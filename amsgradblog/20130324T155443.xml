First, did you know that Pi Day (3/14) is also the birthday of renowned physicist Albert Einstein? Other mathematical holidays and observances include:<span id="more-22658"></span></p>
<p>July 22: If you write your dates with the day before the month, as is standard in Europe, you’ll see that this date becomes 22/7. Since 22/7 is a fraction historically valued for its closeness to pi—at five decimal places it is 3.14285—July 22 is recognized by math enthusiasts as Pi Approximation Day. (If nothing else, it’s a great excuse to bake a pie!)</p>
<p>November 23—Maybe pi isn’t really your thing. You could always celebrate Fibonacci Day. The digits of this date form the first four numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in mathematicians’ birthdays, you can find a calendar of those <a href="http://mathforum.org/~judyann/calendar/" target="_blank">here</a>. Coming up this month are Joseph Fourier (3/21) of the Fourier transform and Fourier series, algebraist and physicist Emmy Noether (3/23), and the famous Paul Erdös (3/26).</p>
<p>Do you have any favorite math holidays to celebrate?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/kirtsaeng-v-john-wiley-sons/">Ever since October</a>, I&#8217;ve lived in fear of government agents repelling through my office window in search of grey-market textbooks. While I can joke, former USC mathematics graduate student Supap Kirtsaeng lived the past few <em>years</em> fearing he owed $600,000 in damages following a copyright dispute. In 2008, publisher John Wiley and Sons successfully sued him for importing and reselling international editions of textbooks from his native Thailand. Tonight, Mr. Kirtsaeng sleeps having those damages erased by the highest court in the land. From <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/thai-student-protected-by-first-sale-supreme-court-rules/">Ars Technica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&#8217;s decision vindicates the &#8220;first sale&#8221; doctrine, which allows the owner of a particular copy of a work to do whatever she wants with it after purchasing it. It overrides first sale losses in both the 9th and 2nd Circuits and makes it clear that digital commerce can flourish in the Internet era, even when it crosses borders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf">full opinion is available from the Supreme Court</a> while SCOTUSblog has an <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/kirtsaeng-v-john-wiley-sons-inc/">overview of the case</a> as well as <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=161209">an analysis of the opinion</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our spring break at Channel Islands begins March 17.  During my break, I will explore the topic of quadratic number rings and Euclidean Domains.  I have already begun assembling and reading literature.</p>
<p>Essentially, a Euclidean ring is a domain <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="R" title="R" class="latex" /> with a map <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi+%3A+R+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi : R &#92;rightarrow &#92;mathbb{N}" title="&#92;psi : R &#92;rightarrow &#92;mathbb{N}" class="latex" />  such that  <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cforall+%5Calpha%2C+%5Cbeta+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;forall &#92;alpha, &#92;beta &#92;in R" title="&#92;forall &#92;alpha, &#92;beta &#92;in R" class="latex" />,  <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexists+q%2C+r+%5Cin+R&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;exists q, r &#92;in R" title="&#92;exists q, r &#92;in R" class="latex" /> such that</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3D+q+%5Cbeta+%2B+r&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;alpha = q &#92;beta + r" title="&#92;alpha = q &#92;beta + r" class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="r = 0" title="r = 0" class="latex" /> or <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28r%29+%3C+%5Cpsi%5Cleft%28%5Cbeta%5Cright%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi(r) &lt; &#92;psi&#92;left(&#92;beta&#92;right)" title="&#92;psi(r) &lt; &#92;psi&#92;left(&#92;beta&#92;right)" class="latex" />.  My Algebraic Number Theory textbook contained the following two references:</p>
<p><span id="more-22205"></span></p>
<p>1. Samuel. &#8220;About Euclidean Rings&#8221;.  <em>Journal of Algebra</em>; 1970</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. Clark. &#8220;A Quadratic Field Which is Euclidean but not Norm Euclidean&#8221;.  <em>Manuscripta Mathematica</em>; 1994.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first reference talks about Euclidean rings where <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi" title="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is not the absolute value of the norm usually defined on the ring.  For example, <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;mathbb{Z}" title="&#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" /> is a Euclidean ring, but a map <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi" title="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> exists such that for <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="n &#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}" title="n &#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}" class="latex" />, <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi%28n%29+%5Cne+%7Cn%7C&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi(n) &#92;ne |n|" title="&#92;psi(n) &#92;ne |n|" class="latex" />.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second reference re-states a remarkable result from 1973: If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true, than algebraic number rings with infinitely many units that are Principal Ideal Domains are Euclidean Domains.  Applying this to real quadratic number rings (these rings have infinitely many units), those that have unique factorization are Principal Ideal Domains and would also be Euclidean rings!  There are only sixteen real quadratic number rings that are Euclidean with the map <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi" title="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> given by the absolute value of the usual norm (the norm of the underlying number field).  But there are other real quadratic number rings with unique factorization.  Thus, there would be examples of these number rings that are Euclidean, where <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi" title="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> is not given by the field norm.  The number ring</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B69%7D%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%5D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;mathbb{Z}&#92;left[&#92;frac{1}{2} + &#92;frac{&#92;sqrt{69}}{2}&#92;right]" title="&#92;mathbb{Z}&#92;left[&#92;frac{1}{2} + &#92;frac{&#92;sqrt{69}}{2}&#92;right]" class="latex" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">was shown in reference 2 to be such an example.  One goal of the above research (not necessarily my goal) is to find a general method of generating the map <img src="//s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpsi&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;psi" title="&#92;psi" class="latex" /> for real quadratic number rings that have unique factorization, thereby showing that they are in fact Euclidean.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I look forward to exploring the above references and others in more detail during spring break, when I have a lull in my normal classwork, and before I begin my thesis research this summer.  Is anybody else planning some independent research or study for spring break?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After I heard someone ask about what a mathematician does, I myself wonder what it means to do mathematics if all what one can answer is that mathematicians do mathematics. Solving problems have been considered by some as the main activity of a mathematician, which might then be the answer to the question. But, could reading and writing about mathematics or crafting a new theory be considered as serious mathematical activities or mere extracurricular activities?</p>
<p><span id="more-22198"></span></p>
<p>It seems mathematicians and mathematics students are expected to always solve problems. Many mathematicians I know or hear about have always been busy with solving problems; some of the named theorems, such as Heine-Borel Theorem or Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem, could have been problems on which Heine, Borel, and Brouwer spent a long time to solve. Also, many papers published in journals are solutions to problems, which makes me think that mathematical research is synonymous to solving problems. I also have the impression that solving problems is seen by some as the “right” way to do mathematics by the emphasis put on such activity. But, if someone writes an expository paper about a mathematical topic, could that also be seen as doing mathematics? Could this enterprise be counted among a mathematician’s achievements? For students being trained in mathematics, should there also be an emphasis on reading and writing about mathematics, which is not necessarily reading and writing proofs? Furthermore, when a mathematician comes up with a theory after years of work, could he be seen as having wasted his time while he could have solved many problems in the time he took him to complete his work?  If one thinks it indeed is a waste of time, would one also see problems arising from this theory as <i>un-mathematical</i> since their source is not mathematical enough? What if this theory has been inspired by a problem, would that qualify it as a genuine mathematical activity?</p>
<p>Because of this apparent ambiguity about what constitutes the “right” mathematical activity, what would students of mathematics need to focus on for their training? Do they need to focus more on solving problems, which necessarily could involve the other activities since understanding a problem might demand some preliminary reading about its origin and motivation and solving it might push one to write about it for a wider audience and inspire one to come up with a new theory in the process of solving the problem?</p>
<p>So, what would it mean to do mathematics? Besides the activities aforementioned, would there be other activities considered as doing mathematics?</p>
<p>Please, share your comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When did you realize that you wanted to study math? Some of my friends knew when they were little kids. One of my professors knew in grade school. I didn’t know until my first year of undergrad. <span id="more-22186"></span>Although I wasn’t bad at it, I didn’t enjoy math in high school—I even chose to do two periods of science in twelfth grade so that I wouldn’t have to take a math class. When I got to college and was told I needed a “quantitative literacy” class to graduate, I signed up for the easiest class in the course catalog (Math Appreciation) even though my advisor wanted me to take Calc I. I just wanted to get it over with and be done with math forever.</p>
<p>It didn’t really work out that way (obviously). We got to see simplified versions of some really cool higher math topics in Math Appreciation, including Cantor’s diagonal argument and formal logic. Over the course of the trimester, I begrudgingly came to admit that, okay, yes, math was cool after all. After that, I signed up for calculus, and then went on to complete a minor in math (I didn’t have time to finish a major in it), to do an independent study in the department, and eventually to apply to master’s programs. Math was something I never expected to like, but it ended up being a really big part of my college career and my life, so I’m really glad I took that class. It might sound cheesy, but it really lived up to its name.</p>

During this time, I discovered that Geogebra has an option to export to Tikz code. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with it, <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/" target="_blank">Tikz</a> is a TeX package for creating graphics. For instance, I can open Geogebra, type sin(x) in the input line and hit enter. It graphs a sin function as expected. Then pressing File &gt;&gt; Export &gt;&gt; Graphics View as PGF/TikZ, I get the code as below.</p>
<p>This is a pretty neat way to easily generate TikZ code. Have you used this feature? Are there other softwares you like to use to generate TikZ code?</p>
<p>\documentclass[10pt]{article}<br />
\usepackage{pgf,tikz}<br />
\usetikzlibrary{arrows}<br />
\pagestyle{empty}<br />
\begin{document}<br />
\definecolor{ffqqqq}{rgb}{1,0,0}<br />
\begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round,line join=round,&gt;=triangle 45,x=1.0cm,y=1.0cm]<br />
\draw[-&gt;,color=black] (-4.3,0) &#8212; (7.3,0);<br />
\foreach \x in {-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}<br />
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,2pt) &#8212; (0pt,-2pt) node[below] {\footnotesize $\x$};<br />
\draw[-&gt;,color=black] (0,-3.12) &#8212; (0,6.3);<br />
\foreach \y in {-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6}<br />
\draw[shift={(0,\y)},color=black] (2pt,0pt) &#8212; (-2pt,0pt) node[left] {\footnotesize $\y$};<br />
\draw[color=black] (0pt,-10pt) node[right] {\footnotesize $0$};<br />
\clip(-4.3,-3.12) rectangle (7.3,6.3);<br />
\draw[color=ffqqqq, smooth,samples=100,domain=-4.3:7.3] plot(\x,{sin(((\x))*180/pi)});<br />
\end{tikzpicture}<br />
\end{document}</p>
