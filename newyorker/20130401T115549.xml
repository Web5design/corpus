      <description>The new Pritzker Prize winner Toyo Ito (who will receive his medal in a May ceremony at Boston&amp;#8217;s John F. Kennedy Presidential Library) is a seventy-one-year-old Japanese architect with a distinguished forty-year record of substantial and influential buildings, some of them much admired. And yet, as much as Ito&amp;#8217;s Pritzker acknowledges his indisputable skill and endurance, the prize also illuminates some of the deep weirdness of architecture as a profession.</description>
