      <title>Rescuing the Eisenhower Memorial</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/dwight-eisenhower-memorial-gehry-design.html</link>
      <description>The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial would take up much of a four-acre plot across the street from the National Air and Space Museum, which itself sits on the increasingly cluttered National Mall, and would be dominated by four eighty-foot metal curtains showing scenes from Eisenhower&amp;#8217;s life. It has managed to achieve something rare in Washington: in true bipartisan spirit, almost everyone hates it.</description>

      <description>Bronfman said that he wrote his version of the Haggadah, the text that guides the Passover meal while telling the story of the Jews&amp;#8217; exodus from Egypt, with children in mind. Illustrated with watercolors by his wife, Jan Aronson, it includes quotations from such goyim as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and there is no Hebrew in it.</description>

      <description>One day that summer Mike Boehm went to his mother&amp;#8217;s attic, where his medals from Vietnam were stored, and threw them in the garbage.

      <description>Bill Brandt, the subject of a brilliant retrospective at MOMA, was the photographer who best defined England in the years just before the Second World War.

      <description>In 2007, John Kiriakou was settling into a lucrative life as a former spy. His fourteen-year career as a C.I.A. officer had included thrilling, if occasionally hazardous, tours as a specialist in counterterrorism. In Athens, in 1999 and 2000, he recruited several foreign agents to spy for the United&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. (Subscription required.)</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a rarer quality than it seems at first&amp;#8212;many television personalities strive for affability but end up looking maniacally suggestible.
