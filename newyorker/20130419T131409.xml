      <description>The days following the bombing at the Boston Marathon have been filled with images. Many have been grisly and terrifying: maimed bodies, blood streaked on the sidewalk, smoke filling the air. The interfaith vigil held on Tuesday night at the Arlington Street Church, which is just a few blocks down Boylston Street from the finish of the race, produced new images.</description>

      <description>The exactness of Shakespeare&amp;#8217;s compressed account is wonderful. Daffodils do come before the swallows arrive, and take their chances with the often-cruel winds of March. Violets, primroses, oxlips, and fritillaries are all flowers of early spring.</description>

I was so moved by it that I was choked up for most of the twenty-six miles, seeing this crazy display of community and generosity.</description>
