      <title>Come Play with &amp;#8220;The Shining&amp;#8221;</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/03/room-237-reviewed.html</link>
      <description>&amp;#8220;The Shining,&amp;#8221; released in May, 1980, has always been seen as Stanley Kubrick&amp;#8217;s pulpiest and most commercial venture. It&amp;#8217;s not just that it&amp;#8217;s a horror film. (All of Kubrick&amp;#8217;s works, really, are horror films.)...</description>

      <title>Toyo Ito&amp;#8217;s Pritzker Win</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/03/pritzker-prize-2013-toyo-ito-architecture.html</link>
      <description>The new Pritzker Prize winner Toyo Ito (who will receive his medal in a May ceremony at Boston&amp;#8217;s John F. Kennedy Presidential Library) is a seventy-one-year-old Japanese architect with a distinguished forty-year record of substantial and influential buildings, some of them much admired. And yet, as much as Ito&amp;#8217;s Pritzker acknowledges his indisputable skill and endurance, the prize also illuminates some of the deep weirdness of architecture as a profession.</description>

      <description>A menacing tone was set as soon as the first lighting cue came up, in silence: eight narrow strips of light crossing the floor from end to end, which created a sharp, forbidding environment, a trap that awaited unsuspecting victims.</description>

      <description>To read &amp;#8220;V.&amp;#8221; today is to experience Pynchon anew. Blast through the multilayered densities of &amp;#8220;Gravity&amp;#8217;s Rainbow,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Mason &amp; Dixon,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Against the Day,&amp;#8221; and you have a young Cornell graduate, an engineer from Long Island, writing with an earnestness you might not have expected, about a world he could never recover.</description>

      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/political-scene-moving-gay-marriage-forward.html</link>
      <description>This week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases dealing with gay marriage: the challenges to California&amp;#8217;s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act. On the Political Scene podcast, Jeffery Toobin and Margaret Talbot talk with Dorothy Wickenden about how the Court might rule in each case and what the decisions could mean for marriage equality.</description>

      <description>Following Wednesday&amp;#8217;s Supreme Court arguments on the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, there has been a lot of discussion of whether gays and lesbians have become so politically powerful as to hardly warrant the safeguards of the equal-protection clause of the Constitution.</description>

      <description>When the telephone rings, I snatch it up, thinking it will be S calling. Is he the being I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for? When he visited last week, he brought The New Yorker and together we sat on the front steps of the Panth&amp;#233;on, from which one can see out over all of Paris, and slowly we translated the magazine pages, laughing at each other&amp;#8217;s errors.</description>

      <description>In February, the Yahoo C.E.O. Marrisa Mayer banned employees from working at home. The decision, which bucked the growing trend of telecommuting in the corporate world, drew a great deal of criticism. James Surowiecki recently weighed in.</description>

      <description>Readers who are looking for a neat story of loss and redemption, a simple narrative arc, catharsis on the cheap, will find no such thing in Sonali Deraniyagala&amp;#8217;s memoir about losing her family in Sri Lanka&amp;#8217;s 2004 tsunami: the particularity of Deraniyagala&amp;#8217;s suffering, and the intensity with which she feels it, is immense. But something does shift in the course of the narrative.</description>

      <description>It seems safe to say that the Justices of the Supreme Court, currently weighing the fate of the Defense of Marriage Act, have not spent their time basking in the soft glow cast by an array of pixels depicting a pink equal sign against a red square backdrop, a symbol that is currently blanketing social-media networks like Facebook and Twitter.</description>

      <description>George Antheil&amp;#8217;s autobiography, published in 1945, is called Bad Boy of Music. It&amp;#8217;s an incredibly entertaining, restless traipse and sometime skirt-chase set between the Wars, and it takes the reader from the factory neighborhoods of Trenton, New Jersey, to the inner circles of European high culture, and back west to the hills of Hollywood.</description>

      <description>Gilles Bourdos&amp;#8217;s new film, &amp;#8220;Renoir,&amp;#8221; is openly a celebration of sensuous ease and calm. It&amp;#8217;s an idyllic, low-intensity movie set in what appears, literally and symbolically, to be the last bastion of the nineteenth century.</description>

      <title>Would the Justices Rather Not Rule on Prop 8?</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/prop-8-gay-marriage-supreme-court-oral-arguments.html</link>
      <description>The most important thing anyone needs to know about Tuesday&amp;#8217;s Supreme Court oral arguments on the constitutionality of Proposition 8, California&amp;#8217;s same-sex marriage ban, is this: veteran Supreme Court watchers and gay-rights advocates alike came away with the impression that Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote, was, in the words of one advocate, looking for a way not to decide.</description>

      <title>Can the Supreme Court Hurry Love?</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/supreme-court-asks-what-marriage-means.html</link>
      <description>There is a clear constitutional issue at the heart of Hollingsworth v. Perry&amp;#8212;namely whether barring same-sex couples from marrying is a violation of equal protection. But Tuesday&amp;#8217;s arguments were a reminder that there is a swirl of bigger questions which come up every time that issue is argued in court.</description>

      <description>Two Sundays ago, the artist and urban planner Neil Freeman stood in front of a vacant lot in Bushwick, Brooklyn, beneath the elevated J train and across the street from an apartment blasting Colombian cumbia music. &amp;#8220;This is the geographic center of New York,&amp;#8221; he said to me and five others shivering in the pre-spring cold.</description>

      <description>For several days in 1978, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and the screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan worked through an idea Lucas had for a film called &amp;#8220;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&amp;#8221; and they recorded the sessions. And there&amp;#8217;s a transcript.</description>

      <description>I had never heard of Tandyn Almer. And so when I saw that the excellent record label Sundazed was releasing an album of Almer&amp;#8217;s demos, I stared at the name for a while. Tandyn Almer. It didn&amp;#8217;t even seem like a real name so much as a Scrabble spill.</description>

      <description>Today is the ninetieth birthday of Bob Elliott, of the classic American comedy duo Bob and Ray. For half a century, starting in 1945, Bob and his partner Ray Goulding, who passed away in 1990, created a unique kind of spoof comedy.</description>

      <title>The &amp;#8220;Master&amp;#8221; Letters of Margaret Fuller and Emily Dickinson</title>

      <description>Fuller&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Master&amp;#8221; letter does not help to resolve the questions that surround Dickinson&amp;#8217;s gnomic metaphors, masochistic tone, and intended recipient. But it speaks eloquently to what Susan Sontag calls &amp;#8220;a common reality&amp;#8221;: the predicament of a woman isolated by her singularity, whose mind was free, but whose heart and body yearned for surrender.</description>

      <description>The Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial would take up much of a four-acre plot across the street from the National Air and Space Museum, which itself sits on the increasingly cluttered National Mall, and would be dominated by four eighty-foot metal curtains showing scenes from Eisenhower&amp;#8217;s life. It has managed to achieve something rare in Washington: in true bipartisan spirit, almost everyone hates it.</description>

      <description>Bronfman said that he wrote his version of the Haggadah, the text that guides the Passover meal while telling the story of the Jews&amp;#8217; exodus from Egypt, with children in mind. Illustrated with watercolors by his wife, Jan Aronson, it includes quotations from such goyim as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and there is no Hebrew in it.</description>

      <description>In 2007, John Kiriakou was settling into a lucrative life as a former spy. His fourteen-year career as a C.I.A. officer had included thrilling, if occasionally hazardous, tours as a specialist in counterterrorism. In Athens, in 1999 and 2000, he recruited several foreign agents to spy for the United&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. (Subscription required.)</description>

Like many of his protagonists, Matilda Wormwood was a precocious youngster surrounded by monstrous adults and grotesque peers.
