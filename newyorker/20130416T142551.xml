      <title>Homemade Marathons</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/04/memories-of-the-new-york-city-marathon.html</link>
      <description>For me, the marathon was a rare, rare moment when the city seemed truly whole; when people came together&amp;#8212;for free&amp;#8212;to watch an event, and they cheered the back-of-the-pack plodders as enthusiastically as they did the whippets who led the way. I was so moved by it that I was choked up for most of the twenty-six miles, seeing this crazy display of community and generosity.</description>

      <description>The end of a marathon is a soft target. The scene is always chaotic. Runners are delirious. And today, in Boston, though we don&amp;#8217;t know what caused it&amp;#8212;an accident, a deliberate act&amp;#8212;there was horror.</description>

      <description>The legend of Mike McAlary&amp;#8212;tabloid chronicler of the crime-ridden, crack-laden New York City of the Koch-Dinkins era&amp;#8212;has been burnished twice over: first by the man himself, who, at various times, dominated the crime pages of Newsday, the Post, and the Daily News, and again by Nora Ephron, whose stage biography Lucky Guy, starring Tom Hanks as McAlary, has just opened on Broadway.</description>

      <description>paragraph class="noindent"&gt;The death of Bobby Charles, in 2010, touched off a resurgence of interest in the work of the Louisiana-born singer-songwriter. The standard obituaries focussed mainly on the swamp pop that Charles pioneered in the late fifties and early sixties; he wrote &amp;#8220;See You Later&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.</description>

      <title>Anthony Lane: Jean-Pierre Melville&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Un Flic,&amp;#8221; at Film Forum.</title>
      <link>http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/notebook/2013/04/22/130422gonb_GOAT_notebook_lane</link>
      <description>By the time Jean-Pierre Melville made &amp;#8220;Un Flic,&amp;#8221; in 1972, his style had condensed and cooled, beyond the elliptical, into near-abstraction. False backdrops abound; modern fa&amp;#231;ades stretch away into the mist; a model helicopter hovers over a model train. Heists were by now familiar&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.

      <description>The emperor considers his options. How he longed for 
the rhythm of campaigning, riding fast in foggy woods, 
riding slow eating chickpeas, accurate killing, little 
strange herbs of the frontier for his collection, little new 
bitter smells. He stood up. Arrest the envoys, he said&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. (Subscription required.)</description>
