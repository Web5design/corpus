				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not having the time, money or other resources required to travel long distances to enjoy a break does not mean that you have to relinquish your family vacation altogether. With a little research and creativity, you will likely find that there are plenty of things to do and see without even leaving your home town. This is important for families with children, as little ones can become bored quite quickly, needing activities and attention to enjoy their time away from school. This is also a great way to spend weekends at any time of year.</p>
<h3>Here are 10 popular things to do and places to visit locally:</h3>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/national-botanical-gardens.htm">Botanical gardens</a> are usually open to the public and are not open for profit. They are quick, easy and cost-effective for the entire family to visit. They showcase natural beauty and are usually set up to accommodate even young children without posing too many dangers. Enquire about lectures and classes being conducted during the school holidays for those that find this type of place particularly interesting.</p>
<p>2. Find out about local organic farms and take the children on a pre-arranged tour of one (or more) of these to educate them about the origin of their fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products. Young ones will love milking a dairy cow or watching sheep get shorn.</p>
<p>3. If you live close to a regular farmers’ market, visit it as a family. Let the children choose some produce for their week’s meals, involving them more in the process and allowing them to see where their food comes from.</p>
<p>4. Plan a treasure hunt in a grocery store to convert a weekly chore into a fun activity. Give them clues as to what to find and where, and ensure that there is a worthwhile treasure at the end of their quest. This will take plenty of forethought and preparation but will prove to be worth it. Clues can include logos or slogans on the item’s packaging, a certain barcode, or a colour combination, for example.</p>
<p>5. Watch a local sports match, even if it is just at a nearby high school. The vibe and excitement is a fabulous way to pass a few free hours.</p>
<p>6. Incite the child in you and plan a family day at the local games arcade. Instead of ambling around waiting for the kids to finish their games, play along with them. They will love the quality time and be able to enjoy themselves without worrying that you are in a rush to get home.</p>
<p>7. Enjoy a family picnic in a local park, sports field, beach or forest. Pack all sorts of delicious delights and remember to take along an activity (such as a bat and ball or a board game).</p>
<p>8. Find out about local art, craft or music festivals and visit these, even if it is not something you would ordinarily do. A change makes for a valuable break.</p>
<p>9. Find an isolated spot in which you can plant some indigenous trees. This may work best at a local animal shelter or children’s home that needs and approves of your initiative. Teach youngsters about the importance of this vegetation and watch their delight as, year after year, they monitor the growth of “their” trees. Permission will definitely be required.</p>
<p>10. Take classes (art, pottery, jewellery making or cooking are all popular choices). If any or all of you need a boost, join the gym or take fitness classes together.</p>
<p>You can find a huge selection of activities <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/things-to-do/">Things to Do in South Africa</a> on SA-Venues.com and to find a kid-friendly place to say, see <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/south-africa-family-friendly.htm">Family-friendly accommodation</a> where children of ALL ages are welcome or see the <strong>all</strong> <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation_south_africa.htm">South Africa Accommodation</a> listing pages for other establishments that accept children from 6, 12 or 16 years upwards.</p>
<p>Happy Travelling!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lighthouses were erected generations ago, when ships began arriving to the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/eastcape.htm">Eastern Cape</a> coastline for a number of different reasons. Some brought supplies, others carried explorers and still others were delivering slaves. These lighthouses remain as beacons of our heritage and history while still serving as guides for incoming vessels.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cape coastline is home to four major lighthouses. There is also a national tour of the South African lighthouses, which comprises eight different buildings.</p>
<p>The four <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/things-to-do/easterncape/category/lighthouses/">Eastern Cape lighthouses</a> are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Great Fish Point lighthouse on the Sunshine Coast – just 25 kilometres from the surfing hotspot of <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/portalfred.php">Port Alfred</a>.</li>
<li>Hoodpoint in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/eastlondon.php">East London</a> – this is situated close to a number of excellent swimming and surfing beaches.</li>
<li>Cape St Francis lighthouse – set in the picturesque little town of <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/capestfrancis.php">Cape St Francis</a>, right on the rocks of a small beach, this oozes charm.</li>
<li>Cape Recife lighthouse in the friendly city of <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/portelizabeth.php">Port Elizabeth</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these lighthouses are open to visitors between 10h00 and 15h00 on weekdays.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Wild Trout Association invites avid fishermen to visit the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa to indulge in some really relaxing fishing expeditions in search of delicious trout. Their official waters are at the southernmost tip of the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/drakensberg.php">Drakensberg</a> Mountain Range, extending from Lesotho. They continue through the Stormberg Mountains (in Dordrecht and Molteno) and westwards.</p>
<p>The Kraai River is the most important in the area when it comes to trout fishing. It begins on the escarpment slopes and connects to the Orange River at Aliwal North. The Kraai then flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Oranjemund.</p>
<p><strong>The following areas are prime trout-fishing regions:</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/rhodes.php">Rhodes</a> – this town is the site of the greatest concentration of running water in the area. The water is easily accessible and very rewarding.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/barklyeast.php">Barkly East</a> – visit Langkloofspruit for superior trout fishing opportunities.</p>
<p>New England – home to the only trout hatchery in the area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/ladygrey.php">Lady Grey</a> – this fishery is supported mainly by a beautiful stream in a deep sandstone gorge.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terra-Khaya is backpacking<a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/hogsback.php"> accommodation in Hogback</a> that prides itself on running and accommodating travellers from all over the world completely “off the grid”.  It is situated on Chillington Farm on the magnificent escarpment of the Amathole Mountains, which drape the horizon around Hogsback.</p>
<p>The aim of this backpackers is to allow visitors to enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and flavours of the Hogsback village and the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/eastcape.htm">Eastern Cape</a> without leaving a negative impact in their wake. In fact, all visitors are encouraged to leave the backpackers in an even better condition. This is done by offering a free meal for every three hours spent taking out the invasive alien Black Wattle trees around the area and a free night’s accommodation when guests bring an indigenous tree to be planted.</p>
<p>The name Terra-Khaya means “Earth Home”. The accommodation and other buildings have been built using eco-friendly and sustainable materials and techniques, so that the environment does not suffer for the human intrusion. Nestled within such beautiful surrounds, guests are assured of a very special backpacking experience, where the bounty of the earth is showcased. The simplicity in this beauty is the core of its success.<span id="more-778"></span></p>
<p>Guests are requested to respect and nurture the facilities and surrounds, so that the fauna, flora and community benefits from Terra-Khaya. This includes considering all of the packaging they bring onto site and the refuse, or garbage, that they produce.</p>
<p>Being completely off the electrical grid means that there are no plug points, geysers, stoves, televisions or computers. Outdoor ablution blocks are effective, though rustic, and water for bathing is heated up on the fires made from Wattle wood. Still, the Terra-Khaya experience is of a high quality with a dash of fun, leaving very little to be desired.</p>
<p>Guests of this backpackers are requested to eat together. Not only does this give them an opportunity to get to know fellow, like-minded travellers, but it also saves on the resources and energy used to prepare and serve meals to large groups of people.</p>
<p>Chillington Farm covers 38 acres, 1 450 metres above sea level, It is a working farm that uses permaculture and land rehabilitation techniques in order to recover from the invasion of Black Wattle that had completely overwhelmed the area. Since 2007, indigenous trees have been reintroduced and fruit and vegetable gardens established. In addition, grasslands have been created for the local animal species to inhabit. The Black Wattle’s wood continues to be used for fires (used for heating water, cooking food, and so on) and building. Farm-fresh milk is bought every day from a local dairy farm for the freshest and most nutritious product.</p>
<p>There are loads of things to do and see in and around Hogsback. These include horse riding, abseiling, hiking, mountain biking, 4 x 4 trails, and searching for edible mushrooms.<br />
For more information, see www.hogsbackecobackpackers.com.</p>
<p>If you are not into &#8216;roughing it&#8217; at a backpacker you can stay in any number of <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/hogsback.php">Hogsback accommodation</a> options, from guest houses to self catering. You might also be interested in seeing <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/eastern_cape_accommodation.htm">Eastern Cape accommodation</a> options if staying outside of Hogsback was part of your plan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/kzn_phinda.htm">Phinda Private Game Reserve</a> is an exclusive retreat at the foot of the majestic Lebombo Mountain Range in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/kwazulu_natal.htm">KwaZulu Natal</a>. This exquisite reserve is home to an abundance of plant and animal species, making it a very rewarding <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/">South African experience</a> for nature-lovers and those visiting the country, wanting to taste and touch its natural appeal.</p>
<p>Some of the wildest residents of the Phinda Private Game Reserve include the Big 5, as well as a number of other mammals and more than 400 bird species. Reptiles and insects abound to create the perfect balance of predators and prey. This reserve boasts seven ecosystems, each of which achieves a delicate balance in which a different combination of plants and animals can co-habit. This creates a truly African experience, with all of the splendour and variety that characterises this magnificent land.</p>
<p>There is also a conference centre at Phinda, catering to large corporate groups that want to incorporate the natural beauty of Kwa-Zulu Natal with their business-related discussions or events. Teambuilding initiatives at Phinda Private Game Reserve are sure to be memorable and effective. Morning and evening game drives showcase animals that are more active during the warmth and light of day as well as nocturnal ones that prefer to hunt under the cover of night.</p>
<p>Durban is 350 kilometres away from Phinda, and is home to the new King Shaka International Airport. This means that the reserve is accessible, even to international tourists.</p>
<p>Other attractions that are located within close proximity to the Phinda Private Game Reserve include:</p>
<p>•    The St Lucia Wetland Park (with the largest estuarine system in all of Africa), now known as the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/kzn_isimangaliso.htm">iSimangaliso Wetland Park</a>.<br />
•    Zulu villages in which traditional arts, crafts, music and culture are showcased to visitors.<br />
•    The <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/kzn_hluhluwe-umfolozi.htm">Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Park</a>, which is home to about 1 600 White Rhino and 370 Black Rhino. This park is just an hour’s drive from Phinda Private Game Reserve.<br />
•    <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/sodwanabay.php">Sodwana Bay</a>, a coastal park about 30 kilometres from Phinda, is popular for its many watersport opportunities.</p>
<p>Kwa-Zulu Natal is humid and warm to hot along the coast, with slightly cooler temperatures as you head further away from the coast and more inland. Summers at Phinda can experience soaring daytime highs in the mid- to late-30’s, but usually average around 30 degrees Celsius. Winters can get very cold inland, with night-time lows plummeting to zero. Therefore, visitors to the reserve should be prepared for weather extremes, depending on what time of year they visit. To find a place to stay for your cvisit to Phinda see <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/kwazulu_natal_accommodation.htm">KwaZulu Natal accommodation</a> for a variety of hotels, guest houses and self catering options.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard of the Big 5, for which <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/" target="_blank">South Africa</a> is famous. These are the leopard, lion, elephant, rhino and buffalo. However, the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/eastcape.htm">Eastern Cape</a> is home to the Big 7, which adds Great White Sharks and the Southern Right Whale to this already-impressive list.</p>
<p>There are a few <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/ec_game_lodges.htm">game reserves in the Eastern Cape</a> that offer this very exciting combination of nature’s finest, guaranteeing a memorable safari and vacation in this South African province. These include:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/ec_addo.htm"><strong><em>Addo Elephant National Park</em></strong></a><br />
Addo is just outside of Port Elizabeth or the Nelson Mandela Metro. It is a national park and ranks third in size in the country. It was recently extended to stretch from Sunday’s River towards Alexandria, and includes the marine areas of St Croix Island and Bird Island. It stretches 1 640 square kilometres. In addition to the Big 7, Addo is also home to the famous Flightless Dung Beetle, as well as the Spotted Hyena, warthogs, a vast array of antelope, and an impressive selection of birdlife.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/visit/kwandwegamereserve/"><strong><em>Kwandwe Private Game Reserve</em></strong></a><br />
Acclaimed for its luxury, Kwandwe offers award-winning accommodation and safaris that cater to the needs of local visitors and international tourists. Kwandwe stretches for 220 square kilometres, and is also the home of the Cape Grysbok, Knysna Woodpecker, Black-Footed Cat and Crowned Eagle. So, once you have spotted all of the Big 7, there remains plenty to see and do during your special time at Kwandwe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/ec_kariega.htm"><strong><em>Kariega Game Reserve and Park</em></strong></a><br />
This private game reserve is situated along the renowned Eastern Cape coastline of South Africa. It includes the beautiful Kariega River and the Bushman’s River and stretches down to the magnificent coastline, along which the whales and dolphins frequently play and surf. Thanks to this location and the variety within the reserve, visitors are assured of plenty to do and see, over and above the impressive Big 7. Kariega is situated close to Kenton-on-Sea, which is a tiny village, as well as Port Alfred and the small community of Bushman’s.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/ec_shamwari.htm"><strong><em>Shamwari Game Reserve</em></strong></a><br />
Shamwari is just 65 kilometres from the hub of the Friendly City, Port Elizabeth. It is 250 square kilometres in area and is all about the luxurious side of safaris. This area was once under huge threat of total destruction due to generations of farming. However, Shamwari has focused on the rehabilitation and conservation of the land and those that have made it their home. The Cat Sanctuaries and Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre are very special and serve to educate the public about the threats facing our precious natural treasures. This is all set within unrivalled natural beauty.</p>
<p>So book yourself into one of these fine <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game_lodges_nationwide_south_afr.htm">South Africa Lodges</a> or find a great <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/hotels_south_africa.htm">South African Hotel</a> and experience wildlife viewing second to none!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visiting a destination makes you appreciate its beauty and value so much more. However, we all have a part to play in ensuring that destinations around the world are maintained and cared for, so that others may also get to experience them in their natural splendour. Being a responsible tourist doesn’t rob you of any of the joy and excitement of visiting a place. Rather, it adds to the experience and leaves you feeling satisfied that you have contributed to its sustainability.</p>
<p><strong><em>Modes of Transport</em></strong><br />
We all know that cars emit harmful gases that destroy our atmosphere, but aeroplanes do much the same. So, for trips that don’t require crossing oceans, consider taking the train. This is a really relaxed, easy way to travel and allows you to stroll around, sleep and play games along the way. Within a destination, try to walk or take bicycles wherever possible. Not only is this environmentally better, but it also gives you the opportunity to experience the landscape in a much more personal, less rushed way. If you have to fly, try to take a direct flight, rather than stopping over. Use public transport, if necessary, rather than renting your own vehicle.</p>
<p><strong><em>Switch it Off</em></strong><br />
When leaving your home and office to head for your holiday, make sure that you unplug and switch off all of your appliances, including your geyser, which uses loads of electricity. At your destination, be sure to switch off your lights and the air-conditioning in the hotel room.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ask About Green Initiatives</em></strong><br />
Before booking at various accommodation facilities and tourist attractions, enquire about their green initiatives and sustainable practices. Try to book only where there are systems like recycling, grey water usage, solar heating, and so on, in place. The more of a habit this becomes to tourists, the more places will begin implementing sustainable measures.<span id="more-745"></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Local Dining</em></strong><br />
Opt for local markets and food sourced from the area rather than buying imported foodstuffs from large supermarkets. Of course, some destinations are not always as hygienic as others, and you’ll need to be careful of the cleanliness of your fruit and vegetables. When packing your own meals, choose a container that you can use again (i.e. not a plastic packet that will be thrown away each day) and avoid using polystyrene packaging.</p>
<p><strong><em>Save Water</em></strong><br />
Water is a scarce commodity the world around, and a culture of respect for it needs to be created. When travelling anywhere, whether locally or internationally, it is imperative that you turn taps off tightly, don’t let water run while you brush your teeth and shave, wash your own clothes in only as much water as you need, and so on.</p>
<p><strong><em>Buy Local</em></strong><br />
When buying souvenirs and memorabilia, support local manufacturers and craftsmen. This will help to create a viable industry for these ones and will save the money spent on imports.</p>
<p><strong><em>Support the Community</em></strong><br />
When you travel, look out for opportunities to give back to the local community in a way that shows them how tourism benefits them. You may volunteer to help build a facility, contribute money or raise awareness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Support World Heritage Sites</em></strong><br />
<a title="UNESCO World Heritage Sites" href="http://www.sa-venues.com/unesco_world_heritage_sites.htm" target="_blank">World Heritage Sites</a> have been awarded such a status according to stringent requirements. This means that they are always rewarding places to see and experience. By supporting these, you promote the heritage of the destination as well as support the efforts of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre, which seeks to uplift communities and the environment and to create a tourism industry that benefits the destination.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are so proud that Tjing Tjing Rooftop Bar in Longmarket Street, <a title="Cape Town Accommodation" href="http://www.cape-venues.co.za/" target="_blank">Cape Town</a>, was voted one of the “Best New Bars in 20 Cities” in the Condé Nast Traveler’s list (published in the July 2012 issue of this international magazine). Tjing Tjing ranked fourth on this inclusive list, which is about searching the world for the best drinking and party hubs to have hit the scene since the previous year.</p>
<p>Tjing Tjing describes themselves as “a unique urban rooftop bar.” The eclectic style, set within and atop a building that is almost 200 years old, gives it a retro look that is really different, and makes for a trendy hotspot for drinks, cocktails, snacks and a good dance. Being situated in the <a title="Cape Town City Bowl" href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/cape-town-city-bowl.htm" target="_blank">City Bowl</a> of the Mother City means that Tjing Tjing is accessible and close to a host of other eateries, guest houses, attractions and activities.</p>
<p>The Condé Nast Traveler’s list included Tjing Tjing for its vibrant ambience, great music and varied menu and wine list. The music that regulars can expect ranges from Indie to electronic, attracting an irresistibly cool crowd. The red, black and white Tokyo-inspired décor provides the perfect ambience in which to enjoy this trendy hub.</p>
<p>The menu is fairly brief, but includes something for everyone. Foody options include cheesy quesadillas, beer-battered angelfish, sticky Asian pork belly sandwiches and a local cheese and charcuterie platter. The wine list is considerably more assorted and ranges from 2009 vintages (at R350 per bottle) to easy-to-drink varieties that cost only R77 per bottle. Lots of cool cocktails are available to refresh you on a balmy summer’s afternoon or warm you up on a chilly winter evening.</p>
<p>Tjing Tjing makes for a fab event venue. Every Wednesday, this award-winning bar is the host of wine tastings. Each tasting showcases wines from suppliers off the wine list; familiarising the tasters with new flavours and traditional favourites and giving these suppliers a platform on which to show their labels off in the best light.</p>
<p>Tjing Tjing is open from Tuesday to Friday from 16h00 to late and on Saturdays from 18h30 to late. If booked in advance, Tjing Tjing takes exclusive bookings for a Monday night.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-647" title="Bierfest launches in SA" src="http://www.southafricablog.co.za/uploads/2011/08/bierfest.jpg" alt="Bierfest launches in SA" width="434" height="289" /></p>
<p>For more than 200 years the annual Oktoberfest in Munich has been a defining part of Bavarian culture and has grown to become the world’s largest festival, attracting more than five million people from around the globe to Germany each year. Attending the Oktoberfest is on the ‘bucket list’ for many, but this year South Africans will not have to travel abroad for the experience, as Oktober Bierfest is coming to <a title="Cape Town accommodation" href="http://www.cape-venues.co.za/" target="_blank">Cape Town</a> and <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsga/johannesburg-metro.htm" target="_blank">Johannesburg</a>.</p>
<p>“Oktober Bierfest is a recreation of traditional Bavarian beer festivals,” says Andrew Douglas, Director of The Entertainment Group (TEG), producers of the event. “Halls will be draped in traditional style and guests can enjoy an array of Bavarian cuisine supplied by the finest local purveyors of German food, be served by Fraulein while listening to an entertainment lineup, including live Oompah bands.”</p>
<p>In order to bring the taste of Germany to Oktober Bierfest, founding partner The South African Breweries Ltd (SAB), will be brewing beers exclusively for the event. “We are committed to supporting the growth of the beer category as a whole and are looking forward to brewing three special limited edition Bavarian-styled beers. For the first time ever, South Africans can enjoy Royal Bavaria Oktoberfest Bier, King Ludwig’s Munich Dunkel and Protea Edelweiss Krystal Weiss,” says Diarmaid De Burca, General Manager of Newlands Brewery, the SAB’s flagship brewery.</p>
<p>With the added involvement of the South-African – German Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the event, the Oktober Bierfest promises to be an authentic Bavarian festival.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have been chosen as the host venue for an event steeped with such rich history and tradition,” says Steve Howell, General Manager of Montecasino. “South Africa itself is a melting pot of cultures and traditions brought together by a common love of beer, and Montecasino’s Outdoor Events Area is the perfect venue to accommodate these beer-lovers of every demographic in large numbers. The inclusion of an authentic Bavarian Oktober Bierfest is a welcome addition to the annual Jozi social calendar.”</p>
<p>Oktober Bierfest will tour to Cape Town from 29 September to 1 October 2011 on the Village Green, Newlands Brewery and to Johannesburg from 27 to 29 October 2011 at Montecasino’s Outdoor Event Area. The event is open to both corporate functions and the public alike. For ticket sales or more information email bookings@oktoberbierfest.co.za or visit www.oktoberbierfest.co.za.</p>

<p>The Endler Concert Series will continue its full 2011 programme with concerts on both 13 and 14 August. The first concert on 13 August takes place at 20:00 and features the South African born duo of Dawid Venter (flute) and Ben Schoeman (piano).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2008 La Motte Méthode Cape Classique has just been acknowledged as one of the National Winners for cultivar wines by the 2011 Novare SA Terroir Wine Awards.</p>
<p>“<em>With the 2008 MCC Brut being only the second vintage of sparkling wine to have been released from La Motte, we are delighted by this performance</em>”, says Hein Koegelenberg, CEO of La Motte. “<em>Not only do we mature the wine on the lease for 29 months, but we also released just 3300 bottles, so we hold this sparkling wine very dear</em>.”<span id="more-631"></span></p>
<p>Wines certified as a single vineyard wine, an estate produced wine or from a specific ward can participate, hence the term SA Terroir Wine Awards. Made from 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay grapes all grown on the foothills of the mountain on La Motte, this wine once again confirms the Franschhoek valley’s expertise with these two traditional cultivars.</p>
<p>Passionate about terroir, La Motte is proud to be associated with the SA Terroir Awards and also wish to congratulate the other winning wineries.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The his­toric <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/capewinelands-attractions.htm" target="_blank">Cape Winelands</a> town of Tulbagh is host­ing a<strong> Spring Arts Festival </strong>over the week­end of <strong>26–28 August 2011</strong>, cel­eb­rat­ing the arts in all their var­ied forms. The fest­ival also coin­cides with the spring wild­flowers, which include sev­eral vari­et­ies of rare endemic bulbs that only flower in the Tulbagh val­ley. It is aimed at rais­ing funds for the Tulbagh Community Gardens and Galgeheuwel Reserve ini­ti­at­ive, which will cre­ate a pub­lic pleas­ure garden for the enjoy­ment of all in his­toric Church Street.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tulbagh Spring Arts Festival </strong>is head­lining with the open­ing of the Christo Coetzee House Museum and Gallery (post renov­a­tion of the dilap­id­ated barn, where Coetzee painted from 1973 until his death in 2000, and the Rhenish mis­sion­ary house where he lived behind the stu­dio.) For the dur­a­tion of the fest­ival the work of past, present and future mas­ters of the val­ley will be on display.</p>
<p>Christo Coetzee is obvi­ously our past mas­ter. The South African Encyclopedia says about Coetzee’s work: <em>“He has broadened art in the sense that he con­trib­uted to the fad­ing of the tra­di­tional bound­ar­ies between paint­ing and sculp­ture and because he insisted on viewer par­ti­cip­a­tion in the cre­at­ive pro­cess. <span id="more-625"></span>As Marcel Duchamp is today known as the twentieth-century father of con­cep­tu­al­ism, so Coetzee is the most import­ant innov­at­ive artist in South Africa.” </em>The exhib­i­tion of Coetzee’s work will also fea­ture a col­lec­tion of pho­to­graphs by award-winning Cape pho­to­grapher Jean du Plessis, entitled: “<em>Christo Coetzee – The Tulbagh Years</em>”.</p>
<p>Vasek Matousek is our present mas­ter. Resident in Tulbagh since 1975, Vasek exhib­its from his extraordin­ary stu­dio in the Winterhoek and will be demon­strat­ing glaz­ing tech­niques and Raku kiln firings.</p>
<p>Tulbagh-born Jannie Du Toit is our future mas­ter – young and tal­en­ted. His early work reflects his Tulbagh roots, although he now lives and works in the city bowl of Cape Town.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cape-venues.co.za/">Cape Town</a> is gearing up to be inspired by all genres of design and an abundance of creativity in the days to come. The Design Indaba Conference and Expo is recognised the world over as a top design and trend event. Drawing the likes of speakers such as Alberto Alessi, Mark Shuttleworth, and Michael Wolff, Design Indaba 2011 is set to add stimulating conversation and a fresh take on creativity and design. The conference runs from 23 – 25 February, with the Expo open to the public between 25 – 27 February at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.</p>
<p>The 2010 Design Indaba Conference and Expo events attracted approximately 37 300 international delegates, media, buyers and members of the public and reinforced Cape Town’s positioning as a design-focused, creatively inspired destination. As part of the annual Design Indaba series of events, the Design Indaba Filmfest 2011 runs from 18-27 February at the Freeworld Design Centre Auditorium.<span id="more-614"></span></p>
<p>The new Freeworld Design Centre is in itself a testament to Cape Town’s creative and design status. Located in the old Cape Waters Building (along the Fan Walk) the building has been given a complete design overhaul and now serves as both a resource centre for the design trade and a place of inspiration for the public. It features a number of room-sized, themed décor exhibitions – designed by top South African creatives – that will change seasonally.</p>
<p>A key event at the Design Indaba Film Festival is a live cyber-workshop with design-for-change guru, Bruce Mau. The MASSIVE CHANGE NETWORK will unfold real plans for design’s role in future change. Other documentaries include stories about design duo, the Vignelli’s, and a study of Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino and Buckminster Fuller.</p>
<p>In addition, the Cape Town Design Route 2011 map will be launched at Design Indaba this year. This year sees the third edition of this popular design map – a creative partnership project between Cape Town Tourism and Design Indaba. The Cape Town Design Route comprises of Western Cape-based Design Indaba exhibitors, from fashion and shoes to dinnerware and toys, who have been approved by a curatorial panel of industry experts ensuring the best in creativity and quality along the route. Some examples of featured artists include: Inkheart Jewellery Design, a Cape Town based studio offering a selection of beautifully handmade pieces of jewellery inspired by childhood stories and memories; Township Patterns, a social enterprise which aims to create a sustainable vehicle for economic empowerment with handmade colourful fabrics inspired by South Africa’s informal settlements and Recreate, original furniture and lighting crafted from repurposed junk items.</p>
<p>Says Mariëtte du-Toit Helmbold, CEO of Cape Town Tourism; “Design is a pillar of our city’s unique identity, not only because we have inspiring and trend-setting creative industries but also because we are committed to using design as a guiding principle in the creation of a city that is future-fit. Often, the word design is associated with glamour, luxury and exclusivity. In fact, socially responsive design is the key to a more sustainable future. Our bid to become World Design Capital 2014 is just one of the ways that Cape Town is staking its claim on the global design landscape and evolving into a top world city to live, work, visit, study and invest in.”</p>
<p>World Design Capital (WDC) is a title awarded every two years to a city that is dedicated to using design for social, cultural and economic development. The award is presented by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID) based in Canada and focuses on developing a year-long programme of design-driven events. The 2010 recipient of the award was Seoul, with Helsinki to be WDC in 2012.</p>
<p>The City of Cape Town’s bid to be World Design Capital 2014 is being coordinated by Cape Town Partnership, and the City will hear whether its bid has been successful before the end of the year. To drive support for the bid, Cape Town Tourism will be sponsoring a “Cape Town for World Design Capital 2014” stand at the Design Indaba Expo.</p>
<p>Bulelwa Makalima-Ngewana, Managing Director of the Cape Town Partnership, believes that the bid will not only be important for Cape Town in 2014, but also in the lead up and well beyond. “The bid book is proving to be a valuable resource and we are looking for a way to turn it into a public working document for the creative industries post the bid. Also, irrespective of whether or not Cape Town is World Design Capital in 2014, the process of bidding and in particular the educational process that is going on towards exposing design in all its relevance to the public, will go a long way in driving Cape Town towards achieving its goal of becoming a Knowledge Economy.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cape Town Festival’s (CTF) multi-dimensional street festival Night Vision is back by popular demand on Saturday, 12 March from 6pm till midnight.</p>
<p>It will take place at the newly revamped Cape Town Station Forecourt, extending festivities into Adderley Street between Strand Street and the fountain. The CTF, incorporating the One City, Many Cultures (1CMC) Project, is supported by the National Lottery Distribution Trust Fund (NLDTF).</p>
<p>After a three-year break, Cape Town’s nocturnal urban street festival, Night Vision, is back with a bang, only this time bigger and better than ever before! Night Vision promises to dominate the city night life with a party-thumping arts and entertainment extravaganza. The event will lead up to a climax of explosive live on-stage performances by iconic bands such as High Voltage Collective featuring EJ Von LYRIK, Theba Shumba and D.form; 340ml; The Dirty Skirts and headline act, 2010 SAMA Award Winners, Big NUZ who will take the party well into midnight.<span id="more-613"></span></p>
<p>The evening programme launches at 6pm amid a vibrant carnival atmosphere complete with street parade, roving buskers, stilt-walkers, mimes, jugglers and loads of other amusement activities. This, juxtaposed with a bustling street market laden with exquisite arts, crafts, vintage collectables and organic market, will leave the whole family spoilt for choice. Food vendors catering to a variety of culinary preferences will provide quality catering service at the food court. Bar facilities will be dotted around the venue.</p>
<p>Powering up the Night Vision stage is High Voltage Collective. This dynamic <a href="http://www.cape-venues.co.za/">Cape Town</a> ensemble comprising EJ Von LYRIK, Teba Shumba and D.form blend their individual musical styles to put on a show of electrifying proportions.</p>
<p>A prolific and dynamic songwriter, music producer and performer, the vivacious EJ von Lyrik hails from <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/mitchells-plain.php">Mitchells Plain</a> on the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/cape-flats.htm">Cape Flats</a> and is known for her inspiring and uplifting lyrics fragranced with positive messages. She has been writing and performing her own material since 1997, with a distinct interest in music production. Her music is an eclectic mix of funk, rock, dancehall, hip hop and roots reggae. EJ feels “the reason for this cross-over of musical genres is to reach out to a more diverse audience because the music is message-orientated”. She has performed on various international stages as well as collaborated with some hefty names in the music industry. A former member of the legendary female hip hop group Godessa, EJ has traversed the globe with performances in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Norway, Cuba, USA, UK, Ethiopia and Tanzania. Her confident energy, thought provoking lyrics and stirring melodies backed by a solid group of musicians, will be sure to captivate the Night Vision audience.</p>
<p>Teba Shumba is a ragga muffin artist born and raised in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/gugulethu.php">Gugulethu</a>, Cape Town, and whose love for the arts started in community theatre. His music career started with the Kwaito band Skeem who were the proud recipients of the FNB Sama Award for ‘Best Township Pop’ for their debut hit song Waar Was Jy? in 1997. Since the release of his debut soul-afro-reggae-dancehall album 20-5-2-1 Manifesto in 2004, Teba performed at the 2005 Wurzburg Afrika Festival in Germany, sharing the stage with Julian Marley. He also performed at the 2006 Rototom in Italy alongside acclaimed artists like Andrew Tosh, Third World, Alpha Blond and Burning Spear. His dedication and perseverance has allowed him to travel to countries like France, Australia, New Zealand, South Pacific Islands, Solomon Islands, Finland, and closer to home &#8211; Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho. Championing the cause of the voiceless, Teba’s music deals with social justice, universal love and songs of inspiration. His performance is nothing short of exhilarating and massive.</p>
<p>The third party to High Voltage Collective is none other than D.form, a product of a family of eccentric entertainers raised on a strict diet of jazz, soul, funk, reggae, disco and goema. It is therefore no surprise that his passion for the arts was unleashed at the young age of 10 when he joined his first b.boy/break-dance crew and at age 15 was part of his first rap group. He entered many talent shows as a rapper and dancer and went on to join the African Hip Hop Movement in 1988. He formed one of the first graffiti crews in Cape Town known as the Bomb-Crazy Crew and found himself involved with many conscious organisations in the hip hop community involved with acting and speaking out against the crimes and injustice of the Apartheid regime. By starting one of Cape Town’s first monthly hip hop nights known as ‘geto3000’, D.form has been instrumental in bringing together rappers, deejays, b.boys and graffiti artists – the basic four elements of hip hop culture under one roof.</p>
<p>The programme then makes way for the hip hop, African and fusion outfit 340ml, a name taken from the ubiquitous measurement on beverage cans. The Mozambican dub-jazz foursome comprising of Pedro da Silva Pinto on vocals, Paulo Chibanga on drums, Rui Soeiro on bass and Tiago Paulo on guitar, displays an organic musical influence that is unquestionably Latin music subtly laced with traditional Mozambican folk music (Marrabenta), synonymous with the sounds of marimba and the acoustic guitar. Their unique musical style incorporates Dub, Jazz, Ska, Afro-jazz and Reggae. Their debut album Moving was released in 2004 to rave reviews and what follows was nothing short of mass airplay on national radio and television across South Africa. Four years later they released their second album Sorry for the Delay. Apart from South Africa and Mozambique, 340ml has performed in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Reunion Island, England and France. Their music has been described by leading South African journalists as “an elaborate musical cocktail”, and certainly one that will go down especially well at this sizzling-hot show.</p>
<p>The fiendishly independent alt-indie-rock band The Dirty Skirts is based in Cape Town and is made up of Jess de Tolly on lead vocals and guitar, David Moffatt on guitar, Passion Paliaga on bass and Markie de Menezes on drums. Their sound has segued from rock electro to alt pop, and is steeped in an alternative rock tradition stretching back some forty odd years &#8211; think David Bowie, John Lennon, Talking Heads and The Cure. The band has toured the USA, UK, and the United Emirates. In South Africa they have shared festival stages with Oasis, Snow Patrol, Panic at the Disco, and Evanescence. They have independently recorded and released their eponymous debut mini-album in 2005. Singles such as Feeling the Pressure and Set Me Alight scorched up the local and student charts. The album Daddy Don’t Disco was released in June 2008 and enjoyed four radio play-listed singles. Daddy Don&#8217;t Disco was nominated in the ‘Best Rock Album’ category at the SAMA’s. Winners of the inaugural Red Bull Soundclash, this quirky group will be sure to live up to their reputation of captivating live audiences.</p>
<p>Night Vision will draw to a monumental close with the headline act, 2010 SAMA Award-winning kwaito group, Big NUZ featuring Jojo aka Mampintsha, Mzi aka Danger and Sbu aka R Mashesha. Big because they are doing big things in the music world and NUZ being the vehicle registration prefix for the township of Umlazi next to Durban, from where the trio hails. The group was formed in 2002 when they moved from Durban to Jo’burg to hustle for a record deal. But years of perseverance ultimately paid off. In 2006 they released their debut album Zozo under Gallo Records working with the late Kid Mokoena from Why Not Entertainment. The rest is history. The trio, riding on the strength of its smash hit album, Umlilo, swept three awards – ‘Best Album of the Year’, ‘Best Kwaito Album’ and the prestigious ‘MTN Record of the Year’ &#8211; an accolade for which they were congratulated by President Jacob Zuma. The group also shared the stage with international acts including Rick Ross, T Pain and 2Face at the 2010 MTV African Music Awards and came home with ‘Best Performance Award’. They were also nominated in the category ‘Best Anglophone’. They have performed at a host of prestigious events including Mandela Day and the opening ceremony of the 2010 Soccer World Cup televised to millions of people the world over.</p>
<p>Night Vision is Cape Town’s premier free-to-the-public street festival, originally held on Long Street in the CBD and known for attracting over 30 000 reveling party-goers consisting of both locals and tourists. “With the jam-packed line-up on this year’s entertainment bill, we expect to host our largest audience yet,” said Cape Town Festival Founder and Executive Chairperson, Ryland Fisher, “we are happy to have secured the Cape Town Station Forecourt as the new home of the annual Night Vision in a bid to maximise the infrastructure legacies left behind by the 2010 Soccer World Cup,” he added.</p>
<p>Parking, public transport, road closures, etc. are among those logistical considerations that will be confirmed within the next week.</p>
<p>Night Vision forms part of the CTF’s year-long programme of events which also includes a 1CMC Discussion; Community Youth Workshop Programmes; Senior Citizens Day; Leadership Forum; Multimedia Exhibition; and Community Festivals. These interventions are strategically designed to engage publics at social, educational, business and creative level in the broader Cape Town society to showcase “a united city celebrated for its diversity and liveability.”</p>
<p>The 12th annual CTF kicks off on Friday, 18 March and culminates in the Human Rights Day celebrations on Monday, 21 March at the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/company-gardens.htm">Company’s Garden</a> in the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionswc/cape-town-city-bowl.htm">CBD</a> between 12pm and 8pm daily.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pietermaritzburg band, the Hairy Legged Lentil Eaters, has been confirmed as the featured act for this year’s <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/events/kwazulunatal/splashy-fen-music-festival/">Splashy Fen Music Festival</a>, taking place near <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/underberg.php">Underberg</a> in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/kwazulu_natal.htm">KwaZulu-Natal</a> from April 21-25.  The festival coincides with the 20th year of the band’s existence, and is an opportunity to celebrate a shared history that dates back to Splashy Fen’s early beginnings in 1990.</p>
<p>Described as the most eclectic folk band this side of the Limpopo, the Hairy Legged Lentil Eaters have made an indelible mark on Splashy Fen over the years, never failing to win over audiences with performances that have ranged from the satirical to the bizarre.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the band, vocalist and guitarist Brian Bedingfield said that it was exciting to be offered the featured act billing and to be paid tribute to in this way by a festival that is “in their blood”.</p>
<p>“Either individually or collectively, the Hairies have been at every single Splashy Fen – if not on the bill, then busking and generally spreading good humour.  During the early years, our association with the then <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/pietermaritzburg.php">Pietermaritzburg</a> Folk Club also saw us getting involved in other ways, either as sound engineers, stage managers, crew or MCs.”</p>
<p>Currently, the band plays an active role in the running of the Maritzburg Musicians’ Club, which meets every other Tuesday at The Red Door in Pietermaritzburg.</p>
<p>Catch the Hairy Legged Lentil Eaters on both stages and busking on the rocks at the 22nd Splashy Fen Music Festival this Easter!  Supported by East Coast Radio, the four-day festival will also see performances by the likes of Karen Zoid, Ard Matthews, Dan Patlansky, Madala Kunene, The Rudimentals, Valiant Swart, Good Luck, Wrestlerish, Versus The Wolf, Isochronous, The La Els, City Bowl Mizers, Boulevard Blues, Holiday Murray, Margaret’s Daughter and The Aquarian Quartet, featuring guitar maestros Steve Newman, Syd Kitchen, Greg Georgiades and Tony Cox.  </p>
<p>Tickets cost R500 at Computicket and selected Game stores.  The price includes camping for the entire festival.  For more information, visit www.splashyfen.co.za or contact 031 563 0824.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Known for its creatively-inspired accommodation offering, <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/visit/thegranddaddyhotel/">The Grand Daddy Hotel</a> in <a href="http://www.cape-venues.co.za/">Cape Town</a> recently redecorated its restaurant with the help of interior decorator, Tania Reddering. The result is a casual, easy-going eatery for hotel guests and Capetonians to enjoy.</p>
<p>King proteas, light wood and white surfaces, scatter cushions and cool turquoise touches give the open-plan space a re-energized feel that nods to the building’s colonial heritage. The clean, light-filled look is a match for the daytime-focus of the restaurant. The menu has also been revised to include easy-going classics and a lovingly crafted burger that is likely to draw rave reviews.  </p>
<p>Now serving a hot breakfast from 6h30 till 12h00 (and a continental buffet until 10h00), The Restaurant has an accessible lunch time menu of crowd-pleasers and an early evening dinner seating on Friday nights. A selection of imported teas from Teabox (teabox.co.za) add intrigue to the teatime experience with the strong aromas of strawberries and rooibos, white peach &#8211;  and spicy chai pervading the air as guests enjoy a tea ceremony with a personalised teapot that filters the tea directly into the cup. </p>
<p>Kids (ten years and under) will also be able to enjoy a menu especially created for them. Patrons will also be able to connect to the internet on their personal laptop with a free 20 MB voucher compliments of Skyrove. As Skyrove only requires the user to insert their cellphone number, no codes or permissions are required from a waiter.</p>
<p>The Restaurant is fully licensed and opens at 06h30 from Mondays to Sundays. It closes at 17h00 from Mondays to Thursdays, 21h30 on Fridays, Saturdays at 19h00 and at 14h00 on Sundays. As with the hotel’s other spaces (The Venue, Daddy Cool, The Airstream Trailer Rooftop), The Restaurant can be hired or incorporated into a total event package. </p>
<p>The Grand Daddy is proudly associated with Jaci’s Lodges in the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/game-reserves/nwp_madikwe.htm">Madikwe Game Reserve</a> and Cheetah Plains Lodge in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/sabisands.php">Sabi Sands</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Brightwater Commons, in conjunction with the Chinese Embassy in <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/">South Africa</a> will be hosting a celebration of the Chinese New Year on Saturday 12th February 2011.  To start at 11am, this  event will feature a variety of vibrant cultural performances as well as colourful exhibitions that will allow visitors to experience the beauty and diversity of the Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Whilst the exhibitions and stalls will open at 11am, the entertainment programme will begin at 1pm with an official opening ceremony.  This will be followed by the ever popular and spectacular Lion and Dragon dances.  Other performances that will dazzle and delight visitors will include an acrobatics, contortion and fire act; traditional Umbrella and Fan dancing, as well as demonstrations of martial arts.  </p>
<p>The event&#8217;s highlight will be a set of acts by the talented Yunnan Arts Troupe originating from Yunnan, which is regarded as China&#8217;s most culturally diverse province.  The professional 14 member troupe will reflect the colour and culture of the province through the dances of the region&#8217;s different ethnic minorities.  They will also present a delightful magic show and Tibetan songs.</p>
<p>Visitors can also see a variety of cultural exhibitions, from arts and crafts all the way to clothing; and enjoy lunch on the commons as there will be numerous food stalls specializing in different kinds of delicious Chinese cuisine ranging from stir-fried dishes  to sweet treats.   The celebrations will close at 5pm.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese Zodiac calendar, 2011 is the Year of the Rabbit.  To the Chinese people, speed, strength and kindness of heart are traits associated with the rabbit.  They therefore believe that those born in the Year of the Rabbit are clever, romantic, modest and merciful.  The rabbit is the 4th animal on the calendar, which dates back to more than  2000 years ago.  There are 12 animals on the calendar which works in 12 year cycles.  The Chinese believe that these animals appeared before Buddha or the Jade Emperor.  The animals are listed on the calendar in their order of arrival, starting with the rat and followed by the ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From 19 – 21 March 2011 Wellington dons its festive costume when this quaint Boland town which was named 2010 SA Terroir Top Wine Area celebrates the bounty of the harvest at the 5th Wine Harvest Festival.  Spend the day or make sure you don’t miss any of the action and book in for the weekend for an extraordinary array of fun-filled activities for the whole family.  </p>
<p>Big names like Steve Hofmeyr, Adam Tas and the newly crowned Idols winner Elvis Blue will get your hands clapping, while opera lovers can experience a cultural evening around a piece of Wellington history, the Black Countess.   Live music will follow you wherever you go throughout the day. </p>
<p>Treat your taste buds with the region’s premium wines, out of the box food parings such as vodka and sushi, and brandy and chocolate, or oysters and bubbly on a topless bus.  Buy slow food from the country market; or show your prowess with the potjie in the international potjiekos competition. </p>
<p>The adrenalin junkies will be spoilt for choice with the quad bike trail, the Bain’s trail run or even just a messy round of grape stomping.  Take it a bit slower while still breathing the fresh autumn air – join the Wine-on-foot@Blouvlei 5km long vineyard walk in the Bovlei area.  Make sure to bring the kids for the tractor and pony rides, and an endless supply of ice-cream. </p>
<p>Only R60 (kids under 13 enter free) promises a full weekend of fun and laughter and lip-smacking taste experiences for the whole family. Festival armbands, your entry ticket, are available from all participating farms and the Wellington Information Office. Special Monday armbands are available at R30 per person. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taste, eat, drink and play to your heart’s desire at the <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/events/westerncape/sa-cheese-festival/">SA Cheese Festival</a>, taking place from Saturday 24 until Tuesday 27 April at Bien Donné on the R45 between <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/paarl.php">Paarl</a> and <a href="http://www.sa-venues.com/accommodation/franschhoek.php">Franschhoek</a>. This fabulous foodie event sets the scene for an intimate yet festive get-together between cheesemakers, food artisans and those who simply adore the good life.  Bring the whole family for a fun-filled day in the countryside surrounded by the most sumptuous eats and treats.</p>
<p><strong>Cheese to choose</strong><br />
The Checkers Cheese Emporium houses the country’s largest selection of cheese under one air cooled 2 400 m2 roof. Strong and bold or familiar and mild – your choice of cheese will be there.  The Checkers Food Theatre will come alive with Nataniël’s razor-sharp wit, while the Giggling Gourmet Jenny Morris and YOU magazine’s food editor Carmen Niehaus will captivate you with their imaginative cheese recipes. Free tickets to the Nataniël sessions can be obtained daily on a first-come-first-served basis from outside the Cheese Emporium.  </p>
<p>Choose your cheese and top up your bag or basket with some sweet seducers such as handmade chocolate, Turkish delight, nougat, and sweet or sparkling wines, and you’re set for a taste celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Pot action</strong><br />
Several of your favourite entertainment, food and other icons will be stirring up a storm in the Cooking Pot.    Enjoy the antics of the uproariously funny Soli Philander, or let Sarie and Sarie Kos’s food fundis Herman Lensing and Barbara Joubert, who was recently lauded as the Galliova Food Writer of the Year, share with you the what’s hot of creating with cheese. The Pinotage icon, Beyers Truter, and Johan Badenhorst, presenter of the travel TV programme Voetspore, team up for an adventurous outdoor food and Pinotage demonstration.  A combination of quirks and canapés brings RSG presenter Johan Rademan, TV presenter and comedian Nico Nel and outstanding chef Alet Erasmus together.  Aperitivo dishes, paired with Peroni will be the speciality of chef Craig Hounsman.  Whether you’re a gourmet guru or a closet cook you are sure to enjoy the energy of the Cooking Pot which is by now a legendary hotspot for cheese innovation. </p>
<p><strong>Cool options for busy kids</strong><br />
Kids 12 years and younger enter for free and then the fun and games begin!  Expert entertainers will encourage kids of all ages to safely shed some of their energy in the Wilde Fruit Juices Kiddies Corner run by the professional party people, Crazy Chameleon.  Life-size cartoon characters of the Boomerang Channel will be sharing hugs and a magician and balloon artists will intrigue the young ones with their tricks.  Also bring your kids for an experience of the udderly amazing journey of milk from the cow, goat or sheep to the table while they enjoy being near these peaceful big eyed, four-legged friends in the Renault &#038; Kia Milk Factory.</p>
<p><strong>Shop till you drop</strong><br />
Cheese on its own is a treat but with the right partners it provides for a feast. The new SA Olive Experience in The Mall will allow olive enthusiasts to enjoy this ancient fruit in surprisingly innovative ways – taste the purest olive oils and gleaming black and green table olives, tapenades and even olive jams. Some ten olive producers from as far as Beaufort West, Montagu and Porterville bring you their delicacies, by one producer described as the wonderful gifts of good earth and captured sunshine.  </p>
<p>Wine is of course the other constant companion of cheese – taste your way through the many cultivars and then stock your home cellar with your favourites.  Make sure you buy enough delectable goodies including nuts, homemade preserves, bread and pesto’s to cater for the rest of your autumn picnics or for chilly winter evenings.</p>
<p><strong>Meet at the Market </strong><br />
Artisan cheese makers who craft superb cheeses using age old methods and lots of patience share this space with special deli products which bring new dimensions to tasting pleasure. Savour the flavours that abound in this laidback country market, do not miss the products in the snail trail and then make your choice: what will you take home? Or unpack your purchases there and then and enjoy them on the shady market square. </p>
<p><strong>Do lunch in the Gourmet Lane</strong><br />
The marvellous variety of tastes and aroma’s emanating from the Gourmet Lane will entice you to settle down and enjoy a bite with the music from the band BRAWOU! accompanying your appetite on this exciting journey.    Don’t forget to browse in the herb nursery and buy some to take home for your cheese cooking and pairing adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Festival goes green</strong><br />
The organisers of the Cheese Festival are also committed to the ‘greening’ of the event. To this purpose the contracted stand builders are strongly associated with the green movement in their industry and annually recycle their products.  Furthermore a group from previously disadvantaged community in Franschhoek was invited to sort and recycle all waste from the festival and then benefit from the profits derived from the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Buy your tickets now</strong><br />
A limited number of tickets are available from Computicket or Checkers stores (no tickets at the gate) at R110 for Saturday and Sunday, and R90 for Monday and Tuesday. Senior citizens pay R70 and children 12 years and younger enter for free.  The festival runs each day from 10:00 to 18:00 and closes the last day at 17:00.  For more information contact Agri-Expo on tel 021 975 4440 or cheese@agriexpo.co.za or visit www.cheesefestival.co.za.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven-time Dusi Marathon winner and Spur Adventure ambassador Martin Dreyer is participating in the Spur Adventure Charity Challenge over the months of April and May. Dreyer is encouraging everyone to join him as all proceeds from the challenge go to Joint Aid Management (JAM), a non-profit humanitarian relief and development organisation that currently assists more than 498,000 children through nutritional feeding, health and social welfare programmes. </p>
<p>“Most of us would agree that there’s nothing better than a weekend of adventure spent outdoors navigating your way through nature on foot or bicycle,” says Dreyer. “Now you can enjoy your outdoor pursuits and do something good for JAM while you’re getting wet and having fun in the process.”</p>
<p>In addition to supporting JAM through this initiative, athletes from Dreyer’s grassroots’ initiative ‘Change a Life’ will also participate in the Spur Adventure Charity Challenge. </p>
<p>According to Dreyer, the Adventure Challenge consists of a 20km mountain bike trail ride (two 10km loops) and 5km trail (two 2.5km loops) dash through nature with natural obstacles and water crossings. Teams can participate in the long or short courses and for the less energetically inclined there’s a scenic 6-7km circular route nature hike.</p>
<p>Dreyer, who recently became a first-time father, says there is also a bush baby trail that has been developed specifically for kids between the ages of 6-10years. “It kicks off with a ‘sak resies’ (bag race) and then children are guided along a marked trail on foot, negotiating a number of obstacles and surprises that include live demonstrations and discussions on birds, snakes and other flora and fauna.”</p>
<p>Spur Group Managing Director Pierre van Tonder says the Spur Adventure Charity Challenge is an outdoor experience for the whole family. “Spur Adventure is a celebration of all things South African’ an event that makes the most of our great weather, our scenic surrounds and the simple pleasure of spending time with family and friends.” </p>
<p>The Spur Adventure Challenges takes place on the following dates:<br />
Cape Town (Lourensford) – 18 April 2010;<br />
Pretoria (Groenkloof) – 24 April 2010;<br />
Durban (Shongweni Dam) – 2 May 2010.</p>
