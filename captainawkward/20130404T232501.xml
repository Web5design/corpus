				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward,</em></p>
<p><em>My mom died suddenly and unexpectedly 2 months ago. My parents had been married almost 40 years. A month after her passing, I accidentally discovered that my dad has been sleeping with multiple men he meets on the internet, at the gym, etc., and that he is also having sex in public restrooms. I don&#8217;t believe that my mom knew that this was going on, but I realize that that is a possibility. </em></p>
<p><em>It was not a complete shock to me that my dad is gay or bisexual, as the thought had crossed my mind before, and after my mom died I had even considered that he might bring home a boyfriend in a couple of years. I imagined myself being very supportive and understanding in that scenario, but this sudden discovery at such an emotional time has really thrown me for a loop. The high-risk behavior is freaking me out and making me angry, if I&#8217;m honest. I just lost one parent, and I don&#8217;t want to lose another! Furthermore, the thought that he was likely putting my mom at risk, too, really upsets me.</em></p>
<p><em>I cannot stop worrying about how this might play out. I&#8217;m worried that he is putting himself in harm&#8217;s way and risking arrest, etc. I&#8217;m worried that the community that has been supporting him through the loss of my mom would disappear if this came out in the wrong way. Similarly, I worry about how my mom&#8217;s extended family, to whom we are very close, would react if this were suddenly revealed. I feel like I&#8217;m not able to progress through the normal grieving process for my mom because I am so wrapped up in the stress of this situation and keeping this secret. So, here are my questions:</em></p>
<p><em>1) Should I tell him that I know? Should I tell him how much I know?</em></p>
<p><em>2) If I do tell him, how do I do it and what do I say? Is it even appropriate for me to share my concerns for his health and well-being considering his sex life is not really any of my business?</em></p>
<p><em>Sincerely, </em></p>
<p><em>Daughter with a Dilemma</em></p>
<p><span id="more-5351"></span></p>
<p>Dear Daughter,</p>
<p>A little time has gone by since you first sent this in. I am so, so sorry for your loss and cannot even imagine the shock and grief that goes with losing your mom so suddenly.</p>
<p>While I realize that this may not make you feel any better, if at all possible, I think the best course is for you to let the stuff with your dad go, and not do or say anything to him about it until or unless he tells you what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s risky.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s uncharacteristic.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p>Even if you have worries and fears and anger about it.</p>
<p>His extended family and community might not be happy with his behavior if they found out, but that is <strong>his</strong> issue to manage.</p>
<p>He owns his own body and his own sexuality, including any risks that come with his behavior.</p>
<p>And he owns his own <strong>grief</strong> and grieving process.</p>
<p>Thinking the words &#8220;my dad&#8221; and &#8220;<a title="Peaches: Fuck the Pain Away" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHcMqOQt4NY" target="_blank">fuck the pain away</a>&#8221; in the same sentence is not a whole bunch of fun for you, and I&#8217;m sorry &#8211; I wish he were being more discreet and that you didn&#8217;t know. But unless he does something in a way that makes it 100% obvious that you know, put up that Plausible Deniability Screen, the one your parents probably used for you when you became sexually active and the one that all roommates everywhere use to pretend that sound doesn&#8217;t carry inside a shared house.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you are a kinky person, and that your kink is to tie eggplants to your feet and rub them against the feet of people who have mushrooms tied to their feet. Wracked by grief, you&#8217;ve been having more vegetable-on-vegetable action of late and have been a little less than discreet about where you find your ratatouille. Your dad finds out what you&#8217;re up to, and he confronts you about your safety, the way people might see you in the family and community, and heaps a whole bunch of shame and worry upon your private business, etc. How would you feel? Would you feel loved and cared for? Would it be a wakeup call for you? Would that conversation leave either of you feeling better? I know you are genuinely very concerned about him, but any time &#8220;safety issues&#8221; + &#8220;what will people think?&#8221; + &#8220;behavior I don&#8217;t like or agree with/moral upset&#8221; get combined together you risk falling into concern-trolling. I think many of us have done sexual things that our family members would not approve of and find risky, and I think at those  times we had our reasons, and I don&#8217;t think anyone could have talked us out of them or made things better with their disapproval.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m deliberately trying to choose a ridiculous kink as an example so I don&#8217;t inadvertently stumble into anyone&#8217;s actual kinks, and I don&#8217;t want to dodge the very real safety issues that might be at play here, but all nearly all sexual contact carries some risk. You&#8217;re not psyched about the string of anonymous partners, but you also wouldn&#8217;t be psyched if they were women, and you also probably wouldn&#8217;t be happy if he found a new girlfriend or long-term boyfriend and started to look serious about settling down with someone right now. It&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span> too much, too soon.</p>
<p>So the axioms at play are:</p>
<ul>
<li>His sexual choices are his to make.</li>
<li>Adults should give each other a wide berth when it comes to privacy.</li>
<li>People come out when it&#8217;s right for them, not necessarily when it&#8217;s right for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s good that you&#8217;ve considered the possibility that he is gay. When the time is right, and some more time has passed, you can have the sweet talk that my Godmother had with me when it had been a long time since I&#8217;d mentioned a dude or brought one home:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Jennifer, I just want you to know that&#8230;<strong>anyone</strong> you loved, we would also love. So if you ever wanted to bring &#8230;<strong>someone</strong> home, we would welcome&#8230;<strong>that person</strong></em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t gay, I was just single (and we don&#8217;t fly <a title="My Sluthood, Myself" href="http://yesmeansyesblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/my-sluthood-myself/" target="_blank">Socially Unacceptable Brief Slutty Encounters </a>home to Massachusetts for the holidays, or, at least I don&#8217;t), but it was good to know, right?</p>
<p>Your dad will need you to be that cool daughter someday. But he also needs you to be that cool daughter <strong>now</strong>, and give him some time and space about private stuff, and to reach out to him (spend time with him, recommend that he see a counselor, check in on him, tell him you love him) about the common ground you share.</p>
<p>I think you should talk to <strong>someone</strong> about this. Grief, anger, worry, the pressure of keeping a secret all mixed up together is a powerful and messy combo, and some counseling for yourself where you can get as angry as you need and lay out all your concerns and figure out how to tackle them might be a very helpful step. A counselor will let you talk through worst-case scenarios but will also remind you that the worst case scenarios are not always so. Maybe he wasn&#8217;t putting your mom at risk. Maybe he really did wait until she died to seek this kind of contact, and this is something that has been pent up for years. Maybe they did have an understanding. That is 100% between them; you are not the guardian of your parents&#8217; marital fidelity.</p>
<p>If word is getting out, and people bring concerns up to you, an all-purpose mantra is &#8220;<em>Grief is unpredictable. You should probably talk to my dad directly about that.</em>&#8221; You don&#8217;t have to manage your dad&#8217;s image for him. That can be a hard thing to let go of, but I think it is good for you if you learn (maybe slowly, with help of a counselor) that you don&#8217;t have to control how other people see your dad.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can find a way to put this down under some kind of Year of Grieving seal and forgive your dad for not managing his grief the way you want him to. Maybe there is an honest talk in your future where he tells you what&#8217;s up and you can say &#8220;<em>Yeah, I knew when you did x, and I was really worried about you, but I wanted to give you your privacy. Can we talk about that?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>Finally, if you do end up talking about it, just freaking talk about it. Don&#8217;t drop hints about &#8220;discretion.&#8221; Don&#8217;t drop hints, period. &#8220;<em>Dad, I wish I didn&#8217;t know this, but I do. I heard/saw/unavoidably have to know that you did x, and it&#8217;s making me concerned about you. I want to respect your privacy, and you don&#8217;t have to talk to me about what&#8217;s going on, but I wish you would talk to someone about it, and I really want you to be safe and okay.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t envy you, or your dad. The Year(s)of Grieving stretch out in front of you no matter what you choose, so I wish you kindness, strength, patience, and love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward:</em></p>
<p><em>I am trying to not make this question sound like a pity party, but will probably slip up somewhere. Apologies in advance and gratefulness for making this the space you do.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like I am just plain mean a lot of the time. </em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s confusing because I try to be really caring and positive and encouraging to my friends, there&#8217;s just this fucking mean streak too. I also work in Profession where Being Kind and Supportive is a huge part of my job and I don&#8217;t have any trouble there. The few times my friends have been my clients (which is ethically fine in this field) I have felt lucky because I feel like they finally got to see me at my best.</em></p>
<p><em>But outside of that I feel like there&#8217;s just this continuous stream of negativity that slips into conversations even with people I love, and I dig at people in subtle and not-subtle ways and don&#8217;t even notice it until the words have already flown out of my mouth. </em></p>
<p><em>I think it is a defense mechanism because I don&#8217;t do it as much when I&#8217;m around people I feel comfortable with, but when I&#8217;m in a new social setting or around people I&#8217;m not sure like me I am just like&#8230;negative thought machine word vomit spout. It used to be way worse, but it is still often enough to sting and be totally inappropriate. </em></p>
<p><em>I avoid getting involved with people who I can tell are no-bullshit and have good boundaries because I feel like they would automatically dislike me because of it, which sucks because I really respect people who have those skills and I am working on them myself. Simultaneously, I try to avoid becoming close with people who aren&#8217;t necessarily good at standing up for themselves, because I&#8217;m afraid of hurting their feelings.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m also really hard on myself, like 24/7 negative self-talk, which I know is my stuff to deal with, and I&#8217;m working on getting back in therapy. I guess what I&#8217;m wondering about is how to deal with Jerkbrain: Externalized so I&#8217;m not always hurting people I care about and feeling like I have to avoid social situations so I don&#8217;t ruin them for the people who are there to enjoy them, not be insulted.</em></p>
<p><em>I already know that what I&#8217;m doing is shitty and I am trying to find tools to be able to stop, because shaming myself about it is, surprise, totally ineffectual. Tips? Tricks? Personal red flags to look for? Mantras to repeat under my breath in bathrooms at parties? </em></p>
<p><em>Thanks,</em></p>
<p><em>Jerk but Trying</em></p>
<p>Dear Trying Jerk:</p>
<p>The negative self-talk and the negative other-talk are connected. So yes, please go back to therapy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in the headspace you describe, for sure. I believe the clinical term is &#8220;total misery.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-5344"></span></p>
<p>The biggest thing I did to get out of it may sound cheesy and strange: I gave up &#8220;complaining&#8221; for Lent one year way back when Lent was something I still agnostically tried to celebrate. I wrote about it at the (now very defunct) <a title="The Girl Who Ate Everything" href="http://thegirlwhoateeverything.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/burgers-and-blasphemy/">food blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had just turned 26.  I worked ridiculous hours and was stressed past all recognition.  And I was addicted to complaining in a work environment that was hooked on complaining and my work people were also my social people whose favorite thing to do was get together after work and complain. At least there we had liquor.</p>
<p>We wanted to change everything, so complained about the changes we would make if we were in charge, but when our bosses tried actually changing stuff, we complained about that too.  I don’t remember exactly how I decided, but somewhere in there I realized the complaining was slowly killing me and I gave it up for Lent.  Here were the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would not initiate complaining.</li>
<li>If people started to complain, I’d change the subject or politely extricate myself from the conversation.</li>
<li>I would not tell people what I was doing or harsh on them for complaining –The goal was to change my outlook, not to give up complaining in favor of being a jerk to everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p>I won’t say I was perfect but I will say I did pretty well at consistently re-routing my brain away from pointing out the flaws in everything to finding solutions.  I think I became nicer to other people and to myself.  And then I quit that job, dumped my unsuitable love partner, and moved across the country to start a new life within the following 4 months.  The energy I released by complaining was incredibly productive when channeled into actually changing things&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A ban on complaining didn&#8217;t mean I had to react positively to actual bad news, i.e., death, taxes, romantic disappointment, injustice. To live in the world means being aware all the time of things that are unfair and wrong, and I don&#8217;t think we do ourselves or each other any favors by pretending things are okay when they are not okay. Activism requires a certain amount of complaining.</p>
<div>Also, at the time, I was pretty big into <a title="The Artist's Way" href="http://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-Spiritual-Creativity-Anniversary/dp/1585421464">The Artist&#8217;s Way</a> and the whole Morning Pages thing (3 pages longhand every morning, the digital equivalent would be <a title="750 Words" href="http://750words.com">750words.com</a>), and in the morning pages I could say anything I wanted, including a litany of complaints and things I hated about myself. By having a safe place to vomit it all out, I could keep my cool throughout the day. Nowadays I still keep journals and having them switch over to all complaints, all the time is a good sign that I&#8217;m about to go into a depressive slide.</div>
<p>The complaining ban was meant to stop the constant complaining that I was doing at work and about work that was spilling into everything. The expense report system is wack! They are making a tiny change to this software I use and I don&#8217;t like it! I wanted to go on that assignment and they sent someone else! I hate my body! I never have any free time! What am I really supposed to be doing with my life? The bus was full! My feet stink! This coffee is burnt! They are out of my favorite brand of toilet paper! The cat puked on the floor again! Why am I paid $30,000 year to rewrite stuff that some old dude gets $200,000 year to write very badly? This job requires an expensive degree but doesn&#8217;t pay me enough to make the student loan payments! (Welp, we&#8217;re back to legit activism with that last one).</p>
<p>I know complaining isn&#8217;t exactly the same as being mean to people, but I was hypercritical of everything: work, myself, other people. My inner critic was in full outward mode, and I was definitely mean to people in some pretty shameful ways. Like High School-aged Liz Lemon, I thought being a smartass and having a mean mouth was the one thing I had going for me, and there are ways it made me feel less powerless and allowed me to feel like I was defending myself against bullies or a shitty status quo. In high school, that logic is understandable if not entirely forgivable: The Cool Kids are mean to me, therefore if I can be as mean as them I can be as cool as them! It was a fallacy at the time, and it sure as hell doesn&#8217;t age well.</p>
<p>So, Letter Writer, to bring this back to you and now and not some 13-year old experiment, I think:</p>
<p>1. Negative talk comes out of negative feelings that need to be dealt with at length in some safe space &#8211; a therapist&#8217;s office, a journal, with close friends.</p>
<p>2. However, you don&#8217;t have to change the feelings to start to change the habit, and negative talk (negative self-talk, criticism, complaining) is also a <strong>habit</strong>. When it&#8217;s in full force, it becomes your first instinct to react negatively.</p>
<p>We know some stuff about changing habits, and one of the biggest things to know is that sustained effort is better than perfection. How you treat yourself when you inevitably slip up is everything. People who will actually change the habit forgive themselves for slipping up, give themselves credit for doing what they can, and try again later. Perfectionists see any slip-up as a total failure and a reason to derail the entire affair. So if your mean self comes out, when you catch it: stop it, apologize, and then move away from those people and/or stop talking so much. Maybe you&#8217;ll have a shame spiral ( I would probably have a shame spiral), because that shit I just said about forgiving oneself and giving credit and trying again later is seriously the hardest thing for a recovering perfectionist to do. What matters is that you keep trying to stop saying negative things about yourself and others. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><br />
</span></strong></p>
<p>The other thing we know about changing habits is that it feels hard at first (when I gave up complaining, I felt like 85% of my personality went away) but it feels better the more you do it. Don&#8217;t expect it to feel good immediately, but over time, expect your actions to affect your feelings positively.</p>
<p>3. Negative talk has a place &#8211; in acknowledging hurt and wrong, in figuring out that a situation is bad for you, in figuring out what steps to take next. It&#8217;s toxic when it gets all over other people the way you describe in your letter, and also when it becomes what you do <strong>instead of</strong> taking action. If it&#8217;s robbing you of momentum and sapping your energy, it&#8217;s crossed the line into unhelpful. This is stuff to work on when you actually do find a therapist, but a good habit when you&#8217;re in &#8220;complain/criticize&#8221; mode is to try to figure out what parts of what is upsetting you is inside your control and what is outside your control. The stuff that&#8217;s inside your control will lend itself to action, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Ask the person directly to stop doing the thing that&#8217;s bothering you.</span></li>
<li>Start looking for a new job/roommate/college major/career/life plan.</li>
<li>Ask your crush out already, or break up with the person who is bringing you down.</li>
<li>Make a needed schedule change/doctor&#8217;s appointment/reorganize the spice cabinet/home repair.</li>
<li>Write  letter to the editor or find some activist or volunteer outlet.</li>
<li>Stop hanging out with x person or change the subject when x topic comes up.</li>
<li>Stop reading/watching stuff that makes you feel bad, for example, one way to cut down on body shame and body snarking is to stop reading women&#8217;s magazines that are full of diet advice and Photoshopped idealized bodies.</li>
<li>Break any of the above down into tiny steps. One tiny step in the direction of actually resolving something that is bothering you is better than complaining.</li>
</ul>
<p>The things you are criticizing other people for sound like things that are outside your control, because what someone wears/listens to/who they date/what they eat or whatever you are criticizing isn&#8217;t really your business, at all.</p>
<p>4. Make apologies and amends where you can, but remember, apologies only count if you stop doing the bad thing and you don&#8217;t make them about yourself. <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I was so mean, there is this thing going on where I hate myself and I feel like I can&#8217;t help it</em>&#8221; = not actually an apology. &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m sorry, that was really out of line</em>&#8221; = an apology.</p>
<p>5. Practice some self-care. This means taking care of yourself around eating, sleeping, your living space, going to the doctor when you&#8217;re sick, getting a haircut when you need one, looking for a new job if you hate your current one.</p>
<p>It might also mean spending more time with people who make you feel good and comfortable and taking a break from social scenes that stress you out. Maybe your outbursts are borne of defensiveness and not liking yourself very much right now, or patterns you were raised with that come out in times of stress. Consider also the idea that part of this is your gut reactions to spaces that don&#8217;t feel good and people that don&#8217;t feel good. Maybe your <a title="#391: How To Train Your Rageasaurus" href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/11/07/391-how-to-train-your-rageasaurus/">Rageasaurus</a> is trying to protect you. I don&#8217;t want to say &#8220;No new things or people&#8221;, but I do want to say that if you are going to be around people you don&#8217;t know well or outside of your comfort zone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give yourself a time limit &#8211; one hour, one set, one drink, meet one new person and talk to them &#8211; and then give yourself permission to leave while things still feel good.</li>
<li>If drinking is a factor in what&#8217;s going on, watch yours. Keep it to one, or don&#8217;t drink at all.</li>
<li>Slow down, overall. Listen more than you talk. Stop trying to hard to make people like you (or have an opinion about you either way). Stop working so hard at this.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NO yucking other people&#8217;s yum</span>.</strong> If you don&#8217;t know what to say, compliments and questions are a good place to start. &#8220;<em>I like your bag, where did you get it?</em>&#8221; &#8220;<em>How do you know the hosts?&#8221;</em> &#8221;<em>This is delicious, how did you make it?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>In an answer full of tangents, allow me to rant about taste and the way we talk about pop culture and suggest an alternative way of talking about taste. Because this is a common, sort of socially acceptable way that I see adults being mean to each other.</p>
<p>We have to learn a better way of talking about things that other people like that we don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>There are a ton of Geek/Pop Culture discussions when people are meeting the first time that go like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>What kind of _____ do you like?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I like ____.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Really? They SUCK. Here are 11,000 reasons why that thing you like sucks</em>.&#8221; (Subtext: And you also suck for liking it. And I am smarter than you and my opinions are better than yours.Consider yourself DOMINATED. <strong>Side Note:</strong>  If you start paying attention to the way people have these conversations, you&#8217;ll start noticing how often &#8220;girly&#8221; things are devalued. Whether or not you personally like the work of Stephanie Meyer, Lena Dunham, Amanda Palmer, or Beyoncé (and let me, with full moderator powers, make it clear how much I really do not care what your personal opinions of their particular works are. Like them, or don&#8217;t, as long as you do it <strong>elsewhere</strong>), much of the criticism that comes their way and the way of their fans is laden with misogyny, racism, and body-policing that does not get applied to men in similar prominent creative roles.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Postulate Time:</strong></span></p>
<p>Stuff can be &#8220;good&#8221; (technically accomplished, made with talent &amp; dedication) and you can still not like it. Stuff can be &#8220;bad&#8221; and entertaining/enjoyable at the same time.</p>
<p>A lot of people get really caught up in the stuff they listen to and watch and buy to the point where it becomes their identity. In a capitalist society, this is encouraged and rewarded. The question isn&#8217;t &#8220;<em>Do you prefer a Mac or a PC?</em>&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;<em><strong>Are</strong> you a Mac or a PC?</em>&#8221; So people get very defensive, and yes, mean, when that identity is challenged in any way. Or they get overly invested in the meaningfulness of taste as a source of connection when someone likes the same stuff. As <a title="Geek Relationship Fallacies" href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/04/16/geek-relationship-fallacies/">Commander Logic says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look, the Jedi and the Klingon CAN be lovers. And LotR purists can make out with LotR movie fans (right after we pause (or not) to sing a requiem for Glorfindel&#8230; What’s important in a relationship is not your media, it’s your actions and respect.</p>
<p>This is another human being who is allowed to have thoughts and opinions that are different from yours. They are allowed to not give a shit if Greedo or Han shot first.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ranting about pop culture is fun. Sometime if we&#8217;re at a party, ask me about the movie <em>Rent</em>.  Criticism is valuable and entertaining &#8211; in blog posts, in Tweets, in scholarly articles, in reviews &#8211; and <a title="Marie Claire’s “Rich”:  Good girls get to meet your mom.  Bad girls are too confident and hard to control….like dirty snow." href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/03/13/marie-claires-rich-good-girls-get-to-meet-your-mom-bad-girls-are-too-confident-and-hard-to-control-like-dirty-snow/">snark has its place</a>.</p>
<p>However, that place is not the first time you meet someone, or with someone you don&#8217;t know well, or with someone that isn&#8217;t comfortable having super-fun pop culture ranty times with you. And that time is not right after someone says &#8220;<em>I really like ___!</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>So if a lot of your conversations are going the way of the example, and you are the one acting as the Sole Arbiter of Taste and Style, try this approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>What kind of x do you like?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I like x!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;They&#8217;re not really my thing/I haven&#8217;t really gotten into them/I don&#8217;t know much about them, but what&#8217;s your favorite (song, book, movie, painting, example)?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The stuff you like will still be cool without you defending it or proving its superiority in this exact moment; truth and beauty are durable. Also, you can still feel whatever you want about what the other person likes. I mean, I do not understand Juggalos, but if I&#8217;m hanging at a party and there is an actual Juggalo there I want to find out all about that, don&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m pretty sure the Juggalos are pretty comfortable with the fact that most people aren&#8217;t also Juggalos and tired of having the &#8220;<em>Juggalos: Cool or Not Cool?</em>&#8221; discussion. You&#8217;re not going to accidentally become a Juggalo because you failed to fully critique the one you met that time at a your cousin&#8217;s wedding, so relax and let people be themselves.</p>
<p>This way you can actually have a conversation and find out a little bit more about someone else, which is the point of social interactions with new people. There&#8217;s this fallacy that &#8220;authenticity&#8221; always means talking about things with the most negative, critical eye.  Not sharing every opinion that you have does not equal &#8220;being fake&#8221; or &#8220;lying.&#8221; Every dinner party doesn&#8217;t have to turn into a Platonic discussion of What is the Good?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the community will have many helpful suggestions and tales of reformed Mean People, and I really do wish you luck in changing this aspect of your personality. The fact that you are self-aware and wanting to change it is a big, big step in the right direction, so practice giving yourself some credit for reaching out and asking how.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>

<div>Dear Awkward Army,</div>
<p>London meetup this weekend, 23rd March!  All welcome.</p>
<p>11:00 am onwards, Leon restaurant, 36/38 Old Compton Street, London, W1D 4TT.</p>
<p>The venue so far has worked out well, so I’m sticking with that.  They&#8217;ve also offered us 25% off all our food and drink.</p>
<p>Map: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/i9COr" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/maps/i9COr</a></p>
<p>Leon have a variety of good food at very reasonable prices – for central London, anyway!  Menu here:<a href="http://www.leonrestaurants.co.uk/menu/" target="_blank">http://www.leonrestaurants.co.uk/menu/</a></p>
<p>This branch has an accessible toilet, and we’ll be on the ground floor in the back (around behind the food service counter).</p>
<p>I have long brown hair and glasses.  I will bring my plush Cthulhu to use as a table marker.  It looks like this: <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/7cb0/" target="_blank">http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/7cb0/</a></p>
<p>My email address is kate DOT towner AT gmail DOT com</p>
<p>As discussed at previous meetups, I am happy to teach people to knit, so if you want to start or want help, bring something along!</p>
</div>
<p>By the way, I think it&#8217;s likely the April one will be on the 20th rather than the 27th, sorry about any confusion.</p>
</div>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Kate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>And now, a letter.</p>
<p><em>Hey Cap (and friends!),</em></p>
<p><em>There&#8217;s a little bit of background to this, but I&#8217;ll try to keep it short.</em></p>
<p><em>I have issues with my family. I guess you could say I&#8217;m the &#8220;black sheep&#8221; in a way. I&#8217;m the middle child, the only creative person, the only one who could be described as liberal, and (perhaps most importantly) the only one to inherit my mother&#8217;s bad depression, with a side of social anxiety. Add to this a big old heap of emotional abuse from my father and, later, my stepmother (who is thankfully gone now).</em></p>
<p><em>When I was in high school, I went through a lot of trouble, including self-harm, that was more or less ignored, and I didn&#8217;t do very well in school despite having clear potential. It was only later when I asked my parents about it that they said yeah, they always sort of knew that I had depression, and knew that it was holding me back, but they didn&#8217;t want to bring it up with me at the time because&#8230;they haven&#8217;t given a solid answer. As far as I can tell, they kind of sacrificed my academic future on the altar of not having an awkward conversation with me.</em></p>
<p><em>A few months ago, I moved out of state to live with my boyfriend and see about continuing into college now that I have things more under control. But every time I talk to my parents or my brother and sister, it seems like they have nothing nice to say at all.</em></p>
<p><em>I love my brother and sister, but every time I chat with them, they seem to be always upset with me. &#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you called us? Why haven&#8217;t you called Dad? You need to call us more and not be so ungrateful. You don&#8217;t even want to be part of the family.&#8221; Even putting aside the fact that they know I have a lot of anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone, I don&#8217;t understand how being busy up here and not able to contact home every day counts as ungrateful.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, the other night, a minor disagreement on Facebook randomly spiraled into them accusing me of hating our father, of not wanting to be a part of the family, and of being selfish in even moving away. These overtures were common before I&#8217;d moved, but now it&#8217;s been magnified so that they&#8217;ve become outright vicious about it.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m out of a toxic environment, but now the environment is starting to follow me. How do I tell my brother and sister that I still love my family (I really do!), but they need respect my decisions and treat me like a person?</em></p>
<p>Oh goody, when your abuser recruits others to do their abusing for them.</p>
<p><span id="more-5336"></span></p>
<p>I want to review a few things about abuse (which includes neglect and/or emotional abuse). Well, I don&#8217;t want to. But I will. People can grow up in the same household <a title="Reader Question #6:  I’m worried about my sister.  She is still very close to our abusive parents." href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/01/19/reader-question-6-im-worried-about-my-sister-she-is-still-very-close-to-our-abusive-parents/">and have two totally different experiences of what happened</a>. Your brother and sister are probably being wound up by your dad, and investing in this story about how they are the Good Ones and you are the one who causes problems. And your leaving affects the stories they want to tell themselves about how they grew up. If they grew up in an awesome place, then why are you leaving it? And if they didn&#8217;t grow up in such an awesome situation, and you can just walk away from it, then they could theoretically walk away from it, too. But they aren&#8217;t, so are you like, judging them by making a different choice? Or leaving them alone to deal with JerkDad on their own, which is somehow &#8220;unfair&#8221;?</p>
<p>None of this surprises me, is what I&#8217;m saying. Abusers need to control the story about what happened, and will go to great lengths (including deputizing others and making them miserable by proxy) to keep that control, because it&#8217;s a way of controlling you. If your parents had gotten you help when they noticed you harming yourself, they risked that you would tell other people what it was really like in your house, which may have had real consequences for them or the imagined consequence of &#8220;someone somewhere thinks they are not very good parents.&#8221; Maybe you would have moved out, and been outside of their control. Maybe you would have gone off to school, and learned things, and been outside of their control. Maybe people in your town would have given them the side-eye at church. Or, maybe they saw you hurting yourself and they just didn&#8217;t give a shit, and now that you&#8217;re old enough to tell the story I and everyone reading this thinks maybe they weren&#8217;t very good parents. That cat is out of the bag, Letter Writer, so take care of yourself now that you are out of the house and have that agency for yourself.</p>
<p>Honestly, who knows or cares what their logic is. You don&#8217;t actually have to know in order to make good decisions for yourself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we do know:</p>
<p>1. Many people don&#8217;t get the whole &#8220;making a different choice than you is not an attack on you&#8221; thing. You left. They could leave too, if they wanted to. If they choose to stay? Great, enjoy that, then! Not actually a referendum on love or a reason for yelling.</p>
<p>2. Starting a conversation with someone who calls you with WHY DON&#8217;T YOU CALL MORE, JERK? is a good way to get people to call you even less, because why put up with the hassle? Telephones, roads, emails work both ways.</p>
<p>3. Living where you are living and putting some distance between you and your family is a good decision for you right now.</p>
<p>Your family doesn&#8217;t have to be horrible for that to be true, by the way. Some people grow really well while staying very close to and entwined with their families, but some people need to go off on their own and really break away for a while before they can come back and figure out an adult relationship with their folks. The stayers aren&#8217;t better people than the leavers, and the leavers don&#8217;t necessarily grow up better than the stayers &#8211; it&#8217;s just, whatever your situation is, you need to do what is right for you.</p>
<p>It sounds like your family sees you as a perpetual fuck-up. Guess what? For much of my adult life, mine did, too. They wouldn&#8217;t use &#8220;fuck-up&#8221;, they would use &#8220;We&#8217;re very worried about you,&#8221; or &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand your choices (to seem to fail at everything).&#8221; For a lot of my 20s, when I was really struggling with depression and figuring out what I wanted to do with my life, being around them for long periods of time would make me start to feel like a fuck-up. And then it would be self-fulfilling &#8211; I&#8217;d be so miserable and wound up that I would be in a reactive mode because I was so ashamed and on-edge all the time. If you&#8217;re constantly criticized, you start to react to people as if they mean to criticize you even before the words come out of their mouths, so it&#8217;s easy to launch the &#8220;<em>Why are you being so dramatic/exaggerating/blowing things out of proportion/I was <strong>just asking</strong>/jeez, overreact much?</em>&#8221; brigade and the you feel more like a fuck-up because you&#8217;re being gaslighted into believing that having normal reactions &#8211; stress, aversion, shoulders-up-around-ears, being on guard are somehow your own fantasies and not reactions to the <a title="Microaggression" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression" target="_blank">constant criticism </a>that&#8217;s being leveled at you.</p>
<p>You know what was a great decision for me? Moving really, really far away and staying there, and seeing them in smaller doses.</p>
<p>I just spent a few days with my folks last month, and we&#8217;re on much better terms now and it was mostly a great visit. But by the end of it, my dad&#8217;s constant mansplaining had escalated to the point that he took my toast out of the toaster, put it back in &#8220;correctly,&#8221; called me &#8220;stupid&#8221; for not being able to find the correct drawer where knives were kept on the first try in a kitchen where I don&#8217;t live, and actually SCREAMED at me for microwaving food for what he deemed to be an incorrect amount of time. Screamed. Spit flying and hitting my face. Screamed.</p>
<p>And that was a &#8220;great&#8221; visit. And if he read this (I don&#8217;t think they read the blog, they&#8217;ve never mentioned it, and I&#8217;ve never mentioned it to them though I don&#8217;t hide my actual identity), he&#8217;d tell me I was overreacting and blowing the whole thing out of proportion. Because screaming about things like &#8220;where we keep the knives in a rental kitchen&#8221; is normal in his world, so normal that there is a 75% chance he does not remember it at all, and I was raised to think that was normal. I <a title="Men are too emotional to have a rational argument" href="http://www.thegloss.com/2012/11/12/career/bullish-life-men-are-too-emotional-to-have-a-rational-argument-994/" target="_blank">would be the &#8220;emotional&#8221; one for being mad</a> that someone screamed in my face (and having to walk out of the room and go cry privately and text my boyfriend because I honestly felt like I was going crazy), and he would be the rational one, because&#8230;he is a dude. A dude who gets so upset about microwave times that he screams. Rational!</p>
<p>And then I left, and I went to the <a title="Should I move away from my abusive family" href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/10/18/question-122-should-i-move-away-from-my-abusive-family/" target="_blank">small quiet room</a>, where no one screams at me, ever. And if someone in my life now screamed at me, they would not do it twice, because they would not be in my life anymore, because screaming at people over trivial shit is not okay. I learned that by leaving home, pretty much forever, which was not without costs and anxiety and working hard to schedule visits so that I can get in and out with a minimum of screaming. Going home &amp; maintaining that relationship means trying to always make sure I have a rental car, or schedule time with friends who live nearby so I have a break, and ALWAYS having my phone with me so I feel connected to people who don&#8217;t yell at me, and sometimes, honestly, Xanax. It means when they are nice and pleasant it makes me doubt my own reality, like, do I really need to keep my shields up? Am I being unfair? Ohhhhh wait, there is screaming about trivial stuff again, nope, it&#8217;s okay to keep my guard up. It also cost <strong>years of therapy</strong> to learn how to interact in a healthy way, keep my temper (or lose it more selectively), and be able to disassociate from what was happening and remind myself that their vision of me is not me. It also cost long periods of not interacting with them, with the explicit message &#8220;<em>If you are not nice to me, I will not be around</em>.&#8221; Eventually it worked and made everyone try very hard to be nicer. But I won&#8217;t ever lie and say it was easy.</p>
<p>Alphakitty said something really great <a title="Comment by Alphakitty" href="http://captainawkward.com/2013/03/18/461-my-partner-makes-hurtful-jokes-about-my-health-situation/#comment-49604" target="_blank">in a comment</a> yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think part of a mother/father’s power to hurt comes from the Pedestals of Infallibility young children are encouraged to put their parents on. Even once we grow up and learn that our parents are just people, with biases and baggage and all that, we still invest their opinions of us with greater Truth and weight than we would give anyone else’s opinion. It’s all swirled together with the “Mother/Father knows best,” and “we only want what’s best for you” (even though their values probably aren’t quite the same as yours, so their definition of “best” is not going to match yours), and an implication that “we know you better than anyone else, even you” (though parents’ opinions of their offspring are often a) outdated, based on behavior/characteristics the “child” has outgrown, and b) distorted by their own values and their need to believe certain things about their kids).</p></blockquote>
<p>Your parents, and your brother and sister, DON&#8217;T KNOW YOU BEST. And they don&#8217;t know what is best for you &#8211; they proved that when you needed help and mental health services and they just kind of forgot to hook you up with them. And this story that they have about how you are a fuck-up is not the only story, and not a story that everyone will have about you. And I think you were smart to get far, far away from them.</p>
<p>I think that now that you are away, you should do a couple of things:</p>
<p>1) Find (or continue) treatment for your depression.</p>
<p>2) Put your brother, sister, dad, and anyone else who makes you uncomfortable in social media jail. There are ways you can stay &#8220;friends&#8221; with someone on Facebook but make it so they can&#8217;t really see anything you post or do on Facebook. Or, consider unfriending them, or making a second profile where you connect with people you really want to. &#8220;<em>I love you, but I refuse to get in Facebook fights. From now on email me at _____.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>3) Filter their emails and phone calls so that you <a title="What is an introvert? #456 &amp; #457: Communication Expectations" href="http://captainawkward.com/2013/03/01/what-is-an-introvert-456-457-communication-expectations/" target="_blank">choose to interact with them at specific, regular times</a>. And possibly cut off all contact for a while, if it helps you gain some distance and perspective. For a long time, this is what I did: I would call or hang out periodically, and be pleasant as long as they were pleasant. When the first mean thing was said, I would leave the conversation and not interact again for a period of (generally) 1 month. 2 mean things? 2 months. 3 mean things? 3 months. It was not perfect, and it was very hard and painful and took a lot of psyching myself up and second-guessing on my part. But it was pretty essential in reminding myself: &#8220;<em>Whatever happened in the past,</em> <em>I do not have to stay in conversations with people who are rude to me.</em>&#8221; Sometimes I would just excuse myself, &#8220;<em>Sorry, out of time to talk, catch you soon!</em>&#8221; and sometimes I&#8217;d say &#8220;<em>This conversation is really starting to stress me out, so I&#8217;m going to end it now</em>&#8221; &#8211; it depended on how mean it was and my overall stress level.</p>
<p>4) Repeat &#8220;<em>I am not responsible for everything they feel&#8221;</em> until it sounds believable.</p>
<p>5) If you want to, say something like &#8220;<em>I am really happy and excited to start school. I am taking a break from communication for a while while I get settled, and I&#8217;ll be in touch when I&#8217;m ready</em>.&#8221; And then let them feel about it and react however they want. They will not like it, they will not understand, they will be mad, but it might still be <strong>what you need</strong> in order to feel okay.</p>
<p>6) It may never be okay. It will always hurt a bit and feel weird. That&#8217;s because abuse is destructive and it ruins everything, not because you are a bad mean ungrateful daughter. Your family is blaming you for things they did to you. Not okay.</p>
<p>7) The rest of your family might not believe you or see it your way. &#8220;<em>But that&#8217;s just how he is&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;But I deal with it, why can&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re exaggerating.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not that bad.&#8221; </em>Well, maybe it is that bad, for you, and they don&#8217;t have to agree for you to do what is right for you. It would be awesome if your sibs could be your allies, but if they aren&#8217;t, admit it and disengage. &#8220;<em>We think you&#8217;re the worst, so move back here and prove you love us, or we&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re the worst</em>&#8221; isn&#8217;t really a compelling proposition.</p>
<p>8) Kick ass at your studies and enjoy your new life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward:</em></p>
<p><em>I have had a very complex life in the last couple of years. I have gone from having a fairly normal life in regards to health and then I went on dialysis. Since that point I now have a kidney transplant.</em></p>
<p><em>My girlfriend currently has a really hard time wrapping her mind around the changes in lifestyle that I have to live. She almost finds my precautions somewhat unbearable.</em></p>
<p><em>What should I do? She also makes fun of my situation or lightheartedly jokes about it.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately they don&#8217;t offer empathy transplants.</p>
<p>Was your girlfriend with you since before the changes? Because I would imagine that watching a partner go through dialysis and a kidney transplant would make it sink in that 1) Hey, you could have DIED 2) Following your doctors&#8217; recommendations carefully is  serious business. If she met you after the changes, maybe the seriousness of it hasn&#8217;t really sunk in. Which isn&#8217;t an excuse, but it gives you a place to start in deepening her perspective.</p>
<p>If you want to try to make things work with this person, I think there is both a Big Serious Talk to be had and some day-to-day scripts.</p>
<p>The daily script is, when she makes a joke, to say something like &#8220;<em>Whoa, that really hurts my feelings</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>After you say that, be quiet, and listen to what happens next. There is going to be a very awkward moment, and it is not your job to smooth it over &#8211; the awkwardness is the way that you get to the resolution. If she stops, apologizes, and changes her behavior, that&#8217;s a good sign. If you&#8217;ve been putting up with the jokes for a while, it may take a few tries for it to sink in &#8211; you are subtly changing the &#8220;rules&#8221; of how the relationship works and some people don&#8217;t get it right away. You can openly acknowledge the rule change with &#8220;<em>I know I usually let it go, but&#8230;.&#8221; </em>or<em> &#8220;I know you mean that as a joke, but&#8230;.&#8221; when you say things like that, it really hurts my feelings. Can we find another way to talk about x issue?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>If after saying that her jokes hurt your feelings, she doubles down on the joking, or starts justifying why it&#8217;s okay for her to make jokes that hurt your feelings, she is pressuring you to ignore your healthy routines, she calls you &#8220;too sensitive&#8221; and tells you to &#8220;toughen up,&#8221; or for whatever reason the conversation ends with <strong>you</strong> apologizing to <strong>her</strong> for bringing it up and being upset, here there be <a title="The House of Evil Bees" href="http://criminalreviews.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/a-captain-awkward-glossary/#evilbees" target="_blank">Evil Bees</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-5328"></span></p>
<p>I would try that script several times before escalating to the Big Serious Talk. You will get some information about what you&#8217;re dealing with that will help you have the talk, and you&#8217;ll get some recent examples of the behavior that bugs you.</p>
<p>The big talk is telling her what you went through, how painful and scary it was, and why these lifestyle changes are very necessary for you, and asking her directly for her kindness and support and to lay off the hurtful jokes. There is also some asking to be done about her point of view, one way to start the talk is to maybe ask her how things are affecting her. &#8220;<em>I know we&#8217;ve been through some changes, and I get from the jokes that you make that you&#8217;re still really processing them. I know it was hard for you to see me go through that crisis. Can you tell me a little bit about what it&#8217;s been like for you? In a perfect world, where you get everything you want, how would our relationship work? Is there a way we can make the relationship work better for both of us?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s okay for a partner to belittle you for having needs, or make jokes about your health needs, or laugh off your very real concerns and issues, and this way of opening the conversation might seem way nicer than she deserves. My reasoning is this:  When you have to have a very difficult conversation, it helps to treat people as you want to be treated. You are modeling good behavior by being up front about your needs and asking her to articulate hers in the hopes that she will rise to the occasion.</p>
<p>In the most generous possible interpretation of her behavior maybe the jokes are her way of getting uncomfortable feelings out there that she didn&#8217;t ever feel safe to talk about when you guys were in full &#8220;gonna die, can&#8217;t talk now&#8221; mode.  A drastic change in diet or energy or what activities you do does affect the other person in the relationship, not to mention being a caregiver or watching someone you love go through a huge medical crisis.Whatever happened to her during that time was definitely happening to you way more, obviously, but *something* was happening to her and maybe she needs a safe place to talk about how scared she was. If she is a new partner and wasn&#8217;t with you during the time before the transplant, maybe she doesn&#8217;t fully understand what happened and how serious it was, and needs to be told explicitly what it&#8217;s like for you.</p>
<p>Your health needs and not-being-belittled-by-someone-who-says-they-love-you needs trump her feelings, obviously. But the best way to figure out if this is a My Girlfriend Is Bad At Communicating vs. My Girlfriend Lacks Empathy situation is to ask outright and give her the opportunity to surprise you with doing the right thing.  This talk might be a much needed way to process everything together and find a way forward. If it goes well, consider seeing a couples counselor where you can have an ongoing conversation about this and really work on communication.</p>
<p>Sadly, it may be the time you find out that you guys are really not on the same page. Maybe the changes in your lifestyle really are &#8220;unbearable&#8221; for your girlfriend. That is something she gets to decide, and she gets to leave and seek another partner. But she doesn&#8217;t get to hang around and be mean to you. If<em id="__mceDel"> </em>you open up and she makes fun of you, laughs it off, and keeps going with the jokes, realize that there are people out there who won&#8217;t treat you this way. And if she for one second implies that &#8220;someone in your condition&#8221; is lucky to have her and that you won&#8217;t be able to find anyone else, run (or wheel yourself, or crawl) for the nearest exit. That is a big, bad sign that she is emotionally abusing you, and that is 100% never okay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a very smart post on <a title="Ask Jenn Vicious: You're going to be a jerk; set boundaries anyway" href="http://inourwordsblog.com/2013/03/15/ask-jenn-vicious-youre-going-to-be-a-jerk-set-boundaries-anyway/">moving on and setting boundaries with an ex from Jenn Vicious at In Our Words:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There’s this thing that sometimes happens when people break up but still care about each other: they want to continue working on things that were problems in their relationship. Don’t do that. <strong>My opinion on it is that if you break up with someone, then you are done working out the problems in your relationship.</strong> You are more likely to get to a place where you can genuinely care about each other as friends if you actually stop relying on each other for the same support you provided when you were together. You have to change your patterns of behavior, change the expectations you have of each other when you interact. It isn’t easy, but if you didn’t know that you needed to do it, you probably would have stayed in the relationship.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(Bolding mine) That&#8217;s my opinion, too, which is why I <a title="Cohabitation Situations: Ambivalence Deliverance (#451) &amp; Eviction Prescription (#452)" href="http://captainawkward.com/2013/02/20/cohabitation-451ambivalence-deliverance-452-eviction-prescription/">say to not use the moment when you break up with someone to critique everything about them that you don&#8217;t like</a>. You don&#8217;t have to make a case to someone about why your heart moved on, you just have to tell them your decision and then figure out how to live with it. Also, it&#8217;s true that when what someone wants (you!) is fundamentally different from what you want (not them!) there is no magic way to extricate yourself without hurting them.</p>
<p>And now, a letter:</p>
<p><em>Hello Awkwards:</em></p>
<p><em> I&#8217;m a 22 year old single female student studying library and information science. I&#8217;m a gamer, computer &#8211; roleplaying and boardgames it&#8217;s all the same. </em></p>
<p><em> I also don&#8217;t drink alcohol. My family thinks it&#8217;s a bit weird but prefer it to an extreme in the other direction and don&#8217;t bother me about it anymore, strangers and friends however are a different story. Most assume that I&#8217;m either religious (in some strange way), on a cleanse (HA!), a recovering alcoholic or even pregnant.</em></p>
<p><em> The thing is that I just don&#8217;t like the taste and if/when they find this out it&#8217;s no longer accepted for me to abstain. It&#8217;s always just this one beer or drink or wine that is going to convert me. And I like hanging out with my friends when there&#8217;s drinking. I can watch out for everyone and still have an awesome time with just soda. Still someone always asks and I always have to explain and then be pestered. </em></p>
<p><em> &#8220;It&#8217;s to bitter&#8221; I will say and they will reply</em><br />
<em> &#8220;Ah but this drink/beer/wine is different, try it&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em> and no it&#8217;s not it maybe sweet compared to other but that doesn&#8217;t make it actually sweet or remove the aftertaste of alcohol.</em></p>
<p><em> And I never send out the signal that this is something I want solved. I don&#8217;t desperately want to get drunk, I&#8217;m not in dire need of a drunk Yoda to guide me in the way of the drink. And not to make light of others problems but when I have to compare to trying to convert others to your faith/sexuality just to make them stop trying to enrich your life it&#8217;s gone to far- can someone give a way I can try to convince people to leave it alone without referring to these sensitive and more serious issues?</em></p>
<p><em> Please help a frustrated absolutist</em></p>
<p><span id="more-5323"></span></p>
<p>Dear Frustrated Absolutist:</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p><strong>Person</strong>: &#8220;<em>Would you like some wine?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> &#8220;<em>No, thanks. How is (subject change) going with you?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t elaborate, don&#8217;t explain why, don&#8217;t justify it. You said in your letter that you feel like you always have to explain when you turn down alcohol, but you <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> actually have to explain. Be very casual and treat them like you expect nothing weird will happen, and most people will accept subject change and not even realize it. Of course, there will be exceptions, so if someone ask again, try this:</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> &#8220;<em>Are you sure you don&#8217;t want some? It&#8217;s really good.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> &#8220;<em>No thanks. So, tell me about (subject change).</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>Again, do not explain, justify, or elaborate. It is none of their business why you don&#8217;t drink, and elaborating on why invites them to try to make the case that it&#8217;s not that bad or tastes like angel sweat stirred by a unicorn. If the person still doesn&#8217;t get the hint, and if you like absurdity and are snappy with a comeback, try:</p>
<p><strong>Person</strong>: &#8220;<em>Why, are you pregnant or something?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> &#8220;<em>Hahaha, yes, ever since I was kidnapped by demons. They warned me that alcohol could really speed up The Summoning of The Dark One, so I&#8217;m trying to lay off until the Day of The Blood Harvest is complete. So, about (subject change)&#8230;</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> &#8220;<em>But why?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> &#8220;<em>It makes my personality implant malfunction, and trust me, you DON&#8217;T want to meet </em>(stage whisper<em>) Leviticus, the Hands-y Science Professor.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>Person:</strong> &#8220;<em>But you should totally drink! It&#8217;s fun and refreshing!</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> &#8220;<em>I believe you! I&#8217;m starting to run out of subject changes, though, so I would *really* like the next one to take.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>If you are not so snappy with a comeback, or want an all-purpose strategy, here is my actual recommended strategy if someone gets pushy about why you won&#8217;t drink:</p>
<p><strong>Be done talking to that person for the time being.</strong> You said no TWICE. &#8220;No&#8221; is a complete sentence. If someone is just not hearing your &#8220;no&#8221; and steamrollering over it, one possible solution is to just walk away from the conversation. There are lots of people to talk to at parties. You can decide how much of an issue you want to make of it. You can go &#8220;<a title="#336: Gracefully exiting from conversations." href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/08/27/336-gracefully-exiting-from-conversations/">gracefully</a>&#8220;or <a title="Reader Question #20:  Captain Awkward’s Emporium of Cutting Remarks" href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/02/23/reader-question-20-captain-awkwards-emporium-of-cutting-remarks/">ungracefully</a> , i.e., &#8220;<em>Hey, good talking to you&#8221;</em> and excuse yourself from the conversation, or &#8220;<em>I&#8217;ve said &#8216;no thanks&#8217; twice now. Is there a problem?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s good to engage with people and explain to them sincerely why what they are doing is out of line, as in, &#8220;<em>Hey, do we really have to have this conversation again? Because it&#8217;s exhausting and boring. Stop trying to convince me of something I already know and get to decide for myself.</em>&#8220;  Other times, the most self-caring thing you can do is to get yourself away from people &amp; conversations that stress you out, and save your energy for people who make you feel good. Other times, you can just blink at them incredulously and remain silent until they fill the awkward silence with something less intrusive and terrible. &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m sorry, <a title="Don Draper saying &quot;What&quot;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsJSRP7cZVo" target="_blank">what</a>?</em>&#8220;</p>
<p><strong>Because:</strong> The problem is not you not wanting to drink, or why you don&#8217;t want to drink. The problem is people hearing &#8220;no thanks&#8221; and taking that as the opening stage in a negotiation. And I think it is good for everyone to recognize when that is happening and have strategies for shutting the conversation down.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not weird for not drinking. They are weird for taking &#8220;I don&#8217;t drink&#8221; as an invitation to sell you on drinking.<strong> Analogous</strong>: Someone is not weird for being a vegetarian, or having celiac disease, or being a vegetarian with celiac disease. The person who hears &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m a vegetarian and I have celiac</em>&#8221; and responds with &#8220;<em>But have you <strong>tried</strong> this sandwich of ground animal parts on a whole wheat bun? I think it&#8217;s really going to change your whole outlook on things!</em>&#8221; is committing a massive, massive faux pas. And that faux pas is <strong>coercion. </strong>Which we need less of, both <a title="Hiatus, Holiday Open Thread, &amp; #389: Friendly Social Coercion is Still Coercion" href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/10/23/hiatus-holiday-open-thread-389-friendly-social-coercion-is-still-coercion/">generally</a> and <a title="#398: I’m tired of explaining my medical condition and food choices to “helpful” folks." href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/11/25/398-im-tired-of-explaining-my-medical-condition-to-helpful-folks/">around food/drink specifically</a>. Whenever someone behaves like that, I wonder, are they really THAT insecure about what they like? If the people in your life love drinking so much, they can do it without your validation or participation. <strong>Someone making a different choice than you would make is not invalidating your choices. </strong></p>
<p>Now, your friends and family should know that you don&#8217;t drink, and they should be respectful about that. Which means, warning you if something has alcohol in it, and not making you explain yourself about it, or, if someone is badgering you about it they should also step in and say &#8220;<em>Yeah, she doesn&#8217;t drink. So, howabout (subject change)?</em>&#8221; as well. If they make fun of you or shame you, shut it down, not because you should drink but because people shaming you about choices that have nothing to do with them is shitty. <strong><br />

<p>Sorry for the light posting. My students are all in the middle of making films, so my job is pretty busy right now, and I took on an additional super-cool project. If you&#8217;re in Chicago, come see <a title="Goodman Theatre By The Way, Meet Vera Stark" href="http://www.goodmantheatre.org/season/by-the-way-meet-vera-stark/" target="_blank">By The Way, Meet Vera Stark</a> at the Goodman Theatre this spring. It&#8217;s a play about the African American actresses who played maids in Hollywood in the 1930s, written by Pulitzer-prize winning playwright <a title="Lynn Nottage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Nottage" target="_blank">Lynn Nottage</a>. I&#8217;m line-producing  and working as the First Assistant Director for the film-within-the-play that opens the second act.</p>
<p>My colleague <a title="Vaun Monroe: Reel Soul" href="http://www.indiewire.com/feature/reel-soul-vaun-monroe" target="_blank">Vaun Monroe </a>is directing, and we&#8217;re collaborating with the Goodman&#8217;s amazing cast and crew of designers and set builders and props people. We&#8217;re shooting black &amp; white, 35mm film in the style of 1930s melodramas like <a title="Jezebel Trailer" href="http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/72819/Jezebel-Re-issue-Trailer-.html" target="_blank">Jezebel</a>* or <a title="The Flame of New Orleans" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033606/" target="_blank">The Flame of New Orleans </a>(We have a film historian on our crew &#8211; How awesome is that? &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure our <a title="Brian Levin" href="http://www.brian-levin.com/" target="_blank">cinematographer</a> said something about using <a title="diffusion filters" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fR--7yVROI4C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=pantyhose+cinematography+diffusion+filters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rnkcb8fSux&amp;sig=TdU9nVpVJypMsA73crSnOg8nqvg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WRJCUfPkEMWzygGSk4C4Ag&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=pantyhose%20cinematography%20diffusion%20filters&amp;f=false" target="_blank">pantyhose filters</a> to get <a title="Marlene Dietrich" href="http://www.doctormacro.com/Images/Dietrich,%20Marlene/Annex/NRFPT/Annex%20-%20Dietrich,%20Marlene_NRFPT_37.jpg" target="_blank">1930s glamour closeups</a>).</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a line producer or a 1st AD does, I make the budget and the schedule, recruit the crew, negotiate costs for rentals, make the contracts, manage the money, and on the day of the shoot I make sure everything happens on schedule and all of the paperwork is filled out. Chief problem-solver and get-shit-done person, basically, or, the person who translates the stuff the creative team says at meetings into to-do lists, or, the person who must always keep her cell phone on. It&#8217;s a great honor to be involved in the project, and I love the script and the work. But it&#8217;s not a writerly mode of existence, for sure.</p>
<p>Commander Logic also has her hands full&#8230;<strong>with a new baby</strong>! That&#8217;s kind of a way bigger deal than a short movie, but I have not met said baby yet so do not have a 200 word synopsis of said baby ready to go.<a title="Commander Logic made a person" href="https://twitter.com/cdrLogic/status/310149410698981378"> From what I gather from the Twitter</a>, &#8220;sleepy&#8221; and &#8220;small for a human, large for a baby&#8221; are what we have going on.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make this an open thread. Seen any good movies lately? Have a question for the commentariat?</p>
<p><strong>Edited to Add:</strong> Are you working on anything cool we should know about?  Based on a comment in the thread, I&#8217;m deciding to allow self-promotion of blogs/creative projects/crowdfunding/Etsy stores<strong> in this thread only, by regular readers only </strong>with a few caveats. Spam will still be deleted. If you never comment here but are de-lurking just to self-promote for commercial purposes, maybe refrain. Please don&#8217;t just post links without descriptions &#8211; introduce us to the work and let us know what we&#8217;ll find at the link, give content notes. Definitely warn if it&#8217;s NSFW.</p>
<p>A lot of us make art, and if we do this right it could be a cool repository of the art this community makes.</p>
<p>*ALL of Bette Davis&#8217;s reactions need to be animated .gifs. All of them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>I&#8217;m in grad school for creative writing. It&#8217;s hard. Right now, I&#8217;m taking three classes, which means that I&#8217;m reading 500-plus pages a week, in addition to commenting on my classmates&#8217; writing and producing a poem every week. Plus, I&#8217;m teaching a basic composition course for struggling writers, and a literature course (for the first time ever), so I&#8217;m writing lesson plans and grading essays for nearly 60 students. AND I work ten hours a week to supplement my stipend enough to buy things like toiletries, books and the occasional beer on a Friday night. Also, I need to clean my apartment and do laundry and run errands sometimes. And in addition to all of THAT, I&#8217;m expected to participate in meetings, go to outside lectures, and attend all the readings by my classmates and visiting writers. And I WANT to, because oh my god I love school. School is the best thing ever. I work my ass off and I LOVE IT. This is not really about grad school.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_5302" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/millay_magn.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5302" alt="Millay" src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/millay_magn.jpg?w=250&#038;h=300" width="250" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What people think an MFA is like.</p></div>
<p><em>Except it kind of is. I have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which causes, among other things, crushing migraines and extreme fatigue. And there&#8217;s no cure for it, because ovaries, ew. Mostly, I manage. But there are days when I can barely drag myself around, and did I mention all the stuff I&#8217;m supposed to be doing? Sometimes I can&#8217;t do it all. Sometimes my whole body feels like a bag of wet sand that I&#8217;m not strong enough to lift. Sometimes I have to lie down and rest before I die. So I miss the reading, or the lecture, or the lunch meeting.</em></p>
<p><em><span id="more-5297"></span>I apologized to a friend for missing her reading, and she ranted about how much it sucks that people don&#8217;t go to stuff. And the professors who went to everything and did everything and walked uphill in the snow both ways while carrying their dissertation on their backs give us VERY SERIOUS TALKS on why we must do everything. They mean well, but it hurts me. There&#8217;s a kind of gleeful masochism in grad school where being overworked and sleep-deprived is a point of pride. Long story short, I feel guilty, but also mad.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t go around telling people about my health, because it&#8217;s personal. But I&#8217;ve built up a reputation as someone who&#8217;s dedicated and hardworking, and I&#8217;d hate to think people assume that I just can&#8217;t be bothered to show up to things. Do I woman up and tell people about my defective gonads? Tell them to fuck off? How do I balance my health needs with my need to be a good grad student?</em></p>
<p><em>Signed,</em></p>
<p><em>My Candle Burns at Both its Ends</em></p>
<p>Dear Lovely Light-Giver,</p>
<p>Sweet Machine, fellow MFA-survivor and chronic migraineur, reporting for duty. I have so much to say to you that I am not sure I know how to say it, but let me start by declaring, in the sincerest way, I KNOW THAT FEEL BRO</p>
<p>It sounds like you have your medical situation taken care of, in terms of having doctors and knowing your stuff, so I am going to ask one question and then shush: do you see a neurologist for your migraines? Even if you&#8217;re managing your PCOS through a ladybits doctor, a headache specialist might help. It took a while, but I have gone from basically having 3-4 migraine days a week to having maybe 1 (and some milder headache days), with the help of Big Pharma and my neurologist. Now that I&#8217;ve got that tidbit out of the way, I&#8217;m going to ask the Awkward Army to<strong> kindly refrain from making &#8220;have you tried this&#8221; suggestions in comments</strong>. There are two reasons: 1) That&#8217;s not what this letter is about, and 2) People with chronic illnesses or medical conditions usually <em>have </em>tried everything you can suggest. (See also: saying to fat people &#8220;Have you tried diet and exercise?&#8221; WHY YES. YES I HAVE. THANK YOU, DR OZ.)</p>
<div id="attachment_5301" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rutgerhauer.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5301" alt="Grad school." src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rutgerhauer.jpg?w=300&#038;h=134" width="300" height="134" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What an MFA is really like.</p></div>
<p>So here is the thing about grad school, which I have completed (oh god) eight years of. Grad school is a black hole of selfhood. Grad school is a monster that wants to take every shred of your time and your identity and your well-being and store those shreds in a place you can&#8217;t access. Grad school will, if you let it, become your whole life and then demand more like it&#8217;s young scary/sexy Rutger Hauer. Grad school does not want you to be a person; it wants you to be a body in a seat in a lecture/reading/office/library chair, and it never wants to let you go.</p>
<p>I personify grad school because it&#8217;s really not that any one person wants you to sacrifice your self and sanity for this experience. Your profs are concerned with making events worthwhile for visiting speakers and such; your friend is upset that she&#8217;s expected to go to all these readings but not everyone showed up for hers; your students think you live in your office and sleep at your desk and love, beyond all reckoning, to grade their shitty essays. Individually, it&#8217;s all a bit much but based on the right things: passion, community, fairness. In toto, it&#8217;s a godawful nightmare of stress, which, oh hey, is a huge migraine trigger. And this all goes double for an arts degree, because it is Your Art and Your Passion and You Are So Lucky To Get To Do This and You Should Be Grateful.</p>
<p>Now, most grad students would really, really, really benefit from some kind of artificially enforced boundary that says &#8220;you get to stop working now [at 8:00 every night/on Saturdays/when it's time to watch more Buffy].&#8221; But you have an actually enforced boundary: your body&#8217;s needs. You have a chronic medical condition that, while manageable, means you need rest. This is a fact. Your body and your brain both need down time in order to function, and if you don&#8217;t take that time they will fucking well let you know about it. This is not you being lazy or weak or fragile; this is you having a trick knee and needing to take the elevator sometimes when you&#8217;d rather take the stairs. The secret is that <em>everyone </em>needs to take the elevator sometimes, but for people without a chronic illness, it&#8217;s usually a more visible situation: I broke my leg skiing and I need the elevator till the cast is off. For <a title="But you don't look sick" href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/" target="_blank">chronic and invisible illnesses</a>, you need the elevator sometimes and no one but you knows why.</p>
<p>You say you&#8217;ve developed a reputation for being dedicated and hardworking, but you don&#8217;t sound like you believe it. I&#8217;d suggest that you start by trying to believe it! Start with that assumption and work forward. Think about yourself with the same kindness which you bestow on your friends and colleagues. If someone doesn&#8217;t come to a reading, is your first thought &#8220;What a dick,&#8221; or is your first thought, &#8220;Oh, I hope he doesn&#8217;t have the flu that&#8217;s going around&#8221;? Assume everyone is working on assumption #2. Now let&#8217;s think about specifics: your school probably has a disability services office of some kind. You may not think of your condition as a disability, which is fine, but the people who work there may be able to talk you through university policy about absences/substitute teachers/disclosure of information and the like. As for individual professors you work with, there are a few options. You are under <em>no obligation</em> to discuss your gonads, as you put it. But if you have a sympathetic advisor, you might tell them that you have a medical condition that means you get frequent migraines and need to rest regularly as part of your health management. You may find that people are more sympathetic than you expect. (My own version of this has kind of an epic back story involving ER trips and brain scans, but the short version is I didn&#8217;t know my constant headaches were migraines until a couple of years ago; I just thought I was a fucking wuss. When I got a proper diagnosis and realized that my &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s Wednesday&#8221; headache was most people&#8217;s &#8220;I might be having a stroke&#8221; headache, I felt way way better about saying &#8220;Hey, I have to rest today&#8221; and taking care of myself.) Of course, the simpler option is simply to say &#8220;I&#8217;m sick&#8221; when you need to skip something; it happens, everyone gets sick, and much as the black hole monster of grad school wants to deny it, you actually do get to stay home and rest when you&#8217;re sick.</p>
<p>I am rambling because I feel so passionately about this &#8212; the &#8220;gleeful masochism&#8221; of academia is in fact a profoundly ableist cultural norm. You can do grad school and practice your art and your craft and teach struggling students how to write without sacrificing yourself on the altar of Unstoppable Grad Student Who Can Do It All. You get to have a private life. You get to have a fallible body. You get to be an adult human being who can tell another adult human being, &#8220;I am sorry that I cannot attend this lecture, as I&#8217;m sick today.&#8221; You get to do all that and you still get to be a poet.</p>

<p><em>Dear Captain Awkward:</em></p>
<p><em>My boyfriend and I are in our mid-twenties and have been together for about half a year. He treats me well, takes an interest in what I do and enjoy and is generally a good boyfriend. We have a lot of similar characteristics and the same silly sense of humor. When we first got together it was supposed to be a casual thing, but it ended up escalating into something more serious almost immediately. Right now we are together almost five days of the week and almost never go out alone. We sleep in a tangled pile. We are comfortable with just being in the same room doing our own thing. I have never pressured him into anything and neither has he, everything just happened. It feels SO nice and natural. He seems to enjoy it too.</em></p>
<p><em> I am developing some Serious Feelings for him and I can definitely imagine a future with this man, but I am not sure about what he wants from our relationship. I would definitely want to be with someone who wants to have a family and this is not something up for compromise. My problem is that both him and I are absolutely terrible at talking about emotional things. I even have trouble saying „I like you“ out loud, asking „where do you see this relationship going“ is something I feel is beyond me. I’ve tried to find a good moment to force myself to bring up this topic with him, but can’t seem to find one (or I can’t make myself to open my mouth). I’m also afraid that he will not be able to answer my questions for the same reasons (I know I’d have trouble with it). I don’t want to lose him and yet I don’t want to waste my time in a relationship that will not lead anywhere. </em></p>
<p><em> So I guess my question is, how do I get over this unnatural fear I have of talking about my feelings/relationship goals? Suppose I get over it, how do I make the conversation comfortable enough for him? Do you think it’s viable if we’re both funny the same way?</em></p>
<p><em>Miss Wordless</em></p>

<div id="attachment_5286" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/letsdothisbinder.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5286" alt="Ann Perkins holds a binder with &quot;Let's Do This&quot; and a picture of a happy uterus." src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/letsdothisbinder.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not everyone appreciates the &#8220;I made you this binder of feelings &amp; reasons&#8221; approach.</p></div>
<p>Dear Miss Wordless:</p>
<p>If you are happy, you are not &#8220;wasting time&#8221; in a relationship that &#8220;will not lead anywhere.&#8221; You are learning to be in a relationship and enjoy the day to day of getting a lot of your needs met by someone cool and nifty who likes you and likes spending time with you. That ain&#8217;t nothing, and you should not feel guilty about enjoying yourself for as long as you are enjoying yourself. There is no one right way to be in a relationship, and if the two of you like to keep it light and seem to have similar styles of communication and humor, that can be great.</p>
<p>Being funny (and funny together) is really important and a great way of connecting. But if you&#8217;re going to be with someone your whole life and really do that whole in sickness and in health, for richer or for poorer, through illness and births and death and all the stresses and joys of living every part of this complex and amazing life you&#8217;ve been given, you will need more than funny.</p>
<p>Dark times come to us all. If you are very, very lucky, when you reach those dark times you will have someone who loves you to hold your hand and <a title="#190: The Sandwich Means “I Love You”: A Valentine." href="http://captainawkward.com/2012/02/13/190-the-sandwich-means-i-love-you-a-valentine/" target="_blank">wrap you in their love and support</a>, and remind you of your own worth. This love doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily come from a romantic partner to be real and true. Sometimes love is a sandwich. Sometimes it&#8217;s killing the giant bug that crawled out of a crack in the ceiling. Sometimes the toilet in the place you&#8217;re staying in on vacation is backed up, and love means driving you to a safe pooping sanctuary. B<a title="On vulnerability" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html" target="_blank">eing vulnerable</a> is scary and hard sometimes. It carries risk of rejection. But it&#8217;s the only way that we can we connect with each other beyond the surface level and reap all the rewards of being truly seen and truly seeing someone else&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>Fortunately you don&#8217;t have to lay out all of your thoughts/feelings/hopes/dreams at once. You don&#8217;t have to go right into deep heartfelt talks about THE FUTURE. Relationships don&#8217;t have to feel &#8220;intense&#8221; to be true and important and truly loving. You can use this relationship that is working and where you get along very well and spend all your time together to practice being vulnerable a little at a time and see what happens.</p>
<p>I think one thing that will help you learn to let your feelings cross the brain-mouth barrier is to practice being present in the moment and saying what&#8217;s on your mind in the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I think I might love you but I don&#8217;t want to say so in case you don&#8217;t want a family or see us having a permanent future together</em>&#8221; is a lot for anyone to unpack in a relationship where you haven&#8217;t talked about feelings before. NOTHING is wrong with having any or all of those feelings, and you don&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t have to make your feelings smaller or more convenient in order to be with someone. But there is a lot of pressure and anxiety tied up in expressing them all at once and with such a strong future-emphasis. So start small, and start in the present, and start with expressing true thoughts and feelings you are having in a way that does not put pressure on the other person to feel any particular thing themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<em>I am glad you came over tonight.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Thank you for making dinner.&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;I love sleeping next to you.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>&#8220;<em>I am feeling very happy right now.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>&#8220;<em>That feels really good.</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>That doesn&#8217;t feel good, can we stop?</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>I feel sad.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>&#8220;<em>I feel nervous.</em>&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>See what reactions you get. Does he smile? Does he reciprocate? Does he open up a bit? Does he make you feel glad and comfortable that you said something about how you were feeling? Then things are good.</p>
<p>Maybe next you can practice asking for specific things.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;<em>Will you rub my back?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Can you make dinner tonight?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Can we do (that sex thing I like)?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Is there&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to do today?</em>&#8220;</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>Does this feel good?</em>&#8220;</li>
<li><em>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a night to myself to catch up on reading. Can we talk tomorrow instead?&#8221;</em></li>
<li><em>&#8220;Will you be my date to x event?&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Practice being honest about your feelings about what is happening <strong>now</strong> and checking in about his. Start with low-stakes, true things.</p>
<p>You say &#8220;we spend five days of the week together and almost never go out alone.&#8221; So one other suggestion I have to make things feel a bit less risky is that you do something to get back in touch with your solo life &#8211; spend a little solo time with your friends, make sure you do a hobby or art or sport or working at a goal that is yours alone and that brings you in touch with other people. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s winter where you live, but I do know how tempting it is to curl up in the bundle of two and not motivate to go out and do things with others. That can be so great and comfortable, but right now if you&#8217;re feeling uncertain about relationship stuff s it can be good to get back in touch with the fact that a lot of people like you and want you to be happy.</p>
<p>These are the most basic baby steps, and I can&#8217;t script out your whole story for you. Maybe you have another year ahead of you before you can say &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m in love with you&#8221;</em> or blurt out &#8220;<em>I want to have kids and I am hoping you want to have kids with me and that we can do that together</em>&#8221; after an episode of Parks &amp; Rec. This is a good news/bad news situation &#8211; until you&#8217;re comfortable enough to talk about having kids with the purported father of those kids, you&#8217;re not ready to have kids.</p>
<p>I want to leave you with three thoughts.</p>
<p>1) There is no way to know ahead of time what someone else thinks and feels and wants. There is no code for figuring it out and therefore guarantee that they will be on the same page as you before you speak up. Despite an entire magazine industry devoted to &#8220;Top Signs He&#8217;s Ready To Commit&#8221; written by <a title="Marie Claire’s Rich tells you how to keep a guy’s attention." href="http://captainawkward.com/2011/09/11/marie-claires-rich-tells-you-how-to-keep-a-guys-attention/" target="_blank">people who have degrees in preserving the status quo from Dipshit University</a>, the tools you have at your disposal for sussing out another adult&#8217;s plans, hopes, and feelings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saying what you want and seeing how they respond.</li>
<li>Asking what they think and seeing what they say.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your question, and its mention of &#8220;sleeping in a tangled pile&#8221; (lovely image, by the way) and asking if I think it&#8217;s viable because your senses of humor match was a little bit about asking for top! signs! this will work out! I mean, yeah, it sounds like the guy is into being in your company, and &#8220;actions speak louder than words,&#8221; but I think it&#8217;s okay to want the words, too. (See .gif, below).</p>
<p>2) If you are a lady, that does not means that you have to do all the work of figuring out feelings and the future. You are not this guy&#8217;s FeelingsTutor. You&#8217;re the one who wrote, so probably you will be the one to start saying things like &#8220;I really like you.&#8221; If he&#8217;s a good guy and into you, he will make it very safe and comfortable to trust him with those things, and he will say stuff back, even if it&#8217;s hard for him, too. If you start opening up and suddenly feel like you&#8217;re dating a Michael Cera character (like an onion, with each layer made of more Michael Cera) who only has one emotional mode, abort!</p>
<p><a href="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ben-leslie-proposal.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5287" alt="Parks and Rec's Ben proposing to Leslie by saying &quot;I am deeply, ridiculously in love with you.&quot;" src="http://captainawkwarddotcom.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ben-leslie-proposal.gif?w=300&#038;h=168" width="300" height="168" /></a>3) If you really know that you want to have kids someday, you gotta speak up about it sometime. Whatever that heart&#8217;s desire is &#8211; if it&#8217;s to live on a boat for a while or move to Finland or start a theater company or go back to school &#8211; you have to be able to say it out loud to the people who you want to really know you.</p>
<p>By saying it out loud*, you do take a risk. You risk that people will laugh at you, or not be on board. You risk that this person right in front of you will not be on Team You while you go after the things you want. You risk pain and disappointment.</p>
<p>By NOT saying it loud, you also risk never, ever getting what you want. Not because some evil nemesis put their evil boot down on your neck and stood in your way, but because you stayed silent, the people around you never knew what you wanted, and you never gave them a chance to actually be on your side or walk away from your side. And then time happened. Your silence + time + fear came in and stole your dreams from you, and then it was too late.</p>
<p>Every good thing that ever happens to us because someone said &#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s try it.&#8221; There is no love without courage, so be of good courage. Take your faults and walk into Camazotz. Take your passion and make it happen. Say &#8220;<em>I really care about you and want you to stay in my life</em>&#8221; to your boyfriend, and see what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*can mean voice, text, email, letter, skywriting, or any form of expression.</p>
