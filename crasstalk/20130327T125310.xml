				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we heard the oral arguments for CA&#8217;s Prop 8 which audio of can be found <a href="https://soundcloud.com/afer-3/oral-argument-at-the-supreme">here</a> and a transcript <a href="http://www.npr.org/2013/03/26/175351429/audio-supreme-court-arguments-on-california-gay-marriage-ban">here</a>. I would write a recap, but I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that 1) I suck at translating legal jargon into actual English and 2) I don&#8217;t want to get something wrong.<span id="more-122644"></span></p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re getting the DOMA or Defense of Marriage Amendment oral arguments. Background of which can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_marriage_act">here</a>.</p>
<p>So many questions that I know you, my fellow Crassers have the answers to, so rather than flood the regular Open Thread with predictions and comments, let’s use this one for today.  Post links to whatever live feeds you are listening to.  GIFS and photos more than welcome.</p>

<p>Ok, folks. Here we go. The second-to-last Smash live blog. I love to hate watch this show, but not enough to stay home on Saturday night to watch it live. This episode is called &#8220;The Bells and Whistles.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s about Gay Kyle and Jimmy Who joining a boys choir. Or begging for change on the street. Or aliens. Hell, it&#8217;s probably all three.</p>
<p>See ya in the comments!<span id="more-122650"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two absolute truths to life lately;</p>
<p>1. The newest episode of Doctor Who premieres Saturday night on BBC America here in the states.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m kind of obsessed.</p>
<p>The Doctor has run across some pretty badass friends in his adventures. Here are some that never got to travel with him in the TARDIS, but made a major impact anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Caution: Spoilers in the reply.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-122520"></span></p>
<p>And because I&#8217;m working on a limited schedule, here are my picks for best almost-companions in almost chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>1. Harriet Jones; MP, Flydale North/British Prime Minister</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episodes: </strong>Aliens of London/World War Three; The Christmas Invasion; The Stolen Earth/Journey&#8217;s End</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Harriett-Jones.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122582" alt="Harriett Jones" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Harriett-Jones-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a> Ms. Jones&#8217; proved to be quite the BAMF in her three-episode arc. Her confidence, fierce dedication to the British people, and fearless leadership gained her the trust and respect of The Doctor, as well as a landslide victory in the election for Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Those same qualities later resulted in The Doctor planting the seed for a vote of no confidence against her in the British Parliament, leading to the election of Harold Saxon (oops).</p>
<p>In her third and final episode however, she redeemed herself, with tragic consequences. Rest in Peace Prime Minister, your commitment to crown and country was truly something to be admired. And, quite possibly a little underestimated by The Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>2. Nancy</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episodes: </strong>The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances</span></em></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" style="line-height: 1.5em;" alt="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lv6ox36RSe1r5ck5bo1_500.png" width="500" height="282" /></p>
<p>Nancy. Oh, Nancy. A young mother figure to around a dozen orphans during the blitz in London during WWII, she was haunted/stalked by a little boy in a gas mask who turned out to be her closest and only living relative.</p>
<p>Her episode is also responsible for my irrational fear of gas masks. However, The Doctor would was now a better Time Lord for having met the sweet soul known as Nancy, and is to date one of the most sweetest, most delightful endings ever in a Doctor Who episode.</p>
<p><strong>3. Madame de Pompadour</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>The Girl in the Fireplace</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Reinette1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122585" alt="Reinette" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Reinette1-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a> Despite travelling with Rose, Mickey, and some wicked love triangle action, The Doctor has either an incredibly short, or extremely long romance with France&#8217;s Madame de Pompadour, depending on whose perspective you have.</p>
<p>Beautiful, talented, and in possession of the ability to rock a corset, Reinette wins The Doctor&#8217;s heart while being stalked by strange clockwork people. In the end, she leaves him a heart-wrenching love letter, breaking hearts across space and time. Or, possibly just in my living room. Bonus points for inspiring The Doctor to ride a horse through a giant mirror.</p>
<p><strong>4. Tallulah (and Laslow)</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episodes: </strong>Daleks in Manhattan &amp; Evolution of the Daleks</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_122586" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tallulah.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122586" alt="Tallulah" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tallulah-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Three &#8216;L&#8217;s and an &#8216;H&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The quintessential 1930&#8242;s New York showgirl, Tallulah may have come off as a bimbo, but helped find a key piece of information in the blueprints for the in-progress Empire State Building, helped save mankind from becoming Dalek-people, helped to save her true love, Laszlo, even though he was turned into a freakish pig-man by the Daleks. Despite his disturbing appearance (complete with bottom fangs), Tallulah gives up the glam life to live with him in Hooverville, the makeshift community for down-on-their-luck victims of the great depression. Good on you, Tallulah &#8211; not everyone would give up everything to live in a tent with a guy who I can almost guarantee snores.</p>
<div id="attachment_122587" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Frank.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122587" alt="We'll throw him a bone on this one." src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Frank-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;ll throw him a bone on this one.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Honorable Mention</em>: Frank, because Andrew Garfield</p>
<p><strong>5. Sally Sparrow</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>Blink</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_122588" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sally-Sparrow.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122588" alt="&quot;Sad is happy for deep people&quot;" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sally-Sparrow-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Sad is happy for deep people&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Is it wrong of me to wish a lack of Hollywood-grade success upon an actor? Because I think Carey Mulligan would have been better off as a recurring character on Doctor Who than Shia LeBouf&#8217;s love interest in <em>Wall Street 2: Money Never Sleeps</em>. Come on, Carey, think of the Whovians.</p>
<p>Okay, <em>fine</em>, she&#8217;s done well, and that&#8217;s great, but Sally Sparrow was a great character in <strong><em>one of</em></strong> the best Doctor Who episodes to date, and despite the serious shortage of The Doctor and Martha Jones, still embodied the characteristics The Doctor looks for in a good companion. Also, she kept going back to Wester Drumlins, even <i>after</i> finding out about the whole displacement-in-time thing, to find out what was truly going on, and ultimately saved The Doctor and Martha, leaving everyone wanting more of Sally Sparrow.</p>
<p>Plus, she lost both her best friend and Billy Shipton who was probably going to be a hot date, until the angels got to him.</p>
<div id="attachment_122589" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Billy-Shipton.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122589" alt="Hey Doctor, give Billy a ride back with you. Please?" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Billy-Shipton-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hey Doctor, give Billy a ride back with you. Please?</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Astrid Peth</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>Voyage of the Damned<br />
</span></em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122590" alt="Astrid Peth" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Astrid-Peth-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /> Yes, we know Kylie Minogue has more glittery, dance-fueled shows to perform than she knows what to do with, but did Astrid really have to sacrifice herself? Couldn&#8217;t she have jumped out of the forklift before it went over the cliff?</p>
<p>Alas, it&#8217;s not surprising that Astrid was a one-time character, but it would have been nice to let The Doctor keep this one for a few more adventures.</p>
<p><strong>7. Liz 10</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>The Beast Below</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_122591" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Liz-10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122591" alt="&quot;Basically, I rule.&quot;" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Liz-10-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Basically, I rule.&#8221;</p></div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Queen Elizabeth X was one of the first people to meet the Eleventh Doctor, but made it known stories about him had been handed down for generations. She also fiercely guarded the subjects of Starship UK, and had some of the best one-liners in Doctor Who history. (ex: &#8220;&#8221;Mysterious stranger. M.O. consistent with higher alien intelligence. Hair of an idiot.&#8221;")</span></p>
<p>Granted, she returned for under a minute in the Season 5 finale, but it still didn&#8217;t feel like enough. Maybe in future episodes&#8230; please?</p>
<p><strong>8. Vincent van Gogh</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>Vincent and the Doctor</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Van-Gogh.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122592" alt="Van Gogh" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Van-Gogh-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a> Oh Vincent. Such a beautiful, tortured soul. His episode was one of beauty and pain &#8211; and the hope against hope that Amy and The Doctor could have saved him. However, anyone with any sort of working knowledge of history knows that Vincent van Gogh committed suicide, but if only he could have had a few more good days, travelling through space and time, we might in the tiniest of ways have felt better about his tragic end. Wasn&#8217;t his reaction in the art gallery priceless though? Hopefully there&#8217;s a parallel universe in which that all really happened. Also, thank you Bill Nighy for the beautiful delivery of the curator&#8217;s opinion of Vincent van Gogh.</p>
<p>He and Amy really would have had the most ginger babies in the universe too.</p>
<p><strong>9. Canton Everett Delaware III</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episodes: </strong>The Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Canton-Everett-Delaware.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122593" alt="Canton Everett Delaware" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Canton-Everett-Delaware-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a> Because, Mark Sheppard. Well, and his character was pretty bad-ass, and was involved in quite a convoluted plot, keeping his dry humor intact. Will he come back before the time he comes back at the beginning of the first episode of Season 6 when he was an old man? Yes, you read that right.</p>
<dl class="wp-caption alignnone" id="" style="width: 490px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"></dt>
</dl>
<p><strong>9. Rita</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>The God Complex</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Rita-and-The-Doctor.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122594" alt="Rita and The Doctor" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Rita-and-The-Doctor-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a> Let&#8217;s be honest, when The Doctor told Amy she was fired because he wanted to take Rita with him. we were kind of pulling for a way to make it happen. Both Amy and Rita in the TARDIS? It could work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Rita was lost to the Minotaur, and The Doctor came to realize he would eventually come to lose Amy and Rory too, leading him to drop them off at the new house he got them, making us wonder if they&#8217;d ever reunite.</p>
<p><strong>10. Madge</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episode: </strong>The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Madge-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122595" alt="Madge 2" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Madge-2-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a>Madge, the widow of a WWI &#8211; era pilot spends much of the episode trying to conceal the death of their father to her two children in order for them to have a happy Christmas. The model of the ultimate in loving and protective mothers, Madge not only saves The Doctor, but rescues her two children, an entire forest, and most importantly to them, her husband.</p>
<p>As a bonus, she sends The Doctor back to Amy and Rory, making her nothing short of a heroine to basically everyone in the episode, and directly contributes to real actual tears from the thousand-year-old eyes of The Doctor, as well as the rest of us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Honorable Mention</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong><br />
<em><span style="line-height: 15.994318008422852px;"><strong>Episodes: </strong>Closing Time/The Lodger</span></em></p>
<div id="attachment_122596" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Craig.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-122596" alt="Also, Matt Smith in a towel." src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Craig-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Also, Matt Smith in a towel.</p></div>
<p>Craig, like many other companions, was thrown into his situation, but had zero idea what was going on until towards the end of the episode, but he was entertaining, totally in love with Sophie, and funny, which definitely counts for something. Plus, he and Eleven have an entertaining friendship we hope we get to see more of.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122602" alt="download-1" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-1.jpg" width="640" height="478" /></a>Port Chicago is one of those places that you pass by often on your way to work but never stop to think about. After living in the San Francisco Bay Area for almost two decades, I decided to visit it for the first time last week. It is the site of a World War II munitions explosion that killed 320 people, mostly black sailors. The aftermath caused America to examine its racism and helped integrate the military.</p>
<p><span id="more-122601"></span></p>
<p>During World War II, while white men fought in the front lines, <a href="http://karakullake.blogspot.com/2012/05/rosie-riveter-museum-vintage-photos-and.html" target="_blank">women worked in factories</a> and African-Americans got stuck with unglamorous jobs, such as loading munitions. Many black men from the South ended up joining the navy. Some were stationed in Port Chicago. Many were illiterate and could not even read the explosive warnings painted on the munitions. There was virtually no training and the heavy equipment was in various states of disrepair. Complaints were ignored.</p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122603" alt="download-11" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-11.jpg" width="640" height="478" /></a>In July 1944, a gargantuan explosion occurred at the port. Two 440-foot ships, sitting side-by-side, were being loaded with munitions delivered by railcars for the war in the Pacific. The explosion completely vaporized one of the ships. The other ship was thrown 500 yards away. Hotel windows in San Francisco, 35 miles away, cracked. Seismographs in Las Vegas detected the explosion. In fact, atomic scientists from New Mexico examined the carnage because they wanted to study what a small nuclear weapon was capable of destroying.</p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122604" alt="download-3" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-3.jpg" width="640" height="478" /></a>To add insult to injury, the black sailors were treated like second class citizens after the blast. Their white counterparts received 30-day leaves and were then assigned other duties. The black survivors received no leave and were immediately sent elsewhere to load more munitions. Black families who lost their sons and husbands received less in death benefits than the families of white sailors.</p>
<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-13.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122605" alt="download-13" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/download-13.jpg" width="640" height="478" /></a>Ultimately, 50 black seamen refused to work under these conditions and mutinied. They were handed sentences of eight to fifteen years. This act of civil disobedience, both on the basis of civil rights and worker rights, helped bring about the integration of the military.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So today and tomorrow the Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments on CA&#8217;s Prop 8 (Overturned in the 2010 case, <em>Perry v.

<p>Share your thoughts in this thread.  Will Scalia discuss his son the priest&#8217;s involvement in an <a href="http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/supreme-court-justice-scalias-son-was-chaplain-at-catholic-ex-gay-ministry/news/2012/12/13/56269">ex-gay ministry</a>?  Will Clarence Thomas talk?  What the the odds of a narrow decision? Will I finally get to pull the wedding binder off the shelf and go full on Groomzilla across New Orleans? Which talking heads on the news will make asses of themselves? And finally what will Marcia Coyle have to say on PBS&#8217; &#8220;The News Hour&#8221;? I&#8217;m throwing that last one in because the other half loves her.</p>
<p>So many questions that I know you, my fellow Crassers have the answers to, so rather than flood the regular Open Thread with predictions and comments, let&#8217;s use this one for the next two days.  Post links to whatever live feeds you are listening to.  GIFS and photos more than welcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Emo-4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-122413" alt="Emo-4" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Emo-4.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>Reading your old LiveJournal posts is way worse than looking at that picture of yourself as a freshman with a bad perm. Your words look into the truth of your little emo heart, that perm was just a bad decision that you&#8217;ll grow out of. Collected here are the anonymous journals of your youth brought forth from the depths of LiveJournal and Xanga. Instead of mashing them all together I&#8217;m going to string them out over a few posts.<span id="more-122422"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>October 22, 2005</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come to the realization lately that we don&#8217;t fall in love. It&#8217;s more of a surrender to love than anything. People are not perfect. And part of the surrender is to realize that the person you are in love with is not perfect, but you love them anyway. We all have fairy-tale visions of the person we will fall in love with; we all have ideas of what we thought would make it impossible to love someone. But somehow, when you meet the right person, those things cease to matter. Although we cannot completely disregard our morals and our principles, love is a matter of give and take. A matter of compromise. Even if you swore up and down you could never love someone who doesn&#8217;t understand your deep love for crocheting covers for tissue boxes, sometimes the right person comes along. And sometimes that person believes that the box the Kleenex company used was fine and there is no need for another cover of any kind.</p>
<p>We may try to judge the love between two people, we may say that we have no idea how they work together. But until you have loved someone enough to say that you would do anything for them and meant it, you cannot understand.</p>
<p>Love can turn dangerous. Anyone who loves you will not try to control you, will not try to get you to bend to their every whim. Anyone who loves you with even one small tiny fraction of their heart will let you go off into the world to do as you please and welcome you with open arms when you come back. Anyone who loves you will want only your happiness, and will not try to limit your happiness in any capacity.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that we cannot try to help those we love to improve. Anyone who loves you will try to rid the world of any factor that may keep you from being the best you can be. But on the other side, anyone who loves you must sometimes realize that there is no changing you. That you are too happy (or too stubborn) to try to change. And true love will let that go.</p>
<p>When we surrender to love we forget all reason. Time seems to suddenly stand still and no longer are we living for tomorrow, but we are standing in the moment and we do not want that moment to end. The moment of a perfect kiss. The moment right before &#8220;I love you&#8221;. Happy moments, sad ones. We avoid tomorrow, shy away from it, in fear that as tomorrow takes away today it may also take away the wonder and magic we have suddenly found in the world.</p>
<p>True love may end, true love may be slow in coming. But during the time it is true and the time it is pure, true love does not falter, does not waver, is not questioned. It simply&#8230;is.<br />
And it is the greatest joy of the human heart.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is love?<br />
Oh baby, don&#8217;t hurt me<br />
Don&#8217;t hurt me no more<br />
Oh, baby don&#8217;t hurt me<br />
Don&#8217;t hurt me no more</p>
<p>What is love?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first week of the 2013 NCAA Men&#8217;s Basketball Tournament is in the books, and the Sweet Sixteen is set. For those of you that missed the action, here&#8217;s a recap of this weekend&#8217;s memorable moments, a preview of next weekend&#8217;s action, and an update on the Crasstalk Bracket Funderdome Challenge.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let us all recognize the efforts of the NIT 16-seed Robert Morris Colonials in bouncing the NIT 1-seed Kentucky Wildcats last Tuesday. Godspeed, Colonials.<span id="more-122537"></span></p>
<p>Starting with the South Region, the big story of the tournament so far is the emergence of Florida Gulf Coast University, who upset 2-seed Georgetown in the Round of 64 on Friday. The Eagles certainly live up to their name, featuring an immensely entertaining, high-flying offense that seems to openly flaunt the laws of physics. The FGCU Eagles went on to prove they&#8217;re not a fluke, smacking around the 7-seed San Diego State Aztecs in the Round of 32 on Sunday, earning a trip to the Sweet Sixteen. The Eagles are the first 15-seed to make it out of the first weekend in Tournament history.</p>
<p>11-seed Minnesota smacked around 6-seed UCLA in the Round of 64 before getting bounced by 3-seed Florida in the Round of 32, thus validating everyone&#8217;s &#8220;Obvious Upset As Soon As It Was Announced&#8221; pick.</p>
<p>The seemingly-annual &#8220;Roy Williams Revenge Game&#8221; was uneventful, with 1-seed Kansas beating 8-seed North Carolina in the Round of 32.</p>
<p>Moving to the Midwest Region, the Oregon <del>Nike Catalogs</del> Ducks upset 5-seed Oklahoma State in the Round of 64, then went on to upset 4-seed Saint Louis in the Round of 32. I thought the Ducks were underseeded, but I didn&#8217;t think they were THIS underseeded.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The West Region has been Upset City, with the 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 seeds all going down this weekend.</span></p>
<p>Gonzaga was the first 1-seed to go down, losing to 9-seed Wichita State in the Round of 32. What&#8217;s that, MonkeyBiz? Does this suggest that perhaps non-Power Six conference teams shouldn&#8217;t be given #1 or #2 seeds until a non-Power Six team wins a National Championship? Yes it does, Other MonkeyBiz. Yes it does.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Ole Miss upset Wisconsin in the Round of 64. This is only an upset in the sense that it&#8217;s a round or two earlier than the Bo Ryan-coached Badgers usually get bounced.</span></p>
<p>The 14th-seeded Harvard Crimson upset 3-seed New Mexico in the Round of 64. The New Mexico Lobos were a popular Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight pick, and an RPI favorite. The Crimson were promptly eliminated by 6-seed Arizona in the Round of 32, thus restoring balance to the universe and reminding everyone that RPI is awful.</p>
<p>13-seed La Salle beat 4-seed Kansas State in the Round of 64, then went on to eliminate 12-seed Ole Miss, winning a date with 9-seed Wichita State next weekend. 10-seed Iowa State smacked around 7-seed Notre Dame in the Round of 64, and gave 2-seed Ohio State a scare in the Round of 32 before being bounced on Aaron Craft&#8217;s virtually last second 3-pointer.</p>
<p>The East Region has been comparatively stable. 12-seed California upset 5-seed UNLV, and went on to lose to 4-seed Syracuse. 3-seed Marquette squeaked out wins versus 14-seed Davidson and 6-seed Butler, winning both games by a combined 3 points.</p>
<p>9-seed Temple upset 8-seed N.C. State, although calling it an upset is questionable. Temple went on to face 1-seed Indiana, where the Owls&#8217; Khalif Wyatt scored an astounding 31 points. Unfortunately for the Owls, three of Temple&#8217;s other starters went a combined 0-for-21, ultimately falling to Indiana in the final minute. After sinking the dagger 3-pointer, Indiana&#8217;s Victor Oladipo was overheard yelling at Owls guard Khalif Wyatt, saying &#8220;THIS ISN&#8217;T EVEN MY FINAL FORM!&#8221;. No further clarification from Hoosiers Coach Tom Crean is available, but Oladipo was sighted later, surrounded by an energy field, walking back to the team bus.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Next weekend&#8217;s games are going to be very interesting. The East and West Regions will play on Thursday, with the Midwest and South Regions playing on Friday.</span></p>
<p>First up, out of Washington, D.C. we have 3-seed Marquette taking on 2-seed Miami, and 1-seed Indiana taking on 4-seed Syracuse. Can Marquette keep their string of miracle wins alive? Can Miami silence it&#8217;s critics and make it to the Elite Eight? Can Indiana solve Syracuse&#8217;s zone defense? Can Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim avenge his 1987 National Championship loss to Indiana? Will this be the weekend Indiana basketball finally gives me a heart attack and/or brain aneurysm?</p>
<p><strong>Biz&#8217;s Picks: Indiana over Syracuse, Miami over Marquette, MonkeyBiz over Problem Ded</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Next up, out of Los Angeles, we have 9-seed Wichita State takes on 13-seed La Salle, and 6-seed Arizona versus 2-seed Ohio State. I know nothing about Wichita State and La Salle, other than Wichita is where Sports Illustrated&#8217;s Peter King likes to set hypothetical football games. Also too, Arizona and Ohio State are playing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Biz&#8217;s Picks: Wichita St. over La Salle, Ohio State over Arizona</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Midwest region is next, with 1-seed Louisville taking on 12-seed Oregon, and 2-seed Duke taking on 3-seed Michigan State. Between the Oregon <del>Nike Billboards</del> Ducks&#8217; well-known penchant as a testbed for Nike products and Louisville&#8217;s adoption of the Adidas &#8220;Adizero&#8221; (read: Zubaz) uniforms this postseason, I would highly recommend not watching the game as it may break your television and/or destroy your retinas. Meanwhile, the floor mops they use during games are currently being distributed to interns around the national sports media to handle the deluge of sportswriter slobber that&#8217;s about to inundate us all over Michigan State&#8217;s Tom Izzo and Duke&#8217;<span style="line-height: 16px;">s Mike Krzyzewski.</span></p>
<p><strong>Biz&#8217;s Picks: Louisville over Oregon, Michigan State over Duke, Zubaz over Good Taste, Sportswriter Slobber over Intern-Powered Court Mops</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the South Region will feature 1-seed Kansas versus 4-seed Michigan and 3-seed Florida versus 15-seed FGCU. If Michigan&#8217;s Trey Burke, Glenn Robinson III, and Tim Hardaway Jr. all show up, Michigan is going to roflstomp Kansas. Unfortunately for Michigan, they have a tendency to disappear from time to time, and the Jayhawks are too experienced to not take big advantage of it if they do. It&#8217;s fun to think about what could happen if FGCU beats Florida, but let&#8217;s be realistic: the Gators are gonna eat the Eagles alive. It&#8217;s not gonna be pretty. They&#8217;ll have to broadcast it with a Parental Advisory warning.</p>
<p><strong>Biz&#8217;s Picks: Michigan over Kansas, Florida and the Laws of Physics WAY over FGCU </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/acro-cats1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-122529" alt="acro-cats" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/acro-cats1.jpg" width="600" height="543" /></a><em>Hello and welcome to this installment of Theatre Notes with Botswana, where I take you inside the world of the staged drama and offer my own critical perspectives on the neo-modernist theater scene. </em></p>
<p>You may not be aware, but since the mid 1960s, there has been an alternative movement <del>afoot</del> a-paw in the theater. This new approach fought against all the conventional norms of the theater establishment. Norms like &#8220;you should use people, not cats, as actors&#8221; and &#8220;your actors should try to stay on the stage and not run underneath an audience member&#8217;s chair in the middle of the show&#8221; were suddenly under assault by these young and hungry insurgents of the New Felinists movement. <span id="more-122521"></span></p>
<p>Today this formerly fringe movement is now part of the mainstream. Human actors are now considered old wave and today&#8217;s stars of Broadway and off-Broadway (and off-off-off-off-Broadway) are paid in catnip treats. This trend parallels changes throughout our society, where the cat is now the dominant species of all internet-based media including videos, photos, gifs and Cat Fancy profile pieces. It&#8217;s a cat actor&#8217;s world &#8212; we&#8217;re just offering treats in it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no further proof of the ascendancy of the cat-based theater than <a href="http://www.circuscats.com/">The Acro-Cats&#8217; recent three day run in Atlanta</a>, where I was lucky enough to see the Acro-Cats live. And I do mean lucky &#8212; the titans of the Cat Stage sold out every show (prompting producers to add last-minute late shows over the weekend). The traditional distance between the avant-garde and the mainstream no longer exists. Art is dead. Death is art. Now please give the Mr. Buggles his salmon kitty treat before he claws our eyeballs out.</p>
<p>The Acro-Cats will shatter your preconceived notions about the dynamic space between the actor and the audience. For example at numerous times during the show, the cats exercise their free will as cats and suddenly bolt into the audience. Also, during the show I saw Sunday, the star Tuna decided to climb up a 15-foot ladder that was resting against a wall backstage. She spent most of the rest of the performance trying to figure out how to get down.</p>
<p>The Acro-Cats, for all their bluster, are no mere infantile revolutionaries of the stage. They are true professionals. They perform dozens of amazing tricks. They push shopping cars and roll balls across a rope and climb. And they fucking love climbing. Because they&#8217;re cats, goddammit. At one point the Acro-Cats actually compete in a game of bowling against a rather cute and smiley groundhog. This is the sort of inter-species recreational activity that would have scandalized audiences in a more conservative time, but in today&#8217;s rough and tumble cat theater world, audiences demand such innovation.</p>
<p>Does all this mean that I am ready to repudiate my past ideological assumptions about using cats as actors? Only so far as I must repudiate all theater movements that refuse to acknowledge the fact that cats can now do all forms of entertainment better than humans. A perfect example of this came during the show&#8217;s final act &#8212; a musical ensemble performance by &#8220;The Rock Cats.&#8221; The cats (plus one chicken named Gregory Peck) play all their own instruments. They refuse to bow to the simulacrum of today&#8217;s lip-synched, pre-fab pop music. Instead they play all their own instruments and weave a sound using dissonance and non-Western time signatures that reminds this critic of the visceral pleasures of Stockhausen and Glass. When the fluffy white kitty started playing the drums I felt I was ready to shuffle off this mortal coil.</p>
<p>So in conclusion&#8230; Cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats.</p>
