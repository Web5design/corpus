				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Emo-4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-122413" alt="Emo-4" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Emo-4.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>Reading your old LiveJournal posts is way worse than looking at that picture of yourself as a freshman with a bad perm. Your words look into the truth of your little emo heart, that perm was just a bad decision that you&#8217;ll grow out of. Collected here are the anonymous journals of your youth brought forth from the depths of LiveJournal and Xanga. Instead of mashing them all together I&#8217;m going to string them out over a few posts.<span id="more-122404"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, I hate my boyfriend&#8217;s ex/now BFF. I hate that she makes pie-eyes at him whenever they are together, I hate that they make secret little plans for dinner (and gods know how often because they are secret plans), I hate that she has slept with him, I really hate that she likes to remind me of this, I hate that she hugged me at Christmas, I hate that she is a vegetarian, I hate her hair because it looks dirty all the time, I hate that she smokes and encourages others to do so because she is too poor to buy her own cigarettes, I hate that I have to endure stories about how hard it is for her to buy clothes because it is just so impossible to find a size zero. I cannot think of a redeeming quality.</p>
<p>Sure, this all makes me sound like a jealous psycho girlfriend, but so what? There are things that can be done to mitigate my admittedly strong reactions. Like, oh, not making secret plans to spend time at each other’s houses. Oh, and not fucking touching me. And stop telling me about the damn vibrator that he bought you whenever it was that you were fucking. Because I cannot stand to hear that story one more time.</p>
<p>You know what the worst part is? I’ve actually brought all of this crap up. To real people, including the ones concerned, not just the internets. (Ok, not to her, I’d rather hug a live snake) And do you think anything has changed? No. Not one fucking iota.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems obvious that many of journal entries are about boyfriends and girlfriends, but this one gets to the heart of the issue of that whore of an ex girlfriend. You were never going to like her but does she have to be such a bitch about the fact that he still hangs around with her?</p>
<p>Sure, a more experienced person would just tell him that what he&#8217;s doing isn&#8217;t cool and you&#8217;d appreciate it if he&#8217;d put some distance between the two of them. But the online journals of your youth aren&#8217;t the place of people who have the emotional maturity to say something like that out loud to another human being, they&#8217;re about blind rage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/project-runway-26.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-117875" alt="project-runway-26" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/project-runway-26-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Last week, this show was rainin&#8217; men! The Thunder From Down Under, an Aussie male band of stripping brothers, showed up to have the remaining designers make some tear-away looks for them.</p>
<p>Children, the resulting looks were HOT MESSES, but no one was paying attention, as we were all ogling the man flesh parading around in front of us. I think someone got sent home, but for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember who.<span id="more-122378"></span></p>
<p>Tonight, the designers apparently get real (pissy) with each other. I miss the Thunder From Down Under.</p>
<p>Anyway, join us in the comments as we snark, drink, and snark some more about the hot messes parading as fashion!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pierce_the_Dickish.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-122390" alt="Pierce_the_Dickish" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pierce_the_Dickish.jpg" width="350" height="402" /></a>Dean Pelton tries to lure a potential rich student (aka whale) to college and he&#8217;s enlisted some of Greendale&#8217;s favorite human beings (Britta, Annie and Jeff) to help him to the dismay of Pierce Hawthorne aka Pierce the insensitive/Pierce The Dickish/Grandpa The Flatulent. Meanwhile Abed makes a new fraternity (The Timelords of Gallifrey?) and Troy and Shirley take a Phys Ed class.</p>
<p>Sorry about the mix up last week. There was a post ready but I didn&#8217;t alert anyone in time.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s episode wasn&#8217;t bad. It wasn&#8217;t great, but it wasn&#8217;t bad. You can&#8217;t &#8220;Chang&#8221; a Chang as Chang is still the same crazy ass mad dictator dressed as a Cuban Cab Driver and working with someone (Dean Spreck?) to get back at Greendale.  Jeff became the pariah (again) due to his dickish behavior at trying to uncover what Chang is really up to while Abed&#8217;s cameras capture the goings on in all their glory.<span id="more-122385"></span></p>
<p>It was interesting to see the former Mrs Chang show up. I don&#8217;t know what voodoo or mad skillz besides Salsa Dancing that Ben Chang used to land her, but I am really curious to find out (although I do realize that it is TV land where anything is possible.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring Break, y&#8217;all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spring Breakers&#8221; is sun tan oil, beer, drugs, and an MTV beach house all rolled into one nice, over-indulgent package. For some, this movie will remind them of their past lives as partying co-eds while others will watch on with their mouths agape like peeping toms given a glimpse into a life that they were never meant to see.<span id="more-122316"></span></p>
<p>Either way, the film is pleasant and unsettling all at the same time. The camera spends equal time lingering on gyrating hips, breasts, and sun-kissed skin as it does on blood, beer bellies, and methed out faces. It also highlights the trashiness that is Florida with or without the spring breakers that visit once a year.</p>
<p>It is equal parts &#8220;Enter The Void&#8221; and &#8220;Magic Mike&#8221; with voiceovers that provide the most subtle hints of foreshadowing. The actors do a great job capturing the lightness of spring break while barely acknowledging the treacherousness that lies beneath.  Selena Gomez&#8217;s character is the bible beater of the bunch and acts accordingly but the other characters continue to surprise throughout the film. Sure, they don&#8217;t have many lines but Ashley Benson and Vanessa Hudgens both prove that they are ready for bigger and better things than just tween movies and tv shows. Also,Rachel Korine makes a lasting impression as the fair weather bad girl. James Franco takes the next evolutionary step up from his character in &#8220;Pineapple Express.&#8221; He is Alien, a drug-dealer with a heart of gold and mind for mischief, has so many great moments that you almost forget about his sleaziness and want him to succeed.</p>
<p>The film is composed by Cliff Martinez (Drive, Contagion) and Skrillex whose music provides the perfect backdrop to the raucous proceedings. There are even a few random gunshots thrown in for good measure. Another &#8220;star&#8221; of the film is Britney Spears&#8217; music, some of the most memorable scenes in the movie include her songs &#8220;Everytime&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;Baby, One More Time.&#8221; Both are worth the price of admission, alone.</p>
<p>After all the debauchery of the film, the one thing that did surprise me was the ending. It wasn&#8217;t that far fetched but definitely changed my thoughts about the whole movie.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d give the film an eight out of ten with a few eye rolls thrown in for good measure.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend GloriousShoes shared a link with a recipe for <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/03/the-best-french-bread-pizza-recipe.html">French Bread Pizza</a>. Looked easy enough. I&#8217;ve made pizza from scratch before, so I know the dough is the hard part. I did a quick run down of the ingredients: garlic, butter, olive oil, red pepper, oregano, cheese, tomatoes and a few simple other things. I knew this would be part of my dinner menu this week.<span id="more-122343"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a doofus and ended up buying stewed tomatoes instead of crushed and decided to add Italian sausage. Fixing my stewed tomatoes was easy &#8211; I threw them in the food processor until they were the right consistency for pizza sauce. Rouse&#8217;s didn&#8217;t have any ground Italian sausage so I bought the brat kind and just took the casing off. No big deal &#8211; I&#8217;ve done this before. Cooking the sausage (heh) added a little bit of time to this recipe that probably would have only taken 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Other than that it was a pretty easy process. Preheat the oven to 425º. Cut the French bread in half as if you were going to make a sandwich out of it. Mince the garlic, melt the butter and olive oil in a sautee pan. Cook the garlic until it&#8217;s soft, but don&#8217;t brown it. Throw in the oregano and red pepper flakes with the garlic. Once the garlic is soft, put in the parsley/basil mix and a good pinch of salt. Stir it a little bit and then remove from heat. You should squish the bread a little bit with a cookie sheet. I guess you don&#8217;t have to do this, but the bread might curl up a bit in the baking process.</p>

<p>You want to brush about half of this garlic goodness on the slices of bread, then put some cheese on each slice. Put this in the oven until the cheese is a little melty. Meanwhile, add the tomatoes to the rest of the garlic/butter mixture. Let this cook until the tomatoes have reduced the sauce is rich. Probably about 10-15 minutes. Once the sauce has reduced, put some on each bread slice. My layering went like this: sauce, meat, cheese. Maybe next time I&#8217;ll do sauce, cheese, and then meat.</p>
<p>Let this bake until the cheese has melted/browned to your liking. Let it cool a bit and boom. You&#8217;ve got dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Was this recipe easy?</strong> Pretty easy, yes. I complicated it a bit by adding sausage and screwing up with the tomatoes.<br />
<strong>How long did it take?</strong> It was probably 45 minutes from the time I started cooking the sausage until I was eating.<br />
<strong>How did it taste?</strong> Really good. Dare I say it was even better when I ate it for leftovers. I put the leftover pieces in a toaster oven and the bread was the perfect amount of crunchy.<br />
<strong>Would I make this again?</strong> Sure thing. This was really easy and quick. I&#8217;ll add it to my &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to spend a lot of time cooking dinner&#8221; list of things to make.</p>
