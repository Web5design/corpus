Sad to see another weekend go by, but excited for a new episode of Mad Men. Last week left us with so many questions (well, me at least anyways). I&#8217;m excited to see what &#8220;doorways&#8221; our characters go through this season and where each one leads them.</p>
<p>If you missed out because you don&#8217;t have cable, AMC has made the premiere available <a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/video#type=all&amp;filter=rb-video-browser-num_items%3D10%26module_id_base%3Drb-video-browser%26module_id%3Dcfct-module-092ef28b46f301a3225bce7acc2cd7c1%26rb-video-browser-episode%3D%257B%2522sh%2522%253A%252257%2522%252C%2522se%2522%253A%2522278%2522%257D%26rb-video-browser-content_type%3D&amp;page=1&amp;post_id=32639">online</a> until April 30, 2013. Â My comments will be a little late this week since I&#8217;ll be headed back from the airport during the show, but they will be there!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pasta with bolognese sauce is a staple in our house, but as I&#8217;ve gotten &#8220;older&#8221;, I find that ground beef sometimes sits heavy in my stomach after dinner, particularly if I go overboard with the garlic. I recently started substituting ground beef with ground turkey in my bolognese, and have been thrilled with the results. The ground turkey absorbs all the flavors of the onions and garlic, while making the sauce light, or as light as a bolognese can be. Even though this recipe is not a traditional bolognese, it has all the ingredients I love: onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Also, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broccolini" target="_blank">broccolini</a> gives it a nice splash of color and texture. <em>Serves 4.<span id="more-123945"></span></em></p>
<p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb ground turkey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 bunch broccolini, stalks trimmed</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1/4 white onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 plum tomatoes, chopped</li>
<li>splash of white wine</li>
<li>pinch of dried crushed red pepper flakes</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>8 ounces orecchiette</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Preparation</em><br />
Heat olive oil over medium heat. Saute onions until they are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for 1 &#8211; 2 minutes. Add the ground turkey and the wine, breaking up the turkey with a wooden spatula. Cook until the turkey is no longer pink. Add red pepper flakes, and season with salt and fresh cracked pepper. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add broccolini and cook for approximately 1 minute. Strain broccolini, and cook the orecchiette in the same pot of boiling water according to the package directions. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Add the broccolini, the orecchiette, and the cooking water to the ground turkey mixture and stir. Serve with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</p>

Now is your chance to post younger you in your full glory. Get to it. </p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t access a formal pic then any old school picture will do.<span id="more-123916"></span></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look, if you don&#8217;t know how to post pictures here by now then what&#8217;s your problem?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Post Pics:</strong><!--more--></p>
<p>1) If you want to use a pic from your computer,Â youâveÂ got to first upload it to the web. Click on either of these links: <a href="http://imgur.com/" target="_blank">imgur</a> or <a href="http://tinypic.com/" target="_blank">tinypic</a>. Follow the directions to upload.<br />
2) After the upload, youâll see various links for your pic. Copy the direct link; you want the one that ends in .jpg<br />
3) Come back here. Type this exact code (including the brackets and quotation marks) into the âPost A New Commentâ box: &lt;img src=â â /&gt; and paste your direct link in between the quote marks. There should be a space between img and src (img src), but otherwise, no spaces between anything.<br />
4) It should look like this: &lt;img src=âhttp//www.yourphotodirectlink.jpgâ /&gt; Make sure to include those brackets.<br />
5) If youâre using a photo already on the web: Right click (or ctrl-click on a Mac) on an image and select âView Imageâ or âCopy Image URL/Location.â Copy-and-paste the URL and use the &lt;img src=â â /&gt; code above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6_G339vJjuE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>On April 10, 2012, 25 year old Sam Michel was found stabbed to death in his Los Angeles apartment. A year later, his murder remains unsolved and there are no leads.Â His family has just announced that they haveÂ <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/04/10/reward-doubles-1-year-after-koreatown-murder/">doubled the reward from $50,000 to $100,000</a> in the hopes of bringing renewed awareness to the case.<span id="more-123836"></span></p>
<p>What is known about the murder is that Michel met a friend at a local Koreatown bar known as R Bar and walked home alone at 12:45 am. His apartment, a 1920s Spanish style building called the Villa Sir Francis Drake was only five blocks away from R Bar, on Serrano Ave. Around 2:30 am, neighbors heard screams and called the police, who found Michel on the floor, having been stabbed multiple times. Nothing of value was taken, and there were no signs of forced entry, suggesting that the murderer knew Michel. Witnesses saw a man leaving the apartment on a small BMX bicycle, and the LAPD have expressed an interest in identifying and speaking with this individual. Anyone with information that could help shed light on this case can callÂ 213-382-9470.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://storify.com/LATimescitybeat/who-killed-sam-michel-in-koreatown">Los Angeles Times City Beat Twitter account posted a series of photos and video</a> about Sam Michel, highlighting his life, the neighborhood and apartment building he loved, and the pain of his family at his loss. A graduate of Cal Arts, an avid photographer, a beloved son&#8211;the glimpses that you get of Sam Michel paints a picture of a creative life lived fully, and tragically cut short.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While marriage equality was made legal in Canada in 2005, social acceptance of the LGBT community is not yet universal. In 2008, the government of QuÃ©bec expanded the Minister of Justiceâs responsibility to include the <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/ministere/dossiers/homophobie/homophobie-a.htm">fight against homophobia</a>.<span id="more-123718"></span></p>
<p>A recent provincial government survey found that although 78% of the respondents reported being comfortable with gays and lesbians, 40% remained leery about seeing two men kiss in public. In a âcoudonc, tâes pas sÃ©rieux?â approach, QuÃ©bec&#8217;s Ministry of Justice has responded with a $7.1 million, five-year anti-homophobia campaign. Two 30-second TV commercials in French and one radio commercial in English were created to encourage viewers to âask themselves whether they really are open to sexual diversity.â To complement these commercials, the government has also launched an â<a href="http://fighthomophobia.gouv.qc.ca/">Ãtes-vous vraiment ouvert?</a>â (Are you really open?) interactive website, which gives visitors âan opportunity to react to various situations, assess their own attitudes, learn more about various aspects of homophobia and discover the resources available.â The commercials can be viewed below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunnylands is a 200 acre estate located in Rancho Mirage, California and is owned an operated by the Annenberg Trust with the idea that the estate itself will be used to host retreats for some of the most powerful individuals on the planet. Â Blah blah blah. Â Let&#8217;s get on to the design of the place.</p>
<p>Fair warning: this post will be full of detail oriented photos.<img title="More..." alt="" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><span id="more-123741"></span></p>
<p>The estate itself was designed by architect A. Quincey Jones. It&#8217;s a glorious example of midcentury modern architecture that is chock full of Impressionist era art work that&#8217;s billed as a modest, casual home. I don&#8217;t know about your casual modest home, but this one includes a 9 hole, parkland style, Dick Wilson golf course and a ginormous pool that has enough water in it to change the surface of Sudan, but I digress. I didn&#8217;t go on this tour because I didn&#8217;t register in time. Instead we&#8217;re going to focus on the newly designed center and gardens attached to the estate.</p>

<p>Above you see the site plan of the new gardens and the visitor center. It is spectacular. The new center itself was designed by Fredrick Fisher and Partners based out of Los Angeles, CA. The building itself is a sight to behold. The brilliant, white single-story, multi-use building is certified LEED Gold and blends seamlessly into the over all plan of the estate itself. There&#8217;s a cafe, videos about the Annenbergs, selected pieces from the Annenberg&#8217;s massive collection of art, and a tasteful and well done gift shop. Such a good gift shop that I spent a small fortune on postcards there.</p>
<div id="attachment_123791" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1026px"><a href="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Center.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-123791" alt="Visitor's Center Entry" src="http://crasstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Center.jpg" width="1026" height="569" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitor&#8217;s Center Entry</p></div>
<p>The gardens themselves were designed by the office of James Burnett in Solana Beach, CA. His vision for the space was to use desert plants to mirror the Annenberg&#8217;s love of Impressionist era art. Does he succeed? Sure, in a way. The plant palette is limited and will be expensive to replace when things die, but it is spectacular in its own way. Let&#8217;s get into this.</p>
<p>The nine acre gardens feature over 50,000 desert plants which were chosen to provide year round visual interest while providing a much needed contrast to the lush greenery in the desert of the main estate itself. There are a little over a mile of walking paths, a labrynth, a large green lawn, and a natural wildflower area. Yellow is the predominant bloom color which reflects the Sunnylands logo and the gardens also provide a look into how lush desert plants really can be by using desert plants from all over the world.</p>

<p>So, you want to tour this beast? You&#8217;re in luck, you can. The tour of the entire property is $35 bucks and you need to schedule your visit on the 1st or the 15th every month when they release a limited amount of tickets for each day of the week. Word of warning: it&#8217;s a two hour tour and there&#8217;s a lot of walking involved. The gardens and visitor center are free to the public and you can come and go as you please. For more information on Sunnylands, its history, and the tour go <a href="http://Sunnylands.org">here</a>. The newly installed gardens were awarded ASLA&#8217;s Honor Award for 2012 (this is like winning an Oscar in my field), to see this, click <a href="http://www.asla.org/2012awards/576.html">here</a>.</p>
