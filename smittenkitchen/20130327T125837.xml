			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/03/chocolate-hazelnut-macaroon-torte/" title="chocolate hazelnut macaroon torte"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8578358713_5c9526d996.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="chocolate hazelnut macaroon torte"></a></p>
When it comes to large family gatherings, no matter how much I humble-brag about my <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/04/tangy-spiced-brisket/">brisket</a>, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/11/mustard-roasted-potatoes/">roasted vegetable sides</a> or the way I know my way around a <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/recipes/#Salad">salad</a>, I am always instead nominated to bring desserts. So, like a certain <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vHOrIUKkhs">Phoebe</a> on cup-and-ice duty that I will date myself by referencing, I take things very seriously, in part because I have a lot of rules for Passover desserts. The first is that that whatever dessert I make cannot include even a speck of matzo meal. I&#8217;m sorry, I realize this is a sensitive topic and I should tread more carefully, but I find the taste of matzo meal just awful in anything but matzo ball soup. My difficult palate aside, I also figure if I&#8217;m going to go through the effort to come up with something new (and hopefully better) in the flourless department, it would be of more use to more people were it also gluten-free, so that&#8217;s the second rule. The final rule is that I want the dessert to be good enough that I&#8217;d choose it any other day of year. It can&#8217;t just be good <em>for a Passover dessert</em>. It can&#8217;t just be good <em>for something gluten-free</em>. It has to be <em>objectively</em> good. Really, shouldn&#8217;t everything be? </p>

<p>My inspiration this year was a cake I found on Epicurious. <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Meringue-Chocolate-and-Kirsch-Cream-Layer-Cake-108902">Isn&#8217;t it a beaut</a>? I knew I had to find a way to make it happen, but I also knew it wasn&#8217;t going to be the way it was written. Aside from the fact that it is not actually a Schwarzwälder Torte (a chocolate cake with whipped cream, cherries and often Kirsh, what we sometimes refer to as a Black Forest Cake) and that it contains both flour and powdered sugar (a Passover no-no, unless you find or make cornstarch-free stuff), reviewers seemed very unhappy with the meringues, which were too thin and from what I could tell, not particularly flavorful. I turned instead to the macaroon component of an <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/03/almond-macaroon-torte-with-chocolate-frosting/">almond torte</a> I made a few years ago; the torte was a headache but the macaroons ended up having a lovely flavor largely because they contained such a high proportion of nuts. Given the choice, I always prefer meringues that are closer to macaroons.</p>

		<description>Coconut Bread From Bill Granger, via Wednesday Chef, via The New York Times I had to practically physically sit on my hands to keep myself from tweaking this, because I love coconut with so many other flavors &amp;#8212; lime! (I&amp;#8217;d add some zest) mango! pineapple! (I&amp;#8217;d add chunks, or slather it with mango curd) banana! [...]</description>

Three weeks ago, we together rolled our eyes because it seemed like everyone was either celebrating spring (pea tendrils! meyer lemons!) or on vacation without us, cluttering our social media feeds with shiny, happy scenes on distant beaches. We had a brief but unequivocally necessary pity party because while we were stuck here, shivering, with a fresh layer of sleet accumulating outside. We consoled ourselves with <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/02/blood-orange-margaritas/">blood orange margaritas</a>.</p>
<p>And then &#8212; EH TU, DEB? &#8212; I turned on you too. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8560366499/" title="worst week, ever "><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8560366499_4080aba0eb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="worst week, ever"></a></p>
<p>Really, I have some nerve. There we were, finally getting caught back up after a fall and winter of extended absences while I hopped from <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/events/">Atlanta to Austin</a>, Boston to Bridgewater, Minneapolis to Montreal, Salt Lake to St. Louis and I unpacked my thick sweaters and wool socks only long enough to replace them with sunscreen and flip-flops.</p>
<p>What a terrible week.</p>

I won&#8217;t lie: I generally feel &#8212; being a Jewish kid from suburban New Jersey &#8212; about the least qualified person on earth to talk about biscuits. My grandmother didn&#8217;t make biscuits. I am almost certainly the first person in my family to keep my fridge regularly stocked with buttermilk. And growing up, our breakfast breads were a rotation of Thomas&#8217; English muffins, bagels and maybe corn/blueberry or bran muffins, so it&#8217;s not like I have a deep well of biscuit nostalgia to tap into when I decide, on a whim, that what our morning, <a href="http://instagram.com/p/WmZczQvrek/">slicked with heavy snow</a>, really needs is freshly baked biscuits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8537640051/" title="flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, soda, butter, buttermilk"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8537640051_c35da26ac9.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, soda, butter, buttermilk"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8537640203/" title="butter into bits"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8537640203_a3f764e9b8.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="butter into bits"></a></p>
<p>Odds are, however you make your biscuits, <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/magazine/you-are-making-your-biscuits-wrong.html">you&#8217;re making them wrong</a>. Either the flour isn&#8217;t right (all-purpose when it should be White Lily, cake flour or something equally delicate), the leavener is unacceptable (commercial baking powder instead of a <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/2009/08/20/make-your-own-baking-powder/">homemade blend</a> of baking soda and cream of tartar), you chose the wrong fat (shortening instead of lard, lard instead of shortening, butter instead of shortening or lard), you pulsed your fat into the flour instead of rubbed, you beat instead of rolled, you dropped instead of cut, you used a cookie cutter (gasp!) instead of a juice glass. I&#8217;m totally cool with this: I make my biscuits wrong, too.</p>

		<description>French Onion Tart I tend to fiddle around with different crust ratios each time I make a savory tart shell because I&amp;#8217;m still looking for my favorite.

Hello from 30,000 feet! I wrote this on my 23rd airplane flight since November 2012, but here&#8217;s the part where you can be certain at last that I&#8217;m as weird as you already suspected: I still love flying as much as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8526098681/in/photostream">this</a> guy. How could I not? At the time, there were perfect white puffs of clouds below us (I always call them Simpson&#8217;s Clouds, because they remind me of the ones in the show&#8217;s opener) and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=georgia+o'keeffe+sky+above+clouds&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=georgia+o'keeffe+sky+above+clouds&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3.6724&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">sky above the clouds</a>, as always, was piercingly blue. The day before, it was <a href="http://instagram.com/p/WP0L62vreZ/">snow-sided mountains</a> down below, and before that, circular fields inside perfect grids, fern-like trenches and mosaics that <a href="http://instagram.com/p/WLOkWBvrRh/">stretched to the horizon</a>. That I <i>also</i> get to hang out at awesome bookstores and meet really nice people who indulge me (but really shouldn&#8217;t, lest I feel encouraged) by laughing at my terrible jokes only makes it more fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8512715095/" title="a two-pound bag, you can use all/most"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8512715095_ec255291b1.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="a two-pound bag, you can use all/most"></a><br />

<p>This strange thing that&#8217;s been happening over these book tours that I spend the entirety of my time outside the kitchen pining for it. I constantly jot down recipe ideas and become obsessed with making something very specific when I get home, like English muffins that taste like rye bread or a breakfast burrito like the awesome one I had at the Salt Lake City Airport (seriously) or intense homesick cravings for street meat from Rafiqi&#8217;s. Then I get home and&#8230; nothing. My cooking motivation goes through the floor. I try not to fight it; I hate when cooking is a chore, so we&#8217;ll order in or go out for one night, and then another. Usually, by the third evening, I am so completely over it &#8212; the salad with too much dressing, the raw-centered burger that you send back and comes out burnt through &#8212; that I&#8217;m back in the kitchen, relieved that absence made my cooking obsession stronger.</p>

Are your social media feeds one big blur of the freckled faces of people you once <i>thought</i> you loved basking in the Caribbean sun, showing unintentional contempt for you, back here, shivering and damp? Do your so-called friends in warmer climes gush about pea tendrils and new artichokes while your local market has shriveled roots that last saw the unfrozen earth in October? Of last year? Maybe, just this one time, an exception should be made and a tidy, brief pity party would be acceptable. I have just the elixir.</p>

<p>You may not be in the tropics, but glass-for-glass, we can fake it. You may not have fresh coconuts overhead and sweet mango and papaya slices on your breakfast plate, but if we hurry, we can grab onto the tail end of blood orange season and squeeze it into something better.</p>

		<description>Italian Stuffed Cabbage [Mondeghini al sugo] Adapted from Rachel Eats, who adapted it from from Giorgio Locatelli’s recipe in Made in Italy and Jane Grigson’s Vegetable Book. This dish is a mid-winter delight, budget-minded, not terribly complicated to make, hearty and delicious &amp;#8212; wilted cabbage leaves, a tender meatball and a simple, bright sauce.

Prior to November, what I knew of stuffed cabbage rolls were limited to the Jewish/Eastern European variety, which I make <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/02/alexs-moms-stuffed-cabbage/">the way my mother-in-law does</a>. I hadn&#8217;t given it further thought because as far as I was concerned, it was never broken, and needed little improvement, and when there&#8217;s little room for me to tinker in the kitchen, I quickly lose interest. But if I had, it might have occurred to me that cabbage, being one of the ultimate peasant foods, has probably been wrapped around meat that&#8217;s been ground and then stretched (always budget-minded, those peasants) with other ingredients and cooked in a sauce in a zillion different ways over the centuries. And oh, the fun we might have been having this whole time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8483762325/" title="peeling the savoy"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8483762325_27f79dc526.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="peeling the savoy"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8483762555/" title="big floppy cabbage leaves"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8483762555_302a1d6fda.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="big floppy cabbage leaves"></a></p>
<p>As it turns out, it could be argued that any region that can grow large cabbage leaves is indeed stuffing them with something. The most cursory of Google searches leads one on a tour of Greek <em>lahanodolmathes</em>, stuffed with ground beef and rice and covered with a traditional egg and lemon (avgolemono) sauce; French <em>chou farci</em>, stuffed with beef or pork, sometimes mushrooms, wrapped in large layers of cabbage leaves and served in wedges; Polish <em>gloabki</em>, or &#8220;little pigeons,&#8221; with pork and beef, and rice or barley (sigh); Slovak <em>holubky</em> or <em>halupki</em>; Serb or Croatian <em>sarma</em> with (hold me) sauerkraut and ham hocks, and Arabic <em>mahshi malfouf</em> which adds lemon juice, cinnamon and mint (swoon) to the usual ground meat and rice medley. And guys, I&#8217;m just getting started. The idea that there are this many ways to fall in love with stuffed cabbage torments me, and leaves me daydreaming about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(TV_series)">Westeros</a>-length winter wherein we could audition each one. </p>

		<description>Salted Caramel Brownies I used my standard approach to salted caramel, but I dialed back the heavy cream so that it would be less soft, and therefore better able to hold up in the batter. The brownie is my one-bowl favorite, with less salt and sugar to compensate for the sweetness and extra salt in [...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/02/salted-caramel-brownies/" title="runny salted caramel brownies"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8241/8452566415_fab87d7152.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="runny salted caramel brownies"></a></p>
A couple months ago, someone requested that I try my hand at caramel brownies. Amazingly, this person was not my husband, but he endorsed this idea so wholeheartedly that I suspect he might have paid this person off. Then again, in most people&#8217;s minds, who <i>doesn&#8217;t</i> want to make caramel brownies? What kind of strange person considers what would happen when sea salt-flecked deeply copper-colored homemade caramel meets a chewy, rich homemade brownie and then shrugs it off, &#8220;Eh, I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221; Guys, it&#8217;s me. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t think that a salted caramel brownie could be delicious, it&#8217;s just that I imagine it&#8217;s well-trodden territory, which to me translates as &#8220;people who want to make this already know how to&#8221; and then I figure my time would be better spent making other things, like <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/02/egg-salad-with-pickled-celery-and-coarse-dijon/">weird egg salads</a> and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/01/ethereally-smooth-hummus/">silky hummus</a>. </p>

<p>But then, as I did a quick search or two, I discovered things that caused me to make that crooked face that I made when I&#8217;m thinking really hard, because sometimes after a day of explaining to a preschooler why we have to wear pants when we leave the apartment when I fully understand the desire to simply not wear pants sometimes, thinking <i>is</i> really hard. The first is that a whole lot recipes started with store-bought caramels or caramel sauce, which made me sad, because the homemade stuff requires three ingredients that you probably have, is really easy to make and the flavor comparison (especially if you add a fourth ingredient, salt) &#8230; well, there is none. They barely deserve to share the same name. The next thing that gave me pause was that they all looked achingly sweet, as if little consideration was given to the fact that dousing an already-sweet brownie with caramel sauce might cause teeth to hurt/dentists to buy new vacation homes. </p>

		<description>Egg Salad with Pickled Celery and Coarse Dijon As I learned here, there are about as many ways to hard-boiled eggs as there are people who make them. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a new technique, you will delight in the comments. Here, I use my approach, the one that works for me every time. If [...]</description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/02/egg-salad-with-pickled-celery-and-coarse-dijon/" title="egg salad with pickled celery and coarse dijon"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8045/8447006171_14443dee65.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="egg salad with pickled celery and coarse dijon"></a></p>
Someone pointed out to me a few weeks ago that this site has not a single recipe in the archives for egg salad. However, unlike the time I realized the <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/recipes/#Broccoli">broccoli archives</a> boasted but a single recipe (and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/06/broccoli-parmesan-fritters/">quickly sought</a> to populate it) or the time I accepted that a quickie from-scratch <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/10/chicken-noodle-soup/">homemade chicken noodle soup</a> deserves a place in every arsenal, the egg salad-shaped hole in the archives went unnoticed less due to editorial oversight and more because, well, you know: egg salad; it&#8217;s pretty dull. Could anything be more uninspired than an amalgamation of smashed-up hard-boiled eggs and the dreaded mayonnaise? I mean, have you seen the yellow, flavorless mounds of dubious origin and assembly date most delis scoop onto a slice of bread and try to pass off as lunch? It would hardly make an enthusiast out of you. Or anyone. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8448093770/" title="hoping they're perfect inside"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8448093770_4c2f94db37.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="hoping they're perfect inside"></a><br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8447004815/" title="whisking the pickling liquid + helper"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8352/8447004815_27587b34b7.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="whisking the pickling liquid + helper"></a></p>
<p>But for those of us who see past the lack of beauty-queen stature and fervor around it, we know egg salad can be rather delicious if made properly, which is to say, at home, with perfectly cooked eggs and just enough dressing to cling, not drown them. At home, I make three small additions that I think transform it from the unglamorous status-quo to something I find crunchy, bright and absolutely perfect on a slice of whole-grain toasted bread in the middle of the day. The first is that I love to use coarse, or whole-grain Dijon mustard. Not only is it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/2592653059/">the prettiest thing</a> in my fridge, the combination of the faintly crisp/crackly seeds and its milder flavor are heavenly here, adding texture and just enough kick to the eggs. The second is finely minced shallot, just a little. You could use red onion, too, but I think the texture is key. You want it to be noticeable enough that you enjoy it but not so loud that it upstages the star, kind of like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8448211964/in/photostream">surprise guests</a> at a halftime show. </p>

		<description>Pasta and White Beans with Sizzling Garlic-Rosemary Oil Adapted, barely, from Sara Jenkins via Bon Appetit For the pasta, I used pennete, because I thought it nicely matched the little white beans (Rancho Gordo&amp;#8217;s Alubia Blanca). Sara Jenkins called for ditalini to go with chickpeas. You can use whatever you&amp;#8217;d like &amp;#8212; short tubes, even [...]</description>

If you have a thing for chocolate, the world is your oyster. On this very site, <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/recipes/#Chocolate">86</a> of the just over 800 recipes boast a significant chocolate component and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&#038;bbn=4196&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;qid=1359559768&#038;rh=n%3A283155%2Cn%3A!1000%2Cn%3A6%2Cn%3A4196%2Cn%3A4199&#038;rnid=4196&#038;tag=smitten-20">entire sections</a> of bookstores will be happy to fill in any cravings I missed. If you have a thing for bacon, the internet would be overjoyed to find you places to put it, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bacon&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=bacon&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j59j65l3j60.2248&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">zillions, even</a>, although I&#8217;d proceed with caution before auditioning <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&#038;tbo=d&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=lady+gaga+bacon+dress&#038;oq=lady+gaga+bacon+dress&#038;gs_l=hp.3..0j0i30j0i5i30.123.5919.0.6053.35.25.6.3.3.0.518.4218.4j16j1j3j0j1.25.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.ATJb1fYVdTI&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&#038;bvm=bv.41642243,d.dmQ&#038;fp=93f9448d4881c785&#038;biw=1280&#038;bih=679">a couple</a>. But if you have a thing for something slightly less of a prom king/queen ingredient, say, tiny white beans, well, it can be tough. It&#8217;s not there are <i>no</i> uses for them, it&#8217;s just that when you&#8217;re very much in love, there are never enough ways to be together. And if you&#8217;re me &#8212; someone who sometimes ups and makes a mega-pot of white beans just because you feel like it, presuming you&#8217;ll find things to do with them later &#8212; you sometimes end up scrambling, yanking down nearly every cookbook in your <a href="http://instagram.com/p/UmEmVivrSF/">collection</a> but still coming up bereft of uses outside the well-trodden soup-and-salad territory.</p>

<p>So tell me: What are you favorite uses for beans outside the ever-popular realm of chili, tacos, soup and salad? Really, I&#8217;m hankering for more inspiration. I ended up finding some &#8212; but never enough &#8212; in this month&#8217;s Bon Appetit, in <a href="http://www.bonappetit.com/search/query?contributorName=Sara%20Jenkins">a stack of pasta recipes you will find it impossible to choose among from Sara Jenkins</a> of <a href="http://www.porchettanyc.com/">Porchetta</a> and <a href="http://porsena.com/">Porsena</a> (and <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2011/02/green-bean-salad-with-pickled-red-onions-and-fried-almonds/">green bean salad</a>, sigh) fame. I was so <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8430462112/">charmed</a> by the short tubes of pasta with chickpeas, I made it almost immediately but maybe it was because I&#8217;ve <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/01/carrot-soup-with-tahini-and-crisped-chickpeas/">overdone it</a> <a href="http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/01/ethereally-smooth-hummus/">on chickpeas</a> this month, but I kept thinking it would be nice with something&#8230; <i>daintier</i>. And considering that it is an established fact (um, in Italy, where I suspect both my white bean and artichoke obsessions could roam free) that white beans, garlic, rosemary and olive oil are a combination sent from above, I had a hunch they&#8217;d be happy here too.</p>

		<description>Intensely Chocolate Sables Inspired by Balthazar, adapted quite a bit from Miette I prefer these cookies with Dutched cocoa power, which is darker and little nuttier, but if you only have natural cocoa, you can use it, although the cookies will puff just a bit more. [Update 1/29: Based on the comments I'm reading, I'm [...]</description>

Although I would hardly say that having a kid has made me wiser &#8212; there have been just too many incidents like the one this morning, when not a single of the following clues piqued my concern: 3 year-old going into bathroom to bring his step-stool into another room; the sound of a cabinet opening, a fridge opening followed by a banging sound on the counter, until it was too late and a once-clean child in a once-clean kitchen was making &#8220;skwambled&#8221; eggs &#8212; I can&#8217;t help but have come to a few salient conclusions about children/life itself over the last few years that I find infinitely applicable. One, there are few things wrong that a good night&#8217;s sleep cannot fix. Two, sometimes you really just need to scream and yell and have a great big noisy fuss for a few minutes and get it all out &#8212; pounding your tiny, dimpled fists on the carpet is optional, but this is no time to hold back feeling all the feelings, you know? &#8212; so that you can resume being sweet and awesome for the remaining minutes of the day. Finally, there&#8217;s not a single person in this universe who does not need a cookie at 4 p.m. each day, like clockwork. Nobody. Not even you. Even in the month of Resolutions. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/8413205412/" title="grated chocolate"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8085/8413205412_ea75896fc3.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="grated chocolate"></a></p>
<p>One of my great cookie loves, and the most ideal 4 p.m. mini-escapist treat, is the chocolate sable from <a href="http://www.balthazarbakery.com/home.php">Balthazar Bakery</a>. I don&#8217;t get it often, because that would be dangerous. I usually indulge when I&#8217;ve mentally committed to walking either there or back or both (exercise!) or I&#8217;m having the kind of day that only a walk to SoHo would improve (justification!). If you&#8217;ve ever been to Balthazar, you&#8217;ve probably looked right past it to ogle the <i>pain au chocolate</i> or burnished plum tarts because it looks plain and dull, hardly competitive with its surroundings, and I think you&#8217;ve missed out because alone in its 1/4-inch thick fluted round is the intensity of all the chocolate in Paris. Okay, I exaggerate but still, that&#8217;s no excuse to miss it. It&#8217;s bittersweet, crisp and sandy; it absolutely <i>aches</i> with chocolate impact and it makes me very happy.</p>
