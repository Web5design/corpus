<p>Hey everyone, I am Franny and I&#8217;m from Fort Lauderdale, FL. I am available for adoption through the <a href="http://www.cockerrescuefl.org/" target="_blank">Cocker Rescue of Florida</a>. I am a 3 year old rat terrier but I heard people calling me a &#8220;velcro dog&#8221; whatever that means. I need a forever home with people who appreciate my terrier sassy ways!</p>
<p>Franny is absolutely a delight, she is mellow in the house but always super happy to go for a walk, a jog, or a paddle in the kayak.<br />
She is completely housebroken, good in a leash and will learn tricks for food.<br />
Adoptions South Florida only!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gadget is our foster dog from <a href="http://www.aheinz57.com/" target="_blank">AHeinz57 Pet Rescue &amp; Transport</a> in De Soto, IA. He had a pretty rough start in life and we want to try to wipe the slate clean and start over. Gadget&#8217;s Foster Mom refers to him as the Matthew McConaughey of dogs because he is blonde, scruffy and very charming. Gadget is also a true terrier, friendly and bouncy and tons of fun. He loves to run and play outside with other dogs, and has an amazingly high vertical jump. Gadget would love a home with a fenced yard. Preferably with a 6ft privacy fence!</p>
