				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.dogshaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/korgs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2147528595" alt="korgs" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.dogshaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/korgs.jpg?resize=637%2C475" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I barked because my mom wouldn&#8217;t let me in the bedroom while her boyfriend was here. She got mad, so I ate her Michael Kors wallet while I waited.&#8221;</p>
<p>My Corgi, Harkness, loves it when people come over and gets upset if he doesn&#8217;t get attention (OMG he does *not* care what you&#8217;re doing, he will try to cuddle you. Imagine that during, say, yoga.) . After my boyfriend and I were in the bedroom for a while he started barking at the door. He didn&#8217;t like it when I came out to fuss at him and still wouldn&#8217;t let him in. I was thrilled that he stopped barking after that, but realized afterwards he knocked my phone wallet to the ground and proceeded to get his revenge.</p>

<p>My foster pup apparently does not like my boots, she was nto ashamed until she had to take a picture with the evidence! Nova lives in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. He&#8217;s being fostered through <a href="http://www.loyalrescue.com/" target="_blank">LOYAL Rescue</a>. Nova is a typical puppy, very sweet and playful but of course gets into anything she can. She is a tiny bit shy in newer situations and around new dogs but warms up quickly. She hasn’t met too many children but has no issues with adults, no stranger danger. Here is <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/25097817" target="_blank">Nova&#8217;s profile</a>.</p>

<p>Milo is looking for his forever home. Right now he is being fostered with his brother in Brooklyn, NY by <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/whiteangelshope.html" target="_blank">White Angels Hope Rescue</a>. with a professional trainer but is ready to meet his new family. He is a Double Merle Australian Shepherd. He has special needs, meaning he is deaf and partially blind however he gets around just fine! He is short-sighted and has no peripheral vision but can see at least 25 yards.<br />
Milo is a very bright and intuitive guy. He is housebroken and has been learning sign language (ASL). At this time he knows: SIT, STAY, DOWN, NO BITE, GOOD BOY, AWESOME, OK, GO POTTY, NO WAY, and LET’S GO. He loves other dogs of all shapes, sizes and ages. He has spent time with older children (8 years and up) and would do well in a home with a mature child who understands his special needs. He has met a cat and really just sat there.<br />
Milo would benefit from a home that had a fenced in yard since he can’t hear you when you call him but would settle for a loving home no matter what the situation. He would need a lot of exercise in any case. He is neutered and up to date on his vaccinations. <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/23380744" target="_blank">Here is his profile</a>.</p>

<p>When Cupcake came to us we weren&#8217;t sure about her name, but it became apparent that she is just soooooo SWEET that her name fits her perfectly!<br />
Hello, I’m Cupcake! My foster Mom says I got my name because I am sooooo SWEET! I’m looking for a family to call my own. I promise that I am very loyal and want nothing more than to spend time with my people. I am fully housebroken and am well behaved in my crate when no one is home. I would love to go for walks with you, and promise I will be polite and not pull on the leash. Please consider adopting me, you won’t regret it! Cupcake is a 7 year old Black &amp; White English Pointer. She is up to date on all of her shots and on flea &amp; heartworm prevention and ready for YOU! She is from <a href="www.pointerrescue.org" target="_blank">Pointer Rescue</a>.<br />
Cupcake is being fostered in New York, but we are a National rescue that can transport to approved adopters <img src='http://i0.wp.com/www.dogshaming.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' data-recalc-dims="1" /> </p>

<p>Simone is a 2-year-old Pit Bull cross who is sweet and loyal. She lives in Vancouver, BC, Canada.</p>
<p>She needs a home where she will be an only-pet (no other dogs or cats, please) as she is currently not fond of others dogs, but she is very gentle and loving with people, food, toys, children, etc. Simone will never really be a &#8220;dog park dog&#8221;, but would enjoy a loving family who will love her as their only pup.</p>
<p>She is currently in training classes and will require a home that can continue her training.</p>
<p>There is normally a standard adoption fee for our rescues; however, as an incentive, anyone willing to adopt Simone will have her fees covered by Dog Shaming.</p>
<p>Do you have room for Simone? If so, please fill out an application at our website at <a href="http://lastchanceanimalrescue.ca/" target="_blank">lastchanceanimalrescue.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, I am Franny and I&#8217;m from Fort Lauderdale, FL. I am available for adoption through the <a href="http://www.cockerrescuefl.org/" target="_blank">Cocker Rescue of Florida</a>. I am a 3 year old rat terrier but I heard people calling me a &#8220;velcro dog&#8221; whatever that means. I need a forever home with people who appreciate my terrier sassy ways!</p>
<p>Franny is absolutely a delight, she is mellow in the house but always super happy to go for a walk, a jog, or a paddle in the kayak.<br />
She is completely housebroken, good in a leash and will learn tricks for food.<br />
Adoptions South Florida only!</p>

<p>Gadget is our foster dog from <a href="http://www.aheinz57.com/" target="_blank">AHeinz57 Pet Rescue &amp; Transport</a> in De Soto, IA. He had a pretty rough start in life and we want to try to wipe the slate clean and start over. Gadget&#8217;s Foster Mom refers to him as the Matthew McConaughey of dogs because he is blonde, scruffy and very charming. Gadget is also a true terrier, friendly and bouncy and tons of fun. He loves to run and play outside with other dogs, and has an amazingly high vertical jump. Gadget would love a home with a fenced yard. Preferably with a 6ft privacy fence!</p>
