<p>My name is Betty Davis and I am a sweet and social little girl from Washington, DC! I am mellow and love to hang out with both my human and dog friends here at the <a href="http://www.washhumane.org" target="_blank">Washington Humane Society</a>. I&#8217;m super smart, and I&#8217;ve already learned to sit on command and would love to learn more with some positive training and reinforcement. I really like to go on long walks, then I am ready for a good snuggle. Please consider me to be your new best friend. I can go home with dogs or cats&#8230;or both! I prefer my furry friends calm and laid back like me. Because I rock, my adoption fee is waived!</p>
<p>Interested in adopting Betty Davis? This lovely girl is available at the Washingon Humane Society New York Avenue Adoption Center.</p>

<p>Love our little foster Chestnut, but she has a horrible dirty secret.</p>
<p>Meet Chestnut- a 2-4 year old schnauzer that comes ready to go! from <a href="http://nlolchicago.org/" target="_blank">New Leash On Life Rescue</a> in Chicago, IL.</p>
<p>Chestnut was recently rescued by New Leash on Life Chicago with her non-bonded friend, JackFrost. Because she was an owner give up from a multi-dog home, she does fabulously with other dogs of all shapes and sizes, and would be the ideal dog for a home with kids!  She even shines with her feline foster companions!</p>
<p>This lovely lady is also potty trained and does well when left alone to her own devices. But she does needs some patience while she learns how to walk properly on a leash. What really makes her a winner is her laid back, anything goes personality! All she asks for is a warm blanket or soft bed and someone to scratch behind those ears!</p>

<p>Penny says: &#8220;I ate cat poo. Then, I felt so bad about it I put myself in my foster brother&#8217;s crate to atone for my dirty Dirty deed! Miss Penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Penny is available for adoption from <a href="http://www.aussieandme.org/" target="_blank">Aussie and Me Rescue</a> in Fort Myers, FL! Penny loves pretty much everything: people, dogs, kids, cats, playing, walking, anything as long as she&#8217;s with her pack! She&#8217;s only about a year old, so she&#8217;s still very young but is full of personality and love! She is about twenty five pounds and is very smart. She is house trained, crate trained (obviously), and learning new things in her foster home! Penny is an awesome dog!</p>
<p>If you are interested in finding out more about Penny, <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/25435970" target="_blank">click here</a>. Her petfinder says she is looking for a foster but, as you can see, she has found a foster home but is still waiting for her forever home!</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night I was lonely and missing my old home. So, I whimpered and howled until 2am, when my foster mom let me sleep in her bed. I repaid her nice gesture by farting in her face.<br />
Sorry, I thought smelly meant love…<br />
-Ado&#8221;</p>
<p>Ado is a 9 year old Great Dane that I just began fostering He lives in Fairbanks, AK and in being adopted through <a href="http://www.hbprr.org/" target="_blank">Homeward Bound Rescue</a>. He is very mellow and very sweet, but last night he was feeling a little homesick so he whimpered and howled at the window all night, hoping his owners would come back for him. Sadly, circumstances prevent them from keeping him.<br />
This adorable senior is looking for his forever home.<br />
He&#8217;s 140lbs of lovable and would make the right family very happy.</p>

<p>Starr is a beautiful pitbull mix from Huntington, NY. She&#8217;s being adopted out through <a href="http://www.littleshelter.com/" target="_blank">Little Shelter</a>. Starr was found as a brand new mommy. Two of her pups died but the other 2 pulled through. Starr was a fantastic mom and her babies were very well taken care of and adopted out on their own. Now Starr is ready for the kind of life she should have had all along. Two-year-old Starr is looking for a home where she will be the only pet in the house. Starr has spent some time in our offices and has proven to be well-behaved inside. She will stay by your side, enjoy partaking in some play, and then relax with a peanut butter kong. She is a bundle of fun! <a href="http://www.littleshelter.com/dogs/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=425" target="_blank">Here is her profile</a>.</p>
