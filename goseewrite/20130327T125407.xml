<p>It was right that on the agenda that the Visit Finland folks emailed me. I wasn&#8217;t sure they were serious or whether it was part of some sort of Finnish joke.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finnish sauna is for every occasion in Finland, for business as much as for leisure. The Finns believe that due to its social nature and relaxing effect, the sauna is an excellent place for negotiations, and exchange of ideas and opinions. In ancient times, the sauna in Finland was linked to spiritual and religious ceremonies and healing. The sauna meant a quiet, peaceful place and a clean and warm haven. Saunas have always had a very strong significance and social importance.</p>
<p><strong><em>The health benefits of ice swimming</em></strong> have been thoroughly researched. Due to the drastic changes in temperature the discharge of stress hormones is increased and both blood circulation and metabolism are improved. Studies have shown that people who swim regularly have significantly lower blood pressure and a better tolerance of the cold. Many swimmers say that all aches and pains disappear in the water.</p>
<p>You can feel the effects of ice swimming even after the very first dip in the icy water. Blood rushes through your veins, your body is pumped with adrenaline and the feeling of achievement brings a smile to your face: “I did it!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Whaaaa?? Sauna? Fine, even if naked.</p>
<p><strong>But Ice swimming??</strong></p>
<p>What the heck had I gotten myself into on this trip?</p>
<h2>My First Effort</h2>
<p>My first sauna was in a small house in the Phyä-Luosto area up in Lapland that I was staying at for most of my trip. The sauna was male-only, and therefore we did the sauna portion naked, which was fine. Bit odd to be talking to a couple guys about the weather and such in the nude, but not that big a deal.</p>
<p>But before that, when I pulled up with my two wonderful local tourism folks/drivers/guides, they told me that it was easiest to just do the ice lake swimming right in the beginning, before your body warmed up in the sauna too much which would only highlight the difference in temperature more.</p>
<p><strong>Big mistake.</strong></p>
<p>By the time I shuffled down the frozen path from the sauna building to the lake, my feet were frozen solid and I was completely and totally mentally psyched out by the whole experience.</p>
<p>Semi-failure.</p>
<p>(Side note here is that I didn&#8217;t do the lake swimming part naked, not only because I was going to video it, but because my camera person was one of my guides, both of which were women).</p>
<h2>My Second Try</h2>
<p>After my stay up around the Arctic Circle in Phyä-Luosto, <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2013/03/finland-by-rail-video/">I hopped back on a train</a> and headed down to meet one of my favorite people in the world, Ayngelina of Bacon is Magic, for a couple days of hanging out in Tampere.</p>
<div id="attachment_9944" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/msh-sauna-temps.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9944" title="sauna temperature gauges finland" alt="finnish ice lake swimming after sauna" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/msh-sauna-temps.jpg" width="325" height="272" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>still not sure I believe it</em></p></div>
<p>As soon as I got there, I told Ayngelina that we would be doing the frozen lake swimming. <a href="http://www.baconismagic.ca/finland/finnish-sauna/">She had already done a sauna</a> or two and loved the experience, but hadn&#8217;t jumped in the lake yet.</p>
<p><strong>Time to overcome that mental hurdle.</strong></p>
<p>A couple things to note. See that blurry photo over to the right? Those are the various temperatures in Celsius.</p>
<p>First is the temperature of the sauna. Below that is the temperature of the water. Last is the temperature of the air outside the sauna.</p>
<p>So, the water was 0.3 degrees Celsius &#8212; that is 32.54 degrees Fahrenheit. The temp inside the sauna was 91.4 degrees Celsius &#8212; that is 196.5 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Science review: water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) and  boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 Fahrenheit).</p>
<p><strong>We were just slightly short of being able to put out a glass of water and watching it boil in front of our eyes.</strong> I actually am more shocked by that than the water temperature.</p>
<p>The second oddity on this visit was when we learned that our local Finnish guide, a truly great guy named Ville who runs the <a href="http://www.dreamhostel.fi/">Tampere Dream Hoste</a>l in town, had never gone ice swimming before. He was a regular sauna-goer, but had never jumped in the lake.</p>
<p>We were going to fix that oversight.</p>
<p>Lastly, do the sauna first to warm your body up. It doesn&#8217;t matter a bit once you hit the freezing water, but the steam that comes off you as you walk down to the water keeps you body warm for that part, at least. It makes a big difference.</p>
<h2>Video Proof</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the continuing effort to work on my video skills, I give you my video proof of all the above&#8230;. with a good song (wait for the timing of &#8220;fool&#8221; about 20-25 seconds in).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m still working a lot on my shooting and editing skills, so any feedback that you have is more than welcome. I know I still have a ways to go, but if you&#8217;d like to subscribe to my YouTube channel to keep up with my progress, you can either click on the link that shows up in the lower right on this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpHjJBBwCIuqiwLomI8y6DA?sub_confirmation=1" rel="nofollow">or just click through here</a>.</p>

<p>Finland shocked and surprised me. As you may recall, my primary purpose for taking this winter trip to a final destination up around the Arctic Circle <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2013/01/headed-to-finland-winter/">was to see and photograph the Northern Lights</a> for the first time in my life. I spent ten days in Finland and the only clear sky I received was on the first day, <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2013/03/finland-by-rail-video/">as I took a train north</a> from Helsinki to the Phyä-Luosto region.</p>
<p><strong>Primary plan failure.</strong></p>
<p>I am already making tentative plans to go back, but the Northern Lights might only be my secondary focus of the next trip.</p>
<h2>What do you know about reindeer?</h2>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8xqACmJvqaU" height="360" width="480" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
I dare say that I didn&#8217;t know much more than they pulled Santa&#8217;s sleigh and the unpopular ones had red noses before I took this trip.</p>
<p><strong>The first thing I learned about reindeer is that they are delicious. </strong></p>
<p>If I counted correctly, I had nine dinners in Finland. I believe that I had some version of reindeer meat in six of those meals. Frankly, I could have easily had it a few more times and been happy.</p>
<div id="attachment_9892" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-19.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9892" alt="a few of the reindeer meals I had (also helping to prove I am not a food photographer)" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-19.jpg" width="640" height="360" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>a few of the reindeer meals I had (also helping to prove I am not a food photographer)</em></p></div>
<p>In the hierarchy of &#8220;best meats I have ever eaten,&#8221; reindeer slides into a firm second place on my worldwide list, only trailing southern African game meat such as kudu, springbok and zebra &#8212; all of which are currently tied at the top of the list and requiring me to head back down there to do more tasting.</p>
<p>Where is Argentinian beef on my list, you ask? Incredibly overrated.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t just how tasty reindeer were that fascinated me; it was the whole culture that surrounded them.</p>
<div id="attachment_9894" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reindeer-sleigh-two-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9894" title="winter reindeer tourist ride in finland" alt="reindeer sleigh ride winter finland" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reindeer-sleigh-two-1.jpg" width="640" height="567" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>I took a nighttime reindeer sleigh ride&#8230; but no photos, so here&#8217;s a daytime one for you</em></p></div>
<h2>Sami Culture, Reindeer Herding and more</h2>
<p>The Sami are the native peoples of this Nordic area, spread out over northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and some of Russia. They are spread out over about 150,000 square miles of land up at the top of the world, speak a variety of dialects almost unrecognizable to each other though not separated by much distance, and back to the point of this post, have herded reindeer for centuries.</p>
<p>There are somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 reindeer wandering free in the Lapland area of Finland, depending on the time of year.</p>
<p><strong>Although they wander about freely &#8212; they are all owned.</strong></p>
<p>I had the chance to talk to a few reindeer herders during my visit, both Sami and non-Sami. What I learned has just made me want to go back and learn more.</p>
<div id="attachment_9897" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reindeer-knives-and-wood-cups-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9897" title="knife made of reindeer horns in finland" alt="reindeer knives and wood cups" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/reindeer-knives-and-wood-cups-1.jpg" width="640" height="450" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>some of the Sami craft works, including knives with reindeer horn sheaths and handles</em></p></div>
<p>Most of the reindeer owners in Finland have a very small number of them. Government statistics show that about 4,100 people, or approximately 75% of all reindeer owners, have fewer than 50 reindeer and the income from reindeer herding for these people is only a supplementary income. There are less than 1,000 families making their full-time living from reindeer herding, but that doesn&#8217;t lessen the importance of reindeer in the culture (<a href="http://icr.arcticportal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=188&amp;Itemid=57&amp;lang=en&amp;limitstart=3">Source</a>).</p>
<h3>Some more reindeer facts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Both sexes grow antlers, which (in the Scandinavian variety) for older males fall off in December, for young males in the early spring, and for females in the summer.</li>
<li>Reindeer hooves adapt to the season &#8212; in summertime, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In wintertime, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping.</li>
<li>Mating occurs from late September to early November. Males battle for access to females. Two males will lock each others antlers together and try to push each other away, which is why their antlers don&#8217;t fall off until after the mating season in Autumn. The most dominant males can collect as many as 15-20 females to mate with. A male will stop eating during this time and lose much of its body reserves.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="http://reindeerherding.org/?lang=en">website dedicated to international reindeer herding</a>. It is run by the International Centre for Reindeer Husbandry and I admit that I geeked out and spent a couple hours browsing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But what interested me the most was the whole herding concept.</strong> Finland is divided into 57 regions for the purposes of reindeer herding by the Finnish government. The animals wander about freely, but twice a year they have a massive, nationwide reindeer roundup to bring them all together in each of the regions.</p>
<p>In May, the reindeer are all brought together because they have just recently birthed calves that needed to get their ownership mark. Each herder has a unique mark that they cut into the reindeer&#8217;s ear, so that each herder knows who owns each and every reindeer wandering around.</p>
<p>In October, they round all the reindeer up again, this time to cull the herds (you can read that as &#8220;get some meat onto my dinner table&#8221;) to keep them to an overall population of about 200,000 total in Finland. They do these roundups in modern times using helicopters, snowmobiles, dogs and more and it sounds like a huge, fantastic spectacle&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Ergo me talking to them about going back this October to see it all in person.</strong></p>
<p>I want to go back and talk to more herders about their lifestyle, talk to chefs about cooking reindeer, talk to more Sami about how reindeer played a role in their culture and still do, and see a couple of these massive roundups in person.</p>
<h2>Am I the only one that finds this stuff totally fascinating?? What do you think of it all?</h2>

<p><strong>In a couple of weeks, I am headed to Costa Rica on behalf of Exodus Tours to do a 14-day trip all around that Central American country. </strong></p>
<p>I am really excited to be working with Exodus, though the Navigate Media Group that I have told you about previously. It is a great company and they have dozens upon dozens of incredible tours all around the world. First class stuff, to be sure.</p>
<p>It is going to be a grand adventure and I can&#8217;t wait to bring it all to you via written word, photographs, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpveDuPOc6A">my new latest passion, video</a>, but that being said&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://bit.ly/13V3VSn">click through this link to check out this trip</a>, so you can get a full understanding of my slight qualms about this trip. Back? OK, here we go.</p>
<h2>Knowing my limitations</h2>
<div id="attachment_9858" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 311px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Costa_Rica_Topography.png"><img class=" wp-image-9858 " title="map of costa rica" alt="topographical map of costa rica" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Costa_Rica_Topography-1024x993.png" width="301" height="292" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>topography of Costa Rica</em></p></div>
<p>First, I&#8217;m going to be spending 10 of the 14 days on a bicycle, averaging 30 miles (48 kilometers) a day. And for those that aren&#8217;t fully aware of the layout of Costa Rica, I have included a handy topographical map.</p>
<p>The difficulty level on this tour is labeled as &#8220;moderate,&#8221; but as I stare at that map just a bit, I tend to focus on the white, orange, and yellow portions.</p>
<p><strong>There is, in fact, a rather substantial mountain range that bisects Costa Rica.</strong></p>
<p>If you have clicked on that above link you have seen the map of my route. If not, go click on it, hit the &#8220;Itinerary&#8221; tab and come back.</p>
<p>You got it right. Looks like we will be crossing over that middle part a couple of times. Look, I am up for a fair bit of adventure. I&#8217;ve jumped off a bridge a couple of times; I&#8217;m down for <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2011/05/the-first-annual-dahab-festival/">scuba diving all over</a> the world and actively <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2011/02/traveling-and-dying-the-real-risks-in-life/">seek out sharks when doing so</a>; I&#8217;ve hitchhiked <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2010/06/photo-of-the-day-on-top-of-a-cargo-truck/">on top of cargo trucks in Africa</a> and parasailed over Medellin, Colombia. I&#8217;m generally up for most everything.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m also not in very good physical shape right now. I am in far worse shape <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2010/08/kili-and-my-tattoo/">when I climbed Kilimanjaro</a> in the middle of my round-the-world trip.</p>
<p><strong>This is going to be interesting.</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, Costa Rica isn&#8217;t my favorite country in the world. I was biased against it before I arrived the only other time I have been there. In the rest of Central America, the locals tend to refer to Costa Rica as Gringolandia, not only because it is the most popular expat country in that part of the world, but also because it has far more North American tourists than the rest of that part of the world (for admittedly good reasons &#8212; the tourist infrastructure is more established there than the rest of Central America and it has a long history of political stability, in comparison with its neighbors).</p>
<p>Plus, I went back and looked at my few photographs from that part of my trip and again had to face the fact of how absolutely horrible of a photographer I was back then. I only took 50 or so pictures in my short time in Costa Rica and I went through them today to find the best one.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is the best one.</p>
<div id="attachment_9853" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/costa-rica-beach-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9853 " title="beach in costa rica" alt="costa rica beach-1" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/costa-rica-beach-1.jpg" width="640" height="273" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>my God, this is embarrassing</em></p></div>
<h2>So why am I going?</h2>
<p>I like to challenge myself. And I really haven&#8217;t done much of anything challenging since I did the <a href="http://www.ultimatetrainchallenge.com">Ultimate Train Challenge</a> over a year ago.</p>
<p>This is going to be a physical challenge for me, simply because I&#8217;m just not in the proper shape to do a trip like this and I don&#8217;t remotely have time to get in shape before I leave. I expect that I&#8217;m going to have to have my brain tell my body &#8220;all will be all right&#8221; a number of times on this trip and I will have to talk myself into not giving up and hitting the following van a number of times.</p>
<p><strong>But I need that. I need a swift metaphorical kick in the ass right now.</strong></p>
<p>Now, as to how my actual real ass handles two weeks on a bicycle&#8230; let&#8217;s just hope those padded shorts work miracles.</p>
<p>As to Costa Rica&#8230; I need to give it another chance. I only spent about a week there in the early stages of my round-the-world trip in 2009. It left such a non-impression that the only thing I wrote about it was <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2009/04/safety-crime-while-traveling/">merely in passing in this post</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I am a firm believer on now more than ever, after 70 or so countries in the last five years, is that possession of preconceived notions is the quickest way to disappointment in travel. I am headed to Costa Rica, and warmth, bereft of the blinders that I wore the last time I went through.</p>
<h2>Time for good stuff for you as well:</h2>
<p>1) Exodus has <a href="http://bit.ly/16uP00T">given me a 10% discount code for readers</a>. It may not seem like a lot but if you look a trip like the Costa Rica I&#8217;m taking it is a nearly $400 discount or a $500 discount for the Galapagos trip that Ayngelina is taking. Just quote `BLOG` when you book a trip and voila. Go ahead and take a second to click through and just <a href="http://www.exodus.co.uk/?CMP=goseewrite">check out what sort of tours they have to offer</a> &#8212; there are hundreds of impressive options.</p>
<p>2) <strong>If $400-$500 is not enough there is a way to get a trip for free.</strong> They have a contest running that not many people know about called <a href="http://bit.ly/16uPrIA">Feel More Alive</a>. Moments from travel are often some of the most exciting in our lives and Exodus is trying to assemble the biggest collection of these moments by asking people to submit videos and photos that share a moment that made them feel more alive.</p>
<p>Feel More Alive is a monthly contest, which means you have multiple chances to win. You can <a href="http://bit.ly/16uPrIA">check out the contest details here</a>, but the basics are simple: You just upload a video to the site and every month the panel from Exodus Tours chooses one winner that inspires them, celebrates adventure and represents the value of &#8220;feeling more alive through travel.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s stopping you? January&#8217;s winner is going to Manchupicchu. February&#8217;s winner is going to Rwanda. March through December are there for the taking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very curious. <a href="http://bit.ly/ZCAEVw">Click though to see all the tours that Exodus offers here</a> (there are dozens upon dozens of them). Then tell me below in the comments&#8230;</p>

<p>I not exactly sure how I stumbled across Jon and Tina Reed&#8217;s photography, but the moment I did I realized that it was a stroke of good fortune.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, the first place I saw their photography might have been via their Facebook Fan page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AYearOfLondon">A Year of London</a>. Their blog is <a href="http://blog.nomadicvision.com/">Nomadic Vison</a> and what drew me to them was their current photography project, where they are highlighting all of the great photography in London.</p>
<p>As I have been spending a fair bit of time there, and have already told you that it is a not only a very comfortable place for me, but also a spot I like to photograph myself, I thought I&#8217;d ask them to do a guest post where they could give you a step-by-step guide to photographing this great city.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">__________________________________________</p>
<p>London is a world-class destination with something to impress even the most discerning traveller. For a photographer, it is a playground with endless photographic opportunities. I’ve just completed month two of <a href="http://blog.nomadicvision.com/london/">my year&#8217;s guide to Photographing London</a>. Despite taking a year, I’m going to try guide you through taking photos of London in just one day.</p>
<p>We’ll start at dawn, before sunrise when London is asleep. This is the perfect time to photograph the iconic sites without the crowds. At this time, it can be difficult to get around, so it will help you to be based in zone 1, along the river Thames. The Tower Bridge is the perfect dawn location – it is lit by floodlights, which will help it stand out against a pastel sky. Whilst photographing the bridge, turn your focus along the river towards the Shard, catching the reflections of the skyscraper in the river.</p>
<div id="attachment_9825" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tower-Bridge.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9825 " title="london tower bridge at sunrise" alt="tower bridge at dawn" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tower-Bridge-1024x683.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>early morning light at Tower Bridge</em></p></div>
<p>Just before the sun crosses the horizon, get onto the underground and head over to Westminster Station. Rush across the Westminster Bridge to arrive opposite the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> just in time to capture the first rays of sun striking the palace and the world-famous clock, Big Ben.</p>
<div id="attachment_9826" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Palace-of-Westminster.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9826" title="sunrise over big ben and palace of westminster" alt="Palace of Westminster at dawn" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Palace-of-Westminster-1024x629.jpg" width="1024" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>sun rises over Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster</em></p></div>
<p>Once the light gets too bright and contrasty for photography, head back to Westminster Station and take the district line to <a href="http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/england/london/review-97099.html">Kew Gardens</a>. On your arrival you’ll feel like you’ve stepped out of the city and into the idyllic English village.</p>
<div id="attachment_9827" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kew-Gardens-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9827" title="kew gardens in london with colorful flowers" alt="kew gardens in spring" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kew-Gardens-1-1024x682.jpg" width="1024" height="682" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Kew Gardens in the Spring</em></p></div>
<p>Pop into the Bread Stall to pick up breakfast and your choice of caffeine supplement. The breakfast calories will help power a speedy trip through the Royal Botanical Gardens. By now, the light will be challenging for photography, so use the shady areas to flatten the contrast.  Even a whirlwind trip through Kew Gardens will take you up to lunch.</p>
<p>Head back to the underground and get out at London Bridge. If you’ve picked the right day, street vendors in the <a href="http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/">Borough Food Market</a> will be serving lunch. Whilst looking for the perfect treat, keep your camera out as the area is great for street photography. For the coffee lovers, don’t leave the area without sampling Monmouth Coffee – the queues are much shorter if you order beans to taken home.</p>
<p>After lunch, the light will be horrible for any photography in the daylight. This is the time to explore London’s hidden interior architecture. The Astor House at 2 Temple Place was built by a wealthy American who loved all things British. It is a beautiful example of lavish Victorian architecture and the perfect escape from the harsh daylight.</p>
<p>I’ve now got two options for you:</p>
<h2>Option 1 – The East</h2>
<p>The old shipping yards have been rejuvenated and are now referred to as the Docklands. From Temple, head to Bank Station and jump onto the DLR to Canning Town. Canning Town leads onto the Royal Victoria Docks. Here you can experience London’s only beach, complete with a wakeboarding course. The area is great for photography with a mix of converted warehouses, old shipping cranes and interesting residential sites. Take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_Air_Line_(cable_car)">Emirates Air Line</a> across the Thames and photograph the O2 from the sky.</p>
<div id="attachment_9828" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Victoria-Docks-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9828" title="sunset at victoria docks in london" alt="victoria docks at sunset in london" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Victoria-Docks-1-1024x694.jpg" width="1024" height="694" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>dramatic lighting at Victoria Docks</em></p></div>
<p>From the 02, take a bus to Greenwich town centre. From the town centre, it is a quick walk to the <a href="http://www.ornc.org/visit/attractions/discover-greenwich-visitor-centre">Greenwich Naval Colleges</a>.  Take a few moments to appreciate the Painted Hall which is a dinner hall designed by Christopher Wren and it is full of interesting paintings by James Thornhill.</p>
<p>From the Painted Hall, it is a short walk up the hill to the Greenwich Observatory Point. From this point, there is an amazing view over the Baroque Naval Colleges contrasting with the modern architecture of Canary Wharf. Enjoy the sunset and watch out of the Meridian Laser, a beam of light projected from the Observatory Point.</p>
<div id="attachment_9829" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Royal-Observation-Point-2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9829" title="laser from royal observation point in greenwich london" alt="royal observation point in greenwich" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Royal-Observation-Point-2-1024x656.jpg" width="1024" height="656" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>a view of the laser from the Royal Observation Point</em></p></div>
<h2>Option 2 – The West</h2>
<p>Take the underground line from Temple to Victoria and then take the over ground-line to Battersea Park Rail station. Battersea Park is a large park, that is worth exploring, but because you’re taking photos, head straight to the <a href="http://www.batterseapark.org/history/peace-pagoda/">Peace Pagoda</a> – a large Buddhist monument built on the banks of the Thames River. The contrast of the Buddhist architecture and English park makes for an interesting subject.</p>
<p>From the Peace Pagoda, walk along the Thames River and cross the Chelsea Bridge. The bridge is a great location to photograph the Battersea Power Station – an iconic London site &#8211; that is possibly best known for being on the cover of a Pink Floyd album.</p>
<div id="attachment_9834" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Oxo-Tower-1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9834" title="sunset in london from oxo tower" alt="view from oxo tower in london" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Oxo-Tower-1-1024x672.jpg" width="1024" height="672" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>sunset from Oxo Tower</em></p></div>
<p>After watching the sun set at the power station, get onto the underground at Sloan Square and head to Black Friars Station. From the station, it is a short walk to the Oxo Tower. Few restaurants in London have a better view. Take in London at twilight whilst enjoying a cocktail and then settle down for a meal to top the day off.</p>
<div id="attachment_9830" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Shard.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-9830" title="shard at night with colorful bridge over thames in london" alt="the shard in london" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Shard-1024x669.jpg" width="1024" height="669" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>the Shard in the distance</em></p></div>
<h2>The Perfect Day</h2>
<p>From this guide you can see how much you can actually do in one day in London, provided you have the stamina and energy to get through it.  Try to pick a day when you know the sun will be out as it helps to make the day more enjoyable and leads to better photography.

<p>To say that I had a good time on <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2013/02/finland-via-instagram-visitfinland/">my trip to Finland</a> would be a gross understatement. I&#8217;ll be writing a lot more about my trip in the coming weeks, but I wanted to post up a video that I did from the first day of the trip.</p>
<p>I will be doing a lot more video, now that I am getting more comfortable with shooting them and also editing. Bear with me &#8212; just like my photography, I am hoping that my skill level improves as I try new things, talk to more experts, and just get my hands dirty with effort. For now, though, I hope you enjoy this effort (and please feel <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpHjJBBwCIuqiwLomI8y6DA?sub_confirmation=1">free to subscribe to this YouTube channel</a> also &#8212; that would be much appreciated)</p>

<p>Frankly, I wasn&#8217;t anticipating that I would do up a post or a video about the train ride I took from Helsinki up north on day one of my trip, but&#8230; this was the best train I have yet rode on. The room I stayed in was wonderful and the bathroom, and the really cool shower, was first class.</p>
<h2>Plus, you know how much I love trains.</h2>

<p>I have only been back from Finland for about a week and I am still basking in the memories (and editing a few thousand photos). The entire country was an unexpected revelation.</p>
<p>My major goal in this trip was to see and <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2013/01/headed-to-finland-winter/">photograph the Northern Lights</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I failed. Well, the weather failed me</strong>. As it turned out, pretty much every day I was there was overcast and cloudy, so there wasn&#8217;t a single opportunity to get those photographs.</p>
<p><strong>And I couldn&#8217;t have cared less.</strong></p>
<p>I will be doing a series of posts &#8212; and finally some videos &#8212; from the week I spent in Finland. Not only did I love it, I am already planning a return trip for later this year. Sometimes the unexpected joys are the best ones and Finland in the winter&#8230; I never would have expected to be oohing and ahhhing as much as I was.</p>
<p>Loved, loved, loved it. Here are a few of the Instagram shots I took while there. I hope you like them &#8212; you can <a href="http://instagram.com/michaelshodson" rel="nofollow">follow me along on Instragram by clicking on this link</a>, if you wish. Thanks.</p>

Although I was on their dime, the profuse praise you are going to read in the coming weeks was not remotely influenced by their sponsorship.

<p>A few months ago I was trying to sort out whether I was going to continue doing my occasional <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/lucky-13-interviews-the-best-travel-interviews-on-the-web/">Lucky 13 interviews</a> or not and I decided on a new idea. I have a number of friends whose brains tend to work like mine; that is to say that we wander and bounce between topics and ideas in a chaotic and seemingly random manner.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to capture the sort of conversations I have with these people in reality, but in a readable form.</p>
<p>So came this format. <a href="http://www.everywhereist.com/">Geraldine of The Everywhereist</a> is one of my favorite online friends. Smart, funny, interesting, odd, self-deprecating (a trait I find universal in any truly humorous person), and just plain cool.</p>
<p>Over the past of couple months, as we have both been traveling all over the world, we sent a half-dozen or so emails back and forth to each other with the only rule being &#8220;type as you would talk.&#8221; This is the unedited back and forth conversation we had. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<div id="attachment_9761" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/geraldine-deruiter-everywhereist.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9761 " alt="geraldine deruiter everywhereist drinking coffee" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/geraldine-deruiter-everywhereist.jpeg" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Geraldine, pensively considering her next reply</em></p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Geraldine:</em></strong></p>
<p>Let me start with a question: what do you think of the TSA full-body scanners? I have never been through one. Ever. I&#8217;ve opted out every time I was selected, and gone for a  pat-down. A few times, I&#8217;ve had to fight with agents for the privilege of having their colleagues grope me. Interestingly, the ones who usually have to do the pat-down are very pleasant. It&#8217;s the people you talk to before then who often offer more resistance.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, if you think about it: they don&#8217;t <i>want </i>you to request the pat-down, because it&#8217;s a waste of their time and resources, so they try to dissuade you. But once you prove that you aren&#8217;t going to go through the machine no matter what they say, their colleagues who do administer the pat-down are very pleasant, because the TSA doesn&#8217;t <i>actually </i>want to get sued. I mean, probably.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What do you think? Am I crazy for always opting out?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_______________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Michael:</strong></em></p>
<p>Whoa, slow down there cowboy. We dive right into full-body pat-downs? Too many jokes running through my head.</p>
<p>And since you have already written so movingly and humorously about your recent brush with <a href="http://www.everywhereist.com/wtf-weds-i-have-a-brain-tumor-ive-named-it-steve/">death via your brain tumor</a>&#8230; and yes, I am going to go there&#8230; can&#8217;t you pull the &#8220;Hey TSA a-hole&#8230;just overcame the honors of a brain tumor! What&#8217;s up with you trying to kill me now??!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that pretty much just get you immediately out of all sorts of possible scanner issues?</p>
<p>Hmmmmmm&#8230;. as an idea for causing a serious ruckus starts forming in my head&#8230;</p>
<p>So on your actual question, I usually just roll through the scanner. I&#8217;m not much into pat-downs from overweight, underworked, badly-attired TSA workers.</p>
<p>Quick story (as if I can do that): My brother and I each got a nice, old-style, wind clock from our mother the Christmas right after 9/11. His didn&#8217;t fit in his carry-on bag, so he put it in mine. As we approached the X-ray machine, I realized what these clocks would look like in my bag, turned to him and said &#8220;this is going to be ugly.&#8221;</p>
<p>What was even worse than the full body cavity search that I should have received? That they didn&#8217;t say a single word to me.</p>
<p>Reassuring. Not.</p>
<p>Non sequitur: how do you like your coffee?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_______________________________________________________</p>
<p><em><strong>Geraldine:</strong></em></p>
<p>Funny thing &#8211; I&#8217;ve mentioned the tumor a few times, jokingly (&#8220;Well, I already <i>have </i>a brain tumor, so I&#8217;d rather not blast the sucker with any more radiation.&#8221;) but the response is always blank stares. They just look at me and wrinkle their monobrow, at which point I politely request a patdown.</p>
<p>One gentleman in Milwaukee was a total ass about it. When I mentioned I didn&#8217;t want to go through (without giving a reason why, because WHY SHOULD I?) he started lecturing me &#8211; and he was seriously hostile about it.</p>
<div id="attachment_9762" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 330px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/geraldine-deruiter-rand-fishkin.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9762" title="geraldine deruiter with her husband rand" alt="geraldine deruiter with her husband rand" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/geraldine-deruiter-rand-fishkin.jpeg" width="320" height="213" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Geraldine with Rand, the lovely couple</em></p></div>
<p>&#8220;Is it the radiation? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve heard, but there&#8217;s hardly any. If you are afraid of the radiation from that machine, then you shouldn&#8217;t even fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kept beating the point into me, and it was clear he wasn&#8217;t going to listen to anything I said. So when he started telling me how awful and miserable the patdown was going to be, I just leaned in and whispered, &#8220;What if I <i>like </i>the patdown?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I shimmied my hips a little bit and winked.</p>
<p>That got him to shut the hell up.</p>
<p>The folks who pat me down, I will note, are often incredibly gracious, especially when I mention that I have a hole in my skull (true story) in reply to their inquiry about sensitive areas. They&#8217;re often ask if I&#8217;m doing okay, and one woman even congratulated me on my recovery. It was really lovely.</p>
<p>In response to your non-sequitor: I don&#8217;t drink coffee. Or booze. Sadly, when my tumor got yanked out, my headaches remained, so I avoid a lot of headache triggers. Which include most fun drinks (fruity, boozy, caffeinated, or any combination therein). I AM BASICALLY 90.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s my turn to digress! Have you even flown out of San Diego? It takes YEARS to get through security. It&#8217;s absolutely amazing. Last time we were there, Rand turned to me and hissed, &#8220;The TSA here is on island time.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">____________________________________________________</p>
<p><em><strong>Michael:</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t drink coffee. Or booze.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know you are married to a completely fabulous guy and you may have the most annoyingly, sickeningly, happy marriage of anyone I know, because&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, I have to call off any possibility of a future crush based on those two sentences.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, I will be the guy at the A.A. meeting who says, &#8220;hey, my name is Michael. I&#8217;m an alcoholic, but I&#8217;m sorry folks, just not going to give up the red wine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like the grape. Fermented hops and barley doesn&#8217;t suck too much either.</p>
<p>Funny you mention San Diego. I am actually only about 50 miles from there right now. My folks live in Temecula, a nice little town of 100,000 souls that has absolutely no purpose in the world, other than as a commuter town for both Los Angeles and San Diego. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like the Southern California weather and such, but they&#8217;ve packed way too many damn people in here.</p>
<p>And&#8230; you have a hole in your head? An actual hole? Like&#8230; I can insult you with the classic from about a century ago &#8220;do you have a frickin&#8217; hole in your head?&#8221; And you&#8217;ve have to say yes?</p>
<div id="attachment_9749" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/don-draper-0.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9749" title="don draper mad men with hat fedora" alt="don draper 50s hat" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/don-draper-0-200x300.jpeg" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>everyone looks cooler</em></p></div>
<p>How cool is that. What happens when it rains? Do you wear hats?</p>
<p>Speaking of hats, can&#8217;t we do something to bring them back? How great does a woman look in a nice hat? Why don&#8217;t women wear hats more often? And a good fedora?</p>
<p>JFK seemed like a nice enough guy, but I&#8217;ll never forgive him for single-handedly killing the hat wearing culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_______________________________________</p>
<p><em><strong>Geraldine:</strong></em></p>
<p>Okay. Ahem. Sorry for the, um, two week delay in getting back to you. I had to head down to California, where I was able to gather even further evidence that my family is &#8230; well &#8230;</p>
<p>You know, I have trouble describing them. They&#8217;re amazing. And strange. One Christmas, my mother gave my brother and I copies of Twilight: The Board Game. It was a little befuddling, as neither my brother nor I have ever expressed any interest in the canon. Also, we aren&#8217;t 12 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/10063615-1263899810-458000.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9747" alt="Twilight: The Board Game" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/10063615-1263899810-458000.jpeg" width="420" height="420" /></a>My mom just saw our puzzled expressions and laughed and laughed. Her only explanation: &#8220;You know when people work for the same company, they get the same gift?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was it. No other clue as to what was going on there. She&#8217;s a quirky one.</p>
<p>This year, she gave me a very lovely bracelet (which I kept) as well as a neck pillow that had a massage device attached to it. Sadly, the pillow did not make it on the plane ride back with us, because it looked like an explosive device.</p>
<p>I swear, I think my mother is trying to get me strip-searched by the TSA. Perhaps she&#8217;s convinced my life isn&#8217;t interesting enough as it is, and that&#8217;s her way of spicing it up.</p>
<p>As for the hole in my head, I suppose a better way of describing it would be a hole in my skull (and yes, I occasionally do use the phrase &#8220;I need that like I need another hole in my head&#8221; &#8211; but I don&#8217;t say it nearly as much as you&#8217;d think). Scar tissue has grown in, so it&#8217;s not really a soft spot anymore, and my neurosurgeon says that eventually the bone will fuse back together in that spot. But, rather interestingly, I&#8217;ll always have a dent right there.</p>
<p>So even long after my hair grows back (I still have a bald spot), you&#8217;ll be able to find the spot where I had surgery.</p>
<p>My aunt and mother were horrified by the fact that I had a hole in my skull. Their suggestion was that I start wearing elaborate hats so that people wouldn&#8217;t touch my head (which is interesting, because I found that there wasn&#8217;t much of a risk of that. People aren&#8217;t too keen to press on your skull, and they aren&#8217;t more likely to do when they&#8217;ve found out you&#8217;ve had brain surgery).</p>
<p>But maybe I will start wearing them, because I&#8217;m rather fond of hats. And I have a great collection amassed (people tend to buy you hats when you&#8217;ve had surgery on you head. It&#8217;s grand). And I&#8217;d argue that they are making a comeback. At least among hipsters.</p>
<p>How was your holiday?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">__________________________________________________</p>
<p><em><strong>Michael:</strong></em></p>
<p>Hats really need to make a comeback. But I&#8217;m not sure I <a href="http://diehipster.wordpress.com/">trust the hipsters</a> to lead the charge. In any topic, frankly. But I digress&#8230;</p>
<p>Holidays and the joys of family. Let me say this at the top, because my folks tend to find everything I write anywhere on the interwebs &#8211; love my family. Love. Can&#8217;t imagine having more supportive and cool parents. Get along great with my brother and sister and her husband and kids.</p>
<p>Love them.</p>
<p>That being said, I just got back from a dentist appointment that my father set up while I was home for the holidays. Wouldn&#8217;t take no for an answer. I don&#8217;t want to do a whole biography for you, so &#8220;let me sum up.&#8221; I&#8217;m 45 years old. I was a pretty successful attorney for about 10 years. I circled the world without getting on an airplane. I&#8217;ve managed to permanently be on the road since 2008 with nary a major problem.</p>
<p>But my parents felt it necessary to set up a dentist appointment for me. Visions of high school abounded in my head.</p>
<p>And its not just the dentist appointment. I borrowed my mother&#8217;s car to drive to Los Angeles to have lunch with a friend.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do you know where the SOS button is in the car?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, Mom, I think I&#8217;ll be ok.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But if you have a problem, you can just hit the button and someone will come help you.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Mom, you do know that I somehow managed to go around the world without a cell phone, right?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;OK&#8230;. but here, take my cell phone, in case you have a problem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>How have I managed to survive on my own so far?</p>
<p>You have a dent in your head? Like an actual dent? Do you have a series of ready jokes when people ask about it?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hail damage.</li>
<li>Sonny Bono and I went skiing one day&#8230;</li>
<li>My warranty had JUST expired. Those corporate flunkies know how to time those things, don&#8217;t they?</li>
<li>I knew I should have ordered the Skull Pro, but I cheaped out with the regular version.</li>
<li>Its not a dent, its a divot. I&#8217;m a golfer. Get it?</li>
</ul>
<p>So let me leave you on this note. The dentist somehow convinced me to replace one of my old fillings and do some sort of laser thing on parts of my gums. You know the worst thing about going to the dentist for me?</p>
<p>Not the sound (or smell) of the drill biting into your teeth. Not the taste or crunchy feel of the tooth polish they use. Not the inane banter they expect you to engage in, while your mouth is half-numbed and they have both hands, a drill, and that spit-scooper-upper thing inside it. No, none of that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s when the dentist is flossing my teeth and says, &#8220;well, as long as you are flossing daily, things are looking pretty good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dudette, they might as well call my annual dentist appointment &#8220;my annual flossing.&#8221; I can never get up the courage to confess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Sounds good. I&#8217;ll knock that out every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lying, lazy bastard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_____________________________________________________</p>
<p><em><strong>Geraldine:</strong></em></p>
<p>I owe you some parting words on all of this, don&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually amazed &#8211; and somewhat still endeared &#8211; by how much my family babies me. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; it&#8217;s positively infuriating at times, but it&#8217;s born of love, so I usually keep my mouth shut, grit my teeth, and at the end of the day, I realize it&#8217;s not the worst thing in the world.</p>
<p>Plus, if they knew all the trouble I got into when I&#8217;m off on my own, exploring a city? They would probably all have synchronized coronaries.</p>
<p>Strangely, the brain tumor kind of helped with all of that. It let them know that there are some things that I can handle. And yes, I have a dent in my head, from where they removed my skull. Even if and when the skull grows back, I should the dent should remain; a souvenir from that one time I had brain surgery.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I&#8217;m stressed, I run my fingers over it. It&#8217;s a subtle reminder that whatever I&#8217;m dealing with is not such a big deal.</p>
<p>And really, why should my family, why should anyone, waste their time worrying about me? I&#8217;m doing just fine. Hell, I even floss nightly. If there&#8217;s a better sign of having your shit together, I can&#8217;t think of one. <img src='http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>Let me take a moment to defend the country that I was randomly lucky enough to be born in. I&#8217;ve previously written about how the U.S. is the <a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/2012/07/us-most-popular-country-worldwide/">most popular country in the world</a>, but let&#8217;s address an issue that seems to really annoy some people when a story pops up on it every few months.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Americans <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewbender/2012/01/30/record-number-of-americans-now-hold-passports/">don&#8217;t have a passport</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_7733" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 493px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/344_32733561655_665141655_1094477_1107_n1.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-7733" alt="grapes on the vine in winery napa" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/344_32733561655_665141655_1094477_1107_n1.jpeg" width="483" height="322" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>One of my favorite places in the US &#8212; Napa Valley</em></p></div>
<h2>That&#8217;s not a bad thing.</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s get a few facts out of the way. First, <a href="http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/travel/vacation/ready_set_go/whti_bg/">until 2007</a> you didn&#8217;t need a passport to visit Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean. You could have done a fair bit of traveling internationally without one, which partly explains the limited number of Americans with passports.</p>
<p>Second, the number of U.S. citizens that hold a passport is increasing dramatically. The number of people holding a passport has <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/passport/ppi/stats/stats_890.html">more than doubled</a> in just the last ten years. It is more than 15 times the number that held a passport in 1989.</p>
<p>Third, the United States is pretty damn massive in and of itself. The area of the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) is <strong>almost two and a half times</strong> the size of the European Union.</p>
<p>I spent about twenty years of my life primarily exploring the United States &#8212; and frankly, I could have spent another twenty years doing nothing more than that.</p>
<h2>What if the U.S. was Europe?</h2>
<p>The European Union currently consists of 27 member states (as said earlier, spread out over less than half the size of the U.S.). Until the Schengen Agreement was incorporated into the EU&#8217;s legal framework in the late 1990s, if you were an EU citizen going from one country to another, you&#8217;d need a passport to do so.</p>
<p>Think about the size of European countries for a second. The United States is the <a href="http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/world_statistics_by_area.htm">third largest country by size</a> in the world. The largest EU country is France, which checks in as the 48th largest country in the world, behind Botswana, Burma, and Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>France is significantly smaller than the state of Texas.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/texas-europe-map.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9704" alt="compare size texas verses europe" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/texas-europe-map.jpeg" width="616" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Just take a look at that map for a second and imagine. Leipzig is right about where Dallas/Ft. Worth is. Vaduz is about where Austin is. Right down there near Vienna would be Houston.</p>
<p><strong>You think if a passport was needed for most of the 20th century to go from Dallas to Houston to Austin that perhaps more US citizens would have them? Of course.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not exactly shocking that the percentages of Europeans holding passports are significantly higher than in the States.</p>
<p>Italy is smaller than New Mexico. Austria is smaller than Maine. Switzerland is smaller than West Virgina. Belgium is smaller than Maryland. If Italians want to go to the beach in Croatia, right next door, they need a passport. If someone in Atlanta wants to go to the beach, they head a few hours down the road to Florida.</p>
<p>And frankly, the US is not only big, it is incredibly diverse. If you were going to choose one country in the world that had the most to see, do, and experience, there is no doubt it would be the U.S.</p>
<p>The United States established the first national park in the world, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, in 1872. The total amount of land dedicated to national parks in the US is now around  51.9 million acres (210,000 km<sup>2</sup>), <strong>which is roughly the size of Austria, Ireland and Croatia put together</strong>. On top of that are hundreds of state parks covering tens of millions more acres (though I couldn&#8217;t find a solid number on their total sizes).</p>
<p>The cultural diversity in the States runs the gamut also, from cities as varied as New Orleans to Los Angeles to Seattle to Memphis to Chicago to Miami to New York City to Boston. The culture and tradition of the Deep South is a world apart from the Pacific Northwest, which is a world apart from Southern California, which Midwesterners would feel alien in also. Music festivals, sporting events, water activities, mountains, beaches, theater &#8212; you name it, there is a good chance the U.S. has it.</p>
<p>So if Americans want to spend their time traveling around their own massive and diverse country, I&#8217;m really not going to condemn them too much. I was one of those people myself for about 20 years.</p>
<div id="attachment_9694" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 665px"><a href="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/maine-collage-photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-9694" title="sights in maine" alt="maine collage photo" src="http://www.goseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/maine-collage-photo-1024x614.jpg" width="655" height="393" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>some of the sights of the great state of Maine</em></p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to think if there is any more diverse country on the planet. Can&#8217;t say that I can think of any.</p>
<h2>Look, I understand the value of international travel.</h2>
<p>Obviously I am a proponent of it. I&#8217;ve been living abroad full-time since the end of 2008. I&#8217;m certainly <strong>not advocating</strong> the position that people should only travel in their home country, no matter which one you live in. I strongly believe there are great benefits to getting out and seeing the world &#8212; experiencing total alien cultures, seeing how people think and believe coming from different backgrounds, seeing some of the amazing sights all over the world, and so forth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an international travel advocate. Get out there and see it all (preferably at the ground level).</p>
<p><strong>But to the same extent, lay off the whole BS argument that somehow Americans are backward and inferior because a majority don&#8217;t hold a passport. </strong></p>
<p>It is cheap American bashing. There are plenty of valid reasons to complain about the U.S., but this one is just a simple-minded throwaway &#8220;argument.&#8221;</p>
