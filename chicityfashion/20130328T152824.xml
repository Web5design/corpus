				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish not only has great taste in clothes, she&#8217;s also one of the nicest people I&#8217;ve ever met. And like Rachel Roy says, <em>kindness is always fashionable</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_saifer_berngard" alt=" photo sam_intro.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam_intro.jpg" width="569" height="830" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8272"></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to a <a href="http://splash.suntimes.com" target="_blank">SPLASH</a> event, you&#8217;ve experienced Sam&#8217;s hard work all coming together. As the director of the new magazine since September, she&#8217;s really making a SPLASH on the Chicago events scene (yeah, I went there).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_sun_times_splash" alt=" photo sam2.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam2.jpg" width="899" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen her smiling face at the best parties around the city but do you know her favorite restaurant, best part about her job or what she wanted to be growing up? Well, now you do&#8230;</p>
<p><b>What do you love most about your neighborhood?<br />
</b><em>I love working, going to events and out to new restaurants in the craziness and always buzzing neighborhood that is River North during the week. But at the end of the day, nothing beats going home to my lovely neighborhood of Bucktown/Wicker Park  that is close enough for convenience but far enough away that I can feel separated from it all. I can walk out of my door &#8211; and two steps away, I have the best yoga studio, cafes and most importantly, the cutest shops to explore. I always feel like I am on vacation when I am in my hood.</em></p>
<p><b>What do you think of fashion in Chicago?<br />
</b><em>I think it is completely underrated. I always hear people complain about the lack of shopping in Chicago, but last time I checked &#8211; we have just as good of shopping as any other major city. And every time guests visit us, they cannot get over how over the top and amazing my friends dress. I am proud of our unique fashion sense and how dolled up Chicagoans get to go out at night! We take our time getting dressed. You don&#8217;t have to look homeless to have cutting edge fashion (New York &#8211; I am talking to you).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="splash_office" alt=" photo Untitled.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Untitled.jpg" width="679" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>What’s your favorite thing about Chicago?<br />
</b><em>I love Chicago, because I am not from here, but I never feel like an outsider. Everyone is so genuine, and as much of a cliche as it is &#8211; the midwest truly has the best people. I have lived on every coast, and Chicago is the only place I have truly called home.</em></p>
<p><b>My go-to restaurant in Chicago is….<br />
</b><em>I am a huge fan of Brendan Sodikoff [of Au Cheval, Maude's, Bavette's, Gilt Bar &amp; Doughnut Vault] &#8211; the burger at Au Cheval is not to be believed, but Hot Chocolate  is definitely my go to with my hubby. It&#8217;s the best for brunch, dinner and sitting at the bar for late night dessert after a night out. It never disappoints!</em></p>
<p><b>My advice to out-of-towners…<br />
</b><em>I swear our summers make it all worth living here!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_saifer" alt=" photo fashionquote.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/fashionquote.jpg" width="682" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>What impact does fashion have on your life?<br />
</b><em>Fashion has always been a huge part of my life. I find that fashion is my creative outlet. I am the girl who lays out my outfit the night before work every single day. That is my tranquil time I have to myself where I don&#8217;t have to think about anything except for what necklace goes best with what shoes and if I need to wear tights. Some people meditate, but creating looks for myself is seriously therapeutic for me<b>.</b> </em></p>
<p><b>The best part about my job is…<br />
</b><em>I love that my job is an extension of my life &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the work/life blend, and I have been in this industry long enough that my working relationships have become real relationships. It&#8217;s all about who you work with and who you know &#8211; I have gotten to know wonderful people that I have the pleasure of working with everyday.</em></p>
<p><b></b><b>When I was a kid I wanted to be…<br />
</b><em id="__mceDel">Famous. Ha! I always knew I wanted to be in the fashion magazine world in some way. I went through a total journalism phase where I was destined to be an editor or on TV. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I just love to talk to people, and I enjoy being out and about. Event planning at a media company seemed to be the perfect balance.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="accessories and candy" alt=" photo candy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/candy.jpg" width="1024" height="678" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>If I had all the money in the world I would wear….<br />
</b><em>I would still dress the same and match the high end pieces with the low. I am a firm believer that money really can&#8217;t buy style. Of course I may indulge a bit more in my favorite designer brands &#8211; Emilio Pucci, Valentino, Marc Jacobs, Proenza Schouler, Lanvin. I may travel to Paris a bit more for the unique pieces, but for now I can just enjoy their Target collections <img src='http://chicityfashion.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p>
<p><b>I describe my style as…<br />
</b><em id="__mceDel">Feminine &amp; classic with a bohemian twist. My friends and family like to tease that I never will wear the same thing twice. I mix &amp; match things all of the time and try to never repeat an exact outfit. It&#8217;s trickery to make it appear that my closet is bigger than it is!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="splash candy room" alt=" photo sam7_favorite.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam7_favorite.jpg" width="682" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t she the greatest?</p>
<p>Hope you&#8217;re enjoying my <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/category/chi-citys-most-stylish/" target="_blank">Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish</a> features so far. Until next month&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/shopping-editorial/" target="_blank">last week</a> that the stunning Noel has an equally gorgeous younger sister, Asia. When I happened to choose both of them for this shoot and later found out they were sisters, it was a must that we shot them together. And of course, we did!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="street_style_editorial" alt=" photo IMG_2105copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2105copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8250"></span></p>
<p>My initial inspiration behind this entire editorial was street style, but having models engage in &#8220;every day&#8221; tasks/errands made it a little more dynamic. Although I loved every single photo I posted, I have to say that these are my favorite and I just had to save the best for last. I mean, look at these girls. HOW FREAKIN&#8217; FANTASTIC ARE THEY?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="accessories_street_style" alt=" photo IMG_2116copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2116copy.jpg" width="1024" height="536" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="models_street_style" alt=" photo IMG_2137copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2137copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="mcqueen_clutch" alt=" photo IMG_2132copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2132copy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="street_style_chicago" alt=" photo IMG_2162copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2162copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="ford_models" alt=" photo IMG_2245copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2245copy.jpg" width="1024" height="641" border="0" /></p>
<p>And now it&#8217;s time for my last Ford interview. Take it away, Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Beauty product you can&#8217;t live without?<br />
</strong><em>Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. I use it every morning. It has great coverage but still looks natural.</em></p>
<p><strong>What would you have as your last meal?<br />
</strong><em>Well, I LOVE food&#8230;but I&#8217;d have to pick a big steak with mashed potatoes and gravy.</em></p>
<p><strong>If you could only choose one…personal chef, masseuse, or chauffeur?<br />
</strong><em>In-house masseuse. It&#8217;s really the only thing you can&#8217;t do yourself. Plus, I love to cook.</em></p>
<p><strong>What actress would you want to play you in a movie?<br />
</strong><em id="__mceDel">Dakota Fanning. I love that no matter how famous she&#8217;s become, she&#8217;s always stayed true to herself. I admire that. </em></p>
<p><strong>If you could have backstage access to any concert, what would it be?<br />
</strong><em>Usher! He has such an amazing voice and he&#8217;s a great dancer. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always get excited about store openings in Chicago because it almost feels like we&#8217;ve been validated. Like when we got Lanvin and Louboutin&#8230;it made me feel really cool (and it&#8217;s not like I represent the city of Chicago or anything).</p>
<p>If you have similar feelings about store openings here in the city or you just need even more of an excuse to shop, then you better keep reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="madewell_chicago" alt=" photo madewell_campaign.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/madewell_campaign.jpg" width="588" height="672" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8245"></span></p>
<p>Going in order of appearance (that is, appearance in Chicago)&#8230;</p>
<p>If you were curious to see who&#8217;s taking the place of Starbucks next to Barneys, you won&#8217;t have to wait much longer. <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15N3SEI" target="_blank">Madewell </a></strong>will be officially be open to the public on April 3 at 10am. If you&#8217;re looking for a patchwork chambray button down or a neon yellow A-line skirt this spring (just a few of my favorites I saw from their latest collection) then I suggest you head to Oak and Rush in about a week and check out the new store.</p>
<p><em>Location: 932 N. Rush</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="azza_store_opening" alt=" photo photo.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo.jpg" width="768" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>Local designer Azeeza Khan is opening her very first <strong><a href="http://www.atelierazza.com/#home" target="_blank">Atelier AZZA</a></strong> showroom in the <a href="http://www.theshopsatnorthbridge.com" target="_blank">Shops at North Bridge</a> next month (tentatively April 8). According to Azeeza, &#8220;My by-appointment-only showroom model has been very limiting in more ways than one so I am looking forward to reintroducing some of my best sellers with this mainstream access, as well as all new designs centered around affordability.&#8221; So basically this means&#8230;you can get your studded blazer fix at your convenience.</p>
<p>FYI this is an exclusive first look at the AZZA windows, taken by Azeeza herself&#8230;via iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Location: 520 North Michigan, 3rd floor</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="tom_ford_chicago" alt=" photo tf.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/tf.jpg" width="1004" height="949" border="0" /></p>
<p>A reliable inside source (see how <em>US Weekly</em> I am?) tells me that <a href="http://www.tomford.com/#/en" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Ford</strong></a> on Oak Street is indeed confirmed. Tentatively opening this Fall&#8230;but when it comes to construction, dates seem to be meaningless. So if you were all about Tom Ford&#8217;s Fall &#8217;13 collection (seen above), you&#8217;ll be happy to know that you&#8217;ll be able to get it (RTW, bags, shoes and other accessories) here in Chicago. Maybe Tom himself will make an appearance. A girl can dream, right?</p>
<p><em>Location: [supposedly] 58 E. Oak (old Esquire Theater)</em></p>
<p>Now, if I could only get Proenza to open up a Chicago location&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Varsity jackets have been making somewhat of a revival the last few years. This is something I personally enjoy because it makes me a little nostalgic. One, because I remember my parents having them (similar to <a href="http://bit.ly/X3U8q8" target="_blank">this</a> but with black sleeves) and two, sports weren&#8217;t really my thing so I never actually got to own a real varsity jacket. Instead, I got to wear a super uncomfortable cheerleading uniform with orthopedic-looking gym shoes&#8230;and those, my friends, were great times.</p>
<p>So getting back on track&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="varsity_jackets" alt=" photo 2896-Le-21eme-Adam-Katz-Sinding-After-Rodarte-Mercedes-Benz-New-York-Fashion-Week-Spring-Summer-2013_AKS7827.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/2896-Le-21eme-Adam-Katz-Sinding-After-Rodarte-Mercedes-Benz-New-York-Fashion-Week-Spring-Summer-2013_AKS7827.jpg" width="799" height="625" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8240"></span></p>
<p>Alongside things like capes, knee-high boots and white wide-leg pants, varsity jackets are something that&#8217;s always in the back of my mind but I never really executed in my wardrobe. After seeing this photo on <a href="http://le-21eme.com/after-rodarte-new-york-city/" target="_blank">Le 21ème</a> from this past September, this perfect-transition-to-spring item is on my mind once again.</p>
<p>What I especially love about varsity jackets is that they&#8217;re great for both men and women. If you&#8217;re a guy looking to splurge on this type of outerwear, please buy this one from <a href="http://bit.ly/16TjwSb" target="_blank">Saint Laurent</a>&#8230;and let me borrow it. I thank you in advance.</p>
<p>So if varsity jackets happen to be on your mind as well, then it&#8217;s time you get your fix.</p>

</a></p>
<p><em><strong>WHY</strong> (am I wearing it):<br />
</em>I&#8217;m declaring it now. I refuse to wear a heavy coat in my What Why Where posts until next Winter. Although it was an astonishing 20 degrees when we took these photos, I couldn&#8217;t help but not wear boots. But the real star of this look is GET IT GIRL. Phillip Lim did some quirky tees and tanks for <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/complete/S2013RTW-PLIM" target="_blank">Spring 2013</a> and the second that collection was available for pre-order on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=281800.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9895&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fmodaoperandi.com%2Ftrunkshows" target="_blank">Moda Operandi</a>, I was all over it. When it comes to a statement t-shirt like that, I tend to keep the rest simple; leather pants, pumps, a sleek clutch (although this one happens to glow in the dark&#8230;note to self: need a new set of &#8220;night time&#8221; photos). But one more statement I couldn&#8217;t resist&#8230;those DANNIJO earrings. They compliment Mr. Lim quite nicely, no?</p>
<p><em><strong>WHERE</strong> (can you get it):</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in a while, I enjoy a deceiving title. You probably thought this would be about beauty products that give you the perfect glow, right? If that&#8217;s what you prefer then I suggest you <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/new-beauty-routine/" target="_blank">read this</a>. But if you&#8217;re open to new ways of glowing then I suggest you continue on here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="glow_in_the_dark_shoes" alt=" photo 26319_10151538674647394_66790539_n.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/26319_10151538674647394_66790539_n.jpg" width="518" height="778" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8222"></span></p>
<p>Ever since I was a kid, I&#8217;ve had a fascination with things that glow in the dark. Remember those stick-on glow in the dark stars? I not only had them on my ceiling but I also put them on my dresser, TV, and maybe even on a few of my stuffed animals (I had an obsession with those too). I&#8217;ve thought about glow in the dark clothing and accessories but I&#8217;ve never seen anyone execute it well. After all, it can get a little &#8220;gimmicky.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Jimmy Choo did those <a href="http://bit.ly/YGUBtF" target="_blank">light up heels</a> (which I&#8217;m still thinking about by the way) I knew glow in the dark accessories had to be in my near future. And thanks to designers like <a href="http://bit.ly/102ew8w" target="_blank">Alexander Wang</a> and <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=254155.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=6893&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2FShop%2FSearch%3Fkeywords%3Dtom%2Bbinns%2526x%3D0%2526y%3D0" target="_blank">Tom Binns</a>, my fashion dreams are coming true. If you want to get the full GITD (yeah we&#8217;re on an abbreviation status now) look, click through the images. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>On a side note, I learned from <a href="http://www.missladyfinger.com/post/manicure-muse-etro-fall-13/" target="_blank">Miss Ladyfinger</a> that even quality nail polish has gone glow in the dark (see: <a href="http://bit.ly/13d2Y8S" target="_blank">Illamasqua in Rare</a>). Now that would be one hell of a #ManiMonday!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/gym-editorial/" target="_blank">Dominique</a>, it was all about those eyebrows and now it&#8217;s time to obsess over Noel with those killer LIPS. This girl is insanely gorgeous (sometimes I just can&#8217;t even look at these photos because she&#8217;s too pretty). And as an added bonus? She has a stunning sister (who you&#8217;ll see next week in the last installment of my Ford editorials).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="ford_model_editorial" alt=" photo IMG_1793copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_1793copy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8209"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already hit the main &#8220;every day&#8221; activities &#8212; <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/ford-model-chicago/" target="_blank">putting on makeup</a>, <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/chicago-fashion-editorial/" target="_blank">coffee</a> (in this case there was cake&#8230;rainbow cake), <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/gym-editorial/" target="_blank">hitting the gym</a>&#8230;and now it&#8217;s time for my personal favorite errand, the grocery store.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="model_sunglasses" alt=" photo IMG_1800copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_1800copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>

<p>And for even more Noel&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your favorite part about Chicago?<br />
</strong><em>It&#8217;s hard to choose just one. I love the beach, the independent restaurants and most of all&#8230;the great places to shop.</em></p>
<p><strong>What designer inspires you most?<br />
</strong><em>Betsey Johnson. All of her designs are so loud and unique, which I feel is much like my personality</em></p>
<p><strong>If you could only choose one…personal chef, masseuse, or chauffeur?<br />
</strong><em>In-house masseuse for sure. Massages are one of my favorite things ever. Plus, I love to drive and cook so I wouldn&#8217;t want someone doing it for me!</em></p>
<p><strong>Guilty pleasure TV show?<br />
</strong><em id="__mceDel"><em>The First 48. I love all of the action and mystery. </em></em></p>
<p><strong>If you could travel anywhere in the world (all expenses paid), where would you go?<br />
</strong><em>Brazil, hands down. From what I&#8217;ve seen in photos, they have the most amazing beaches and waterfalls. They&#8217;re so beautiful, it almost looks fake!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people have the same concerns when it comes to working from home: getting easily distracted, not leaving your apartment, and when it comes to the creative industry, being uninspired. Well thankfully there&#8217;s nothing good on TV during the day, I tend to have plenty of meetings and events, and I&#8217;ve figured out a way to WERK from home.</p>
<p>So for those of you who are in the same boat (whether you&#8217;re in fashion or not) or those thinking about making the switch&#8230;I want to show you how you can WERK from home. It&#8217;s much more fun. I promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="work from home" alt=" photo IMG_6792.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/IMG_6792.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8182"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying my office is for everyone and I realize not every person has a spare room to convert into an office, but there are little things you can add to your living space to make it an inspiring, functioning work place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="stylish_office" alt=" photo IMG_6784.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/IMG_6784.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p>Starting small, a stylish notebook or notepad always makes jotting things down more fun. Although I&#8217;m at a computer most of the day, I&#8217;m always writing down random things that I could easily type&#8230;but I don&#8217;t. I found those quirky sticky notes (from the first photo) at a local boutique last year. Such an upgrade from Post-its, right? And after I&#8217;ve been Starbucks-free for a good 5 months now, a nice mug is a must. I&#8217;m pretty partial towards <a href="http://bit.ly/WzT2Rr" target="_blank">Missoni</a> but <a href="http://bit.ly/WzT1Nq" target="_blank">Jonathan Adler</a> has some great options as well. And to get the creative juices flowing a little more, a good candle goes a long way. Who knows&#8230;maybe this blog post only happened because I lit my <a href="http://bit.ly/ZW2JZk" target="_blank">Diptyque</a>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="fashion_office" alt=" photo IMG_6793.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/IMG_6793.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p>When it comes to foreign or independent magazines, I&#8217;m kind of a hoarder. I can throw away an American <em>Vogue</em> any day (unless it&#8217;s a September issue&#8230;then it usually takes me a few months) but I can&#8217;t seem to toss the French <em>Vogue</em> from 2 years ago. They&#8217;re always cool to look back on and because they&#8217;re not easy to find in Chicago, I feel it&#8217;s necessary to keep them all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="fashion_books" alt=" photo IMG_6810.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/IMG_6810.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p>Along with magazines, my ever-growing collection of coffee table books (mostly in the fashion category) are a go-to when looking for inspiration. They also happen to be a great way to spruce up your space. Whether stacked on a shelf, on a table or at your desk&#8230;they make for great reading material and a stylish accent to any room.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend getting a real life Pinterest board (which in my case is really just a piece of metal with magnets&#8230;a cork board will also suffice). I mean, what else am I supposed to do with old fashion week invites and Polaroids?</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking to WERK from home (and not just work from home) then look no further&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think of overalls, 1 of 2 things probably come to mind&#8230;farmer and/or 90s, right? I mostly think of the 90s, because I freakin loved these things and I still miss my <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/throwback-thursday/" target="_blank">white overalls with stars on them</a> from age 7.</p>
<p>Basically where I&#8217;m getting at is&#8230;I really wanted an excuse to use this picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="nsync_overalls" alt="Photobucket" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/keepaustinstylish.jpg" width="347" height="493" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8166"></span></p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t think of these denim jumpsuit creations as a trend of the past, because they&#8217;ve made a recent revival. Now you can find them in stores once again and they&#8217;re already everywhere on the streets. Of course, they&#8217;ve gotten a serious upgrade since &#8216;N Sync.</p>
<p><a href="http://s1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/?action=view&amp;current=overallsstreetstyle.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/overallsstreetstyle.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>I had no desire to see overalls again until Phillip Lim made a leather variety for <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/complete/2013RST-PLIM" target="_blank">Resort 2013</a>&#8230;and now I think of them much differently. Although this trend isn&#8217;t necessarily the most flattering, the silhouettes in recent years have become more forgiving. Whether you want shorts, pants, a dark wash, light wash, distressed or even a <a href="http://bit.ly/WyGIkk" target="_blank">snake print with leather trim</a>&#8230;there&#8217;s an overall to fit your personality&#8230;if you so choose to dive into this trend.</p>
<p>Take a look&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you been getting the urge to start a blog but fear this might happen to you?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="blogger street style" alt="Photobucket" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/ccf3/all-blogs-post-the-same-stuff.jpg" width="650" height="432" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8151"></span>And no, I don&#8217;t mean being snapped by a street style photographer during fashion week. With so many blogs out there today, it can be intimidating and overwhelming to start now. BUT I have a solution for you. How about taking my very first <a href="http://bit.ly/Z3sBjL" target="_blank">Fashion Blogging For Beginners</a> class? Yes, this is actually happening.</p>
<p>On April 9th at 6pm you can learn everything you need to know about starting a blog. Well, everything I think you need to know at least. I&#8217;ve been doing this blogging thing for over 3 years now so I have to assume I know what I&#8217;m doing at this point&#8230;right?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited that <a href="http://www.publichotels.com/chicago/home/" target="_blank">Public Hotels</a> has offered a space in the Library area for me to teach. I want to keep this class small so it&#8217;s not intimidating. So, keep in mind that space is limited. And as a plus by being at Public, you can order, food, drinks, coffee (they carry my favorite, La Colombe!) or whatever you&#8217;d like during class. I am all about drinking and learning so feel free to go for it.</p>
<p>See what it&#8217;s all about and <strong>sign up <a href="http://bit.ly/Z3sBjL" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. Wear your best thinking hat (it does not have to be <a href="http://bit.ly/XNWk4r" target="_blank">Maison Michel</a>) and let&#8217;s get our knowledge on.</p>
<p>**UPDATE 3/20: The class sold out within 24 hours! Makes me feel pretty cool&#8230;not going to lie. BUT I&#8217;m planning on teaching another blogging for beginners class PLUS a more advanced class for those who already have a blog. So be sure to sign up for CCF updates (at the bottom of the page) to stay informed. Thank you to everyone who signed up. It&#8217;s going to be a fun night!</p>
