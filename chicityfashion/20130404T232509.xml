				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely do &#8220;looks for less&#8221; features because honestly, it&#8217;s not my forte. I&#8217;m all about mixing high/low but when it comes to finding a similar look for less, I usually just hit up Zara to see what knocked-off runway trends strike my fancy.</p>
<p>But because I love a good <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/dress-with-pants/" target="_blank">fashion challenge</a>, I decided to take this one on. Except I&#8217;m tired of the phrase &#8220;looks for less&#8221; so I&#8217;m renaming it &#8220;on the cheap.&#8221; Hope that&#8217;s alright with you&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="stylish_backpacks" alt=" photo ScreenShot2013-04-04at103505AM.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ScreenShot2013-04-04at103505AM.png" width="644" height="476" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8331"></span></p>
<p>Now, there are certain things in your wardrobe that are definitely worth the investment: a high quality black blazer, great fitting jeans, an everyday bag, etc. Others are not necessarily worth the money, especially if it&#8217;s super trendy. I&#8217;m not saying never splurge on a trend, as long as you&#8217;ll think you will still be wearing it in at least a year from the purchase date.</p>
<p>Although I am guilty of splurging on things I probably shouldn&#8217;t have, we all make mistakes and learn from them (except when I got bangs 3 different times even though I know they don&#8217;t work on me&#8230;I guess third time&#8217;s a charm). Whether you have your eye on <a href="http://bit.ly/14QlsM5" target="_blank">The Row backpack</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/14QlJi2" target="_blank">Marant sneakers</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/12lCr4s" target="_blank">Kenzo tiger sweatshirt</a>, feel free to splurge&#8230;but if you&#8217;re hesitant, I have the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the new <em>Great Gatsby</em> movie coming out soon, all things Gatsby themed are making a comeback. But <em>Sheridan Road</em> Magazine is taking it to another level for their April issue with one glamorous Gatsby wedding.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="gatsby_wedding" alt=" photo 45538_515856315126614_86046009_n.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/45538_515856315126614_86046009_n.jpg" width="695" height="960" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8325"></span></p>
<p>This shoot was another prodigy of stylist Michael Favia and photographer Billy Rood (who did all of my <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/tag/chicityfashion-editorial/" target="_blank">Ford editorials</a>) and ironically, I went to high school with the cover model Eleanor and graduated with her brother. Chicago is much smaller than it may seem!</p>
<p>Because Michael is so awesome (I mean, he is <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/michael-favia-stylist/" target="_blank">Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish</a>Â after all) he invited me on set for this photoshoot and I even got to assistant style once again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="behind_the_scenes" alt=" photo photo4.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo4.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="lanvin_kids" alt=" photo photo3.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo3.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>Oh yeah that&#8217;s baby Lanvin for the flower girl. No big deal. But seriously&#8230;how precious is this?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="flower_girl" alt=" photo photo1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo1.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p><em>Sheridan Road</em> really went all out for this shoot: location at the enormous Schweppes Estate in Lake Forest (which has the coolest bath tub I&#8217;ve ever seen), a Rolls Royce for the &#8220;bride&#8221; &amp; &#8220;groom&#8221; and even a real catered meal for the wedding reception photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="lux_tub" alt=" photo photo2-1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo2-1.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>So if you want to get in the Gatsby mood or just want to look at some really gorgeous pictures, I suggest picking up the latest issue of <em>Sheridan Road</em> and/or checking out the behind-the-scenes video below. It&#8217;s time to get your Gatsby on&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clear accessories, especially handbags, are a photographer&#8217;s dream during fashion week. Although I can&#8217;t recommend wearing one if you carry your life with you on a daily basis, there are ways to do see-through right. Whether it be a bag, sunglasses or even a jacket, this trend can either be your best friend (see below) or your worst enemy (ie. stripper heels).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px;" title="clear_handbag" alt=" photo bag1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/bag1.jpg" width="857" height="637" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-8314"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of all transparent fashion, handbags happen to my favorite. Mainly because it&#8217;s a great excuse to buy a fun wallet and potentially some other exciting chotchkies you want the world to see. <a href="http://bit.ly/Z10ngM" target="_blank">Valentino</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/179W3fE" target="_blank">Charlotte Olympia</a> are my top picks, however I wouldn&#8217;t mind finding out who makes the one Miroslava Duma is carrying in the photo above. It looks like Tom Binns and DANNIJO had a baby but that baby was not a piece of jewelry, it was the coolest handbag ever.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re looking for an easy way to incorporate this &#8220;trend&#8221; into your wardrobe, I suggest starting with sunglasses. They go with everything, you can wear them regardless of the season and you don&#8217;t have to spend a ton of money to make the look work. By the way, I use the word <em>trend</em> loosely here because I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily consider it to be on trend this particular season (unlike black &amp; white or stripes) but it&#8217;s a fun thing to wear, especially come Spring/Summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re looking for a fashion challenge (re: <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/dress-with-pants/" target="_blank">dress over pants</a>) then you should go with the jacket. Although I&#8217;ve had my eye on the <a href="http://bit.ly/179WQgx" target="_blank">Valentino</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/10jz6Tl" target="_blank">RED Valentino</a> versions this season, I ended up buying a transparent studded Alberta Ferretti jacket at the <a href="http://www.ShopDecadesInc.com/" target="_blank">Decades</a> pop-up last month and my fix has been filled. Let&#8217;s just say it will definitely make rainy days much more manageable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to look into your closet and say &#8220;I can see right through you&#8221; (I can&#8217;t be the only one, right?) then it&#8217;s time you start shopping.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One thing I hear from women way too often is that they need more basics in their wardrobe. I get it. When you&#8217;re shopping, it&#8217;s seems more satisfying to buy that special dress you&#8217;ll probably wear only once as opposed to a basic t-shirt. Then when it comes to real life you realize you&#8217;re not wearing a sequin dress everyday and you think you have nothing to wear. Well, I have found the solution&#8230;and it happens to be right here in Chicago.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="chicago_design_showroom" alt=" photo IMG_6894.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_6894.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8291"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.archertownsend.com" target="_blank"><strong>Archer Townsend</strong></a> is a local brand that&#8217;s fairly new on the scene and they&#8217;re really changing the way you think about basics. Although their collection consists mostly of tanks, t-shirts, as well as a few dresses, it&#8217;s all comfortable, fun and actually flattering. According to co-founder, James Townsend, &#8220;We love to make clothing that makes a statement but never overpowers the woman. Â The woman should make the clothing, the clothing should not make her.&#8221; Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="archer townsend showroom" alt=" photo IMG_6906.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_6906.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p>Besides the clothes, their West Loop showroom is beyond impressive. It&#8217;s so neat and organized, it&#8217;s basically meant to be on Pinterest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="chicago fashion designer" alt=" photo IMG_6897.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_6897.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p>And as always when I go anywhere, I feel it&#8217;s necessary to try everything on. In case you were wondering, the t-shirt is my favorite (of course).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="showroom_visit" alt=" photo Untitled-1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Untitled-1.jpg" width="734" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the clothes that make Archer Townsend unique, it&#8217;s the fact that everything is designed and manufactured in Chicago. Now, THAT is Â true Chicago fashion.</p>
<p>If you like what you see here then you&#8217;re in luck, because Archer Townsend is giving away a piece from their collection!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to fashion, I do enjoy a challenge. Pastels in the winter, mixing prints, a sequin sweatsuit&#8230;I find these things entertaining. One challenge I&#8217;ve recently decided to take on &#8212; the dress with pants. Something typically reserved for the couture runways, this look is rarely seen on the streets. But I decided to kill two fashion challenges with one stone this week (dress with pants + headband not at a music festival) and here&#8217;s how it turned out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="proenza_schouler_dress" alt=" photo Danielkelleghancom-12.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Danielkelleghancom-12.jpg" width="683" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8280"></span></p>
<p>And like I <a href="http://instagram.com/p/XVGdgyPgcw/" target="_blank">mentioned on Instagram</a> the other day, I&#8217;m making headbands my thing this Spring/Summer, so&#8230;get used to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="DRESS_WITH_PANTS" alt=" photo Danielkelleghancom-34-1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Danielkelleghancom-34-1.jpg" width="683" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="jeweled_headband" alt=" photo maybe.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/maybe.jpg" width="683" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="trapeze_dress" alt=" photo Danielkelleghancom-16.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Danielkelleghancom-16.jpg" width="683" height="1024" border="0" /></p>

<p>And a curtsy for the win&#8230;</p>

<p><em><strong>WHAT</strong>Â (am I wearing):<br />
</em><b>Dress: </b><a href="http://bit.ly/Zva2px" target="_blank">Proenza Schouler</a> (Fall 2010).Â <b>Pants</b>: <a href="http://bit.ly/13ubi48" target="_blank">The Row</a>.Â <strong>Bag</strong>: c/o <a href="http://danielle-nicole.com" target="_blank">Danielle Nicole</a>.Â <strong>Sunglasses: </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/UwCf0q" target="_blank">Illesteva</a>. <strong>Shoes</strong>: <a href="http://bit.ly/ZUTzNV" target="_blank">Valentino</a>.Â <strong>Headband: </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/16fHg1y" target="_blank">Deepa Gurnani</a>.<a href="http://bit.ly/13KNRTo" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p><em><strong>WHY</strong>Â (am I wearing it):<br />
</em>So about this whole dress with pants thing. I&#8217;ve done it once previously with a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/V0LdEqPgUP/" target="_blank">shift dress</a>Â and I&#8217;m not going to lie, I wore this exact outfit (minus the headband and sunglasses) to a real estate event with my boyfriend (this is how I do corporate attire, apparently). For What Why Where purposes, I wanted to make it a little more daytime appropriate with the accessories, hence the headband, blue sunnies and casual clutch. When it comes to doing a dress with pants, picking a fitted pant is key. I&#8217;ve only done it with leather but it would also work with a slim trouser. For the dress, a shift or sheath works best. My Proenza dress is neither silhouette but because it&#8217;s super short and wide (not ideal for windy days without pants) I thought it would be the perfect candidate for this style challenge. And although I love this outfit, it&#8217;s really the <a href="http://www.rmchampagnesalon.com/" target="_blank">RM Champagne Salon</a> patio that completes the look. Sometimes a good backdrop can be your best accessory.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHERE</strong>Â (can you get it):</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This month&#8217;s Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish not only has great taste in clothes, she&#8217;s also one of the nicest people I&#8217;ve ever met. And like Rachel Roy says, <em>kindness is always fashionable</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_saifer_berngard" alt=" photo sam_intro.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam_intro.jpg" width="569" height="830" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8272"></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been to a <a href="http://splash.suntimes.com" target="_blank">SPLASH</a> event, you&#8217;ve experienced Sam&#8217;s hard work all coming together. As the director of the new magazine since September, she&#8217;s really making a SPLASH on the Chicago events scene (yeah, I went there).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_sun_times_splash" alt=" photo sam2.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam2.jpg" width="899" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen her smiling face at the best parties around the city but do you know her favorite restaurant, best part about her job or what she wanted to be growing up? Well, now you do&#8230;</p>
<p><b>What do you love most about your neighborhood?<br />
</b><em>I love working, going to events and out to new restaurants in the craziness and always buzzing neighborhood that is River North during the week. But at the end of the day, nothing beats going home to my lovely neighborhood of Bucktown/Wicker ParkÂ  that is close enough for convenience but far enough away that I can feel separated from it all. I can walk out of my door &#8211; and two steps away, I have the best yoga studio, cafes and most importantly, the cutest shops to explore. I always feel like I am on vacation when I am in my hood.</em></p>
<p><b>What do you think of fashion in Chicago?<br />
</b><em>I think it is completely underrated. I always hear people complain about the lack of shopping in Chicago, but last time I checked &#8211; we have just as good of shopping as any other major city. And every time guests visit us, they cannot get over how over the top and amazing my friends dress. I am proud of our unique fashion sense and how dolled up Chicagoans get to go out at night! We take our time getting dressed. You don&#8217;t have to look homeless to have cutting edge fashion (New York &#8211; I am talking to you).</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="splash_office" alt=" photo Untitled.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Untitled.jpg" width="679" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>Whatâs your favorite thing about Chicago?<br />
</b><em>I love Chicago, because I am not from here, but I never feel like an outsider. Everyone is so genuine, and as much of a cliche as it is &#8211; the midwest truly has the best people. I have lived on every coast, and Chicago is the only place I have truly called home.</em></p>
<p><b>My go-to restaurant in Chicago isâ¦.<br />
</b><em>I am a huge fan of Brendan Sodikoff [of Au Cheval, Maude's, Bavette's, Gilt Bar &amp; Doughnut Vault] &#8211; the burger at Au Cheval is not to be believed, but Hot ChocolateÂ  is definitely my go to with my hubby. It&#8217;s the best for brunch, dinner and sitting at the bar for late night dessert after a night out. It never disappoints!</em></p>
<p><b>My advice to out-of-townersâ¦<br />
</b><em>I swear our summers make it all worth living here!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="sam_saifer" alt=" photo fashionquote.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/fashionquote.jpg" width="682" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>What impact does fashion have on your life?<br />
</b><em>Fashion has always been a huge part of my life. I find that fashion is my creative outlet. I am the girl who lays out my outfit the night before work every single day. That is my tranquil time I have to myself where I don&#8217;t have to think about anything except for what necklace goes best with what shoes and if I need to wear tights. Some people meditate, but creating looks for myself is seriously therapeutic for me<b>.</b>Â </em></p>
<p><b>The best part about my job isâ¦<br />
</b><em>I love that my job is an extension of my life &#8211; it&#8217;s all about the work/life blend, and I have been in this industry long enough that my working relationships have become real relationships. It&#8217;s all about who you work with and who you know &#8211; I have gotten to know wonderful people that I have the pleasure of working with everyday.</em></p>
<p><b></b><b>When I was a kid I wanted to beâ¦<br />
</b><em id="__mceDel">Famous. Ha! I always knew I wanted to be in the fashion magazine world in some way. I went through a total journalism phase where I was destined to be an editor or on TV. Somewhere along the way, I realized that I just love to talk to people, and I enjoy being out and about. Event planning at a media company seemed to be the perfect balance.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="accessories and candy" alt=" photo candy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/candy.jpg" width="1024" height="678" border="0" /></p>
<p><b>If I had all the money in the world I would wearâ¦.<br />
</b><em>I would still dress the same and match the high end pieces with the low. I am a firm believer that money really can&#8217;t buy style. Of course I may indulge a bit more in my favorite designer brands &#8211; Emilio Pucci, Valentino, Marc Jacobs, Proenza Schouler, Lanvin. I may travel to Paris a bit more for the unique pieces, but for now I can just enjoy their Target collections <img src='http://chicityfashion.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p>
<p><b>I describe my style asâ¦<br />
</b><em id="__mceDel">Feminine &amp; classic with a bohemian twist. My friends and family like to tease that I never will wear the same thing twice. I mix &amp; match things all of the time and try to never repeat an exact outfit. It&#8217;s trickery to make it appear that my closet is bigger than it is!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="splash candy room" alt=" photo sam7_favorite.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/sam7_favorite.jpg" width="682" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t she the greatest?</p>
<p>Hope you&#8217;re enjoying my <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/category/chi-citys-most-stylish/" target="_blank">Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish</a> features so far. Until next month&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/shopping-editorial/" target="_blank">last week</a> that the stunning Noel has an equally gorgeous younger sister, Asia. When I happened to choose both of them for this shoot and later found out they were sisters, it was a must that we shot them together. And of course, we did!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="street_style_editorial" alt=" photo IMG_2105copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2105copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8250"></span></p>
<p>My initial inspiration behind this entire editorial was street style, but having models engage in &#8220;every day&#8221; tasks/errands made it a little more dynamic. Although I loved every single photo I posted, I have to say that these are my favorite and I just had to save the best for last. I mean, look at these girls. HOW FREAKIN&#8217; FANTASTIC ARE THEY?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="accessories_street_style" alt=" photo IMG_2116copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2116copy.jpg" width="1024" height="536" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="models_street_style" alt=" photo IMG_2137copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2137copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="mcqueen_clutch" alt=" photo IMG_2132copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2132copy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="street_style_chicago" alt=" photo IMG_2162copycopy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2162copycopy.jpg" width="1024" height="682" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="ford_models" alt=" photo IMG_2245copy.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/IMG_2245copy.jpg" width="1024" height="641" border="0" /></p>
<p>And now it&#8217;s time for my last Ford interview. Take it away, Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Beauty product you can&#8217;t live without?<br />
</strong><em>Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. I use it every morning. It has great coverage but still looks natural.</em></p>
<p><strong>What would you have as your last meal?<br />
</strong><em>Well, I LOVE food&#8230;but I&#8217;d have to pick a big steak with mashed potatoes and gravy.</em></p>
<p><strong>If you could only choose oneâ¦personal chef, masseuse, or chauffeur?<br />
</strong><em>In-house masseuse. It&#8217;s really the only thing you can&#8217;t do yourself. Plus, I love to cook.</em></p>
<p><strong>What actress would you want to play you in a movie?<br />
</strong><em id="__mceDel">Dakota Fanning. I love that no matter how famous she&#8217;s become, she&#8217;s always stayed true to herself. I admire that.Â </em></p>
<p><strong>If you could have backstage access to any concert, what would it be?<br />
</strong><em>Usher! He has such an amazing voice and he&#8217;s a great dancer.Â </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always get excited about store openings in Chicago because it almost feels like we&#8217;ve been validated. Like when we got Lanvin and Louboutin&#8230;it made me feel really cool (and it&#8217;s not like I represent the city of Chicago or anything).</p>
<p>If you have similar feelings about store openings here in the city or you just need even more of an excuse to shop, then you better keep reading.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="madewell_chicago" alt=" photo madewell_campaign.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/madewell_campaign.jpg" width="588" height="672" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8245"></span></p>
<p>Going in order of appearance (that is, appearance in Chicago)&#8230;</p>
<p>If you were curious to see who&#8217;s taking the place of Starbucks next to Barneys, you won&#8217;t have to wait much longer. <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/15N3SEI" target="_blank">Madewell </a></strong>will be officially be open to the public on April 3 at 10am. If you&#8217;re looking for a patchwork chambray button down or a neon yellow A-line skirt this spring (just a few of my favorites I saw from their latest collection) then I suggest you head to Oak and Rush in about a week and check out the new store.</p>
<p><em>Location: 932 N. Rush</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="azza_store_opening" alt=" photo photo.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo.jpg" width="768" height="1024" border="0" /></p>
<p>Local designer Azeeza Khan is opening her very firstÂ <strong><a href="http://www.atelierazza.com/#home" target="_blank">Atelier AZZA</a></strong>Â showroom in theÂ <a href="http://www.theshopsatnorthbridge.com" target="_blank">Shops at North Bridge</a>Â next month (tentatively April 8). According to Azeeza, &#8220;My by-appointment-only showroom model has been very limiting in more ways than one so I am looking forward to reintroducing some of my best sellers with this mainstream access, as well as all new designs centered around affordability.&#8221; So basically this means&#8230;you can get your studded blazer fix at your convenience.</p>
<p>FYI this is an exclusive first look at the AZZA windows, taken by Azeeza herself&#8230;via iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Location: 520 North Michigan, 3rd floor</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="tom_ford_chicago" alt=" photo tf.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/tf.jpg" width="1004" height="949" border="0" /></p>
<p>A reliable inside source (see how <em>US Weekly</em> I am?) tells me that <a href="http://www.tomford.com/#/en" target="_blank"><strong>Tom Ford</strong></a>Â on Oak Street is indeed confirmed. Tentatively opening this Fall&#8230;but when it comes to construction, dates seem to be meaningless. So if you were all about Tom Ford&#8217;s Fall &#8217;13 collection (seen above), you&#8217;ll be happy to know that you&#8217;ll be able to get it (RTW, bags, shoes and other accessories) here in Chicago. Maybe Tom himself will make an appearance. A girl can dream, right?</p>
<p><em>Location: [supposedly] 58 E. Oak (old Esquire Theater)</em></p>
<p>Now, if I could only get Proenza to open up a Chicago location&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Varsity jackets have been making somewhat of a revival the last few years. This is something I personally enjoy because it makes me a little nostalgic. One, because I remember my parents having them (similar to <a href="http://bit.ly/X3U8q8" target="_blank">this</a> but with black sleeves) and two, sports weren&#8217;t really my thing so I never actually got to own a real varsity jacket. Instead, I got to wear a super uncomfortable cheerleading uniform with orthopedic-looking gym shoes&#8230;and those, my friends, were great times.</p>
<p>So getting back on track&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="varsity_jackets" alt=" photo 2896-Le-21eme-Adam-Katz-Sinding-After-Rodarte-Mercedes-Benz-New-York-Fashion-Week-Spring-Summer-2013_AKS7827.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/2896-Le-21eme-Adam-Katz-Sinding-After-Rodarte-Mercedes-Benz-New-York-Fashion-Week-Spring-Summer-2013_AKS7827.jpg" width="799" height="625" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8240"></span></p>
<p>Alongside things like capes, knee-high boots and white wide-leg pants, varsity jackets are something that&#8217;s always in the back of my mind but I never really executed in my wardrobe. After seeing this photo on <a href="http://le-21eme.com/after-rodarte-new-york-city/" target="_blank">Le 21Ã¨me</a> from this past September, this perfect-transition-to-spring item is on my mind once again.</p>
<p>What I especially love about varsity jackets is that they&#8217;re great for both men and women. If you&#8217;re a guy looking to splurge on this type of outerwear, please buy this one from <a href="http://bit.ly/16TjwSb" target="_blank">Saint Laurent</a>&#8230;and let me borrow it. I thank you in advance.</p>
<p>So if varsity jackets happen to be on your mind as well, then it&#8217;s time you get your fix.</p>

<p><em><strong>WHY</strong>Â (am I wearing it):<br />
</em>I&#8217;m declaring it now. I refuse to wear a heavy coat in my What Why Where posts until next Winter. Although it was an astonishing 20 degrees when we took these photos, I couldn&#8217;t help but not wear boots. But the real star of this look is GET IT GIRL. Phillip Lim did some quirky tees and tanks for <a href="http://www.style.com/fashionshows/complete/S2013RTW-PLIM" target="_blank">Spring 2013</a>Â and the second that collection was available for pre-order on <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=281800.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=9895&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fmodaoperandi.com%2Ftrunkshows" target="_blank">Moda Operandi</a>, I was all over it. When it comes to a statement t-shirt like that, I tend to keep the rest simple; leather pants, pumps, a sleek clutch (although this one happens to glow in the dark&#8230;note to self: need a new set of &#8220;night time&#8221; photos). But one more statement I couldn&#8217;t resist&#8230;those DANNIJO earrings. They compliment Mr. Lim quite nicely, no?</p>
