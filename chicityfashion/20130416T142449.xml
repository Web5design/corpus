				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since a trip to Australia nearly three years ago, I quickly grew fond of all things Aussie &#8212; food (excluding Vegemite), accents, exotic animals and of course fashion. It started with some boutiques I enjoyed shopping at and it turned into a full on obsession with stalking Australian designers. And with Fashion Week Australia coming to a close last week, I thought I&#8217;d take this opportunity to talk about some designers I especially fancied for Fall 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="australian_fashion_week" alt=" photo ScreenShot2013-04-15at33556PM-1.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ScreenShot2013-04-15at33556PM-1.png" width="573" height="543" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><span id="more-8425"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Notice anything a little &#8220;off&#8221; from these images? These are in fact looks from FW13 but they don&#8217;t look like Fall at all (I&#8217;m a poet and I didn&#8217;t even know it). I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s that whole opposite season thing&#8230;which I kind of love, for no apparent reason.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://www.flannel.com.au" target="_blank">Flannel</a> </strong>is a brand you may recognize &#8212; it happened to show up a few times in my Ford editorials (see: <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/shopping-editorial/" target="_blank">Noel&#8217;s sweater</a> and <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/gym-editorial/" target="_blank">Dominique&#8217;s jacket</a>). I first discovered Flannel when pulling for this photoshoot from <a href="http://shopsarca.com" target="_blank">SARCA</a>, which happens to be one Chicago boutique embracing Australian designers (more about that later). If you&#8217;re a fan of loose silhouettes and pale colors then I suggest you start hunting Flannel FW13 immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://wearehandsome.com" target="_blank"><strong>We Are Handsome</strong></a> is an especially unique brand. They specialize in swimwear, but like you&#8217;ve never seen before. I mean, how often do you come across a <a href="http://bit.ly/139I9a2" target="_blank">panda one-piece</a> or an <a href="http://bit.ly/14r0Zya" target="_blank">eagle cover-up</a>? Yeah, that&#8217;s what I thought. I always appreciate those who have fun with fashion and extra snaps to those taking swimwear to the next level. I personally don&#8217;t enjoy shopping for bathingsuits (it makes me reconsider eating that whole pizza to myself, followed by 2 scoops of gelato) but when your beach attire <a href="http://bit.ly/YYuK56" target="_blank">comes with a view</a>, it&#8217;s not all that bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://blessedarethemeek.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Bless&#8217;ed Are The Meek</strong></a> has made a few appearances in my wardrobe. It&#8217;s pretty easy considering their price-points are phenomenal, the clothes are super comfortable, and they&#8217;re carried at both <a href="http://www.sofialivelovely.com" target="_blank">Sofia</a> and <a href="http://edithhart.com" target="_blank">Edith Hart</a> in Chicago. I wonder if Australian designers hit stores later than most? Because I don&#8217;t think I can wait much longer for that printed vest with matching shorts. I might even wear it with the bra top, but only to a music festival and only if I use my gym membership&#8230;which I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It&#8217;s pretty cool to see such successful designers come out of Australia. It proves that you don&#8217;t need to be based in New York, Paris, Milan or London to make it in the fashion industry. Maybe Chicago will be next? <img src='http://chicityfashion.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Plus, Aussies are the nicest people you&#8217;ll ever meet and how can you not support that?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can find a great selection of Australian designers at Sofia and Edith Hart (two of my favorite stores in Chicago). If you&#8217;re looking for some other fantastic Aussie designers, check out MINKPINK, Sass &amp; Bide, Camilla &amp; Marc, Ellery, and Bec &amp; Bridge. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been dying to know who the mastermind was behind the iconic <a href="http://bit.ly/115hJGx" target="_blank">Balenciaga City bag</a> and were curious to see what they&#8217;re up to now, then today is your lucky day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="myriam_schaefer_handbag" alt=" photo 5-1804858_0x440.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/5-1804858_0x440.jpg" width="660" height="440" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8413"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myriamschaefer.com/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Myriam Schaefer</strong></a>, alongside Nicolas Ghesquière, is responsible for Balenciaga&#8217;s most iconic bag but now that they&#8217;re both no longer at the design house&#8230;what&#8217;s next? Well, we&#8217;re still waiting to hear on Nicolas (although there&#8217;s been <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG9930875/Nicolas-Ghesquiere-own-label-rumours-gather-pace.html" target="_blank">plenty of  rumors</a> flying around) but after a trip to Ikram last week, I know exactly what Myriam&#8217;s been up to.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="myriam_schaefer" alt=" photo 9-2108337_0x440.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/9-2108337_0x440.jpg" width="660" height="440" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re behind one of the most popular bags in the last 2 decades, you better be coming out with your own line of handbags, right? That&#8217;s exactly what Myriam Schaefer did. The main priority with her designs is to be practical; a carryall to go with every outfit, one you can wear any day of the week and of course, to be made with the highest quality materials possible.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;m sure Nicolas is very proud.</p>
<div id="rs-shopping-widget-26942">
<div id="rs-intro-loader" style="height: 32px; width: 32px; margin: 0 auto;"><img alt="" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/rewardstyle/shopping_loader.gif" /></div>
<p><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.currentlyobsessed.me/js/easyXDM-2.4.15.118/easyXDM.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
setTimeout(function() {var transport = new easyXDM.Socket({remote:"http://www.currentlyobsessed.me/api/v1/get_widget?wp=31|ChiCityFashion|26942",container: document.getElementById("rs-shopping-widget-26942"),swf: "http://www.currentlyobsessed.me/js/easyXDM-2.4.15.118/easyxdm.swf",onMessage: function(message, origin) {this.container.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[0].style.width = "100%";this.container.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[0].style.height = message + "px";var d = parent.document.getElementById("rs-shopping-widget-26942");var d_nested = document.getElementById("rs-intro-loader");if (d_nested) {var throwawayNode = d.removeChild(d_nested)};}});}, 100);
// ]]&gt;</script></p>
</div>
<p>You can find Myriam Schaefer at some of my favorite <a href="http://www.myriamschaefer.com/stocklist.html" target="_blank">stores</a> in the country, including Ikram, Bergdorf Goodman, Kirna Zabete, and Jeffrey. Know that these bags don&#8217;t come cheap &#8212; they really are the epitome of an investment piece.</p>

<p><em><strong>WHAT</strong> (am I wearing):<br />
</em><b>Hat: </b><a href="http://www.oatw-usa.com" target="_blank">OATW</a>. <b>Pants</b>: c/o <a href="http://us.mih-jeans.com/home/" target="_blank">MiH Jeans</a>. <b>Shirt: </b><a href="http://www.zara.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/home/us/en/" target="_blank">Zara</a>. <strong>Cape-looking-thing</strong><strong>:</strong> <a href="http://tomenyc.com" target="_blank">Tome</a>. <strong>Shoes: </strong><a href="http://www.openingceremony.us" target="_blank">Chloe Sevigny x Opening Ceremony</a>. <strong>Rings</strong>: <a href="http://www.cartier.us" target="_blank">Cartier</a>, <a href="http://www.danarebeccadesigns.com/cart.php" target="_blank">Dana Rebecca</a>. <strong>Necklaces:</strong> <a href="http://www.danarebeccadesigns.com/cart.php" target="_blank">Dana Rebecca</a>. <strong>Lipstick: </strong>c/o <a href="http://www.morganmariebeauty.com" target="_blank">Morgan Marie Beauty</a> (color: Elizabeth).<a href="http://bit.ly/13KNRTo" target="_blank"><br />
</a></p>
<p><em><strong>WHY</strong> (am I wearing it):<br />
</em>In case you haven&#8217;t realized, this look is all about the cape-looking-thing (like that title?) I got it at <a href="http://www.space519.com" target="_blank">space519</a> a few months ago and wore it during fashion week in February. I thought it needed to come out and play once again but this time with a different look. I wore it with leather pants (obviously) and boots previously but I thought I should  change it up. I&#8217;ve been wanting to wear more flare jeans/bell bottoms lately and this pair from MiH could not be more perfect. I like wearing a chunky platform with wider pants so the shoe was an easy choice. A not-so-easy choice was the OATW hat (stands for Ohio Against the World&#8230;which I kind of love). Could I get away with a super shiny gold cape, bell bottoms and what appears to be the Hermes Collier glued on a leather baseball hat? Well&#8230;you be the judge.</p>
<p><em><strong>WHERE</strong> (can you get it):</em></p>
<div style="width: 600px; height: 120px; margin: 0px auto; background: white;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="120" scrolling="no" src="http://currentlyobsessed.me/api/v1/get_widget?wid=29&amp;blog=ChiCityFashion&amp;product_ids=n_616439,5f64ab3b9de9ef69a4101d2e865db186,ab548ce75e2bff5fcdb5b44a975bbb71,37d061a42c08974a29d0523276235bb0,86afbbc2a42bd249102f457db16cfef3,381a9811369b440a0fbfea8c55bdc6ef,823c4eac4406a69a2033da3022c886a1&amp;rows=1&amp;cols=5&amp;brand=0&amp;price=0&amp;hover=0" width="600"></iframe></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m hoping you have no plans on Thursday, April 25 because you&#8217;re going to feel pretty BLUE if you do (or don&#8217;t?)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="benetton_spring_campaign" alt=" photo ss13_woman_look_581.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ss13_woman_look_581.jpg" width="620" height="825" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8377"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m no good with puns.</p>
<p>That evening I&#8217;m hosting a spring shopping event at Benetton, along with <em>Michigan Avenue </em>magazine, and I&#8217;m beyond excited for the theme. Their <a href="http://www.benetton.com/campaign/" target="_blank">spring campaign</a> (featuring some of my favorites like Charlotte Free &amp; Elettra Wiedemann) is all about individual colors and Benetton is throwing events across the country to celebrate. For Chicago, the theme is BLUE&#8230;which is kind of perfect because it happens to be my favorite color (even though you probably thought it was neon).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m most excited about for the event is that I&#8217;ll be picking a best dressed that will get a pretty spectacular prize. You don&#8217;t have to wear head-to-toe blue but whoever I think incorporates the color best will win. And who doesn&#8217;t want to win best dressed? It IS the highest honor you can receive after all. Plus there will be a blue carpet. See, red carpets are for A listers, but blue carpets are for us A+ listers&#8230;much more chic.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="benetton_event" alt=" photo Evite_Benetton_Blue_APR25.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Evite_Benetton_Blue_APR25.jpg" width="1024" height="724" border="0" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a blue-ser and come party with with us.</p>
<p>And if for some reason you can&#8217;t come, you can still join in on some fun. From now until April 30, when you post a picture of your favorite Benetton colors on Instagram using hashtags #Benetton and #BeYourSelfie, you&#8217;ll be entered to win a $300 shopping spree. The perfect excuse to WERK that selfie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, it&#8217;s that time of year again. That awkward time where it can go from 50 to 80 and back again in one week&#8230;or even in one day. That awkward time where most other states have a somewhat normal Spring but we can&#8217;t just yet transition from our Winter wardrobes. And that awkward time where I just want to wear my <a href="http://bit.ly/10Ss5sU" target="_blank">Valentino sandals</a> but mother nature won&#8217;t allow it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="transition your wardrobe to spring" alt=" photo Photoon4-9-13at449PM.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/Photoon4-9-13at449PM.jpg" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8366"></span></p>
<p>Spring has sprung in Chicago, people. It&#8217;s time to [almost] celebrate. Sure we have those miraculous 75 degree sunny days where everyone darts to Big Star. Then it&#8217;s back to real life with 40 and rainy. To everyone reading this that doesn&#8217;t live in Chicago, this is what it&#8217;s like. But our summers actually make it worth living here, trust me (that and the insanely delicious restaurants&#8230;can&#8217;t forget about those).</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re in Chicago or elsewhere and can&#8217;t seem to figure out how to transition your wardrobe for the new season, I think I can be of some assistance.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s not just yet sandal weather (and clearly, I&#8217;m upset about this), <strong>pumps</strong> are the way to go. It&#8217;s an upgrade from boots but you can still rock that chipped pedicure for another month or so. It&#8217;s sad how excited I get when I can expose my ankles for the first time.</p>
<p>In the Winter, I live in skinny jeans and cashmere leggings. I can&#8217;t afford to let any cold air up in my boyfriend jeans or trouser pants, ya know? But thankfully it&#8217;s not [that] freezing so <strong>silk pants</strong> are a must. <a href="http://bit.ly/14VihCA" target="_blank">Floral</a> is always a fun option for spring but if you&#8217;re not feeling all that daring, a simple <a href="http://bit.ly/YgXaIe" target="_blank">black pair</a> will do.</p>
<p>Although we all love a good chunky knit, it&#8217;s time to retire yours for the season and bring out the <strong>blazer</strong>. I&#8217;m into the print on print trend so if you&#8217;re down for the floral pants, then why not try the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=254155.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=6894&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fproduct%2F325869" target="_blank">matching blazer</a>? I&#8217;m really excited to wear my Mia Moretti x Pencey floral shorts suit I got at <a href="http://www.sofialivelovely.com" target="_blank">Sofia</a> a few months ago. It really sucks buying Spring clothes in February but [fingers crossed] I&#8217;ll hopefully be able to look like a walking garden soon enough.</p>
<p>The best feeling in the world is ditching your heavy coat and opting for a lighter option. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love a good JACKET but coats are another story. And then when leather is involved, it&#8217;s a completely different story. Anyway, <strong>light jackets</strong> are my jam. This season, it&#8217;s all about <a href="http://bit.ly/14VhSQA" target="_blank">light leather</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/10RGPIo" target="_blank">military</a>. You&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for the ultimate spring accessory, it&#8217;s not as exciting as you&#8217;re probably hoping. But at least you can ditch your scarves, earmuffs and gloves, right? Having a good <strong>umbrella</strong> is necessary when living in Chicago. The weather is so unpredictable and who wants to get caught in the rain after a fresh blow out? Or in any situation for that matter. I refuse to let weather ruin my wardrobe.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s time to semi-transition your wardrobe and fill in the gaps. Last weekend, I put away my Winter accessories, heavy sweaters and tall boots&#8230;and it felt damn good.  If you seem to be missing that Spring in your step (or Spring in your wardrobe) then look no further.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been inside Bergdorf Goodman, I&#8217;m sure you know that it&#8217;s more than just a store&#8230;it&#8217;s a magical place (especially the second floor&#8230;I can&#8217;t contain myself when I&#8217;m around all those shoes). And clearly, I&#8217;m not the only one feels this way.</p>
<p><img alt=" photo SMAAB_OneSheet.jpeg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/SMAAB_OneSheet.jpeg" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8355"></span></p>
<p>If director Matthew Miele got Diane Von Furstenberg, Georgina Chapman, Karl Lagerfeld, Oscar De La Renta, Vera Wang, Marc Jacobs, and Christian Louboutin (just to name a few) to gush to the camera about how fantastic Bergdorfs is&#8230;then it&#8217;s worth making a movie about. I can talk about how much I love Bergdorfs all day long but unfortunately that didn&#8217;t make the final cut.</p>
<p>Appropriately titled <strong>Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf&#8217;s </strong>goes behind the inner workings of the historic department store, including an interview with their top personal shopper Betty Halbreich (who claims she&#8217;d be drinking if she wasn&#8217;t doing what she&#8217;s doing&#8230;but why not do both and just have it all?) as well as how they come up with those phenomenal window displays. I really am just in awe every time I see them. They are truly incredible.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the best part&#8230;my boys Jack and Lazaro even make an appearance. So that&#8217;s reason enough for me to see this movie.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="jack and lazaro" alt=" photo ProenzaSchouler.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ProenzaSchouler.jpg" width="1024" height="768" border="0" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/scattermyashesatbergdorfs" target="_blank">Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorfs</a> premieres in NYC on May 3 then &#8220;expands across the country in following weeks&#8221; (so I need to know when it&#8217;s Chicago&#8217;s turn ASAP). Don&#8217;t be a loser like me and watch the trailer 9 times in a row. Because that happened.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever the question &#8220;what&#8217;s your sign?&#8221; arises, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve always thought to yourself &#8220;hmm I wish I had some kind of accessory to enhance my answer.&#8221; And of course none other than <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=254155.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=6893&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2FShop%2FDesigners%2FCharlotte_Olympia%3Fviewall%3Don" target="_blank">Charlotte Olympia</a> has already thought of this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="charlotte olympia zodiac flats" alt=" photo tumblr_mkp8hoiewC1qhe1feo1_1280.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/tumblr_mkp8hoiewC1qhe1feo1_1280.png" width="563" height="562" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8349"></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Charlotte Olympia fan like myself and enjoy a good astrology lesson (and by lesson I mean purchase), then I think you&#8217;re going to be a fan of her new zodiac flats. But if that isn&#8217;t enough for you&#8230;she also did a line of zodiac clutches. Although I&#8217;m a <a href="http://bit.ly/17mITfi" target="_blank">Gemini</a>, I&#8217;m personally a fan of the <a href="http://bit.ly/17mIx8F" target="_blank">Cancer clutch</a>. Basically because I think it&#8217;s weird to put a crab on a bag and I&#8217;m all about weird. But if I were to do this zodiac fashion thing. I would do it right. Why match your shoes to your bag when you could pick your sign + your rising sign (which I still don&#8217;t understand what that is because I really don&#8217;t follow this stuff all that closely)?</p>
<p>This is what mine would look like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="zodiac_accessories" alt=" photo ScreenShot2013-04-08at81056AM.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ScreenShot2013-04-08at81056AM.png" width="952" height="573" border="0" /></p>
<p>Apparently my rising sign is a <a href="http://bit.ly/10L5rT8" target="_blank">Virgo</a>. I have no idea if that means you love me or you hate me but I know the Gemini thing never goes over well with a crowd. &#8220;Ohhhh you&#8217;re a Gemini?&#8221; (cue: raised eyebrow). If you&#8217;re all about astrology then I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re thinking the same thing and questioning why you ever read this blog in the first place but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s just a sign and I&#8217;m only human&#8230;right?</p>
<p>So if you want to give yourself a stylish astrology lesson, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Rnt3bk*VKHI&amp;subid=&amp;offerid=254155.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=6893&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2FShop%2FDesigners%2FCharlotte_Olympia%3Fviewall%3Don" target="_blank">shop the Charlotte Olympia collection here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet has done wonderful things; it&#8217;s made phenomenons possible like cat memes, the Harlem Shake and even Justin Bieber. It&#8217;s also made information more confusing than ever: Is soy good for you or bad for you? How close is too close to stand to a microwave? Is a <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/03/11/kim-kardashian-blood-facial-kktm-pic/" target="_blank">blood facial </a>really beneficial? (unfortunately we have Kim Kardashian to thank for that) Well, one thing we know for sure &#8212; oil is the new cream.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="face and body oils" alt=" photo ScreenShot2013-04-04at92146PM.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ScreenShot2013-04-04at92146PM.png" width="674" height="537" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8343"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the all natural beauty kick lately. I mean&#8230;do I really want preservatives all over my face? No thank you. With all the crap in makeup and skincare, the more pure you can get the better. Face and body oils have been all the rage and I&#8217;m totally on board. I was initially nervous to try them because when you&#8217;ve heard all your life about the benefits of having oil-free products, why would you want to put pure oil on your skin? Because it feels awesome and it&#8217;s the good kind of oil. That&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>In an array of price points, my top 3 picks are as follows:</p>
<p>If you want to ball out in the beauty department then I suggest picking up a bottle of <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/14RUrrN" target="_blank">Rodin Face Oil</a></strong>. It also comes in a <a href="http://bit.ly/XhB7zx" target="_blank">body oil</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/ZckgdX" target="_blank">hair oil</a> but fun fact&#8230;you can use the face oil all over. It has 11 essential oils and that&#8217;s it. Not only do you get the perfect amount of moisture with just 2-3 drops but you get that glow that all your friends will be envious of. And that alone is worth the $150 investment&#8230;right?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bit.ly/12nPiTM" target="_blank">Kiehl&#8217;s Superbly Restorative Argan Oil</a></strong> has <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/new-beauty-routine/" target="_blank">made its rounds</a> on ChiCityFashion, and it&#8217;s well deserved. I&#8217;ve been using this on my skin and hair for a few years now and I&#8217;ve never been disappointed. Although not as pure as Rodin, it&#8217;s still made with high quality ingredients and is paraben-free. Plus, a small bottle will only run you $34 ($42 for the large) so you don&#8217;t have to beauty baller to get that glow.</p>
<p>I have been extremely hesitant to try <a href="http://bit.ly/12lH2Ym" target="_blank"><strong>Coconut Oil</strong> </a>on my skin. Maybe it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t want to smell like a coconut all day (although I do love a good macaroon), maybe it&#8217;s because I was skeptical to lather myself in something I bake with. Regardless, after an extra-dry trip to Arizona last week I thought I&#8217;d take my mother&#8217;s advice and give it a shot. Don&#8217;t you hate when your parents are right? THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. My skin has never been softer, you only smell like a coconut for the first 5 minutes after applying and it runs on average $10 a tub! I think this is what Charlie Sheen meant when he made #winning happen.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your take on oils? Any favorites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely do &#8220;looks for less&#8221; features because honestly, it&#8217;s not my forte. I&#8217;m all about mixing high/low but when it comes to finding a similar look for less, I usually just hit up Zara to see what knocked-off runway trends strike my fancy.</p>
<p>But because I love a good <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/dress-with-pants/" target="_blank">fashion challenge</a>, I decided to take this one on. Except I&#8217;m tired of the phrase &#8220;looks for less&#8221; so I&#8217;m renaming it &#8220;on the cheap.&#8221; Hope that&#8217;s alright with you&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="stylish_backpacks" alt=" photo ScreenShot2013-04-04at103505AM.png" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/ScreenShot2013-04-04at103505AM.png" width="644" height="476" border="0" /></p>
<p><span id="more-8331"></span></p>
<p>Now, there are certain things in your wardrobe that are definitely worth the investment: a high quality black blazer, great fitting jeans, an everyday bag, etc. Others are not necessarily worth the money, especially if it&#8217;s super trendy. I&#8217;m not saying never splurge on a trend, as long as you&#8217;ll think you will still be wearing it in at least a year from the purchase date.</p>
<p>Although I am guilty of splurging on things I probably shouldn&#8217;t have, we all make mistakes and learn from them (except when I got bangs 3 different times even though I know they don&#8217;t work on me&#8230;I guess third time&#8217;s a charm). Whether you have your eye on <a href="http://bit.ly/14QlsM5" target="_blank">The Row backpack</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/14QlJi2" target="_blank">Marant sneakers</a> or the <a href="http://bit.ly/12lCr4s" target="_blank">Kenzo tiger sweatshirt</a>, feel free to splurge&#8230;but if you&#8217;re hesitant, I have the solution.</p>

<p>This shoot was another prodigy of stylist Michael Favia and photographer Billy Rood (who did all of my <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/tag/chicityfashion-editorial/" target="_blank">Ford editorials</a>) and ironically, I went to high school with the cover model Eleanor and graduated with her brother. Chicago is much smaller than it may seem!</p>
<p>Because Michael is so awesome (I mean, he is <a href="http://chicityfashion.com/michael-favia-stylist/" target="_blank">Chi City&#8217;s Most Stylish</a> after all) he invited me on set for this photoshoot and I even got to assistant style once again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="behind_the_scenes" alt=" photo photo4.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo4.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="lanvin_kids" alt=" photo photo3.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo3.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>Oh yeah that&#8217;s baby Lanvin for the flower girl. No big deal. But seriously&#8230;how precious is this?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="flower_girl" alt=" photo photo1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo1.jpg" width="480" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p><em>Sheridan Road</em> really went all out for this shoot: location at the enormous Schweppes Estate in Lake Forest (which has the coolest bath tub I&#8217;ve ever seen), a Rolls Royce for the &#8220;bride&#8221; &amp; &#8220;groom&#8221; and even a real catered meal for the wedding reception photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px;" title="lux_tub" alt=" photo photo2-1.jpg" src="http://i1142.photobucket.com/albums/n612/chicityfashion/2013/photo2-1.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>So if you want to get in the Gatsby mood or just want to look at some really gorgeous pictures, I suggest picking up the latest issue of <em>Sheridan Road</em> and/or checking out the behind-the-scenes video below. It&#8217;s time to get your Gatsby on&#8230;</p>
