				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo BOOK_zps5cc100d4.jpg" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/BOOK_zps5cc100d4.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Last year, when I worked for a big company, a large editors conference was called where editors of some of Australia&#8217;s most popular magazines were gathered. Myself, and a few others, from the digital teams of the same company were brought in to talk about working online. Being quite fresh to the big world of publishing, I thought it was going to be an ordinary conference with team-building, discussions and a little bit of inspiration thrown in, as well as finger sandwiches and sparkling water. In reality, it felt more like a crisis meeting {many magazines are experiencing declining readerships, and some were a little late in embracing the digital world}.</p>
<p>Having been a magazine addict since forever, I was sitting amongst some of my idols, Donna Hay for one. Shy and intimidated was I. The first morning of the conference I took a seat at one of the round tables, in the rather small room, with my workmate and watched as the editors rolled in. I recognised some, and then a woman took a seat beside me and I got a little giddy. It was the Australian Editor of Vogue. I remained calm and collected, and quite excitable within.</p>
<p>As the morning rolled on and we heard from various speakers, I watched as she eagerly scribbled in her notepad. I peered over her shoulder and watched her write &#8216;YOU TUBE&#8217;, underlining it to confirm its importance.</p>
<p>In the months since that conference, there came a lot of upheaval. People were let go, magazines updated their websites and some even got iPad Apps {digital world, consider yourself embraced}&#8230; but one major thing was that that editor of Vogue no longer had a job with the magazine after many loyal years.</p>
<p>My sister was in Greece when it happened, with some of her magazine-writing friends. We were talking on Skype and I gave her the update {I don&#8217;t think it made the national news over there somehow}. There were gasps and shock. Kirstie Clements was Vogue to us, so it was a huge shake-up.</p>
<p>When the book came out, I had to read it. I&#8217;m an impatient reader, so I read the first few chapters, skimmed through some in the middle and then headed to the back for the juicy bits. Oh, and I flicked through the pictures. Novels should have more pictures, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>It was a good book, insightful and interesting particularly to me because I was with the company when the shake-up happened. Being safely placed in digital we only overheard what was happening though.</p>
<p>When I mentioned a handful of books that I was reading last year, there was a bit of outrage that they were all non-fiction books. <em>&#8220;You need to escape!&#8221;</em> someone told me. So I&#8217;ve decided the next book I read will be all made-up. And I want your help. I hate wasting time on a bad book. I am fussy. I don&#8217;t do sci-fi, or fantasy. No vampires, or witches, nothing that isn&#8217;t believable. I loved Jodi Picoult&#8217;s &#8211; My Sister&#8217;s Keeper, Nicholas Sparks &#8211; The Notebook and would love something that has me not wanting to skim through the middle.</p>
<h4>Can you help a fussy reader out? What have you read that I REALLY need to read? Please.</h4>

<p>With the festival of chocolate {a.k.a. Easter} just around the corner, it might seem slightly insane of me to add to the chocolate frenzy&#8230; but why not? Chocolate <em>is</em> calorie-free this long weekend, right?</p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m being honest, I have to say I made this but didn&#8217;t taste it. Being a mousse I couldn&#8217;t {due to being pregnant} but Hubby was a happy taste-tester and said it was amazing. It&#8217;s light, chocolate-y enough and refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="A little treat: Mars Bar frozen mousse delight" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Mousse_zpsfa94bef0.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>6 Mars Bars
<br>
600ml thickened cream
<br>
3 eggs, separated
<br>
50g milk chocolate, melted {for decorating}</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Grab a loaf tin and spray it with cooking spray, and then line generously with cling wrap. Make sure it hangs over the sides to make it easier to pull out. I layered it twice to be safe.
<br>
♥ Chop 4 of the Mars Bars roughly and place into a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Make sure the water doesn&#8217;t touch the bottom of the bowl. Stir until melted. You&#8217;ll have to push the nougat parts of the chocolate bar into the bowl to break them up {you&#8217;ll understand when you&#8217;re doing it!}.
<br>
♥ Add 1/2 of the cream and mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Take the bowl off the heat, and let it cool slightly. Add the rest of the cream and the egg yolks.
<br>
♥ In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
<br>
♥ Gently fold it into the chocolate mixture until all combined. Pour it into the loaf tin, cover with cling wrap and then place in the freezer overnight.
<br>
♥ Once set, decorate with chopped Mars Bars and the milk chocolate drizzled over the top.</p>
<h4>Will you be indulging in chocolate this weekend? Or will you be well-behaved? {I&#8217;m usually a chocolate lover, but am preferring fruits instead, as well as salty things this pregnancy}.</h4>

<p>How long has it been since you went through your blog and social media platforms and gave them a little spruce up? Or a health check-up? Quite often I get so caught up in the &#8216;doing&#8217; that I forget to check-in and make sure everything is up-to-date and working properly. Below is a checklist of health-checks you might just need to perform on your various platforms. Go on, the Doctor is in the house!</p>
<h4>Facebook</h4>
<p>▢ How long has it been since you updated your profile photo or cover photo? For tips on how to make a great cover photo for your page, have a read of <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/how-to-make-your-facebook-cover-photo-all-fancy-like/" target="_blank">this post</a> I wrote last year.
<br>
▢ How is your Facebook page working for you? Go to your last post and down the bottom you&#8217;ll see &#8216;X people saw this post&#8217;, click on that. It&#8217;ll show you the post that connected most with your audience {or more correctly that the most people saw}. Have a think about how you can bring a bit more of that good stuff to your followers.
<br>
▢ Are you sharing a mix of links, photos, status updates etc on your page each week? Have a think about how you can mix it up a bit and engage your audience.
<br>
▢ A few bloggers have now taken on a new method of sharing links to their blog posts, by writing a status update and sharing the link in the comments. While I&#8217;m sure it works for some, remember two important things: user experience and share-ability. Is it offering your readers a good experience to have to click through the comments to get to the link? With Facebook one of our main goals is to make something so good that people want to share it {make it viral baby!}, and if you&#8217;ve got a link in the comments it gets totally lost and the post isn&#8217;t shareable at all {well it&#8217;s shareable, of course, but they&#8217;ll be sharing your status update not your link}.</p>
<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>▢ Does your profile photo look like you, or is it a photo of you in 1998 when you were at your most fabulous? Make sure you have an updated photo of the current you.
<br>
▢ Have you checked out your profile page on Twitter? It will be one of the first places people go to check you out, so make sure it gives a great insight into you, or is at least witty enough that they&#8217;ll want to follow you ASAP.
<br>
▢ How is your header looking? Add a little jazz to your Twitter profile by uploading a photo or collage that shares a bit more about you. If you need a little help, you can use <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.twitcover.com/" target="_blank">TwitCover</a> to create one.
<br>
▢ Ask yourself &#8211; &#8220;Why am I actually on Twitter?&#8221; If it&#8217;s to connect, make sure that you&#8217;re taking a little time each week to be active and connect with others online. If it&#8217;s to share your website/blog, then why not check your blog stats to see that people are actually clicking from Twitter to read what you&#8217;ve written.</p>
<h4>Pinterest</h4>
<p>▢ Again, how is your profile photo? Is it up-to-date?
<br>
▢ Make sure that your website URL is highly visible so if people like your pins they can find more of you elsewhere.
<br>
▢ How often are you pinning stuff? Have a think about how you want Pinterest to work for you, and then set aside an amount of time each week/month to grow it. Perhaps it&#8217;s just a place for you to play, and that&#8217;s a-ok too!
<br>
▢ Is the content on your blog pinnable? You can check who has pinned your content by using the URL: http://pinterest.com/source/YOUR-WEB-ADDRESS {so mine is http://pinterest.com/source/fatmumslim.com.au/}. What are people pinning? Think about how you can make more shareable content on your site.
<br>
▢ Another great thing to do is to find people that inspire you online and follow them. Being inspired is a wonderful thing!</p>
<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>▢ Instagram won&#8217;t bring a huge amount of traffic to your site, but that&#8217;s not really what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about having fun {mostly!} and growing your profile online. There are loads of ways to get involved {challenges are just one way}. You can share even the most boring on Instagram, but just as long as you&#8217;re sharing.
<br>
▢ Clean up your following feed, and find inspiring people to follow. Comment on their photos, be active in the Instagram community. You&#8217;ll be surprised how easy it is to make friends and connections.
<br>
▢ Are your profile details up-to-date? And how long has it been since you updated your profile picture? Freshen it up if it&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<h4>Your blog</h4>
<p>▢ Go through your blog with fresh eyes. Pretend you&#8217;re visiting it for the first time. Check your about page, contact page and other links. Make sure there&#8217;s a photo of you somewhere. Does it need a freshen up? Click all your social media links and make sure they still work. Go through and write a list of anything that needs updating or changing and put it on your to-do list for the next few weeks. If you want a new header but aren&#8217;t so crafty, look on Etsy for a new design or affordable designer.
<br>
▢ Make sure you&#8217;re being legal. If you&#8217;re running competitions on your blog, make sure you&#8217;re doing it right. In Australia all giveaways need to have an element of skill to them, otherwise you need to purchase a gaming licence <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.olgr.qld.gov.au/" target="_blank">{around $80 from here}</a>. If you&#8217;re running a Rafflecopter competition simply asking people to &#8216;like&#8217; your Facebook page to enter, and you haven&#8217;t purchased a licence, you&#8217;re risking hefty fines. Play safe!

▢ I know stats are so boring, and I try not to look at mine very often &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to check out what patterns are forming and get an insight to how people read your blog. Delve into what the page impressions and unique browsers have been for each month so far this year. Is your traffic going up, or down? Which posts have had the most impressions? Why do you think they did?
<br>
▢ Where is your traffic coming from? Have a think about how you can make that work for you more.
<br>
▢ Look at comments. Which posts got the most people talking on your blog?
<br>
▢ Look at shares {Facebook, Twitter, Pins etc}. Which posts got the most shares on your blog?</p>

<p>April is just around the corner. Don&#8217;t ask me how, but it is&#8230; so that means it&#8217;s time to embrace a new month of photo-taking fun. Above you&#8217;ll find some freshly cooked prompts and below you&#8217;ll find some easy instructions on how to play. Enjoy!</p>
<p><img title="Line break" alt="" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FatMumSlim/line-break.jpg" width="640" height="4" /></p>
<h4>How to play!</h4>
<p>Playing along with photo a day is super easy:
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Check out the April photo a day list.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Each day look at the daily prompt and take a photo according to whatever the prompt is. For example for day 1 the prompt is PLAY. It&#8217;s Easter Monday so I hope everyone can find some time for a little fun. Pick anything symbolises PLAY and snap it. It’s a great opportunity to get creative. Be inspired by a little creativity and see what you come up with.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Once you’ve taken the photo it’s time to share it. There are loads of places you can share it. See below for more details.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Check out other people’s photos. You can browse through them <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim" target="_blank">on my Facebook page</a>, in the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSphotoaday/" target="_blank">FMS Photo A Day Facebook group</a>. Or on Instagram or Twitter just search for the #FMSphotoaday hashtag to see them all.</p>
<p><img title="Line break" alt="" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FatMumSlim/line-break.jpg" width="640" height="4" /></p>
<h4>Where to play?</h4>
<p>There are loads of places to be social and share your photos with the #FMSphotoaday community:</p>
<p><span style="color: #de1d90;">♥</span> <strong>Instagram:</strong> Just upload your photo, use a fancy filter, add a caption and the hashtag #FMSphotoaday and then share.
<br>
<span style="color: #de1d90;">♥</span> <strong>Facebook:</strong> There are a few options here. You can simply share on your own personal page, among your own friends. Or you can upload to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim?filter=2" target="_blank">my page’s wall</a>, or I’ve created a Facebook group for 2013.

<br>
<span style="color: #de1d90;">♥</span> <strong>Blog:</strong> If you have a blog, you could share each day or do a wrap up of all the photos at the end of the month.
<br>
<span style="color: #de1d90;">♥</span> <strong>Tumblr:</strong> Add your daily photos to your Tumblr feed.
<br>

<p><img title="Line break" alt="" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FatMumSlim/line-break.jpg" width="640" height="4" /></p>
<h4>How do I remember the prompts?</h4>
<p>There are a few ways you can grab the list or remember the prompts:
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> Come back here each day and click the button on the right-hand side to check out the list.
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> Right-click on the list above and save it to your desktop. Or if you’re on your phone you could take a screenshot and save it as your wallpaper. {To screenshot click the power button and home button at the same time}.
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> The very fabulous <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.alwaysapples.com.au/" target="_blank">Doug</a> has created a calendar for us. You can have the prompts added to your phone’s calendar by clicking <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~bit.ly/15KFbZw" target="_blank">here</a>. It will open your calendar program and ask if you want to add the calendar. This works on iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Mac and PC. Alternatively you can view the calendar online in your browser <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~bit.ly/16Tad4H" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><img title="Line break" alt="" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FatMumSlim/line-break.jpg" width="640" height="4" /></p>
<h4>What’s the fab four?</h4>
<p>Each day I’ll be picking four photos on each Instagram and Facebook that have caught my attention, and sharing them to my Facebook and Instagram. To have your photos in the running you can just share them to <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim?filter=2" target="_blank">my Facebook page</a> or the <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSphotoaday/" target="_blank">FMS Photo A Day group</a> or the #FMSphotoaday Instagram feed, or both. It’s not a competition – just a fun way to put the spotlight on some photos from the community.</p>
<p><img title="Line break" alt="" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FatMumSlim/line-break.jpg" width="640" height="4" /></p>
<h4>What do the prompts mean?</h4>
<p>There are no rules when playing along with photo a day, you can be creative as you like! Interpret the prompt as you please. For those that need a little help, some more suggested details about each prompt are below:</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>1. Play:</strong> Take a photo of play. How do you like to have fun?
<br>
<strong>2. Blue:</strong> This is our charity prompt for Autism Awareness. Shoot something blue.
<br>
<strong>3. Something beginning with A:</strong> Find something beginning with the letter A, snap and share.
<br>
<strong>4. This happened today:</strong> Perhaps you&#8217;ll need to take a few photos today and share in a collage, or pick your favourite. What happened to you today?
<br>
<strong>5. Something good:</strong> What&#8217;s good in your life right now? Do share!
<br>
<strong>6. Air:</strong> This month we&#8217;re exploring the elements: air, earth, water and fire. Today share air. Tough, right?
<br>
<strong>7. Dreamy:</strong> To me dreamy is all about light and putting a filter over a photo that makes it a little whimsical. What does dreamy mean to you? Is it a place you like to escape to? Something you hope for?
<br>
<strong>8. On your plate:</strong> You could take this one literally: what&#8217;s on your plate for lunch etc? Or what you have on your to-do list right now&#8230;
<br>
<strong>9. Tiny:</strong> Look for the small things in life; little ants running across the path, a teeny flower just starting to bloom.
<br>
<strong>10. A place:</strong> Home, work, a cafe, your town, a place you visited&#8230; pick a place and share it. Perhaps even geotag it.
<br>
<strong>11. Detail:</strong> How can you show off the beautiful detail in something. Get in close and show it off, or just shoot something that has lots of detail worth appreciating.
<br>
<strong>12. In the middle:</strong> You can use &#8216;in the middle&#8217; for composition and take a photo of something smack-bang in the middle of the frame, or choose to shoot something that is placed in the middle of other things. It&#8217;s up to you.
<br>
<strong>13. View from your bed:</strong> What do you see when you wake up or go to bed at night? Share it.
<br>
<strong>14. Water:</strong> Share the element water. Is it the sea? In a glass? From a tap?
<br>
<strong>15. Alone:</strong> Take a photo of alone. Perhaps it&#8217;s how you feel, what you&#8217;re doing, or a lone object sitting on it&#8217;s own.
<br>
<strong>16. Your favourite colour:</strong> What&#8217;s your favourite colour right now?
<br>
<strong>17. Busy:</strong> What&#8217;s the busiest part of your day? Share it, or share something that is busy {a bee, a line at a cafe, a person working, you!}
<br>
<strong>18. Hello!:</strong> Use your imagination on this one. Is it how you greet someone? A sign? A look? Or something else?
<br>
<strong>19. Button:</strong> On your clothes, or a button you press to start/stop thing&#8230; or a belly button if you may!
<br>
<strong>20. On your mind:</strong> What are you thinking about today?
<br>
<strong>21. Fire:</strong> The fire element! A match? Candles on a cake? A fireplace? Be careful!
<br>
<strong>22. Blurry:</strong> How can you get creative and make your photo blurry? Move your camera quickly, or have your subject move quickly past the camera. This should be fun!
<br>
<strong>23. Time:</strong> You can show how time passes&#8230; the sun rising, a clock, something growing, or another way to represent time.
<br>
<strong>24. I saw this person today:</strong> Who did you see today? A friend, a loved one, a stranger? Shoot them. Well, don&#8217;t shoot them&#8230; but take a photo. You know what I mean.
<br>
<strong>25. Life is&#8230;:</strong> How is life today for you? Hard? Beautiful? Wonderous? Exhausting? Express it in a photo.
<br>
<strong>26. Childhood:</strong> Share something that represents childhood to you. Perhaps it&#8217;s a photo of you as a kid.
<br>
<strong>27. Earth:</strong> The last of the elements, how will you share earth with us?
<br>
<strong>28. My Sunday:</strong> To me Sundays seem like a sacred day. Some people go to church, some people rest or make pancakes, others get adventurous. I&#8217;d love to see what your Sunday looks like. You can even share more than one photo {a collage perhaps?}
<br>
<strong>29. I wore this today:</strong> Share your whole outfit, or just part of it.
<br>
<strong>30. Glasses:</strong> Drinking glasses giving a cheers, sunglasses or spectacles? You choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p>Prior to this past weekend I was a cruise virgin. I&#8217;d never been aboard a cruise ship, and my freshness was evident by the fact that I repeatedly called the ship a boat, even to the Captain. He wasn&#8217;t very impressed. &#8220;Do you know what the difference is between a ship and a boat?&#8221; he asked. I shook my head and moved the conversation on as quickly as possible. <em>Whoops.</em></p>
<p>The great thing about press-trips is that I mostly have very little expectations. When planning a trip of my own, I plan the heck out of it and get excited over the little details &#8211; hoping that it will live up to my every expectation. I did wonder, as I packed my suitcase, just how small the rooms were, if I&#8217;d get claustrophobic or sick of the seeing the same people on the ship over the weekend. {For the record the rooms were bigger than I imagined, I didn&#8217;t feel closed in at all and I rarely saw the same person more than once &#8211; unless of course I intended to}.</p>
<p>One thing I hadn&#8217;t even thought about was the movement of the boat. It totally slipped my mind. I imagined that we&#8217;d cruise through the water without feeling a thing. Some parts of the trip and others were more &#8216;moving&#8217;. Sunday night was a really rough night. With swells of around 10m it felt like I was sleeping on a trampoline with a herd of children bouncing around me. The bed slipped from underneath me as it bounced off the waves, and returned me back when it found the water again. Hubby had become well acquainted with the bathroom, sea-sickness in full force. It was unusual, we were told by the well-traveled cruise-lovers. I didn&#8217;t mind the movement. It was different to anything I&#8217;d ever experienced. I didn&#8217;t sleep much, more worrying about Hubby than anything else.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And the pool for the rest of us, which was located on one of the top decks &#8211; surrounded by all the action. There&#8217;s restaurants, a spa, a gym, an ice-cream bar {for after the gym!}, loads of deck chairs, heaps of activities, spas, live music, a big screen, kids club and more.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO13_zpsbe164c13.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meeting the Captain. He said, &#8220;Look out at the horizon, can you see there&#8217;s a little bit of swell?&#8221; I think he was trying to gently tell me that it was going to be a bumpy night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO14_zps193dd365.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Another deck. I was surprised that, with a fully booked cruise, that I didn&#8217;t see more people everywhere. The ship is so big that there&#8217;s enough room for everyone and more.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO16_zps6600e63a.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Pacific Jewel is home to Salt Grill by Luke Mangan. While food from two of the restaurants are included in your package, Salt Grill is an extra $40 for a 3-course meal. Definitely worth the money. We would easily pay $100 each on land for such a meal. You can also get the most delicious Thai meal {8 courses, no less!} at La Luna for just $25. Bargain.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There&#8217;s so much to see and do. On the Saturday night there was a circus show that was pretty darn amazing. One of my sister&#8217;s friends is the Dance Captain on another ship and she does acts just like this. Some people are far too talented.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Most people left the ship on the Saturday for a day on Moreton Island. I&#8217;ll share a little more about that in another post as this one is getting loooooong.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO1_zpsf6e49011.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pulling into Sydney Harbour. It was exciting to see land again. We were home! {This is the view from our room}.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve had a handful of people ask me via email and elsewhere what I thought of the cruise, and whether I&#8217;d recommend it. This particular cruise is only a short one, a total of 4 days away. It&#8217;s the first that&#8217;s ever been done to Moreton Island. We had a 4-berth room with a window {or porthole} and I think it cost around the $450 per person mark. That includes entertainment and food. I thought that was quite good for a family trip &#8211; because you could definitely holiday without finding any unexpected costs. You can of course spend more by adding in onshore activities, alcohol, kids club fees, spa treatments&#8230; etc, but the financially savvy could make sure that they stayed on budget. I found the drinks and extra on board to be affordable. We put Lacey into Kids Club a few times for short periods and it was free.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was also lucky enough to have a spa treatment, a enzyme facial, which was beautiful. One of the journalists I traveled with also found it different to be moving around with the movement of the ship as we had our treatments. It wasn&#8217;t distracting, just so new for someone who has only done such things on land!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would I recommend it? Yes. I think it&#8217;s a great family-friendly way to holiday &#8211; with lots of yummy food and ways to be entertained. Lacey and I had a great time, and so did Hubby until the very last, bumpy night &#8211; where he decided that he would probably never cruise again. Seasickness is the pits, apparently!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever cruised before? Where did you go to? Or are you a cruise-virgin like I was?</p>

<p>I am so excited about this giveaway. Right now I&#8217;m in total party-planning mode, with Lacey&#8217;s birthday coming up soon. When I plan something, I don&#8217;t just dip my toes in and do a lame attempt, I jump right in with total enthusiasm. I love it. {Except the after party clean-up and the stressful bits, but let&#8217;s gloss over those, shall we?}.</p>
<p>Sweet Style is a store that I&#8217;ve used a few times already, and plan on going crazy there when I&#8217;m ready to shop for supplies for the birthday party. Leanne {who owns Sweet Style} is the master at creating beautiful, and oh-so-stylish party set-ups. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.sweetstyleblog.com.au/" target="_blank">You have to check out her blog for inspiration.</a> Or here are few tables she&#8217;s created&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo SWEETSTYLE1_zps5f22fb3d.jpg" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/SWEETSTYLE1_zps5f22fb3d.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>Amazing, right? So as well as being a party stylist, Leanne also runs her online party store filled with all the beautiful goodies {minus some of the food stuff} that you can see in the photos above. She&#8217;s kindly offering up a $200 gift voucher for one super lucky person to win. It&#8217;s open to everyone, whichever corner of the world you live in &#8211; but just note that you&#8217;ll have to include the postage in your $200 if you win. Oh, and you might like to purchase non-breakable items if you live somewhere other than Australia.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.sweetstyle.com.au/" target="_blank">You can check all the goodies available at Sweet Style right here.</a></p>
<p><strong>To be in the running to win the voucher all you have to do is tell me the what you love most about a good party. Is it the people, the food, the music, the socialising? And why?</strong></p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like anything too exciting, does it? Oh, but it was. It was a flavour-sensation. And it was easy to make, and everyone gobbled it up. You can&#8217;t ask for much more for a mid-week meal. Keep this one up your sleeve when you you can&#8217;t be bothered cooking, but you want something that tastes better than peanut butter on toast.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
<br>
1 cooked chicken {meat removed and shredded}
<br>
1 avocado, peeled and sliced
<br>
1 small red onion, sliced thinly
<br>
1 large tomato, sliced {or a handful of cherry tomatoes chopped}
<br>
200g low-fat grated tasty cheese
<br>
1/2 cup chopped coriander
<br>
Salt &amp; pepper
<br>
12 soft flour tortillas
<br>
Oil spray</p>
<p><strong>Dip</strong>
<br>
1 cup low-fat sour cream
<br>
1 garlic clove, crushed
<br>
1 tbsp chives, chopped</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong>
<br>
♥ Place the chicken, avocado, onion, tomato, cheese, coriander and seasoning into a bowl. Mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Heat frying pan to medium heat. Make one tortilla at a time. Place one tortilla on the bench, spread chicken mixture over each, and top with another tortilla. Spray oil into the frying pan, and place tortilla in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes each side. You&#8217;ll want to cook the tortillas more than I did. I made one after this that was much crunchier and it rocked.
<br>
♥ Make the dip by combining all the ingredients into a small bowl. Serve with slices of the tortillas.</p>

<p>Hubby would most probably be mortified that I tell you this, but I&#8217;ll tell you anyway {because it makes him look good, and me <em>notsomuch</em>}. We&#8217;ve been together for 11 years this year, and for most of those years he&#8217;s sent me a text message every single day. Only when he&#8217;s at work or away, mind you, we don&#8217;t make a habit of text messaging one another from opposite ends of the house for the thrill of it. His messages are always kind, quite lengthy in comparison to mine, and just plain lovely. They go something like this: <em>Hey babe. Hope you had a nice a sleep. Have a great day and I&#8217;ll see you tonight. Love you. x</em></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s at this point I&#8217;d like to say that I reply with the loveliest of words, and a handful of emoticons&#8230; but I can&#8217;t lie. Most of the time I don&#8217;t reply at all. Or I&#8217;ll reply with a short: <em>Can you get bread on your way home?</em></p>
<p>I love those messages, and I hope they never stop. But I&#8217;m busy. <em>Oh-so-busy. </em>Too busy to reply.</p>
<p>But really, we need to stop with this busy crap, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>I was having breakfast with a friend recently {yep, I made time for breakfast out of the house with another person, miracle} and she mentioned how busy I was, and she started brainstorming how I could be less busy and make more time for me. We talked about getting a cleaner, a babysitter or a virtual assistant. She mentioned that a mutual friend of ours had also commented on just how busy I was. Knowing the way he thinks and his sense of humour, I knew it would be said with a tongue firmly placed in cheek and an eye-roll, <em>&#8220;Oh yes, she&#8217;s soooo busy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Busy is the new black. We&#8217;re all busy. Too busy to eat a proper meal in one sitting. Too busy to answer emails. Too busy to get through to-do list. Too busy to book a little getaway. Too busy to play, relax and make time for being present.</p>
<p>In my spare time, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/dear-3am-we-need-to-break-up/">as I lay awake in bed at 3am</a>, I&#8217;ve started to think about all the things I&#8217;ve been too busy to do. Browsing through real bookstores is one. I used to spend a crazy {and lovely} amount of time browsing books at our local bookstore in Sydney. I&#8217;d grab a pile, take a seat and enjoy. It seems everyone else got too busy too, because it went into liquidation and closed down. I&#8217;m too busy to sort my whites from my colours, hence the shameful amount of once-white-now-grey clothes I own. And I&#8217;m far too busy to be drinking 2 litres of water every single day. Who has time for the drinking and the consequential toilet breaks? <em>Seriously?</em></p>
<p>After that breakfast where I thought about outsourcing I thought about how busy I really was. I wrote lists of things I could get other people to do, and then thought again. But I want to do those things. Well, not the cleaning. I&#8217;d be happy to do away with the toilet scrubbing. I like to have control, so outsourcing wouldn&#8217;t really work for me, and the time I free up in doing so anyway, would soon be filled with more stuff. I&#8217;d be sure to quickly realise that the linen press needed sorting, the walls needed painting, text messages would need replying to, and of course someone would need three times as much pushing on the swings.</p>
<p>One day I was so busy that my head felt like it was about to explode. Do you know that feeling? So I took the day off and I did none of it. I stopped the busy. Funny thing was, the world didn&#8217;t end. The to-do list didn&#8217;t triple while I played. It stayed the same. And I realised perhaps I&#8217;m not so busy after all. Perhaps if I just managed it all a little better, and stopped that darn glorification of busy, it would all feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t we all do with a little less busy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gozleme-2_zps7b585dd8.jpg" alt="Gozleme" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an avid market-goer you might be familiar with these delicious creations. If you&#8217;re not, then let me introduce you to them. You, meet gozleme.</p>
<p>On Saturday we were doing the rounds at the local markets when we smelled them cooking, and then we saw them. It was like a mirage, a vision of deliciousness right in front of us. It had clearly been a while between gozlemes. Sadly. They&#8217;re little dough filled delights, sometimes filled with spicy beef, others just cheese and spinach. Depending on the stall the filling will change. The ones I saw on the weekend had beef &amp; mushroom, cheese with more cheese or chicken mince.</p>
<p>Of course, in my usual style, I decided that I wanted to start creating them at home. I&#8217;d tried once before, and failed miserably&#8230; this time I tried a different recipe and had success. I know they sound hardish {anything that requires me to make my own dough usually scares me} but it&#8217;s not too hard, and the taste is worth it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gozleme_zps5455b950.jpg" alt="Gozleme" width="640" height="960" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Dough</strong>
<br>
4 cups plain flour
<br>
1 teaspoon salt
<br>
1 1/2 cups warm water
<br>
vegetable oil {for cooking}
<br>
lemon wedges to serve</p>
<p><strong>Filling</strong>
<br>
1 tablespoon oil
<br>
1 onion, finely chopped
<br>
2 garlic cloves crushed
<br>
1 tablespoon ground cumin
<br>
1 tablespoon sumac
<br>
1-2 teaspoons chilli flakes {optional &#8211; but throw them in!}
<br>
500g lamb mince
<br>
200g feta, crumbled
<br>
150g baby spinach, chopped</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gozleme-1_zps309f1f47.jpg" alt="Gozleme" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Make the dough: Sift flour and salt together into a large bowl. Slowly add the water, and stir gradually. Mix together to make a firm dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place back into the bowl and cover with a tea towel while you make the filling.
<br>
♥ Make the filling: Heat the oil in large frying pan on high heat. Saute the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add the cumin, sumac and chilli {if using} and cook for 1 minute. Add the mince and brown for 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, and add the feta and spinach. Mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Roll each piece into a rectangle shape {around 30x40cm}. Using 1/6th of the filling mixture, spoon the filling evenly over one half of the dough. Fold over the over half and push together the edges to seal. You can make all the parcels and keep them aside on a piece of baking paper or lined tray.
<br>
♥ Heat a large frying pan on medium {alternatively if you&#8217;re good on the BBQ, try it on there &#8211; I am not!}. Brush the gozleme with oil and then place in the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes each side, until golden brown and crispy. Cook the remaining gozlemes.
<br>
♥ Cut the gozlemes into squares to serve and serve with a squeeze of lemon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p>We didn&#8217;t holiday much as kids {the budget didn&#8217;t stretch that far} but when we did, just once mind you, it was to the Gold Coast. My parents piled us 4 kids into our Tarago and we drove the 16 hours to the sunny Gold Coast. I was so beyond excited, and wanted to remember EVERYTHING that I kept a journal of all the little details. Including how many stairs from the front door to our hotel room. <em>Oh yes, that&#8217;s a kid who needs to get out more.</em> I was always destined to be a blogger, wasn&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>Now that we live up north, the Gold Coast is just a short drive away, I&#8217;m loving it. We&#8217;re close enough to the theme parks, and there&#8217;s so much to explore. Last year we spent a weekend doing just that, and here are all the juicy details {minus the stair count!} below:</p>
<h4>Where to stay</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/QT_zps3d6d5f4e.jpg" alt="Get thee to the Gold Coast: What to do, eat &amp; where to stay" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>I have to start with where to stay, because this place was so &#8216;me&#8217;. As soon as we walked in there was eye candy everywhere. SO MUCH TO LOOK AT, and that means SO MUCH TO PHOTOGRAPH! {Yes, shouty capitals are necessary!}. The staff at QT wear the coolest outfits, the girls at the check-in were perfect in powder blue jumpsuits, bright red lipsticks and manicured nails. I was far too excited and had to ask Hubby to, &#8220;come and check out the cute check-in girls!&#8221; I could rave on about this place forever so I&#8217;ll try and bridle my enthusiasm and keep it short{er}.</p>
<p>Things I love about QT: the decor, the staff, the free lemonade service {every afternoon the staff go around to the rooms and make complimentary REAL lemonade}, the vibe, the mini bar {we bought some gummy lollies and the pick-up sticks} and the price. I loved this place so much that I&#8217;ve since sent my sister there, and it&#8217;s one of the cheaper, luxury places to stay on the coast. I checked for last weekend {I wanted a night away} and on lastminute.com.au it was the most affordable out of all of them. I&#8217;m so excited that ProBlogger will be held here this year too, such a treat.</p>

<p>On the second night of our weekend stay we moved to Peppers on Broadbeach, and if you asked me which I preferred &#8211; I actually couldn&#8217;t pick. While I loved the vibrancy of QT, I loved the luxury and peacefulness of Peppers just as much. We had an apartment so if you were staying for an extended period of time this would be the ideal choice, plus Broadbeach is just so beautiful and trendy. We were treated like VIPs with cold water on arrival {which we needed after a day in the sun at Dreamworld!}. Peppers is located in the heart of the activity at Broadbeach, with the Oracle Boulevard located just outside it&#8217;s doors. You can find Max Brenner, trendy cafes {for the coffee and cake lovers}, little boutique stores and more. The beach is a short walk away too.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/DREAMWORLD_zps59c38738.jpg" alt=" photo DREAMWORLD_zps59c38738.jpg" width="640" height="410" border="0" /></p>
<p>There are a handful of fun parks to try out on the Gold Coast, on this particular weekend we tried Dreamworld. We also have annual passes to Sea World, Movie World and White Water World. Dreamworld is perfect if you have kids that aren&#8217;t interested in the scary rides {well, great for those too! But Lacey isn&#8217;t at that age yet}, so we explored the kid section which has The Wiggles, Madagascar, Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. There is also the wildlife section so you can hang out with the animals, feed some kangaroos and make your way back to the front of the of the park for a face paint. For lunch I recommend the Billabong Buffet Restaurant, where you can sit down in the cool air-conditioning and choose between roast meats, vegetables, canapes and salads. They also have a dessert bar which is worth exploring.</p>

<p>You know life is tough when you&#8217;re struggling to decide between a facial and a massage, right? It was quite the dilemma I was faced with when offered a treatment at Spa Q. I sat in my fluffy white robe still pondering when my therapist came out to grab me. The good news? You don&#8217;t have to choose. They cater the treatment to you. So we did half and half, the best of both worlds. I have to say it was one of the best hours of my life, I walked out like a zombie, in another universe. So relaxed and preened, and blissed out.</p>

<p>A few weeks before our Gold Coast trip, Lacey and her class had been on an excursion to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary so we let her play tour guide for our visit. She showed us around, introduced us to all the animals, escorted us on our little train ride to the park and was a proud little guide. Hubby likes to see me squirm so he insisted we watch the bird show, and because I like to make him laugh &#8211; I agreed. I sat through that show in complete anxiety. Those birds are big, and the thought of them landing on my head freaked me out. But they were great. It was really interesting to hear about how they live off the land. A word to the budget-conscious Currumbin Wildlife Park isn&#8217;t cheap. We visited complimentary, but when we eyed off the prices we were surprised {$164 for a family} so make sure you pack a picnic and make a day of it.</p>

<h4>What to eat</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/BAZAAR_zps69bfddb5.jpg" alt=" photo BAZAAR_zps69bfddb5.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you take just one thing from this post, I want it to be this: <em>You simply must endeavor to eat at Bazaar once in your life. Please.</em></p>
<p>We all love a good buffet, right? Well, this buffet {which they call an Interactive Marketplace, because it&#8217;s a step-up from a buffet} is so good that people raved to me about it before I&#8217;d even had time to get excited. On my itinerary for the weekend it told me that we were eating there, but I didn&#8217;t Google it. I was mid-facial when my beautician asked where we were having dinner. &#8220;Oh, I hope you haven&#8217;t eaten all day!&#8221; she exclaimed. I didn&#8217;t know it was a buffet, but when I told Hubby he was thrilled.</p>
<p>This is like no other buffet I&#8217;ve met. The food is stunning, fresh and just beautiful quality. You want a wagyu steak? They&#8217;ll cook you one. My tip is to grab their tasting plate for the night. Ours had little pork buns, tuna tartare and other divine bits and bobs. You can get dumplings to order, eat from their fresh seafood bar, try one of their many dishes and salads, or do as you please. The salads were crazy. Full of flavour, and so fresh. I may have gone home and replicated some the next week. Just beautiful. And then there are the desserts &#8211; little bite-sized pieces of deliciousness. They also have an ice cream station, just like Cold Rock where Lacey had a little masterpiece created.</p>
<p>I took my sister and her boyfriend to Bazaar a week after we visited and they loved it. My sister was actually shocked that I knew about something so &#8216;hip&#8217; before her. <em>Puhlease.</em></p>
<p>Breakfast is just as beautiful. We visited last weekend and at only $25 each {plus Lacey is free}, it was a great morning out.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/MooMoo_zpsec3cf98c.jpg" alt=" photo MooMoo_zpsec3cf98c.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Back over at Broadbeach we were treated to fine dining experience at a restaurant called Moo Moo. It was located just metres away from Peppers, where we were staying, and was a whole lot of fancy. Lacey was the only child in the restaurant, but we&#8217;re lucky that she&#8217;s her best-behaved while we&#8217;re out {she keeps her naughty for when we&#8217;re at home}. Moo Moo&#8217;s specialises in meat, so we both order a steak {but different cuts} with a bunch of sides. Lacey ordered her all-time favourite, spaghetti bolognaise and gobbled it up quite promptly. Being a meat-lover, this was a big hit with Hubby. He raved about it. The atmosphere was relaxing. It&#8217;s a bit more upmarket, so wear something nice {by nice I mean no thongs!} if you plan to visit.</p>

<p>Just before heading home from the weekend away, we stopped into Oskars at Burleigh Heads for lunch. The views here are to die for, and the food is just as good. Think beautiful fresh food, perfect portions and taste that packs a punch. Just like Moo Moo it&#8217;s fine dining, but they cater for kids too. Lacey had a serving of fish and chips while sitting comfortably in a high chair.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find an excuse to get back to Oskars again. I said to Hubby over that lunch that I wanted my work Christmas party there, {work = me &amp; him} but we had a hectic December and it didn&#8217;t happen. I think I can feel a birthday lunch coming up.</p>
