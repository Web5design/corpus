				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo MORETON-8_zpsfe3e1dc2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/MORETON-8_zpsfe3e1dc2.jpg" width="640" height="426" border="0" /></p>
<p><em>Dear Lacey,</em></p>
<p><em>Every year your birthday comes around, and every year I play a little game in my head. I call it the &#8216;This time back when&#8217; game. It&#8217;s a little trip back memory lane that I think most mums play around the birthday of their children.</em></p>
<p><em>This morning I woke at crazy o&#8217;clock, also known as 3am. Sick of fighting the wake/sleep battle, I grabbed a blanket and headed for the lounge. Usually my early morning wake-ups go unnoticed. You and Dadda sleep on, like babies {well, babies that sleep that is}. This time Dadda came out to check on me. &#8220;You OK?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;You know this time five years ago you were in labour?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>And now this very time five years ago you were being placed on my chest. Your bare little body. The first time we touched. You cried. I cried. Dadda cried. We all cried.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s hard to remember life before you, Lacey. Was it quiet? Was it dull? How did we fill our days?</em></p>
<p><em>Life is different, I know that much is true. We still don&#8217;t sleep as much as we need or like, but that&#8217;s our life now. And you&#8217;re worth every under-eye bag. Because the good stuff far outweighs the bad.</em></p>
<p><em>The good is good. The way you write my name with such pride, for me. The way you can hear any music, and it doesn&#8217;t matter where we are or who is watching, you dance. And not just a little bop, but you throw yourself into it like you&#8217;re dancing for your life. Like no one is watching. The way you talk about your baby sibling with excitement. The way you love to hug. &#8220;Dad!&#8221; you&#8217;ll yell as he leaves for work, &#8220;I forgot to give you something!&#8221; And down the driveway you run to give him a necessary embrace. The way you ask constant questions, &#8220;Why does it rain? Why is the grass green? How? Who? What? When?&#8221; The way you have a beautiful heart filled with compassion. The way you make friends with such ease, and confidence. The way you embrace life with such enthusiasm.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s hard to believe that you&#8217;ve been here for five years, but at the same time it&#8217;s hard to imagine life before you too.</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo MORETON-6_zps650df22f.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/MORETON-6_zps650df22f.jpg" width="641" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<p><em>Last night you decided for the first time ever that you&#8217;d go to bed without a fight, so you crawled under your blankets and waited for sleep to come {for the record, it didn&#8217;t&#8230; but at least you tried}. I overheard you singing, a little made-up song filled with happy words. I came and sat beside your bed, &#8220;Hello my little 4 year old. When you wake in the morning you&#8217;ll be my 5 year old. All grown up.&#8221;
<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Talk to me some more Mama.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>So we talked. You told me where you want me to hide the presents, how you were going to be so big on your birthday and how your hair was growing so long now that you were nearly five. Simple conversations, but oh how I fought back tears. I have a five year old? I&#8217;m not sure how it happened but I do. And it&#8217;s you.</em></p>
<p><em>This time five years ago you made me a mum. I am forever grateful. Forever changed. Forever your mama.</em></p>
<p><em>I love you. Happy 5th birthday. May it be filled with rainbows, sparkles and lots of music.</em>
<br>
<em> Mama. xx</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><em>This is a sponsored post for <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/" target="_blank">Gumtree</a>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Birthday party" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PARTY_zps3d4d16d8.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;So&#8230;&#8221; I began, with some hesitation, &#8220;I have a weird request.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, preparing herself for whatever I was about to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;My daughter is having a birthday party and I want to get some round balloons. Not oval like normal, but round.&#8221; And yes, I made a round shape with my hands as I asked, as you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Round?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yeah, so you know normal balloons are more oval,&#8221; again showing her with my hands, &#8220;and these are more round. I can show you on my phone if you like? Or I can even buy some and bring them in to be filled up?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As this stage Hubby walked away from the conversation. It had reached a level of &#8216;weird lady {me} wanting round balloons&#8217; and he needed to escape.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I blame <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~pinterest.com/pin/161637074098491514/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for this round balloon obsession. By the end of the balloon session I&#8217;d ended up ordering no round balloons and 40 pink oval balloons {no glossy strings and no pearly colour on the balloons. Fussy? Me? Never}. Things kinda changed when Hubby said to me, &#8220;You know this party is for Lacey, right? Not for you.&#8221; <em>Understood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a total newbie to this party planning gig. Yes, we&#8217;ve done parties before&#8230; but just family and close friends. Now, we live in a totally new area {where round balloons aren&#8217;t the norm}, with totally new friends and a child that can tell me what she wants {unlike when she was 1 and I had total control of all the party details}.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from hosting parties and things, as well as attending them over the years, it&#8217;s that no one likes a stressed-out host. You&#8217;ve seen them. The people running around, a slight sweat {or glow, if we&#8217;re being kind} and they&#8217;re not having fun at all. So I knew that when I decided to have a party for Lacey that involved not just family {and taking into consideration that I&#8217;m preggers and still experiencing lovely morning sickness}, was that I&#8217;d outsource as much as possible. I know that sounds terribly fancy, but it&#8217;s not. Hang with me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo Gumtree_zps40664a85.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gumtree_zps40664a85.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/" target="_blank">Gumtree</a> came to me and asked if they could help out with Lacey&#8217;s party. At first I thought, what am I going to do? Sell Lacey in the classifieds? But then I remembered that they have a whole heap of listings for business services {which I used when I was a nanny}. So I agreed and got about planning. I set a budget. $200 for a cake. $600 for an entertainer. $150 for a cleaner&#8230; <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~pinterest.com/fatmumslim/birthday-parties/" target="_blank">And then I started pinning for inspiration.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apparently my head is still living in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, because once I&#8217;d started searching the Gumtree directory and emailing people things got GOOD. Having someone make the cake of my {ahem, Lacey&#8217;s!!} dreams? $40. <em>Seriously. </em>A fairy to entertain loads of kids for the WHOLE party? <em>Affordable! </em>A cleaner to make the house visitor-ready? <em>Cheap as chips. </em>And I actually even have money left over to have someone make all the food for me. <em>Sushi platters, sandwiches, cake pops, and sweet little sausage rolls, oh my.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I sound all confident and party-ready, don&#8217;t I? I&#8217;m not. Not quite. I&#8217;m quietly stressing out, because while the details might be sorted the big questions start to come in. How many kids should we invite? How many is too many? What if no one wants to come? How long should a party go for? Do parents stay too? Do I need to feed them? Is 11am too early to serve wine? And the list goes on&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, and will the party be the same without my {ahem, Lacey&#8217;s!!} perfect round balloons??</p>
<h4>Please send help. Any tips for a total kids party newbie? Survival tips kindly appreciated.</h4>

<p style="text-align: left;">Until very recently we had my Ma living with us, and feeding an extra mouth each night took a little more creativity than usual. Not that my Ma expects anything fancy, but it&#8217;s always nice to cook something delicious when you&#8217;ve got people to feed, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This isn&#8217;t the healthiest pasta dish {hello cream and butter} but it certainly is high on the yum factor. I wasn&#8217;t expecting it, but as everyone tucked into their first mouthful, a positive reaction quickly followed. &#8220;This is really good,&#8221; Ma exclaimed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now this dish is placed on the &#8216;will totally make again&#8217; list. I think next time I might throw in some toasted pine nuts for a little crunch.</p>

2 cloves garlic, crushed
<br>
1/3 cup vegetable stock
<br>
1/2 cup cream
<br>
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon rind
<br>
75g baby spinach leaves
<br>
1/3 cup coarsely chopped chives
<br>
shaved parmesan, to serve</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Cook pasta in a large saucepan of boiling water as per instructions on packaging {or until al dente}.
<br>
♥ While the pasta is cooking, work on the sauce. Cut zucchinis lengthways down the middle, and then slice thinly on the diagonal.
<br>
♥ Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan. Toss in the zucchini and garlic over medium heat and cook until the zucchini is tender. Add stock, stir to combine. Reduce the heat and add the cream, lemon rind, spinach and chives. Stir until all combined and heated through.
<br>
♥ Once the pasta is cooked, drain and then add to the zucchini mixture. Toss gently.
<br>
♥ Serve in bowls topped with parmesan cheese.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8455_zpsaf99f490.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8455_zpsaf99f490.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>1. L is for&#8230;</strong>
<br>
Lunch. Sometimes when Lacey is at preschool, Hubby and I like to sneak out for a cheap $10 lunch. It&#8217;s the upside of having one that works shift-work and me working from home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8466_zps40d18268.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8466_zps40d18268.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>2. I made this!</strong>
<br>
My chocolate coconut cake. You&#8217;ll want to make it. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/my-go-to-cake-donna-hays-melt-mix-chocolate-cake/" target="_blank">Recipe here.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8477_zps54ee3891.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8477_zps54ee3891.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>3. Key</strong>
<br>
This is one of those cheap toys that you get for free with those expensive kid magazines. Well, expensive for what they are. And yes, I&#8217;m a sucker for buying them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8505_zps1ec2b057.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8505_zps1ec2b057.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>4. Lucky</strong>
<br>
I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how much rain we&#8217;ve had this year so far. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s normal, but it rained so much. This day we had sun and it felt&#8230; lucky.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8515_zps5d2f6e12.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8515_zps5d2f6e12.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>5. Under</strong>
<br>
And because of that rain the umbrella is kinda necessary.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8544_zps75434eaa.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8544_zps75434eaa.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>6. Chair</strong>
<br>
These are from my favourite place on the coast, QT. So stylish that I want to live there. Forever.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8546_zps32d72da2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8546_zps32d72da2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>7. Fear</strong>
<br>
I kinda fear anything with wings. You don&#8217;t want to see me when one of these things pops up unexpectedly. It&#8217;s not pretty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8550_zpsdebb3db0.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8550_zpsdebb3db0.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>8. Favourite</strong>
<br>
When Hubby is on night shift, Lacey and I will cuddle up and do as we please. Sometimes it&#8217;s movies, or music &#8211; but always cuddled up in bed early.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8581_zps84cf6e93.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8581_zps84cf6e93.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>9. Faceless self-portrait</strong>
<br>
You&#8217;ll be happy to know that I had my roots done last week. Bad hair!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8728_zpsd38840cc.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8728_zpsd38840cc.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>10. I want&#8230;</strong>
<br>
{15 minutes or so of calm}. Doesn&#8217;t everyone?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8733_zps199ab34c.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8733_zps199ab34c.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>11. Important</strong>
<br>
Lacey wants to be an ambulance &#8216;girl&#8217; when she&#8217;s older. It&#8217;s a pretty important job.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8738_zps96bb0368.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8738_zps96bb0368.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>12. In the distance</strong>
<br>
We are lucky to live in a beautiful part of the world. Rainbows appear to be right on our doorstep.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8747_zps500835d0.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8747_zps500835d0.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>13. Sound</strong>
<br>
I know people often forget they&#8217;re pregnant after the first baby, but I&#8217;m so aware of this little person. Hearing that little heartbeat on this day was magic. I never get sick of it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8768_zpsb86cbf60.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8768_zpsb86cbf60.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>14. Tasty</strong>
<br>
We were on the cruise this day and we had a little cookies and cream cheesecake. It was delectable {even though it doesn&#8217;t look it!}</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8769_zps207032b7.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8769_zps207032b7.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>15. Explore</strong>
<br>
The cruise was perfect for Lacey because it was all pretty much safe for her to explore. She loved it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8805_zpsc3135879.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8805_zpsc3135879.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>16. 9 o&#8217;clock</strong>
<br>
This was such a big day. Our ship docked at Moreton Island, we fed dolphins and then headed back in to see the end of the circus show. Awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8812_zps14a6c8e4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8812_zps14a6c8e4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>17. Green</strong>
<br>
The faux grass on the ship.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8867_zps10ba2f02.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8867_zps10ba2f02.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>18. Shoes</strong>
<br>
Back home again, and into the rainy weather {!} it was time to break out the gumboots.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8870_zps584c42a4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8870_zps584c42a4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>19. A sign</strong>
<br>
This sign is in my living/dining room. Most people think it&#8217;s temporary {because of the tape} but I think they don&#8217;t realise just how cool fluro pink washi tape is!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8872_zps9b6634c4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8872_zps9b6634c4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>20. Clean</strong>
<br>
Sometimes you just have to pile up some things and clear the surfaces and the house is clean {or so it seems!}.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8880_zpsf04bd429.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8880_zpsf04bd429.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>21. Working</strong>
<br>
Sometimes I get some pretty cool things in the mail {less now than when I lived in the City}. This day I got a beautiful bouquet of goodies for the baby and a bus made of chocolate {which I can proudly say is pretty much still in tact in the fridge}.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8882_zps1fd3a8d2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8882_zps1fd3a8d2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>22. About me</strong>
<br>
{I am: female // 32 // married // a mama // with one on the way // happy // a blogger // a freelance writer // keen photo-taker // a dreamer // hopeful thinker // cake enthusiast // disgruntled maker of beds // trashy TV watcher}</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9043_zps3dd49fd2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9043_zps3dd49fd2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>23. What I do for fun</strong>
<br>
I love heading out and exploring. On this day we went to a nearby coastal town, visited the markets, tried some new food and hung by the pool at my Ma&#8217;s new place.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9049_zpsf457c90e.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9049_zpsf457c90e.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>24. Up</strong>
<br>
I love to look up. This is through a tree in my yard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9058_zps88c092d5.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9058_zps88c092d5.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>25. In your drawer</strong>
<br>
I keep cheap jewelry in my bedside table. Don&#8217;t try and rob me. It&#8217;s not worth it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9061_zpscd941ad2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9061_zpscd941ad2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>26. Something you did</strong>
<br>
I bought Lacey this sweet little dress for her birthday party.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9068_zps0dd95d26.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9068_zps0dd95d26.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>27. Pair</strong>
<br>
On another one of our cheap lunch dates. I&#8217;m craving real sushi {sashimi? Yes, please!}. But I settle for tempura and hot goodies instead.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9082_zpsa51e424e.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9082_zpsa51e424e.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>28. In the mirror</strong>
<br>
On our way down the coast.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9103_zpsb61bf61c.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9103_zpsb61bf61c.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
29. Goodnight
<br>
I need to get a wind-down routine that includes books, not TV. Working on it. {Must buy a lamp first!}.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9125_zps46ad5f60.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9125_zps46ad5f60.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>30. Relax</strong>
<br>
I never thought these words would come from my mouth {or typed from my fingers} but I actually like to garden. It was something I vowed I&#8217;d never enjoy. So far I&#8217;m only into weeding and I&#8217;m sure it will get old, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9129_zps681ca61e.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9129_zps681ca61e.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>31. Stuff</strong>
<br>
Stuffed. Poor little Lindt bunny. {And oh boy, this made me feel sick for a whole day}.</p>

<h4>How to play!</h4>
<p>Playing along with photo a day is super easy:
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Check out the April photo a day list.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Each day look at the daily prompt and take a photo according to whatever the prompt is. For example for day 1 the prompt is PLAY. It&#8217;s Easter Monday so I hope everyone can find some time for a little fun. Pick anything symbolises PLAY and snap it. It’s a great opportunity to get creative. Be inspired by a little creativity and see what you come up with.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Once you’ve taken the photo it’s time to share it. There are loads of places you can share it. See below for more details.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Check out other people’s photos. You can browse through them <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim" target="_blank">on my Facebook page</a>, in the <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSphotoaday/" target="_blank">FMS Photo A Day Facebook group</a>.

It will open your calendar program and ask if you want to add the calendar. This works on iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Mac and PC. Alternatively you can view the calendar online in your browser <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~bit.ly/16Tad4H" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>What’s the fab four?</h4>
<p>Each day I’ll be picking four photos on each Instagram and Facebook that have caught my attention, and sharing them to my Facebook and Instagram. To have your photos in the running you can just share them to <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim?filter=2" target="_blank">my Facebook page</a> or the <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSphotoaday/" target="_blank">FMS Photo A Day group</a> or the #FMSphotoaday Instagram feed, or both. It’s not a competition – just a fun way to put the spotlight on some photos from the community.</p>

<h4>What do the prompts mean?</h4>
<p>There are no rules when playing along with photo a day, you can be creative as you like! Interpret the prompt as you please. For those that need a little help, some more suggested details about each prompt are below:</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>1. Play:</strong> Take a photo of play. How do you like to have fun?
<br>
<strong>2. Blue:</strong> This is our charity prompt for Autism Awareness. Shoot something blue.
<br>
<strong>3. Something beginning with A:</strong> Find something beginning with the letter A, snap and share.
<br>
<strong>4. This happened today:</strong> Perhaps you&#8217;ll need to take a few photos today and share in a collage, or pick your favourite. What happened to you today?
<br>
<strong>5. Something good:</strong> What&#8217;s good in your life right now? Do share!
<br>
<strong>6. Air:</strong> This month we&#8217;re exploring the elements: air, earth, water and fire. Today share air. Tough, right?
<br>
<strong>7. Dreamy:</strong> To me dreamy is all about light and putting a filter over a photo that makes it a little whimsical. What does dreamy mean to you? Is it a place you like to escape to? Something you hope for?
<br>
<strong>8. On your plate:</strong> You could take this one literally: what&#8217;s on your plate for lunch etc? Or what you have on your to-do list right now&#8230;
<br>
<strong>9. Tiny:</strong> Look for the small things in life; little ants running across the path, a teeny flower just starting to bloom.
<br>
<strong>10. A place:</strong> Home, work, a cafe, your town, a place you visited&#8230; pick a place and share it. Perhaps even geotag it.
<br>
<strong>11. Detail:</strong> How can you show off the beautiful detail in something. Get in close and show it off, or just shoot something that has lots of detail worth appreciating.
<br>
<strong>12. In the middle:</strong> You can use &#8216;in the middle&#8217; for composition and take a photo of something smack-bang in the middle of the frame, or choose to shoot something that is placed in the middle of other things. It&#8217;s up to you.
<br>
<strong>13. View from your bed:</strong> What do you see when you wake up or go to bed at night? Share it.
<br>
<strong>14. Water:</strong> Share the element water. Is it the sea? In a glass? From a tap?
<br>
<strong>15. Alone:</strong> Take a photo of alone. Perhaps it&#8217;s how you feel, what you&#8217;re doing, or a lone object sitting on it&#8217;s own.
<br>
<strong>16. Your favourite colour:</strong> What&#8217;s your favourite colour right now?
<br>
<strong>17. Busy:</strong> What&#8217;s the busiest part of your day? Share it, or share something that is busy {a bee, a line at a cafe, a person working, you!}
<br>
<strong>18. Hello!:</strong> Use your imagination on this one. Is it how you greet someone? A sign? A look? Or something else?
<br>
<strong>19. Button:</strong> On your clothes, or a button you press to start/stop thing&#8230; or a belly button if you may!
<br>
<strong>20. On your mind:</strong> What are you thinking about today?
<br>
<strong>21. Fire:</strong> The fire element! A match? Candles on a cake? A fireplace? Be careful!
<br>
<strong>22. Blurry:</strong> How can you get creative and make your photo blurry? Move your camera quickly, or have your subject move quickly past the camera. This should be fun!
<br>
<strong>23. Time:</strong> You can show how time passes&#8230; the sun rising, a clock, something growing, or another way to represent time.
<br>
<strong>24. I saw this person today:</strong> Who did you see today? A friend, a loved one, a stranger? Shoot them. Well, don&#8217;t shoot them&#8230; but take a photo. You know what I mean.
<br>
<strong>25. Life is&#8230;:</strong> How is life today for you? Hard? Beautiful? Wonderous? Exhausting? Express it in a photo.
<br>
<strong>26. Childhood:</strong> Share something that represents childhood to you. Perhaps it&#8217;s a photo of you as a kid.
<br>
<strong>27. Earth:</strong> The last of the elements, how will you share earth with us?
<br>
<strong>28. My Sunday:</strong> To me Sundays seem like a sacred day. Some people go to church, some people rest or make pancakes, others get adventurous. I&#8217;d love to see what your Sunday looks like. You can even share more than one photo {a collage perhaps?}
<br>
<strong>29. I wore this today:</strong> Share your whole outfit, or just part of it.
<br>
<strong>30. Glasses:</strong> Drinking glasses giving a cheers, sunglasses or spectacles? You choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo BOOK_zps5cc100d4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/BOOK_zps5cc100d4.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Last year, when I worked for a big company, a large editors conference was called where editors of some of Australia&#8217;s most popular magazines were gathered. Myself, and a few others, from the digital teams of the same company were brought in to talk about working online. Being quite fresh to the big world of publishing, I thought it was going to be an ordinary conference with team-building, discussions and a little bit of inspiration thrown in, as well as finger sandwiches and sparkling water. In reality, it felt more like a crisis meeting {many magazines are experiencing declining readerships, and some were a little late in embracing the digital world}.</p>
<p>Having been a magazine addict since forever, I was sitting amongst some of my idols, Donna Hay for one. Shy and intimidated was I. The first morning of the conference I took a seat at one of the round tables, in the rather small room, with my workmate and watched as the editors rolled in. I recognised some, and then a woman took a seat beside me and I got a little giddy. It was the Australian Editor of Vogue. I remained calm and collected, and quite excitable within.</p>
<p>As the morning rolled on and we heard from various speakers, I watched as she eagerly scribbled in her notepad. I peered over her shoulder and watched her write &#8216;YOU TUBE&#8217;, underlining it to confirm its importance.</p>
<p>In the months since that conference, there came a lot of upheaval. People were let go, magazines updated their websites and some even got iPad Apps {digital world, consider yourself embraced}&#8230; but one major thing was that that editor of Vogue no longer had a job with the magazine after many loyal years.</p>
<p>My sister was in Greece when it happened, with some of her magazine-writing friends. We were talking on Skype and I gave her the update {I don&#8217;t think it made the national news over there somehow}. There were gasps and shock. Kirstie Clements was Vogue to us, so it was a huge shake-up.</p>
<p>When the book came out, I had to read it. I&#8217;m an impatient reader, so I read the first few chapters, skimmed through some in the middle and then headed to the back for the juicy bits. Oh, and I flicked through the pictures. Novels should have more pictures, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>It was a good book, insightful and interesting particularly to me because I was with the company when the shake-up happened. Being safely placed in digital we only overheard what was happening though.</p>
<p>When I mentioned a handful of books that I was reading last year, there was a bit of outrage that they were all non-fiction books. <em>&#8220;You need to escape!&#8221;</em> someone told me. So I&#8217;ve decided the next book I read will be all made-up. And I want your help. I hate wasting time on a bad book. I am fussy. I don&#8217;t do sci-fi, or fantasy. No vampires, or witches, nothing that isn&#8217;t believable. I loved Jodi Picoult&#8217;s &#8211; My Sister&#8217;s Keeper, Nicholas Sparks &#8211; The Notebook and would love something that has me not wanting to skim through the middle.</p>
<h4>Can you help a fussy reader out? What have you read that I REALLY need to read? Please.</h4>

<p>With the festival of chocolate {a.k.a. Easter} just around the corner, it might seem slightly insane of me to add to the chocolate frenzy&#8230; but why not? Chocolate <em>is</em> calorie-free this long weekend, right?</p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m being honest, I have to say I made this but didn&#8217;t taste it. Being a mousse I couldn&#8217;t {due to being pregnant} but Hubby was a happy taste-tester and said it was amazing. It&#8217;s light, chocolate-y enough and refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="A little treat: Mars Bar frozen mousse delight" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Mousse_zpsfa94bef0.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>6 Mars Bars
<br>
600ml thickened cream
<br>
3 eggs, separated
<br>
50g milk chocolate, melted {for decorating}</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Grab a loaf tin and spray it with cooking spray, and then line generously with cling wrap. Make sure it hangs over the sides to make it easier to pull out. I layered it twice to be safe.
<br>
♥ Chop 4 of the Mars Bars roughly and place into a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water. Make sure the water doesn&#8217;t touch the bottom of the bowl. Stir until melted. You&#8217;ll have to push the nougat parts of the chocolate bar into the bowl to break them up {you&#8217;ll understand when you&#8217;re doing it!}.
<br>
♥ Add 1/2 of the cream and mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Take the bowl off the heat, and let it cool slightly. Add the rest of the cream and the egg yolks.
<br>
♥ In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
<br>
♥ Gently fold it into the chocolate mixture until all combined. Pour it into the loaf tin, cover with cling wrap and then place in the freezer overnight.
<br>
♥ Once set, decorate with chopped Mars Bars and the milk chocolate drizzled over the top.</p>
<h4>Will you be indulging in chocolate this weekend? Or will you be well-behaved? {I&#8217;m usually a chocolate lover, but am preferring fruits instead, as well as salty things this pregnancy}.</h4>

<p>How long has it been since you went through your blog and social media platforms and gave them a little spruce up? Or a health check-up? Quite often I get so caught up in the &#8216;doing&#8217; that I forget to check-in and make sure everything is up-to-date and working properly. Below is a checklist of health-checks you might just need to perform on your various platforms. Go on, the Doctor is in the house!</p>
<h4>Facebook</h4>
<p>▢ How long has it been since you updated your profile photo or cover photo? For tips on how to make a great cover photo for your page, have a read of <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/how-to-make-your-facebook-cover-photo-all-fancy-like/" target="_blank">this post</a> I wrote last year.
<br>
▢ How is your Facebook page working for you? Go to your last post and down the bottom you&#8217;ll see &#8216;X people saw this post&#8217;, click on that. It&#8217;ll show you the post that connected most with your audience {or more correctly that the most people saw}. Have a think about how you can bring a bit more of that good stuff to your followers.
<br>
▢ Are you sharing a mix of links, photos, status updates etc on your page each week? Have a think about how you can mix it up a bit and engage your audience.
<br>
▢ A few bloggers have now taken on a new method of sharing links to their blog posts, by writing a status update and sharing the link in the comments. While I&#8217;m sure it works for some, remember two important things: user experience and share-ability. Is it offering your readers a good experience to have to click through the comments to get to the link? With Facebook one of our main goals is to make something so good that people want to share it {make it viral baby!}, and if you&#8217;ve got a link in the comments it gets totally lost and the post isn&#8217;t shareable at all {well it&#8217;s shareable, of course, but they&#8217;ll be sharing your status update not your link}.</p>
<h4>Twitter</h4>
<p>▢ Does your profile photo look like you, or is it a photo of you in 1998 when you were at your most fabulous? Make sure you have an updated photo of the current you.
<br>
▢ Have you checked out your profile page on Twitter? It will be one of the first places people go to check you out, so make sure it gives a great insight into you, or is at least witty enough that they&#8217;ll want to follow you ASAP.
<br>
▢ How is your header looking? Add a little jazz to your Twitter profile by uploading a photo or collage that shares a bit more about you. If you need a little help, you can use <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.twitcover.com/" target="_blank">TwitCover</a> to create one.
<br>
▢ Ask yourself &#8211; &#8220;Why am I actually on Twitter?&#8221; If it&#8217;s to connect, make sure that you&#8217;re taking a little time each week to be active and connect with others online. If it&#8217;s to share your website/blog, then why not check your blog stats to see that people are actually clicking from Twitter to read what you&#8217;ve written.</p>
<h4>Pinterest</h4>
<p>▢ Again, how is your profile photo? Is it up-to-date?
<br>
▢ Make sure that your website URL is highly visible so if people like your pins they can find more of you elsewhere.
<br>
▢ How often are you pinning stuff? Have a think about how you want Pinterest to work for you, and then set aside an amount of time each week/month to grow it. Perhaps it&#8217;s just a place for you to play, and that&#8217;s a-ok too!
<br>
▢ Is the content on your blog pinnable? You can check who has pinned your content by using the URL: http://pinterest.com/source/YOUR-WEB-ADDRESS {so mine is http://pinterest.com/source/fatmumslim.com.au/}. What are people pinning? Think about how you can make more shareable content on your site.
<br>
▢ Another great thing to do is to find people that inspire you online and follow them. Being inspired is a wonderful thing!</p>
<h4>Instagram</h4>
<p>▢ Instagram won&#8217;t bring a huge amount of traffic to your site, but that&#8217;s not really what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about having fun {mostly!} and growing your profile online. There are loads of ways to get involved {challenges are just one way}. You can share even the most boring on Instagram, but just as long as you&#8217;re sharing.
<br>
▢ Clean up your following feed, and find inspiring people to follow. Comment on their photos, be active in the Instagram community. You&#8217;ll be surprised how easy it is to make friends and connections.
<br>
▢ Are your profile details up-to-date? And how long has it been since you updated your profile picture? Freshen it up if it&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<h4>Your blog</h4>
<p>▢ Go through your blog with fresh eyes. Pretend you&#8217;re visiting it for the first time. Check your about page, contact page and other links. Make sure there&#8217;s a photo of you somewhere. Does it need a freshen up? Click all your social media links and make sure they still work. Go through and write a list of anything that needs updating or changing and put it on your to-do list for the next few weeks. If you want a new header but aren&#8217;t so crafty, look on Etsy for a new design or affordable designer.
<br>
▢ Make sure you&#8217;re being legal. If you&#8217;re running competitions on your blog, make sure you&#8217;re doing it right. In Australia all giveaways need to have an element of skill to them, otherwise you need to purchase a gaming licence <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.olgr.qld.gov.au/" target="_blank">{around $80 from here}</a>. If you&#8217;re running a Rafflecopter competition simply asking people to &#8216;like&#8217; your Facebook page to enter, and you haven&#8217;t purchased a licence, you&#8217;re risking hefty fines. Play safe!
<br>
▢ I know stats are so boring, and I try not to look at mine very often &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to check out what patterns are forming and get an insight to how people read your blog. Delve into what the page impressions and unique browsers have been for each month so far this year. Is your traffic going up, or down? Which posts have had the most impressions? Why do you think they did?
<br>
▢ Where is your traffic coming from? Have a think about how you can make that work for you more.
<br>
▢ Look at comments. Which posts got the most people talking on your blog?
<br>
▢ Look at shares {Facebook, Twitter, Pins etc}. Which posts got the most shares on your blog?</p>
<h4>Do your blog and social media platforms need a little health check-up? Which one do you give the most attention to?</h4>

<p>April is just around the corner. Don&#8217;t ask me how, but it is&#8230; so that means it&#8217;s time to embrace a new month of photo-taking fun. Above you&#8217;ll find some freshly cooked prompts and below you&#8217;ll find some easy instructions on how to play. Enjoy!</p>

<h4>How to play!</h4>
<p>Playing along with photo a day is super easy:
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Check out the April photo a day list.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Each day look at the daily prompt and take a photo according to whatever the prompt is. For example for day 1 the prompt is PLAY. It&#8217;s Easter Monday so I hope everyone can find some time for a little fun. Pick anything symbolises PLAY and snap it. It’s a great opportunity to get creative. Be inspired by a little creativity and see what you come up with.
<br>
<span style="color: #6eeed2;">♥</span> Once you’ve taken the photo it’s time to share it. There are loads of places you can share it. See below for more details.

<h4>How do I remember the prompts?</h4>
<p>There are a few ways you can grab the list or remember the prompts:
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> Come back here each day and click the button on the right-hand side to check out the list.
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> Right-click on the list above and save it to your desktop. Or if you’re on your phone you could take a screenshot and save it as your wallpaper. {To screenshot click the power button and home button at the same time}.
<br>
<span style="color: #f9ed1e;">♥</span> The very fabulous <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.alwaysapples.com.au/" target="_blank">Doug</a> has created a calendar for us. You can have the prompts added to your phone’s calendar by clicking <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~bit.ly/15KFbZw" target="_blank">here</a>. It will open your calendar program and ask if you want to add the calendar. This works on iPhone, iPad, Android phone, Mac and PC. Alternatively you can view the calendar online in your browser <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~bit.ly/16Tad4H" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>What’s the fab four?</h4>
<p>Each day I’ll be picking four photos on each Instagram and Facebook that have caught my attention, and sharing them to my Facebook and Instagram. To have your photos in the running you can just share them to <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/FatMumSlim?filter=2" target="_blank">my Facebook page</a> or the <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://www.facebook.com/groups/FMSphotoaday/" target="_blank">FMS Photo A Day group</a> or the #FMSphotoaday Instagram feed, or both. It’s not a competition – just a fun way to put the spotlight on some photos from the community.</p>

<h4>What do the prompts mean?</h4>
<p>There are no rules when playing along with photo a day, you can be creative as you like! Interpret the prompt as you please. For those that need a little help, some more suggested details about each prompt are below:</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>1. Play:</strong> Take a photo of play. How do you like to have fun?
<br>
<strong>2. Blue:</strong> This is our charity prompt for Autism Awareness. Shoot something blue.
<br>
<strong>3. Something beginning with A:</strong> Find something beginning with the letter A, snap and share.
<br>
<strong>4. This happened today:</strong> Perhaps you&#8217;ll need to take a few photos today and share in a collage, or pick your favourite. What happened to you today?
<br>
<strong>5. Something good:</strong> What&#8217;s good in your life right now? Do share!
<br>
<strong>6. Air:</strong> This month we&#8217;re exploring the elements: air, earth, water and fire. Today share air. Tough, right?
<br>
<strong>7. Dreamy:</strong> To me dreamy is all about light and putting a filter over a photo that makes it a little whimsical. What does dreamy mean to you? Is it a place you like to escape to? Something you hope for?
<br>
<strong>8. On your plate:</strong> You could take this one literally: what&#8217;s on your plate for lunch etc? Or what you have on your to-do list right now&#8230;
<br>
<strong>9. Tiny:</strong> Look for the small things in life; little ants running across the path, a teeny flower just starting to bloom.
<br>
<strong>10. A place:</strong> Home, work, a cafe, your town, a place you visited&#8230; pick a place and share it. Perhaps even geotag it.
<br>
<strong>11. Detail:</strong> How can you show off the beautiful detail in something. Get in close and show it off, or just shoot something that has lots of detail worth appreciating.
<br>
<strong>12. In the middle:</strong> You can use &#8216;in the middle&#8217; for composition and take a photo of something smack-bang in the middle of the frame, or choose to shoot something that is placed in the middle of other things. It&#8217;s up to you.
<br>
<strong>13. View from your bed:</strong> What do you see when you wake up or go to bed at night? Share it.
<br>
<strong>14. Water:</strong> Share the element water. Is it the sea? In a glass? From a tap?
<br>
<strong>15. Alone:</strong> Take a photo of alone. Perhaps it&#8217;s how you feel, what you&#8217;re doing, or a lone object sitting on it&#8217;s own.
<br>
<strong>16. Your favourite colour:</strong> What&#8217;s your favourite colour right now?
<br>
<strong>17. Busy:</strong> What&#8217;s the busiest part of your day? Share it, or share something that is busy {a bee, a line at a cafe, a person working, you!}
<br>
<strong>18. Hello!:</strong> Use your imagination on this one. Is it how you greet someone? A sign? A look? Or something else?
<br>
<strong>19. Button:</strong> On your clothes, or a button you press to start/stop thing&#8230; or a belly button if you may!
<br>
<strong>20. On your mind:</strong> What are you thinking about today?
<br>
<strong>21. Fire:</strong> The fire element! A match? Candles on a cake? A fireplace? Be careful!
<br>
<strong>22. Blurry:</strong> How can you get creative and make your photo blurry? Move your camera quickly, or have your subject move quickly past the camera. This should be fun!
<br>
<strong>23. Time:</strong> You can show how time passes&#8230; the sun rising, a clock, something growing, or another way to represent time.
<br>
<strong>24. I saw this person today:</strong> Who did you see today? A friend, a loved one, a stranger? Shoot them. Well, don&#8217;t shoot them&#8230; but take a photo. You know what I mean.
<br>
<strong>25. Life is&#8230;:</strong> How is life today for you? Hard? Beautiful? Wonderous? Exhausting? Express it in a photo.
<br>
<strong>26. Childhood:</strong> Share something that represents childhood to you. Perhaps it&#8217;s a photo of you as a kid.
<br>
<strong>27. Earth:</strong> The last of the elements, how will you share earth with us?
<br>
<strong>28. My Sunday:</strong> To me Sundays seem like a sacred day. Some people go to church, some people rest or make pancakes, others get adventurous. I&#8217;d love to see what your Sunday looks like. You can even share more than one photo {a collage perhaps?}
<br>
<strong>29. I wore this today:</strong> Share your whole outfit, or just part of it.
<br>
<strong>30. Glasses:</strong> Drinking glasses giving a cheers, sunglasses or spectacles? You choose.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p>Prior to this past weekend I was a cruise virgin. I&#8217;d never been aboard a cruise ship, and my freshness was evident by the fact that I repeatedly called the ship a boat, even to the Captain. He wasn&#8217;t very impressed. &#8220;Do you know what the difference is between a ship and a boat?&#8221; he asked. I shook my head and moved the conversation on as quickly as possible. <em>Whoops.</em></p>
<p>The great thing about press-trips is that I mostly have very little expectations. When planning a trip of my own, I plan the heck out of it and get excited over the little details &#8211; hoping that it will live up to my every expectation. I did wonder, as I packed my suitcase, just how small the rooms were, if I&#8217;d get claustrophobic or sick of the seeing the same people on the ship over the weekend. {For the record the rooms were bigger than I imagined, I didn&#8217;t feel closed in at all and I rarely saw the same person more than once &#8211; unless of course I intended to}.</p>
<p>One thing I hadn&#8217;t even thought about was the movement of the boat. It totally slipped my mind. I imagined that we&#8217;d cruise through the water without feeling a thing. Some parts of the trip and others were more &#8216;moving&#8217;. Sunday night was a really rough night. With swells of around 10m it felt like I was sleeping on a trampoline with a herd of children bouncing around me. The bed slipped from underneath me as it bounced off the waves, and returned me back when it found the water again. Hubby had become well acquainted with the bathroom, sea-sickness in full force. It was unusual, we were told by the well-traveled cruise-lovers. I didn&#8217;t mind the movement. It was different to anything I&#8217;d ever experienced. I didn&#8217;t sleep much, more worrying about Hubby than anything else.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The side decks were always quiet, like little hidden gems, so it was a good place to chill and look out at the ocean.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We played Bingo twice, and didn&#8217;t win. It&#8217;s so much more fun than I remembered it {from when I played it with my Nanna}. A comedian ran the event and he may have made a few people do the chicken dance. Hilarious.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The view from The Bridge {where the Captain does his thing}. That pool you see is just for the staff. Lucky buggers.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And the pool for the rest of us, which was located on one of the top decks &#8211; surrounded by all the action. There&#8217;s restaurants, a spa, a gym, an ice-cream bar {for after the gym!}, loads of deck chairs, heaps of activities, spas, live music, a big screen, kids club and more.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO13_zpsbe164c13.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meeting the Captain. He said, &#8220;Look out at the horizon, can you see there&#8217;s a little bit of swell?&#8221; I think he was trying to gently tell me that it was going to be a bumpy night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO14_zps193dd365.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Another deck. I was surprised that, with a fully booked cruise, that I didn&#8217;t see more people everywhere. The ship is so big that there&#8217;s enough room for everyone and more.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="All aboard: A weekend on the P&amp;O Pacific Jewel" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PampO16_zps6600e63a.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The Pacific Jewel is home to Salt Grill by Luke Mangan. While food from two of the restaurants are included in your package, Salt Grill is an extra $40 for a 3-course meal. Definitely worth the money. We would easily pay $100 each on land for such a meal. You can also get the most delicious Thai meal {8 courses, no less!} at La Luna for just $25. Bargain.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There&#8217;s so much to see and do. On the Saturday night there was a circus show that was pretty darn amazing. One of my sister&#8217;s friends is the Dance Captain on another ship and she does acts just like this. Some people are far too talented.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Most people left the ship on the Saturday for a day on Moreton Island. I&#8217;ll share a little more about that in another post as this one is getting loooooong.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Pulling into Sydney Harbour. It was exciting to see land again. We were home! {This is the view from our room}.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve had a handful of people ask me via email and elsewhere what I thought of the cruise, and whether I&#8217;d recommend it. This particular cruise is only a short one, a total of 4 days away. It&#8217;s the first that&#8217;s ever been done to Moreton Island. We had a 4-berth room with a window {or porthole} and I think it cost around the $450 per person mark. That includes entertainment and food. I thought that was quite good for a family trip &#8211; because you could definitely holiday without finding any unexpected costs. You can of course spend more by adding in onshore activities, alcohol, kids club fees, spa treatments&#8230; etc, but the financially savvy could make sure that they stayed on budget. I found the drinks and extra on board to be affordable. We put Lacey into Kids Club a few times for short periods and it was free.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was also lucky enough to have a spa treatment, a enzyme facial, which was beautiful. One of the journalists I traveled with also found it different to be moving around with the movement of the ship as we had our treatments. It wasn&#8217;t distracting, just so new for someone who has only done such things on land!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Would I recommend it? Yes. I think it&#8217;s a great family-friendly way to holiday &#8211; with lots of yummy food and ways to be entertained. Lacey and I had a great time, and so did Hubby until the very last, bumpy night &#8211; where he decided that he would probably never cruise again. Seasickness is the pits, apparently!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Have you ever cruised before? Where did you go to? Or are you a cruise-virgin like I was?</p>
