<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Beef &amp; Pork rissoles with jazz apple salad" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/10-dollar-dinner-1_zpsfe732143.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<p>For the past month or so, I&#8217;ve been on a mission. A budgeting mission. It&#8217;s been one of those months where money seems to be raining from our bank accounts, and it all started with our cars. One car needed some new brakes, so I took it off to get fixed. Of course, they found a few other bits and pieces that needed work. Then, another car stopped working properly and needed two new tyres as well. How boring is paying for car stuff? And stressful too.</p>
<p>With a baby on the way, we&#8217;ve entered into total budget zone. I usually find budgets pretty boring, but I&#8217;ve tried to make the most of it. As we do the weekly grocery shopping I have an amount in mind that I don&#8217;t want to go over, and it&#8217;s $100. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose. I was devastated when I missed it by $2 over the weekend. I let the checkout attendant know too, &#8220;Missed it by that much!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo 10-dollar-dinner_zpsb199e73f.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/10-dollar-dinner_zpsb199e73f.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Coles recently sent me over to their <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~recipes.coles.com.au/campaigns/165/feed-your-family-for-under-10/page-1/?c_nm=Feed your Family&amp;c_ch=Blogger%20outreach&amp;c_nt=Fat%20Mum%20Slim&amp;c_pl=Sponsored%20post" target="_blank">$10 dinner section </a>to pick a recipe to recreate. When I think cheap dinners, I definitely think there will be no meat involved {and therefore a somewhat disappointed husband}, but not so. They all involved some sort of protein which makes everyone happy in our little family.</p>
<p>This recipe was fresh and delicious. I&#8217;ve never had apples in a savoury dish like this, and it works so well. I think Lacey was a bit confused with why I was putting apples in her salad&#8230; but she&#8217;s getting more used to my weird ways, I hope.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo 10-dollar-dinner-3_zps97ac8ded.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/10-dollar-dinner-3_zps97ac8ded.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>3 medium red washed potatoes {make sure these are around the same size}
<br>
2 tbs white wine vinegar
<br>
1 tbs chopped fresh thyme
<br>
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
<br>
1/3 cup olive oil, plus 2 tbs extra
<br>
1/2 small red onion, sliced thinly
<br>
50g baby spinach
<br>
1 jazz apple, cored and cut into 1/2cm thick slices</p>
<p><strong>Rissoles</strong>
<br>
500g packet pork &amp; beef bolognaise mince
<br>
1/2 small red Onion, finely chopped
<br>
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
<br>
1 tbs chopped fresh thyme
<br>
1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
<br>
1/2 tsp ground paprika
<br>
1 large free range egg
<br>
Olive oil, for brushing</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Sprinkle with a little salt. Bring to the boil and cook for 7 minutes, or until the potatoes begin to soften but are still firm in the centre. Be careful to not over cook the potatoes, as you&#8217;ll be grilling them later {I used a timer because I have a habit of forgetting!}. Drain the potatoes and return them to the pan to dry and cool. Once they&#8217;re cool enough to handle, cut the potatoes into about 1/2cm-thick slices.
<br>
♥ While the potatoes are cooking, place the vinegar, thyme and mustard in a bowl and whisk to blend. Slowly add 1/3 cup of the oil whilst whisking to incorporate. Stir in the onion. Season with salt and pepper.
<br>
♥ Now to make the rissoles; combine the pork and beef mince, onion, garlic, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, paprika, and egg. Season with salt and pepper. Make 8 balls out of the mix.
<br>
♥ Preheat the barbecue or large frying pan over medium-high heat. Brush the rissoles with oil {or just drizzle some into the pan} and cook for 3 mins each side, or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate and rest for 3 mins. {Again I put on the timer, and it cooked them perfectly. I&#8217;m not the best at making rissoles normally, as they fall apart, but using the timer worked wonders!}.
<br>
♥ Meanwhile, brush the potatoes with the remaining 2 tbs oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the potatoes for 3 mins each side, or until grill marks form. Transfer hot potatoes to the bowl of vinaigrette and toss to coat.
<br>
♥ Finish the salad by adding the spinach and apple to the warm potatoes and vinaigrette. Gently toss to coat. Divide the salad and rissoles among 4 plates. Drizzle with any remaining dressing and serve.</p>
<p><em>For more delicious recipes that won&#8217;t break the budget, head over to the <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~recipes.coles.com.au/feed-your-family/?c_nm=Feed your Family&amp;c_ch=Blogger%20outreach&amp;c_nt=Fat%20Mum%20Slim&amp;c_pl=Sponsored%20post" target="_blank">Coles recipe section</a>. I&#8217;m giving the prawn fettuccine a whirl next. The recipe cost just $9.90 to make {you can see a breakdown of the costs back on their site}, but I had a lot of the ingredients at home {i.e. garlic, paprika, Worcestershire sauce etc} so it came way under budget for me, and that’s always something to cheer about.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="CUP " src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/CUP_zps70693d3f.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I grew up in the Country, but I did spend the past 13 years living in the City. When I was pregnant with Lacey, I gave birth in one of Sydney&#8217;s best hospitals. To be honest, I&#8217;m kinda making that up. I&#8217;ve not frequented many hospitals, so I can&#8217;t compare but it seemed pretty good {besides its dated purple walls}. For this pregnancy I&#8217;ve been sent to a hospital that seems like a whole bush-trek away, it&#8217;s a tiny country hospital that I have to drive over mountains, bridges and bushes to get to. They do things differently there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For starters, on arrival I walked into a teeny room filled with pregnant women {the waiting room at my Sydney hospital would have been 10 times the size}. I&#8217;m not complaining, just comparing. I introduced myself to the receptionist, who pointed to a stack of coffee cups and asked me to go pee in one and come back and wait for my appointment. I&#8217;m not sure how comfortable I am sitting in a room with other people {partners included} with an open cup of urine. But I did it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are things that I just forgot become totally normal when you&#8217;re pregnant. I had my third appointment just this week, and I&#8217;m an old hat at the coffee cup thing. I see newly pregnant women come in and kinda baulk at the idea, I give them a knowing look and we giggle. <em>Welcome to the new normal sunshine.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other things that are completely normal during pregnancy? These.</p>
<h4>Crying anywhere, anytime. Even in the supermarket.</h4>
<p>I went to visit my Ma at work on Monday, and I spotted the <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/fifi-box-shares-the-first-picture-of-her-baby-daughter-beatrix-belle-box/story-fn907478-1226621477652" target="_blank">New Idea with Fifi Box on the cover</a> {she&#8217;s an Australian radio host for those not playing in Australia}. So Ma and I flicked through it, and the tears rolled down my face. Why was I crying? I can&#8217;t be sure. I think it was the fact that she looked like a real new mum {no make-up and no back-to-fab-body-shots-in-a-bikini}, and that Jules was there by her side supporting her as he said he would. Oh the tears.</p>
<h4>Peeing on demand.</h4>
<p>I know, enough with the toilet talk. But it seems at every appointment I have they either want me to drink a rather large amount of water and hold it for extended periods, or pee into small cups. And so I do it, on demand. It&#8217;s a fine art.</p>
<h4>People making comments.</h4>
<p>This has happened more than once. I see someone after a while of not seeing them and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh you look great! How are you feeling?&#8221; I&#8217;ll mention the constant morning sickness, and they&#8217;ll respond, &#8220;Yeah, you don&#8217;t look good, but I didn&#8217;t want to say anything.&#8221; <em>Umm, thank you.</em> Also, apparently sex {the bedroom kind, not the gender} is open conversation too. <em>Uncomfortable?</em> You bet.</p>
<h4>But talking about gender, that&#8217;s on everyone&#8217;s lips too.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m so guilty of this. So so guilty. I ask every pregnant person, &#8220;How are you feeling?&#8221; quickly followed by &#8220;Do you know what sex the baby is?&#8221; And now I&#8217;m getting the same too. {But seriously, what else are we supposed to ask?}</p>
<h4>Smiling for {seemingly} no reason at all.</h4>
<p>The best thing that I totally forgot about being pregnant is the secret bond between me and the baby. Feeling the baby kick is like magic, and I&#8217;ll often find myself smiling over those little movements&#8230; and to anyone not in my head {which is everyone, hopefully!} it looks like I&#8217;m having a grand old time by myself. I&#8217;m just happy, and grateful.</p>
<h4>For the mamas among us, what surprised you most about pregnancy?</h4>

<p>Watched Star Wars or Star Trek {perhaps they&#8217;re the same thing? I&#8217;m <em>that</em> clueless}, held a 50 Shades of Grey novel, or tried pilates. I&#8217;ve never traveled {in Australia} beyond the East Coast, been brave enough to jump out of plane or any other adrenalin-junkie-type activity  or had more than a wee sip of coffee.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Weetbix Slice" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/weetbic-slice_zps699647cc.jpg" width="640" height="898" border="0" /></p>
<p>Back in the day, when I was in primary school, we used to have a &#8216;thing&#8217; called Cake &amp; Slice day. Parents would bake their hearts out late at night, and the kids would take the goods into school the next day to be sold. We had a huge table in the playground where all the cakes and slices would be set up, and the kids would come along with their silver coin and purchase a little baked goodie.</p>
<p>My Ma always made one of two slices, either <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/chocolate-fudge-bars/" target="_blank">chocolate fudge bars</a> {so good!} or Weet-Bix slice. Instead of trying another family&#8217;s creation, I always looked out for my mum&#8217;s slice and paid 20c for a piece. I was kinda funny like that.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t tried Weetbix slice since back in those days at school, and I actually thought that I probably wouldn&#8217;t like it. Weet-Bix? In a slice? Maybe it wasn&#8217;t as good as I remembered. When I mentioned to Hubby, who is totally NOT a Weet-Bix kid, he turned up his nose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Weet-Bix kid from way back. It was my breakfast of choice, and still is. Lacey had her first try on the weekend, and she&#8217;s not a fan either. &#8220;Too slobbery,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Thankfully they both liked the slice. The Weet-Bix adds a little crunch to the base. I&#8217;d pay 20c at least for it. Do they still have Cake &amp; Slice days at schools?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Weetbix Slice" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/weetbix-slice-2_zpse36c9f77.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>3 Weet-Bix, crushed
<br>
1 1/2 cups self-raising flour
<br>
1 cup dessicated coconut
<br>
150g butter, melted
<br>
3/4 cup brown sugar</p>
<p><strong>Icing</strong>
<br>
3/4 cup icing sugar
<br>
2 tbs cocoa
<br>
50g butter, melted
<br>
1 tbs hot water</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celsius.
<br>
♥ Grease and line a tray with baking paper.
<br>
♥ Place all the dry ingredients into a large bowl. Mix to combine. Add melted butter and stir until completely combined.
<br>
♥ Press the slice into the tray, smooth over with the back of a spoon and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
<br>
♥ While the slice cools, make the icing. Mix all ingredients in a small bowl, until smooth and combined. Pour over slice and spread until completely covered. You can sprinkle with a little coconut for added fancy.</p>
<p><em>Note: I&#8217;m not sure if Weet-Bix is sold anywhere other than Australia, but it&#8217;s a breakfast cereal. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weet-Bix" target="_blank">You can see a picture here</a>, and maybe find an alternative where you live.</em></p>

<p>A message from a friend hit my inbox last week and the gist of it was, &#8220;How do you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8216;it&#8217;, she meant everything; working/living/parenting. How do I get the balance right?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never tried to create that illusion. I am the most imperfect person ever. Just one look at me will tell you that. So I told her so, I don&#8217;t and I don&#8217;t know anyone that can or does.</p>
<p>You see that picture up there? That&#8217;s Lacey&#8217;s bedroom. It&#8217;s been like that for 6 whole days now. There&#8217;s a new little boy in the neighbourhood who came to visit. Lacey thinks that anyone that walks past our house should have a tour of our home. It drives me bananas, mainly because it&#8217;s never in a state to be shown off. I can master one room at a time, and this time it wasn&#8217;t her bedroom {but boy our bedroom is looking awesome right now if anyone cares to know}. So the little boy walked in, and then walked out. In all his 5 year old wisdom he said to me, &#8220;That room is so messy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it is. It looks like a bunch of fairies had a party and threw up all over it. Lacey is responsible for it all, except the drawer&#8230; that&#8217;s my doing. I&#8217;m the person who leaves cupboard doors open, drawers hanging and wet towels hanging over doors.</p>
<p>Apparently the little boy in the neighbourhood takes great pride in his room. He told me a story of how he cleaned his desk for when his grandma came to visit. And then she didn&#8217;t come, and he had a clean desk to show off and no one to see it. So he went to bed sad. I hope he hangs around and that some of his cleaning habits rub off on Lacey.</p>
<p>I would love to have a constantly clean home. I would love to play educational games with my daughter all day. I&#8217;d love to drink 2 litres of water without fail. I wish I had buns of steel. I would love to be the mum who makes amazing meals from scratch with organic produce every single night. I&#8217;m just not. I do what I can, when I can. Some days I do better than others.</p>
<p>I juggle stuff. I drop balls all the time. Last week at preschool I was chatting to the teacher about everyday stuff and she asked, &#8220;What did you cook for dinner last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>I told her that I made homemade sausage rolls and salad. <em>I lied.</em> I cooked some pre-made {not by me, by someone else} sausage rolls in the oven {they were gourmet, I&#8217;ll give myself that} and teamed them with some rocket, carrot and tomato. Fancy? Not in the slightest, but it got eaten. I still don&#8217;t know why I lied, it just came out.</p>
<p>Life is a balancing act. I don&#8217;t know a perfect parent. I like imperfect parents. One day I went to visit a friend, who just happened to be one of the most together friends I know, and her house was in a state of imperfection. Similar to how mine might be if you popped around right now. She apologised profusely. I was like, &#8220;Oh, who cares!&#8221; Because I don&#8217;t. Really, I wanted to embrace her with arms wide open, break out into song &amp; dance, and rejoice at the imperfection. Maybe even break out some jazz hands.</p>
<p>I know some mums have moments of perfection. And yes, I envy them in those moments, but deep down I know there&#8217;s another mum somewhere with a room in her house that looks like a fairy farted in it. And I like it. There is comfort in that.</p>
<h4>So, out with it. Confess your imperfections. What state is your house in right now? Or if it&#8217;s visitor-ready, do share something that will make me feel better about the state of that room above. <em>Please.</em></h4>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>Cloaked in their very ordinariness, the prosaic events that truly shape our lives—that truly are our lives—escape our notice.</strong></em>   Gary Morson</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this make you want to embrace the everyday? To soak up the sunshine, the feel of clean sheets underneath your skin at night, the sweet taste of cake {or perhaps that first coffee in the morning}, the way the ones you love laugh, and the way they say your name?</p>
<p><em>Enjoy the everyday. </em></p>
<h4>What ordinary moments make you smile when you stop and take notice?</h4>

<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo PARTY_zpsa100467a.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PARTY_zpsa100467a.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a rite of passage that parents have to go through {endure, if you will} and that&#8217;s to host a kids birthday party. Be it small, or big&#8230; most parents will go through it, no doubt. Some will glide through with ease and finesse and others {ahem, me!} will have their moments of frazzle-dom {not a word, but it should be}.</p>
<p>I am going to put it out there, but Lacey&#8217;s 5th birthday party was my practice run&#8230; for all the parties to come. There won&#8217;t be one every year, but I have no doubt that I will probably host another before she moves out of home, and I will master that baby. It will be the party to beat all parties. Seriously though, I learned a lot from the party just hosted, and I am happy to be guinea pig and share my little lessons learned with you. <em>You&#8217;re welcome.</em></p>
<h4>Follow the recipe for a perfect party.</h4>
<p>I think they should hand this information out to all parents as they leave hospital. It should be in a book of practical things parents should know {with other such things like: Your kid is probably going to eat something pretty much non-edible {dirt, snails, poop} but they&#8217;ll be OK}. There&#8217;s a recipe for kids parties, which I learned from Autumn on <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/please-send-help-party-planning-newbie-alert/" target="_blank">this post</a>. She advised that when inviting kids, invite the number that the birthday girl/boy is turning, plus 2.  So Lacey should have had 7. <em>Perfect.</em> We had 15. Seven would have been much more manageable.</p>
<h4>Balloons. Always get the balloons.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at how entertaining helium balloons can be. The kids spent most of the party playing with the balloons. So GET THE BALLOONS! {We found our fab balloon lady through Gumtree}.</p>
<h4>Remember what&#8217;s important to your child.</h4>
<p>I didn&#8217;t let Lacey make too many decisions with the party, because it would have led to disappointment. She&#8217;d want a REAL rainbow, and a REAL unicorn, and REAL magic. Instead I asked what she wanted to do at her party, and that was dance with her friends. I also asked what colour she wanted everything to be, and that was pink. So I made sure those two things happened, and then planned everything else to suit, keeping in mind things she loves as I did so.</p>
<h4>Outsource when you can.</h4>
<p>I know budgets vary, but you can outsource {with local business services, and/or help from family and friends} where possible to save stress, time and a mental breakdown. I was lucky enough to be given help with the budget, so while I knew I could make a cake, it would be something I&#8217;d agonise over &#8211; so I had a local lady <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/robina/party-catering/manda-s-sweet-treats/1014991619" target="_blank">{sourced through Gumtree}</a> make the cake for $40. I knew once I&#8217;d bought ingredients and calculated the time it would take &#8211; it was better to outsource. At other parties I&#8217;ve asked my Aunt to make the cake and she thinks it&#8217;s such an honour. My priority was having someone entertain the kids for the whole party. I can be out there when I&#8217;m with people I know, but being new to the &#8216;hood I know it would take away much of the stress if that part was outsourced too. You can find affordable services over on Gumtree. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable they were <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/" target="_blank">{look under business services &gt; party/catering}</a>. I was also able to outsource the party food through a local caterer I found on Gumtree {I saved money by just having them drop off the food, so I didn&#8217;t have to pay for their time during the party etc}. You can find great caterers that make platters, finger foods and lots more. Depending on what your budget is you could outsource everything and REALLY enjoy the party, or just choose important things to help you out a bit.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t aim for perfection.</h4>
<p>I had to remind myself of this a few times, that it didn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Lacey wouldn&#8217;t notice the details, and the most important thing was that she had fun. I have a theory with any event &#8211; that something will go wrong. It&#8217;s not a pessimistic view, but just a little bit realistic. So once that one thing breaks or goes awry I breathe a sigh of relief, work around it and move on. Preferably that thing is an easy fix, if not&#8230; drink wine.</p>
<h4>Write lists. Lots of them.</h4>
<p>Your brain is going to be filled with details, so give your brain a break and write lists of things you need to do. I printed out 5 of these babies <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~getbuttonedup.com/2010/02/17/tool-free-printable-daily-schedule-form/#" target="_blank">{printable daily planner}</a> and wrote down everything I needed to do, down to the most boring detail. It just meant it was all out of my head, onto paper&#8230; and then I could delegate too.</p>
<h4>Have a back-up plan.</h4>
<p>Unfortunately on the day our entertainer was delayed, so it meant that we were left without someone to keep the kids happy. A minor freakout later, I enlisted my sister {who just happens to be a big event planner for people like Lady Gaga} and we were on track. I had a pin the horn on the unicorn game in the cupboard that we pulled out, we put on some music and played statues, and then spent some time opening the presents until the fairy arrived.</p>
<h4>Have fun.</h4>
<p>My advice for anyone getting married is to steal some time away from everyone, grab your new husband and have a moment. It&#8217;s the same with a party, take a little time to watch your little person and all the fun they&#8217;re having. Talk to the parents, enjoy some cake, and try to relax.</p>
<h4>And now for all the details&#8230;</h4>

<p>If you believed everything you ever saw in movies about pregnancy, you&#8217;d assume that it&#8217;s a pretty glamorous existence. It&#8217;s all bump out the front, pampering and lots of glowing.</p>
<p>The truth is, I don&#8217;t glow. Instead I get adolescent-type skin conditions that make me want to hibernate for weeks on end. I totally forgot what pregnancy was like for me. I remembering saying to Hubby, &#8220;Oh, pregnancy was a breeze for me, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot me a look as if to say, &#8216;ARE YOU SERIOUS??&#8217;</p>
<p>I think I must have complained just a wee bit last time. Just a little.</p>
<p>Being pregnant is a super blessing. I don&#8217;t talk about it much here, or I try not to&#8230; because I know pregnancy stuff is only really interesting if you&#8217;re pregnant yourself. It&#8217;s kinda like weddings, they&#8217;re fun and all but I am only really interested in your place-cards if I&#8217;m in the midst of planning a wedding myself. <em>Sorry.</em></p>
<p><em>But indulge me for a moment, won&#8217;t you?</em> Today I&#8217;m officially halfway to meeting my baby. It&#8217;s been different to last time, in so many ways. Last time I was working hard, physically. I felt kinda invincible. Now I&#8217;m so aware of this baby and how precious it is. Plus the morning sickness is still hanging around, so I&#8217;m feeling a little bit precious myself.</p>
<p>Last time I had gained a nice chunk of weight by the halfway mark. This time I&#8217;ve gained nothing {actually lost weight} so I feel better about my body than I did back then. Last time I had no issues, and this time is similar &#8211; despite doctors being really wary &#8211; except for being low on vitamin B and getting a monthly injection to keep it up. This time I&#8217;m really dragging my feet. I&#8217;ve never been so tired. Some days it&#8217;s an effort to do anything, but for a week or so after the injection I&#8217;m all motivated and capable. <em>Bliss.</em></p>
<p>Last time I had the baby&#8217;s room all decked out, painted and ready by the halfway mark, this time the room is completely empty. Stupidly, I didn&#8217;t save anything from Lacey. Not a pram, cot or bouncer. So I need to get my act together and get sorted.</p>
<p>We saw our baby on Monday, and it&#8217;s already so super cute and well-behaved. We&#8217;re hoping it keeps up the well-behaved bit. It&#8217;s little hands were holding it&#8217;s face and my heart melted. I can&#8217;t wait to meet him/her. It&#8217;s nice to jump {although very slowly!} over the halfway line. So nice.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not finding out the sex this time. We did with Lacey and this time we want a surprise.</p>
<h4>Mamas, did you find out what sex your baby was? Or did you keep it a surprise?</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo balloon_zps759c814f.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/balloon_zps759c814f.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>Back when we were kids my little sister got a game piece stuck up her nose. Not matter how we tried, nothing could get it out. Ma poked, and tweezed and begged her to blow it out. It didn&#8217;t budge. So she shipped us off to a neighbour for the afternoon, packed my sister in the car and got ready to head to hospital&#8230; when all of a sudden somebody sneezed and the game piece was free.</p>
<p>My story is nothing like that one. <em>Just saying.</em></p>
<p>With pregnancy, for me, comes an array of lovely headaches. When I was pregnant with Lacey I used to see a kind Chiro named Igor who would quickly place my neck in weird positions and the sweet relief would be amazing. Now that we&#8217;ve moved I had to find a replacement. A quick Google and I found my new man, Scott.</p>
<p>A few sessions in and Scott mentioned that my face was really locked-up and that we should do some work there, and it would involve my nose and a balloon.</p>
<p>In some sort of irony, <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/please-send-help-party-planning-newbie-alert/" target="_blank">on the day I wrote about balloons</a> I was getting intimate with another kind of balloon {also not round}.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if people all around the world are having balloons placed up their nose, but they&#8217;ve done a great job in keeping it top secret, because I haven&#8217;t heard a peep about it from anyone in all my life. So, I&#8217;m doing a public service {you know, doing my part for mankind} and telling you now.</p>
<p>A balloon up the nose is not particularly nice. As you might imagine. While the balloon was being strategically placed up my nose in one of 6 holes {who knew we had 6 holes in our nose? Where have I been all my nose&#8217;s life??}, I tried not to freak out. I don&#8217;t think I did a good job. The balloon was inflated and popped. It hurt. Facial bones were adjusted, and then Scott asked, &#8220;Should we do that again?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say I jumped up with joy and exclaimed, &#8220;Yes sir. Please can I have some more?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead I nodded and freaked out again. The second hurt more than the first {this time in a different hole}, but it really felt like it made a difference {THANK GOODNESS, because I did not want to endure that for sweet nothing}.</p>
<p>So now I can cross &#8216;Get a balloon up my nose&#8217; off my mental bucket list. Been there, done that, got the blog post to prove it.</p>
<h4>Have you ever had a balloon up your nose? What&#8217;s the weirdest thing you&#8217;ve done in the name of health? {Eaten a weird green shake? Colonics maybe?}</h4>
