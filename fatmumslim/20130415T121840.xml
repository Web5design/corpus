<p>A message from a friend hit my inbox last week and the gist of it was, &#8220;How do you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8216;it&#8217;, she meant everything; working/living/parenting. How do I get the balance right?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never tried to create that illusion. I am the most imperfect person ever. Just one look at me will tell you that. So I told her so, I don&#8217;t and I don&#8217;t know anyone that can or does.</p>
<p>You see that picture up there? That&#8217;s Lacey&#8217;s bedroom. It&#8217;s been like that for 6 whole days now. There&#8217;s a new little boy in the neighbourhood who came to visit. Lacey thinks that anyone that walks past our house should have a tour of our home. It drives me bananas, mainly because it&#8217;s never in a state to be shown off. I can master one room at a time, and this time it wasn&#8217;t her bedroom {but boy our bedroom is looking awesome right now if anyone cares to know}. So the little boy walked in, and then walked out. In all his 5 year old wisdom he said to me, &#8220;That room is so messy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it is. It looks like a bunch of fairies had a party and threw up all over it. Lacey is responsible for it all, except the drawer&#8230; that&#8217;s my doing. I&#8217;m the person who leaves cupboard doors open, drawers hanging and wet towels hanging over doors.</p>
<p>Apparently the little boy in the neighbourhood takes great pride in his room. He told me a story of how he cleaned his desk for when his grandma came to visit. And then she didn&#8217;t come, and he had a clean desk to show off and no one to see it. So he went to bed sad. I hope he hangs around and that some of his cleaning habits rub off on Lacey.</p>
<p>I would love to have a constantly clean home. I would love to play educational games with my daughter all day. I&#8217;d love to drink 2 litres of water without fail. I wish I had buns of steel. I would love to be the mum who makes amazing meals from scratch with organic produce every single night. I&#8217;m just not. I do what I can, when I can. Some days I do better than others.</p>
<p>I juggle stuff. I drop balls all the time. Last week at preschool I was chatting to the teacher about everyday stuff and she asked, &#8220;What did you cook for dinner last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>I told her that I made homemade sausage rolls and salad. <em>I lied.</em> I cooked some pre-made {not by me, by someone else} sausage rolls in the oven {they were gourmet, I&#8217;ll give myself that} and teamed them with some rocket, carrot and tomato. Fancy? Not in the slightest, but it got eaten. I still don&#8217;t know why I lied, it just came out.</p>
<p>Life is a balancing act. I don&#8217;t know a perfect parent. I like imperfect parents. One day I went to visit a friend, who just happened to be one of the most together friends I know, and her house was in a state of imperfection. Similar to how mine might be if you popped around right now. She apologised profusely. I was like, &#8220;Oh, who cares!&#8221; Because I don&#8217;t. Really, I wanted to embrace her with arms wide open, break out into song &amp; dance, and rejoice at the imperfection. Maybe even break out some jazz hands.</p>
<p>I know some mums have moments of perfection. And yes, I envy them in those moments, but deep down I know there&#8217;s another mum somewhere with a room in her house that looks like a fairy farted in it. And I like it. There is comfort in that.</p>
<h4>So, out with it. Confess your imperfections. What state is your house in right now? Or if it&#8217;s visitor-ready, do share something that will make me feel better about the state of that room above. <em>Please.</em></h4>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t this make you want to embrace the everyday? To soak up the sunshine, the feel of clean sheets underneath your skin at night, the sweet taste of cake {or perhaps that first coffee in the morning}, the way the ones you love laugh, and the way they say your name?</p>
<p><em>Enjoy the everyday. </em></p>
<h4>What ordinary moments make you smile when you stop and take notice?</h4>
<p>P.S. My friend Hailey wrote a book, and I have a page in it. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.bookdepository.com/365-Gratefuls-Hailey-Bartholomew/9780399161186" target="_blank">This is it.</a> It&#8217;s filled with lots of lovely everyday moments.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo PARTY_zpsa100467a.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PARTY_zpsa100467a.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a rite of passage that parents have to go through {endure, if you will} and that&#8217;s to host a kids birthday party. Be it small, or big&#8230; most parents will go through it, no doubt. Some will glide through with ease and finesse and others {ahem, me!} will have their moments of frazzle-dom {not a word, but it should be}.</p>
<p>I am going to put it out there, but Lacey&#8217;s 5th birthday party was my practice run&#8230; for all the parties to come. There won&#8217;t be one every year, but I have no doubt that I will probably host another before she moves out of home, and I will master that baby. It will be the party to beat all parties. Seriously though, I learned a lot from the party just hosted, and I am happy to be guinea pig and share my little lessons learned with you. <em>You&#8217;re welcome.</em></p>
<h4>Follow the recipe for a perfect party.</h4>
<p>I think they should hand this information out to all parents as they leave hospital. It should be in a book of practical things parents should know {with other such things like: Your kid is probably going to eat something pretty much non-edible {dirt, snails, poop} but they&#8217;ll be OK}. There&#8217;s a recipe for kids parties, which I learned from Autumn on <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/please-send-help-party-planning-newbie-alert/" target="_blank">this post</a>. She advised that when inviting kids, invite the number that the birthday girl/boy is turning, plus 2.  So Lacey should have had 7. <em>Perfect.</em> We had 15. Seven would have been much more manageable.</p>
<h4>Balloons. Always get the balloons.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at how entertaining helium balloons can be. The kids spent most of the party playing with the balloons. So GET THE BALLOONS! {We found our fab balloon lady through Gumtree}.</p>
<h4>Remember what&#8217;s important to your child.</h4>
<p>I didn&#8217;t let Lacey make too many decisions with the party, because it would have led to disappointment. She&#8217;d want a REAL rainbow, and a REAL unicorn, and REAL magic. Instead I asked what she wanted to do at her party, and that was dance with her friends. I also asked what colour she wanted everything to be, and that was pink. So I made sure those two things happened, and then planned everything else to suit, keeping in mind things she loves as I did so.</p>
<h4>Outsource when you can.</h4>
<p>I know budgets vary, but you can outsource {with local business services, and/or help from family and friends} where possible to save stress, time and a mental breakdown. I was lucky enough to be given help with the budget, so while I knew I could make a cake, it would be something I&#8217;d agonise over &#8211; so I had a local lady <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/robina/party-catering/manda-s-sweet-treats/1014991619" target="_blank">{sourced through Gumtree}</a> make the cake for $40. I knew once I&#8217;d bought ingredients and calculated the time it would take &#8211; it was better to outsource. At other parties I&#8217;ve asked my Aunt to make the cake and she thinks it&#8217;s such an honour. My priority was having someone entertain the kids for the whole party. I can be out there when I&#8217;m with people I know, but being new to the &#8216;hood I know it would take away much of the stress if that part was outsourced too. You can find affordable services over on Gumtree. I was pleasantly surprised at how affordable they were <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/" target="_blank">{look under business services &gt; party/catering}</a>. I was also able to outsource the party food through a local caterer I found on Gumtree {I saved money by just having them drop off the food, so I didn&#8217;t have to pay for their time during the party etc}. You can find great caterers that make platters, finger foods and lots more. Depending on what your budget is you could outsource everything and REALLY enjoy the party, or just choose important things to help you out a bit.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t aim for perfection.</h4>
<p>I had to remind myself of this a few times, that it didn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Lacey wouldn&#8217;t notice the details, and the most important thing was that she had fun. I have a theory with any event &#8211; that something will go wrong. It&#8217;s not a pessimistic view, but just a little bit realistic. So once that one thing breaks or goes awry I breathe a sigh of relief, work around it and move on. Preferably that thing is an easy fix, if not&#8230; drink wine.</p>
<h4>Write lists. Lots of them.</h4>
<p>Your brain is going to be filled with details, so give your brain a break and write lists of things you need to do. I printed out 5 of these babies <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~getbuttonedup.com/2010/02/17/tool-free-printable-daily-schedule-form/#" target="_blank">{printable daily planner}</a> and wrote down everything I needed to do, down to the most boring detail. It just meant it was all out of my head, onto paper&#8230; and then I could delegate too.</p>
<h4>Have a back-up plan.</h4>
<p>Unfortunately on the day our entertainer was delayed, so it meant that we were left without someone to keep the kids happy. A minor freakout later, I enlisted my sister {who just happens to be a big event planner for people like Lady Gaga} and we were on track. I had a pin the horn on the unicorn game in the cupboard that we pulled out, we put on some music and played statues, and then spent some time opening the presents until the fairy arrived.</p>
<h4>Have fun.</h4>
<p>My advice for anyone getting married is to steal some time away from everyone, grab your new husband and have a moment. It&#8217;s the same with a party, take a little time to watch your little person and all the fun they&#8217;re having. Talk to the parents, enjoy some cake, and try to relax.</p>
<h4>And now for all the details&#8230;</h4>

<p>If you believed everything you ever saw in movies about pregnancy, you&#8217;d assume that it&#8217;s a pretty glamorous existence. It&#8217;s all bump out the front, pampering and lots of glowing.</p>
<p>The truth is, I don&#8217;t glow. Instead I get adolescent-type skin conditions that make me want to hibernate for weeks on end. I totally forgot what pregnancy was like for me. I remembering saying to Hubby, &#8220;Oh, pregnancy was a breeze for me, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shot me a look as if to say, &#8216;ARE YOU SERIOUS??&#8217;</p>
<p>I think I must have complained just a wee bit last time. Just a little.</p>
<p>Being pregnant is a super blessing. I don&#8217;t talk about it much here, or I try not to&#8230; because I know pregnancy stuff is only really interesting if you&#8217;re pregnant yourself. It&#8217;s kinda like weddings, they&#8217;re fun and all but I am only really interested in your place-cards if I&#8217;m in the midst of planning a wedding myself. <em>Sorry.</em></p>
<p><em>But indulge me for a moment, won&#8217;t you?</em> Today I&#8217;m officially halfway to meeting my baby. It&#8217;s been different to last time, in so many ways. Last time I was working hard, physically. I felt kinda invincible. Now I&#8217;m so aware of this baby and how precious it is. Plus the morning sickness is still hanging around, so I&#8217;m feeling a little bit precious myself.</p>
<p>Last time I had gained a nice chunk of weight by the halfway mark. This time I&#8217;ve gained nothing {actually lost weight} so I feel better about my body than I did back then. Last time I had no issues, and this time is similar &#8211; despite doctors being really wary &#8211; except for being low on vitamin B and getting a monthly injection to keep it up. This time I&#8217;m really dragging my feet. I&#8217;ve never been so tired. Some days it&#8217;s an effort to do anything, but for a week or so after the injection I&#8217;m all motivated and capable. <em>Bliss.</em></p>
<p>Last time I had the baby&#8217;s room all decked out, painted and ready by the halfway mark, this time the room is completely empty. Stupidly, I didn&#8217;t save anything from Lacey. Not a pram, cot or bouncer. So I need to get my act together and get sorted.</p>
<p>We saw our baby on Monday, and it&#8217;s already so super cute and well-behaved. We&#8217;re hoping it keeps up the well-behaved bit. It&#8217;s little hands were holding it&#8217;s face and my heart melted. I can&#8217;t wait to meet him/her. It&#8217;s nice to jump {although very slowly!} over the halfway line. So nice.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not finding out the sex this time. We did with Lacey and this time we want a surprise.</p>
<h4>Mamas, did you find out what sex your baby was? Or did you keep it a surprise?</h4>

<h4>Prize 1: Samsung Galaxy Note tablet and mobile 4G Wi-Fi device</h4>
<p>Life is busy, as we know, and it can be hard to juggle everything {work, staying in touch with family/friends and enjoying life as well} that&#8217;s why Telstra are offering up a Samsung Galazy Note tablet and a Telstra 4G Wi-Fi device {with 12 GB to be used over a 12 month period} valued at a total of $1,300.00.

<p>Back when we were kids my little sister got a game piece stuck up her nose. Not matter how we tried, nothing could get it out. Ma poked, and tweezed and begged her to blow it out. It didn&#8217;t budge. So she shipped us off to a neighbour for the afternoon, packed my sister in the car and got ready to head to hospital&#8230; when all of a sudden somebody sneezed and the game piece was free.</p>
<p>My story is nothing like that one. <em>Just saying.</em></p>
<p>With pregnancy, for me, comes an array of lovely headaches. When I was pregnant with Lacey I used to see a kind Chiro named Igor who would quickly place my neck in weird positions and the sweet relief would be amazing. Now that we&#8217;ve moved I had to find a replacement. A quick Google and I found my new man, Scott.</p>
<p>A few sessions in and Scott mentioned that my face was really locked-up and that we should do some work there, and it would involve my nose and a balloon.</p>
<p>In some sort of irony, <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/please-send-help-party-planning-newbie-alert/" target="_blank">on the day I wrote about balloons</a> I was getting intimate with another kind of balloon {also not round}.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if people all around the world are having balloons placed up their nose, but they&#8217;ve done a great job in keeping it top secret, because I haven&#8217;t heard a peep about it from anyone in all my life. So, I&#8217;m doing a public service {you know, doing my part for mankind} and telling you now.</p>
<p>A balloon up the nose is not particularly nice. As you might imagine. While the balloon was being strategically placed up my nose in one of 6 holes {who knew we had 6 holes in our nose? Where have I been all my nose&#8217;s life??}, I tried not to freak out. I don&#8217;t think I did a good job. The balloon was inflated and popped. It hurt. Facial bones were adjusted, and then Scott asked, &#8220;Should we do that again?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say I jumped up with joy and exclaimed, &#8220;Yes sir. Please can I have some more?&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead I nodded and freaked out again. The second hurt more than the first {this time in a different hole}, but it really felt like it made a difference {THANK GOODNESS, because I did not want to endure that for sweet nothing}.</p>
<p>So now I can cross &#8216;Get a balloon up my nose&#8217; off my mental bucket list. Been there, done that, got the blog post to prove it.</p>
<h4>Have you ever had a balloon up your nose? What&#8217;s the weirdest thing you&#8217;ve done in the name of health? {Eaten a weird green shake? Colonics maybe?}</h4>

<p><em>Dear Lacey,</em></p>
<p><em>Every year your birthday comes around, and every year I play a little game in my head. I call it the &#8216;This time back when&#8217; game. It&#8217;s a little trip back memory lane that I think most mums play around the birthday of their children.</em></p>
<p><em>This morning I woke at crazy o&#8217;clock, also known as 3am. Sick of fighting the wake/sleep battle, I grabbed a blanket and headed for the lounge. Usually my early morning wake-ups go unnoticed. You and Dadda sleep on, like babies {well, babies that sleep that is}. This time Dadda came out to check on me. &#8220;You OK?&#8221; he asked, &#8220;You know this time five years ago you were in labour?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>And now this very time five years ago you were being placed on my chest. Your bare little body. The first time we touched. You cried. I cried. Dadda cried. We all cried.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s hard to remember life before you, Lacey. Was it quiet? Was it dull? How did we fill our days?</em></p>
<p><em>Life is different, I know that much is true. We still don&#8217;t sleep as much as we need or like, but that&#8217;s our life now. And you&#8217;re worth every under-eye bag. Because the good stuff far outweighs the bad.</em></p>
<p><em>The good is good. The way you write my name with such pride, for me. The way you can hear any music, and it doesn&#8217;t matter where we are or who is watching, you dance. And not just a little bop, but you throw yourself into it like you&#8217;re dancing for your life. Like no one is watching. The way you talk about your baby sibling with excitement. The way you love to hug. &#8220;Dad!&#8221; you&#8217;ll yell as he leaves for work, &#8220;I forgot to give you something!&#8221; And down the driveway you run to give him a necessary embrace. The way you ask constant questions, &#8220;Why does it rain? Why is the grass green? How? Who? What? When?&#8221; The way you have a beautiful heart filled with compassion. The way you make friends with such ease, and confidence. The way you embrace life with such enthusiasm.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s hard to believe that you&#8217;ve been here for five years, but at the same time it&#8217;s hard to imagine life before you too.</em></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo MORETON-6_zps650df22f.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/MORETON-6_zps650df22f.jpg" width="641" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<p><em>Last night you decided for the first time ever that you&#8217;d go to bed without a fight, so you crawled under your blankets and waited for sleep to come {for the record, it didn&#8217;t&#8230; but at least you tried}. I overheard you singing, a little made-up song filled with happy words. I came and sat beside your bed, &#8220;Hello my little 4 year old. When you wake in the morning you&#8217;ll be my 5 year old. All grown up.&#8221;
<br>
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Talk to me some more Mama.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>So we talked. You told me where you want me to hide the presents, how you were going to be so big on your birthday and how your hair was growing so long now that you were nearly five. Simple conversations, but oh how I fought back tears. I have a five year old? I&#8217;m not sure how it happened but I do. And it&#8217;s you.</em></p>
<p><em>This time five years ago you made me a mum. I am forever grateful. Forever changed. Forever your mama.</em></p>
<p><em>I love you. Happy 5th birthday. May it be filled with rainbows, sparkles and lots of music.</em>
<br>
<em> Mama. xx</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Birthday party" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/PARTY_zps3d4d16d8.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;So&#8230;&#8221; I began, with some hesitation, &#8220;I have a weird request.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, preparing herself for whatever I was about to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;My daughter is having a birthday party and I want to get some round balloons. Not oval like normal, but round.&#8221; And yes, I made a round shape with my hands as I asked, as you do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Round?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#8220;Yeah, so you know normal balloons are more oval,&#8221; again showing her with my hands, &#8220;and these are more round. I can show you on my phone if you like? Or I can even buy some and bring them in to be filled up?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As this stage Hubby walked away from the conversation. It had reached a level of &#8216;weird lady {me} wanting round balloons&#8217; and he needed to escape.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I blame <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~pinterest.com/pin/161637074098491514/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> for this round balloon obsession. By the end of the balloon session I&#8217;d ended up ordering no round balloons and 40 pink oval balloons {no glossy strings and no pearly colour on the balloons. Fussy? Me? Never}. Things kinda changed when Hubby said to me, &#8220;You know this party is for Lacey, right? Not for you.&#8221; <em>Understood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a total newbie to this party planning gig. Yes, we&#8217;ve done parties before&#8230; but just family and close friends. Now, we live in a totally new area {where round balloons aren&#8217;t the norm}, with totally new friends and a child that can tell me what she wants {unlike when she was 1 and I had total control of all the party details}.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from hosting parties and things, as well as attending them over the years, it&#8217;s that no one likes a stressed-out host. You&#8217;ve seen them. The people running around, a slight sweat {or glow, if we&#8217;re being kind} and they&#8217;re not having fun at all. So I knew that when I decided to have a party for Lacey that involved not just family {and taking into consideration that I&#8217;m preggers and still experiencing lovely morning sickness}, was that I&#8217;d outsource as much as possible. I know that sounds terribly fancy, but it&#8217;s not. Hang with me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo Gumtree_zps40664a85.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gumtree_zps40664a85.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.gumtree.com.au/" target="_blank">Gumtree</a> came to me and asked if they could help out with Lacey&#8217;s party. At first I thought, what am I going to do? Sell Lacey in the classifieds? But then I remembered that they have a whole heap of listings for business services {which I used when I was a nanny}. So I agreed and got about planning. I set a budget. $200 for a cake. $600 for an entertainer. $150 for a cleaner&#8230; <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~pinterest.com/fatmumslim/birthday-parties/" target="_blank">And then I started pinning for inspiration.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Apparently my head is still living in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, because once I&#8217;d started searching the Gumtree directory and emailing people things got GOOD. Having someone make the cake of my {ahem, Lacey&#8217;s!!} dreams? $40. <em>Seriously. </em>A fairy to entertain loads of kids for the WHOLE party? <em>Affordable! </em>A cleaner to make the house visitor-ready? <em>Cheap as chips. </em>And I actually even have money left over to have someone make all the food for me. <em>Sushi platters, sandwiches, cake pops, and sweet little sausage rolls, oh my.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I sound all confident and party-ready, don&#8217;t I? I&#8217;m not. Not quite. I&#8217;m quietly stressing out, because while the details might be sorted the big questions start to come in. How many kids should we invite? How many is too many? What if no one wants to come? How long should a party go for? Do parents stay too? Do I need to feed them? Is 11am too early to serve wine? And the list goes on&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh, and will the party be the same without my {ahem, Lacey&#8217;s!!} perfect round balloons??</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="clear:left"><p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Zucchini pasta with lemony garlic sauce" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/ZUCCHINI-2_zps9bca6fcb.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Until very recently we had my Ma living with us, and feeding an extra mouth each night took a little more creativity than usual. Not that my Ma expects anything fancy, but it&#8217;s always nice to cook something delicious when you&#8217;ve got people to feed, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This isn&#8217;t the healthiest pasta dish {hello cream and butter} but it certainly is high on the yum factor. I wasn&#8217;t expecting it, but as everyone tucked into their first mouthful, a positive reaction quickly followed. &#8220;This is really good,&#8221; Ma exclaimed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And now this dish is placed on the &#8216;will totally make again&#8217; list. I think next time I might throw in some toasted pine nuts for a little crunch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" alt="Zucchini pasta with lemony garlic sauce" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/ZUCCHINI_zps432fa225.jpg" width="640" height="960" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p>375g bow tie pasta
<br>
4 medium zucchini
<br>
30g butter
<br>
1 tablespoons olive oil
<br>
2 cloves garlic, crushed
<br>
1/3 cup vegetable stock
<br>
1/2 cup cream
<br>
2 teaspoons finely grated lemon rind
<br>
75g baby spinach leaves
<br>
1/3 cup coarsely chopped chives
<br>
shaved parmesan, to serve</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Cook pasta in a large saucepan of boiling water as per instructions on packaging {or until al dente}.
<br>
♥ While the pasta is cooking, work on the sauce. Cut zucchinis lengthways down the middle, and then slice thinly on the diagonal.
<br>
♥ Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan. Toss in the zucchini and garlic over medium heat and cook until the zucchini is tender. Add stock, stir to combine. Reduce the heat and add the cream, lemon rind, spinach and chives. Stir until all combined and heated through.
<br>
♥ Once the pasta is cooked, drain and then add to the zucchini mixture. Toss gently.
<br>
♥ Serve in bowls topped with parmesan cheese.</p>

<br>
<strong>1. L is for&#8230;</strong>
<br>
Lunch. Sometimes when Lacey is at preschool, Hubby and I like to sneak out for a cheap $10 lunch. It&#8217;s the upside of having one that works shift-work and me working from home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8466_zps40d18268.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8466_zps40d18268.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>2. I made this!</strong>
<br>
My chocolate coconut cake. You&#8217;ll want to make it. <a href="https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/my-go-to-cake-donna-hays-melt-mix-chocolate-cake/" target="_blank">Recipe here.</a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8477_zps54ee3891.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8477_zps54ee3891.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>3. Key</strong>
<br>
This is one of those cheap toys that you get for free with those expensive kid magazines. Well, expensive for what they are. And yes, I&#8217;m a sucker for buying them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8505_zps1ec2b057.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8505_zps1ec2b057.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>4. Lucky</strong>
<br>
I can&#8217;t even begin to explain how much rain we&#8217;ve had this year so far. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s normal, but it rained so much. This day we had sun and it felt&#8230; lucky.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8515_zps5d2f6e12.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8515_zps5d2f6e12.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>5. Under</strong>
<br>
And because of that rain the umbrella is kinda necessary.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8544_zps75434eaa.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8544_zps75434eaa.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>6. Chair</strong>
<br>
These are from my favourite place on the coast, QT. So stylish that I want to live there. Forever.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8546_zps32d72da2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8546_zps32d72da2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>7. Fear</strong>
<br>
I kinda fear anything with wings. You don&#8217;t want to see me when one of these things pops up unexpectedly. It&#8217;s not pretty.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8550_zpsdebb3db0.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8550_zpsdebb3db0.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>8. Favourite</strong>
<br>
When Hubby is on night shift, Lacey and I will cuddle up and do as we please. Sometimes it&#8217;s movies, or music &#8211; but always cuddled up in bed early.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8581_zps84cf6e93.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8581_zps84cf6e93.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>9. Faceless self-portrait</strong>
<br>
You&#8217;ll be happy to know that I had my roots done last week. Bad hair!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8728_zpsd38840cc.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8728_zpsd38840cc.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>10. I want&#8230;</strong>
<br>
{15 minutes or so of calm}. Doesn&#8217;t everyone?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8733_zps199ab34c.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8733_zps199ab34c.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>11. Important</strong>
<br>
Lacey wants to be an ambulance &#8216;girl&#8217; when she&#8217;s older. It&#8217;s a pretty important job.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8738_zps96bb0368.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8738_zps96bb0368.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>12. In the distance</strong>
<br>
We are lucky to live in a beautiful part of the world. Rainbows appear to be right on our doorstep.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8747_zps500835d0.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8747_zps500835d0.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>13. Sound</strong>
<br>
I know people often forget they&#8217;re pregnant after the first baby, but I&#8217;m so aware of this little person. Hearing that little heartbeat on this day was magic. I never get sick of it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8768_zpsb86cbf60.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8768_zpsb86cbf60.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>14. Tasty</strong>
<br>
We were on the cruise this day and we had a little cookies and cream cheesecake. It was delectable {even though it doesn&#8217;t look it!}</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8769_zps207032b7.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8769_zps207032b7.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>15. Explore</strong>
<br>
The cruise was perfect for Lacey because it was all pretty much safe for her to explore. She loved it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8805_zpsc3135879.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8805_zpsc3135879.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>16. 9 o&#8217;clock</strong>
<br>
This was such a big day. Our ship docked at Moreton Island, we fed dolphins and then headed back in to see the end of the circus show. Awesome.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8812_zps14a6c8e4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8812_zps14a6c8e4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>17. Green</strong>
<br>
The faux grass on the ship.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8867_zps10ba2f02.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8867_zps10ba2f02.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>18. Shoes</strong>
<br>
Back home again, and into the rainy weather {!} it was time to break out the gumboots.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8870_zps584c42a4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8870_zps584c42a4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>19. A sign</strong>
<br>
This sign is in my living/dining room. Most people think it&#8217;s temporary {because of the tape} but I think they don&#8217;t realise just how cool fluro pink washi tape is!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8872_zps9b6634c4.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8872_zps9b6634c4.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>20. Clean</strong>
<br>
Sometimes you just have to pile up some things and clear the surfaces and the house is clean {or so it seems!}.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8880_zpsf04bd429.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8880_zpsf04bd429.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>21. Working</strong>
<br>
Sometimes I get some pretty cool things in the mail {less now than when I lived in the City}. This day I got a beautiful bouquet of goodies for the baby and a bus made of chocolate {which I can proudly say is pretty much still in tact in the fridge}.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_8882_zps1fd3a8d2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_8882_zps1fd3a8d2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>22. About me</strong>
<br>
{I am: female // 32 // married // a mama // with one on the way // happy // a blogger // a freelance writer // keen photo-taker // a dreamer // hopeful thinker // cake enthusiast // disgruntled maker of beds // trashy TV watcher}</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9043_zps3dd49fd2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9043_zps3dd49fd2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>23. What I do for fun</strong>
<br>
I love heading out and exploring. On this day we went to a nearby coastal town, visited the markets, tried some new food and hung by the pool at my Ma&#8217;s new place.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9049_zpsf457c90e.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9049_zpsf457c90e.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>24. Up</strong>
<br>
I love to look up. This is through a tree in my yard.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9058_zps88c092d5.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9058_zps88c092d5.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>25. In your drawer</strong>
<br>
I keep cheap jewelry in my bedside table. Don&#8217;t try and rob me. It&#8217;s not worth it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9061_zpscd941ad2.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9061_zpscd941ad2.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>26. Something you did</strong>
<br>
I bought Lacey this sweet little dress for her birthday party.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo IMG_9068_zps0dd95d26.jpg" src="https://www.feedblitz.com/ssl.asp?http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/IMG_9068_zps0dd95d26.jpg" border="0" />
<br>
<strong>27. Pair</strong>
<br>
On another one of our cheap lunch dates. I&#8217;m craving real sushi {sashimi? Yes, please!}. But I settle for tempura and hot goodies instead.</p>

<strong>28. In the mirror</strong>
<br>
On our way down the coast.</p>

29. Goodnight
<br>
I need to get a wind-down routine that includes books, not TV. Working on it. {Must buy a lamp first!}.</p>

<strong>30. Relax</strong>
<br>
I never thought these words would come from my mouth {or typed from my fingers} but I actually like to garden. It was something I vowed I&#8217;d never enjoy. So far I&#8217;m only into weeding and I&#8217;m sure it will get old, but it&#8217;s a start.</p>

<strong>31. Stuff</strong>
<br>
Stuffed. Poor little Lindt bunny. {And oh boy, this made me feel sick for a whole day}.</p>
