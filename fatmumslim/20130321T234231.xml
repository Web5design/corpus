<p>I am so excited about this giveaway. Right now I&#8217;m in total party-planning mode, with Lacey&#8217;s birthday coming up soon. When I plan something, I don&#8217;t just dip my toes in and do a lame attempt, I jump right in with total enthusiasm. I love it. {Except the after party clean-up and the stressful bits, but let&#8217;s gloss over those, shall we?}.</p>
<p>Sweet Style is a store that I&#8217;ve used a few times already, and plan on going crazy there when I&#8217;m ready to shop for supplies for the birthday party. Leanne {who owns Sweet Style} is the master at creating beautiful, and oh-so-stylish party set-ups. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.sweetstyleblog.com.au/" target="_blank">You have to check out her blog for inspiration.</a> Or here are few tables she&#8217;s created&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt=" photo SWEETSTYLE1_zps5f22fb3d.jpg" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/SWEETSTYLE1_zps5f22fb3d.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>Amazing, right? So as well as being a party stylist, Leanne also runs her online party store filled with all the beautiful goodies {minus some of the food stuff} that you can see in the photos above. She&#8217;s kindly offering up a $200 gift voucher for one super lucky person to win. It&#8217;s open to everyone, whichever corner of the world you live in &#8211; but just note that you&#8217;ll have to include the postage in your $200 if you win. Oh, and you might like to purchase non-breakable items if you live somewhere other than Australia.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~www.sweetstyle.com.au/" target="_blank">You can check all the goodies available at Sweet Style right here.</a></p>
<p><strong>To be in the running to win the voucher all you have to do is tell me the what you love most about a good party. Is it the people, the food, the music, the socialising? And why?</strong></p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like anything too exciting, does it? Oh, but it was. It was a flavour-sensation. And it was easy to make, and everyone gobbled it up. You can&#8217;t ask for much more for a mid-week meal. Keep this one up your sleeve when you you can&#8217;t be bothered cooking, but you want something that tastes better than peanut butter on toast.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>
<br>
1 cooked chicken {meat removed and shredded}
<br>
1 avocado, peeled and sliced
<br>
1 small red onion, sliced thinly
<br>
1 large tomato, sliced {or a handful of cherry tomatoes chopped}
<br>
200g low-fat grated tasty cheese
<br>
1/2 cup chopped coriander
<br>
Salt &amp; pepper
<br>
12 soft flour tortillas
<br>
Oil spray</p>
<p><strong>Dip</strong>
<br>
1 cup low-fat sour cream
<br>
1 garlic clove, crushed
<br>
1 tbsp chives, chopped</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong>
<br>
♥ Place the chicken, avocado, onion, tomato, cheese, coriander and seasoning into a bowl. Mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Heat frying pan to medium heat. Make one tortilla at a time. Place one tortilla on the bench, spread chicken mixture over each, and top with another tortilla. Spray oil into the frying pan, and place tortilla in the pan. Cook for 3 minutes each side. You&#8217;ll want to cook the tortillas more than I did. I made one after this that was much crunchier and it rocked.
<br>
♥ Make the dip by combining all the ingredients into a small bowl. Serve with slices of the tortillas.</p>

<p>Hubby would most probably be mortified that I tell you this, but I&#8217;ll tell you anyway {because it makes him look good, and me <em>notsomuch</em>}. We&#8217;ve been together for 11 years this year, and for most of those years he&#8217;s sent me a text message every single day. Only when he&#8217;s at work or away, mind you, we don&#8217;t make a habit of text messaging one another from opposite ends of the house for the thrill of it. His messages are always kind, quite lengthy in comparison to mine, and just plain lovely. They go something like this: <em>Hey babe. Hope you had a nice a sleep. Have a great day and I&#8217;ll see you tonight. Love you. x</em></p>
<p>And it&#8217;s at this point I&#8217;d like to say that I reply with the loveliest of words, and a handful of emoticons&#8230; but I can&#8217;t lie. Most of the time I don&#8217;t reply at all. Or I&#8217;ll reply with a short: <em>Can you get bread on your way home?</em></p>
<p>I love those messages, and I hope they never stop. But I&#8217;m busy. <em>Oh-so-busy. </em>Too busy to reply.</p>
<p>But really, we need to stop with this busy crap, don&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>I was having breakfast with a friend recently {yep, I made time for breakfast out of the house with another person, miracle} and she mentioned how busy I was, and she started brainstorming how I could be less busy and make more time for me. We talked about getting a cleaner, a babysitter or a virtual assistant. She mentioned that a mutual friend of ours had also commented on just how busy I was. Knowing the way he thinks and his sense of humour, I knew it would be said with a tongue firmly placed in cheek and an eye-roll, <em>&#8220;Oh yes, she&#8217;s soooo busy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Busy is the new black. We&#8217;re all busy. Too busy to eat a proper meal in one sitting. Too busy to answer emails. Too busy to get through to-do list. Too busy to book a little getaway. Too busy to play, relax and make time for being present.</p>
<p>In my spare time, <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/dear-3am-we-need-to-break-up/">as I lay awake in bed at 3am</a>, I&#8217;ve started to think about all the things I&#8217;ve been too busy to do. Browsing through real bookstores is one. I used to spend a crazy {and lovely} amount of time browsing books at our local bookstore in Sydney. I&#8217;d grab a pile, take a seat and enjoy. It seems everyone else got too busy too, because it went into liquidation and closed down. I&#8217;m too busy to sort my whites from my colours, hence the shameful amount of once-white-now-grey clothes I own. And I&#8217;m far too busy to be drinking 2 litres of water every single day. Who has time for the drinking and the consequential toilet breaks? <em>Seriously?</em></p>
<p>After that breakfast where I thought about outsourcing I thought about how busy I really was. I wrote lists of things I could get other people to do, and then thought again. But I want to do those things. Well, not the cleaning. I&#8217;d be happy to do away with the toilet scrubbing. I like to have control, so outsourcing wouldn&#8217;t really work for me, and the time I free up in doing so anyway, would soon be filled with more stuff. I&#8217;d be sure to quickly realise that the linen press needed sorting, the walls needed painting, text messages would need replying to, and of course someone would need three times as much pushing on the swings.</p>
<p>One day I was so busy that my head felt like it was about to explode. Do you know that feeling? So I took the day off and I did none of it. I stopped the busy. Funny thing was, the world didn&#8217;t end. The to-do list didn&#8217;t triple while I played. It stayed the same. And I realised perhaps I&#8217;m not so busy after all. Perhaps if I just managed it all a little better, and stopped that darn glorification of busy, it would all feel a little bit better.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t we all do with a little less busy?</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re an avid market-goer you might be familiar with these delicious creations. If you&#8217;re not, then let me introduce you to them. You, meet gozleme.</p>
<p>On Saturday we were doing the rounds at the local markets when we smelled them cooking, and then we saw them. It was like a mirage, a vision of deliciousness right in front of us. It had clearly been a while between gozlemes. Sadly. They&#8217;re little dough filled delights, sometimes filled with spicy beef, others just cheese and spinach. Depending on the stall the filling will change. The ones I saw on the weekend had beef &amp; mushroom, cheese with more cheese or chicken mince.</p>
<p>Of course, in my usual style, I decided that I wanted to start creating them at home. I&#8217;d tried once before, and failed miserably&#8230; this time I tried a different recipe and had success. I know they sound hardish {anything that requires me to make my own dough usually scares me} but it&#8217;s not too hard, and the taste is worth it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gozleme_zps5455b950.jpg" alt="Gozleme" width="640" height="960" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Dough</strong>
<br>
4 cups plain flour
<br>
1 teaspoon salt
<br>
1 1/2 cups warm water
<br>
vegetable oil {for cooking}
<br>
lemon wedges to serve</p>
<p><strong>Filling</strong>
<br>
1 tablespoon oil
<br>
1 onion, finely chopped
<br>
2 garlic cloves crushed
<br>
1 tablespoon ground cumin
<br>
1 tablespoon sumac
<br>
1-2 teaspoons chilli flakes {optional &#8211; but throw them in!}
<br>
500g lamb mince
<br>
200g feta, crumbled
<br>
150g baby spinach, chopped</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/Gozleme-1_zps309f1f47.jpg" alt="Gozleme" width="640" height="427" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Make the dough: Sift flour and salt together into a large bowl. Slowly add the water, and stir gradually. Mix together to make a firm dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic. Place back into the bowl and cover with a tea towel while you make the filling.
<br>
♥ Make the filling: Heat the oil in large frying pan on high heat. Saute the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add the cumin, sumac and chilli {if using} and cook for 1 minute. Add the mince and brown for 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, and add the feta and spinach. Mix to combine.
<br>
♥ Divide the dough into 6 equal parts. Roll each piece into a rectangle shape {around 30x40cm}. Using 1/6th of the filling mixture, spoon the filling evenly over one half of the dough. Fold over the over half and push together the edges to seal. You can make all the parcels and keep them aside on a piece of baking paper or lined tray.
<br>
♥ Heat a large frying pan on medium {alternatively if you&#8217;re good on the BBQ, try it on there &#8211; I am not!}. Brush the gozleme with oil and then place in the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes each side, until golden brown and crispy. Cook the remaining gozlemes.
<br>
♥ Cut the gozlemes into squares to serve and serve with a squeeze of lemon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<Img align="left" border="0" height="1" width="1" style="border:0;float:left;margin:0;padding:0" hspace="0" src="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/i/38892391/0/fatmumslimau"><div style="clear:left"><p>We didn&#8217;t holiday much as kids {the budget didn&#8217;t stretch that far} but when we did, just once mind you, it was to the Gold Coast. My parents piled us 4 kids into our Tarago and we drove the 16 hours to the sunny Gold Coast. I was so beyond excited, and wanted to remember EVERYTHING that I kept a journal of all the little details. Including how many stairs from the front door to our hotel room. <em>Oh yes, that&#8217;s a kid who needs to get out more.</em> I was always destined to be a blogger, wasn&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>Now that we live up north, the Gold Coast is just a short drive away, I&#8217;m loving it. We&#8217;re close enough to the theme parks, and there&#8217;s so much to explore. Last year we spent a weekend doing just that, and here are all the juicy details {minus the stair count!} below:</p>
<h4>Where to stay</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/QT_zps3d6d5f4e.jpg" alt="Get thee to the Gold Coast: What to do, eat &amp; where to stay" width="640" height="640" border="0" /></p>
<p>I have to start with where to stay, because this place was so &#8216;me&#8217;. As soon as we walked in there was eye candy everywhere. SO MUCH TO LOOK AT, and that means SO MUCH TO PHOTOGRAPH! {Yes, shouty capitals are necessary!}. The staff at QT wear the coolest outfits, the girls at the check-in were perfect in powder blue jumpsuits, bright red lipsticks and manicured nails. I was far too excited and had to ask Hubby to, &#8220;come and check out the cute check-in girls!&#8221; I could rave on about this place forever so I&#8217;ll try and bridle my enthusiasm and keep it short{er}.</p>
<p>Things I love about QT: the decor, the staff, the free lemonade service {every afternoon the staff go around to the rooms and make complimentary REAL lemonade}, the vibe, the mini bar {we bought some gummy lollies and the pick-up sticks} and the price. I loved this place so much that I&#8217;ve since sent my sister there, and it&#8217;s one of the cheaper, luxury places to stay on the coast. I checked for last weekend {I wanted a night away} and on lastminute.com.au it was the most affordable out of all of them. I&#8217;m so excited that ProBlogger will be held here this year too, such a treat.</p>

<p>On the second night of our weekend stay we moved to Peppers on Broadbeach, and if you asked me which I preferred &#8211; I actually couldn&#8217;t pick. While I loved the vibrancy of QT, I loved the luxury and peacefulness of Peppers just as much. We had an apartment so if you were staying for an extended period of time this would be the ideal choice, plus Broadbeach is just so beautiful and trendy. We were treated like VIPs with cold water on arrival {which we needed after a day in the sun at Dreamworld!}. Peppers is located in the heart of the activity at Broadbeach, with the Oracle Boulevard located just outside it&#8217;s doors. You can find Max Brenner, trendy cafes {for the coffee and cake lovers}, little boutique stores and more. The beach is a short walk away too.</p>

<h4>What to do</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/DREAMWORLD_zps59c38738.jpg" alt=" photo DREAMWORLD_zps59c38738.jpg" width="640" height="410" border="0" /></p>
<p>There are a handful of fun parks to try out on the Gold Coast, on this particular weekend we tried Dreamworld. We also have annual passes to Sea World, Movie World and White Water World. Dreamworld is perfect if you have kids that aren&#8217;t interested in the scary rides {well, great for those too! But Lacey isn&#8217;t at that age yet}, so we explored the kid section which has The Wiggles, Madagascar, Shrek and Kung Fu Panda. There is also the wildlife section so you can hang out with the animals, feed some kangaroos and make your way back to the front of the of the park for a face paint. For lunch I recommend the Billabong Buffet Restaurant, where you can sit down in the cool air-conditioning and choose between roast meats, vegetables, canapes and salads. They also have a dessert bar which is worth exploring.</p>

<p>You know life is tough when you&#8217;re struggling to decide between a facial and a massage, right? It was quite the dilemma I was faced with when offered a treatment at Spa Q. I sat in my fluffy white robe still pondering when my therapist came out to grab me. The good news? You don&#8217;t have to choose. They cater the treatment to you. So we did half and half, the best of both worlds. I have to say it was one of the best hours of my life, I walked out like a zombie, in another universe. So relaxed and preened, and blissed out.</p>

<p>A few weeks before our Gold Coast trip, Lacey and her class had been on an excursion to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary so we let her play tour guide for our visit. She showed us around, introduced us to all the animals, escorted us on our little train ride to the park and was a proud little guide. Hubby likes to see me squirm so he insisted we watch the bird show, and because I like to make him laugh &#8211; I agreed. I sat through that show in complete anxiety. Those birds are big, and the thought of them landing on my head freaked me out. But they were great. It was really interesting to hear about how they live off the land. A word to the budget-conscious Currumbin Wildlife Park isn&#8217;t cheap. We visited complimentary, but when we eyed off the prices we were surprised {$164 for a family} so make sure you pack a picnic and make a day of it.</p>

<h4>What to eat</h4>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c64/chantellelovell/FMS1/BAZAAR_zps69bfddb5.jpg" alt=" photo BAZAAR_zps69bfddb5.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>If you take just one thing from this post, I want it to be this: <em>You simply must endeavor to eat at Bazaar once in your life. Please.</em></p>
<p>We all love a good buffet, right? Well, this buffet {which they call an Interactive Marketplace, because it&#8217;s a step-up from a buffet} is so good that people raved to me about it before I&#8217;d even had time to get excited. On my itinerary for the weekend it told me that we were eating there, but I didn&#8217;t Google it. I was mid-facial when my beautician asked where we were having dinner. &#8220;Oh, I hope you haven&#8217;t eaten all day!&#8221; she exclaimed. I didn&#8217;t know it was a buffet, but when I told Hubby he was thrilled.</p>
<p>This is like no other buffet I&#8217;ve met. The food is stunning, fresh and just beautiful quality. You want a wagyu steak? They&#8217;ll cook you one. My tip is to grab their tasting plate for the night. Ours had little pork buns, tuna tartare and other divine bits and bobs. You can get dumplings to order, eat from their fresh seafood bar, try one of their many dishes and salads, or do as you please. The salads were crazy. Full of flavour, and so fresh. I may have gone home and replicated some the next week. Just beautiful. And then there are the desserts &#8211; little bite-sized pieces of deliciousness. They also have an ice cream station, just like Cold Rock where Lacey had a little masterpiece created.</p>
<p>I took my sister and her boyfriend to Bazaar a week after we visited and they loved it. My sister was actually shocked that I knew about something so &#8216;hip&#8217; before her. <em>Puhlease.</em></p>
<p>Breakfast is just as beautiful. We visited last weekend and at only $25 each {plus Lacey is free}, it was a great morning out.</p>

<p>Back over at Broadbeach we were treated to fine dining experience at a restaurant called Moo Moo. It was located just metres away from Peppers, where we were staying, and was a whole lot of fancy. Lacey was the only child in the restaurant, but we&#8217;re lucky that she&#8217;s her best-behaved while we&#8217;re out {she keeps her naughty for when we&#8217;re at home}. Moo Moo&#8217;s specialises in meat, so we both order a steak {but different cuts} with a bunch of sides. Lacey ordered her all-time favourite, spaghetti bolognaise and gobbled it up quite promptly. Being a meat-lover, this was a big hit with Hubby. He raved about it. The atmosphere was relaxing. It&#8217;s a bit more upmarket, so wear something nice {by nice I mean no thongs!} if you plan to visit.</p>

<p>Just before heading home from the weekend away, we stopped into Oskars at Burleigh Heads for lunch. The views here are to die for, and the food is just as good. Think beautiful fresh food, perfect portions and taste that packs a punch. Just like Moo Moo it&#8217;s fine dining, but they cater for kids too. Lacey had a serving of fish and chips while sitting comfortably in a high chair.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find an excuse to get back to Oskars again. I said to Hubby over that lunch that I wanted my work Christmas party there, {work = me &amp; him} but we had a hectic December and it didn&#8217;t happen. I think I can feel a birthday lunch coming up.</p>

<p>In June last year I spent a week with Darren Rowse {ProBlogger for those not familiar}. No, it wasn&#8217;t some romantic trip away, although we did spend some time on an island&#8230; rather a trip with Tourism Queensland where 10 lucky bloggers got to learn lots of great blogging information, as well as discover Tropical Queensland.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t all work, but two days were spent in particular talking about blogging, and one part has stuck in my mind since then, so I thought I&#8217;d share it.</p>
<p>We were all sitting around our tables talking about each others blogs, and Darren was taking us through a presentation on his best tips for blogging when up popped a picture of some dude with a camera. Darren started explaining to us that the dude with the camera was one of the people he writes for.</p>
<p>A few people responded with confused faces. &#8220;Do you know him?&#8221; one person asked.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t. Darren has three profiles in mind when blogging or creating content on his blogs. He&#8217;s picked pictures from Google to represent the people, added a portfolio on information including age, sex, likes, dislikes and needs. He writes for them. <a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~https://plus.google.com/112726038360301567381/posts/dPRRWAAeFAF" target="_blank">You can read more about why Darren does this here.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve done for a while now, but I just haven&#8217;t gone as far as creating a visual image or profile of the people. When creating the photo a day lists I think of three people: A student, a mum at home in the country and a guy working in an office. When creating the prompts I ask myself whether these people would be able to take a photo of each of these things. I&#8217;ve distinguished the the guy in the office as being a male, because I do need to make sure that my prompts don&#8217;t get too feminine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had people ask if I can make the photo a day lists all about bands like One Direction or Jon Bon Jovi. It just wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<h4>Bloggers, do you have someone in mind when you&#8217;re writing your blog posts, or creating content for social media? Who are you writing for? Who is your audience?</h4>

<p><a href="http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/fatmumslimau/~fatmumslim.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lovelife.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3949" title="Lovelife" src="http://fatmumslim.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lovelife.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="964" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s 8 reasons why I&#8217;m loving life right now:</p>
<p><strong>1. Baby stuff shopping</strong>
<br>
Oh please, someone stop me. How cute is that little spotty onesie? I was shopping for Lacey and I got sidetracked by the cute stuff in the baby section. Little people things are just so DARN cute.</p>
<p><strong>2. Water</strong>
<br>
Perhaps I&#8217;m the only who does this, but sometimes the liquids in my life can get complicated with soft drinks, ciders, spritzers&#8230; and then I pour myself a glass of water and ice and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How good is water?&#8221; The answer to that is <em>good</em>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fun in the sun</strong>
<br>
I mentioned on the weekend that we&#8217;ve had non-stop rain for so many weeks now, so when the sun shines it&#8217;s like a huge blessing. We&#8217;ve discovered the local pool, and it&#8217;s all kinds of awesome. I&#8217;m actually considering starting aqua aerobics. Don&#8217;t laugh.</p>
<p><strong>4. Polka dot Polaroids</strong>
<br>
I&#8217;m addicted to Polaroids. I have hundreds of them. And I&#8217;ve just discovered the polka dot film. I need to put my camera under lock and key because Lacey will find it and come back to me with handfuls of photos of Bronte and I just want to cry.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fruit</strong>
<br>
So good! I did have nectarines and peaches but they were consumed before the photo was taken. Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>6. Swimming</strong>
<br>
We&#8217;ve found a sweet swimming spot that&#8217;s kinda secluded and just perfect. It takes me a while to get in {if the water is cold} but it takes me forever to get out. Can&#8217;t we stay a little longer? Pleeeeaaassseee?</p>
<p><strong>7. An extra set of hands</strong>
<br>
My Ma has moved in with us for a few weeks until she settles into her new job and finds herself a new pad. I am loving the extra set of hands around the house. And the home-cooked dinners. Bliss!</p>
<p><strong>8. TV is back baby</strong>
<br>
All the trashy TV is back. I was talking to my bestie on the weekend who I share a similar taste in TV with &#8211; we&#8217;re loving Real Housewives of&#8230; everywhere, I&#8217;m also excited about Girls and whatever else comes my way. I tape them and then watch them marathon style.</p>

<p>I love when a recipe is a pleasant surprise, and this one was. I wasn&#8217;t expecting much. Being pregnant I have very little interest in food. My best friend had flown up from Melbourne and was heading over for lunch, and deciding what to make is usually fun &#8211; but deciding what to make when you have no interest in food is a little bit harder. After flipping through a few cook books, this was the winner. It was so good that I&#8217;ve made it again since then {and it&#8217;s only been a week}.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a 15 minute meal. It is quick, and if you put your mind to it you could most probably do it in that time frame. I had a little time on my hands, so I flaffed about and probably took more like 25. <em>Rebel.</em></p>
<p>And let me just say, don&#8217;t make the parcels and team it with a different salad. This salad is killer. I actually don&#8217;t like cucumbers. I always pull them off salad sandwiches and push them aside in salads. But I am now in love with them, thanks to this salad. They&#8217;re fresh, crisp and perfect. <em>Why didn&#8217;t anyone tell me about them before?</em></p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p><strong>Parcels</strong>
<br>
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas
<br>
100g feta cheese
<br>
100g baby spinach
<br>
1 lemon
<br>
1/2 tsp sweet smoked paprika
<br>
4 large sheets of filo pastry</p>
<p><strong>Salad</strong>
<br>
1 cucumber
<br>
1 small red onion
<br>
A handful of mint, roughly chopped
<br>
A handful of coriander, roughly chopped
<br>
20g slivered almonds
<br>
650g mixed ripe tomatoes
<br>
2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p><strong>To serve</strong>
<br>
fat-free natural yoghurt
<br>
lemon juice</p>
<h4>Method</h4>
<p>♥ Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celcius.
<br>
♥ Get out your food processor, or use your stick blender. Drain the chickpeas and add to the processor {or bowl if you&#8217;re using the stick blender}. Add the feta, spinach, lemon zest and paprika and blitz until combined.
<br>
♥ To make the parcels, fold a single sheet of filo pastry in half, spoon a quarter of the feta mix into the middle and then bring the sides up to make the parcel. They seem like they&#8217;re going to fall apart, but just pinch the tops together so they stay gathered. Make the 3 other parcels.
<br>
♥ Place in the oven to cook until golden and crisp. {Jamie does suggest frying the bottoms in a frying pan of oil. I tried doing this, and much prepared no frying. Up to you}.
<br>
♥ To make the salad, slice the cucumber thinly, as well as the red onion. Place it into your serving bowl. Slice the tomatoes as you please. I buy a punnet of different sized tomatoes &#8211; some I slice, some I quarter and the smaller ones I leave whole. Place into the serving bowl.
<br>
♥ Drizzle the olive oil over the salad. Sprinkle with salt. Gently toss. Scatter with the herbs and the almonds.
<br>
♥ Serve the parcels with the salad, and a dollop of the yoghurt mixed with lemon juice.</p>
<p><strong>Notes: </strong>
<br>
♥ In Jamie&#8217;s recipe he adds lettuce to the salad. You can do this too. I liked the combination without it.
<br>
♥ I&#8217;ve also skipped another step in the salad, where Jamie adds a handful of black olives. He also adds the lemon juice to the salad instead of the yoghurt. I like the yoghurt sauce to have a tang, but it&#8217;s really up to you. Adapt yours to suit your tastes.
<br>
&hearts; The second time I made this I doubled the quantity of the parcels so we&#8217;d have more {i.e. two for Hubby and some for lunch the next day}.</p>
<h4>Do you like cucumbers? Is there a food you once detested, but suddenly became friends with later in life?</h4>

<p><strong>1. Growing up in the &#8216;hood</strong>
<br>
I don&#8217;t know if we just got lucky where we lived, but we grew up in an awesome neighbourhood filled with kids. The lady who lived two houses up had grown up kids that had moved out and away, but she still kept a jar of lollies in her house for the neighbourhood kids. We&#8217;d go up, knock on the door and a lollipop would be given to us. She was particular though, you had to get your timing right. You couldn&#8217;t visit too often and you had to use your manners. She wouldn&#8217;t tolerate brats. {And of course I was never, ever one of those!}.</p>
<p><strong>2. Best friends FOREVER</strong>
<br>
Next door in that very same neighbourhood lived my best friend Natalie. We spent as much time as humanly possible together. We&#8217;d swim in each others pools. She had a fancy above ground pool, where my dad had made a super fancy half in ground, half above ground pool. We&#8217;d go through phases with which toys we wanted to play with, but we&#8217;d always meet in the driveway with something cool to do that day.</p>
<p><strong>3. Barbies for every one</strong>
<br>
Of all the toys we played with Barbies were the winner. With 3 girls in our family we had quite the collection. And no Barbie collection is complete without Ken. One day he&#8217;d fall in love with my Barbie, and they&#8217;d get married, buy a horse and Barbie would wear her most glamorous dress. Other days he&#8217;d marry Natalie&#8217;s Barbie and mine, well she was a little bit bitter. We donated all of our Barbies to my little cousins later on, and I&#8217;m quietly devastated that I didn&#8217;t keep them for Lacey.</p>
<p><strong>4. The sleepover when you don&#8217;t actually sleepover</strong>
<br>
Remember that sleepover, your very first, when you assured your Mum that you were totally old enough to stay at a friend&#8217;s house, and you definitely would not cry? And then it got to night time and you got terribly homesick and had to ask your friend&#8217;s parents to call yours to come and get you. Or was that just me?</p>
<p><strong>5. Your very first ever bike</strong>
<br>
I think when I was about 6 I got my first bike. I can remember it under the Christmas tree, with it&#8217;s little baby seat on the back for my doll. It was like magic. Years later, when I outgrew it, my Dad &#8216;made&#8217; another bike for me. He got an old boys bike from somewhere and did a fancy spray paint job on it &#8211; splashes of white and pink. I rode it proudly around our streets, until some boys mocked me {well the bike and the paint job} and I didn&#8217;t quite feel like riding it anymore. Funny that.</p>
<p><strong>6. That time your mum trod on your toy </strong>
<br>
She was mad, wasn&#8217;t she? It must have hurt. And now I know too, because those darn teeny pieces of toy are very ouchy, especially when you&#8217;re not expecting it, in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Just as I grew up with Barbie as part of my childhood, we&#8217;ve kind of continued it on. Lacey has a few dolls, but is crazy about the Barbie movies. They watched The Three Musketeers are preschool and ever since she&#8217;s been telling me, &#8220;All for one, and one for all!&#8221; We’ve watched every Barbie movie, more than once. I like them for her because the storylines keep her interested, the messages behind the movies are often sweet and appropriate, and there isn’t a huge scare factor that keep her awake at night {like we’ve had in some other movies}.</p>
<p>This month Barbie are excited to be releasing a new movie, Barbie in the Pink Shoes. We were lucky enough to get an early sneak peak at the movie {which officially made me the best mum in the world, just quietly!}. It&#8217;s a sweet story about friendship, dreams, a little love, and a bit of ballet thrown in. It&#8217;s about following your dreams, whatever they may be. Here&#8217;s a little more about Barbie in the Pink Shoes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Dance your way to a magical adventure with Barbie as Kristyn, a ballerina with big dreams! When she tries on a pair of sparkling pink shoes, she and her best friend, Hailey, are whisked away to a fantastical ballet world. There, Kristyn discovers she must dance in her favorite ballets in order to defeat an evil Snow Queen. With performances to the legendary Giselle and Swan Lake ballets, it&#8217;s a wonderful journey where if you dance with your heart, dreams come true!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>I&#8217;ve got 5 copies of the DVD up for grabs for 5 lucky winners. All you have to do is leave a comment below answering the following question: What was your dream as a child?</h4>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Dear 3am,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>We need to break-up. It&#8217;s not me, it&#8217;s you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I know you&#8217;re lonely, but I&#8217;m just not that into you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Yes, we used to be friends. Back in my early 20&#8242;s we&#8217;d hang out, usually in a taxi on the way home from a night of sweaty dancing and cocktail drinking. And then I slipped back into the comfort of my bed, and you were gone. Just like that.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And then there was that time I was pregnant with Lacey, and we met quite often. There was that bird that insisted on chirping all night long. I didn&#8217;t sleep much, so you and I would hang out watching Rob Mills and his quiz show {really mediocre TV} waiting for morning to come. I know you were meeting with the guy in the apartment upstairs too. I heard him go out onto his balcony and yell in frustration, &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; He was saying what I was thinking. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>And now you&#8217;re back. Almost always 3am. Sometimes 2:55am. Never enjoyable. Sleep never follows after we meet. I toss and turn hoping for it, but it never returns. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I know we&#8217;ll meet again when the baby is here, but for now&#8230; I want to break-up. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Remember, it&#8217;s not me. It&#8217;s most definitely you.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Regards,</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Chantelle.</em></p>
<p>P.S. Any tips for surviving pregnancy insomnia will be gratefully received. x</p>
