<p>I came across <a href="http://www.quora.com/Life/What-are-the-top-10-things-that-we-should-be-informed-about-in-life#ans2267532">this thread on Quora</a> about the top 10 things that we should be informed about in life and found the answers of <a href="http://www.quora.com/Justin-Freeman" title="Justin Freeman">Justin Freeman</a>, pastor of a small evangelical church in southern Missouri, to be quite amazing. I found myself nodding along to everything that Freeman had written, but here are two points that I thought were particularly poignant.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>3. Spend your life with rulebreakers.</strong> Marry them. Befriend them. Work with them. Spend weekends with them. No matter how much power you become possessed of, you&#8217;ll never be able to make someone care—so gather close the caring.</p>
<p><strong>5. Money is expensive.</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s difficult to get your hands on sometimes—and you never know when someone&#8217;s going to pull the floorboards out from under you—so don&#8217;t be stupid with it. Avoid debt on depreciating assets, and never incur debt in order to assuage your vanity (see rule number one). Debt has become normative, but don&#8217;t blithely accept it as a rite of passage into adulthood—debt represents imbalance and, in some sense, often a resignation of control. Student loan debt isn&#8217;t always unavoidable, but it isn&#8217;t a given—my wife and I completed a combined ten years of college with zero debt between us. If you can&#8217;t avoid it, though, make sure that your degree is an investment rather than a liability—I mourn a bit for all of the people going tens of thousands of dollars in debt in pursuit of vague liberal arts degrees with no idea of what they want out of life. If you&#8217;re just dropping tuition dollars for lack of a better idea at the moment, just withdraw and go wander around Europe for a few weeks—I guarantee you&#8217;ll spend less and learn more in the process.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Simple and functional—this is the ethos of design studio <a href="http://fortstandard.com/">Fort Standard</a>. Founded in 2011 by Gregory Buntain and Ian Collings, the company specializes in everything from furniture design and home goods to innovative lighting and  jewelry pieces. They&#8217;re also responsible for store design including the new <a href="http://blog.stevenalan.com/2013/03/14/now-open-steven-alan-home-shop/">Steven Alan Home</a> shop in NYC&#8217;s Tribeca neighborhood.</p>
<p><span id="more-56767"></span></p>
<p>I first encountered Fort Standard&#8217;s work via their <a href="http://fortstandard.com/standard-pendant">Standard Pendant</a>, which I bought at a store in Brooklyn and wear religiously. It&#8217;s a deceivingly simple wooden disk with inlaid brass that seems to pair with every ensemble. I have since become a fan of the geometric stone trivets lined with leather as well as their beautifully made glass wooden vessels, which are perfect for holding various kitchen sundries like coffee beans. Aside from their wide range of home goods (have I mentioned bottle openers, magnets, and candlesticks?), Fort Standard cobbles furniture, too. And their spare stools, side tables, and linear floor lamps are equally as streamlined and arresting.</p>

<p><a href="http://juliarobbs.com/">Julia Robbs</a> is the type of photographer who takes photos of the life you wish you lived. Whether she&#8217;s drinking espressos in the French Alps, feeding pigeons in Paris or just hanging with friends in Big Sur, she always has a camera on hand and a great eye as a visual story-teller. I particularly love these shots of Palm Desert. </p>
<p><span id="more-56492"></span></p>
<p>Julia, it would seem, is a proper adventurer and a constant traveler. Born in France, she has lived in 10 cities in 3 countries and has recently moved to New York. Her images of Palm Desert highlight the area&#8217;s tranquility and beauty. Some prints from this series are available to buy from her online store. <a href="http://juliarobbs.com/store/">Go check it out</a>! </p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84897088&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
<p>I popped on to Rdio this morning and noticed that <a href="http://vampireweekend.com/" title="Vampire Weekend">Vampire Weekend</a> had a new single out called &#8220;Diane Young&#8221; (you&#8217;ll get it when you hear it) from their upcoming album <em>Modern Vampire in the City</em>. The song is peppy and upbeat, but also a little unconventional. It&#8217;s a bit surf rock and a bit 50&#8242;s pop sounding but with Ezra Koenig&#8217;s familiar vocals layered over the top of it all. The new record should be out on May 14 and this makes me pretty excited to hear it.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> Just went to the Vampire Weekend site (should have done that first) and noticed they had videos for &#8220;Diane Young&#8221; and the song &#8220;Step&#8221;. Gotta&#8217; say I&#8217;m much more into &#8220;Step&#8221;, it&#8217;s simple and beautiful. A bit of harpsichord and some digitally altered vocals. Yes, please.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56786" alt="NL Architects Delrey Florida Pool House" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey4.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Amsterdam-based <a href="http://www.nlarchitects.nl/">NL Architects</a> have recently shared three versions of a project designed for a Canadian entrepreneur on the beach in Florida. If this seems like a strange mix of characters and settings to you, you&#8217;re not alone. The collaboration is not a product of rampant globalization, but one of logic. First, pools in Canada are frozen solid year round* so a beach house with a habitable pool <em>had</em> to be built elsewhere. Second, who, other than a Canadian, would scour architecture firms around the world, searching for the firm best equipped to build a nearly tropical beach house and decide to go with a firm in the Netherlands?</p>
<p><span id="more-56783"></span></p>
<p>Kidding aside, the far flung collaboration has churned out three pool houses where the relationship between the pool and the house is unexpected, but in some ways quite simple. NL Architects have created <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/57124/in-progress-blok-k-nl-architects/">fluid rooftops before</a>, but never an entire rooftop that is liquid. For their proposals in Florida, the pool is the roof of each version of the project, and not just part of the roof or a roof-top pool&#8230; the pool IS the roof.</p>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56789" alt="NL Architects Delrey Florida Pool House" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey3.jpg" width="800" height="600" />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56788" alt="NL Architects Delrey Florida Pool House" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey2.jpg" width="800" height="600" />
<p>The first version is relatively straightforward: a rectangular slab of concrete is hoisted in the air and manipulated like fabric, pushed down in graceful curves to divide the program of the house while enjoyed from above as a private outdoor space. In the second version, the house is a meandering ribbion of concrete and glass with the pool resembling a river snaking through the lushly-vegetated site. The final version, called Sawa, was named for and inspired by Balinese terraced rice farms. Water spills over the edge of one pool into the next, making a topography of water across what is essentially a flat site.</p>
<p>To me, these are exciting models and ideas. On a designboom article about the project a few commenters decried the absurdity of the proposals, pointing out the difficulty of realizing the project and how, once built, the project will surely leak. So that&#8217;s very helpful, I&#8217;m sure that the architects hadn&#8217;t considered the potential for leaks. Clearly, these aren&#8217;t construction documents and even if zero versions of the project are ever built, it&#8217;s nice to imagine that these houses could exist. It&#8217;s nice that someone is creating a contemporary alternative the quasi-historic monstrosities that litter expensive beach front real estate. But no matter how nice the effort is, these are still just models; models of a house that is still so far away from the architects and their client.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-56787" alt="NL Architects Delrey Florida Pool House" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//NLArchitects_Delrey5-800x600.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>*I know this is not true. Swimming pools in Canada are only frozen solid for <em>most</em> of the year.</p>

<p>Every time I start packing away the winter sweaters and coats, a long string of cold days shows up on the forecast and I start to hate the axis of the earth for not tilting toward the sun more quickly. Days are getting longer (at least for those of us in the northern hemisphere) but as close as summer seems to be, there is still too much snow on the ground for too many of us. 2013 is just another year that the groundhog lied to us all.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been flipping through projects trying to find some that look <em>summerish</em> even if I&#8217;m not sure why seem that way. Counterintuitively, we&#8217;re starting in Michigan with a tall, skinny cabin that is probably absolutely miserable right now, so let&#8217;s just pretend that it&#8217;s summer. The <a href="http://www.homedsgn.com/2013/03/21/glen-lake-tower-by-balance-associates-architects/"> Glen Lake Tower</a> is a cabin on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Lake">Glen Lake</a> where <a href="http://www.balanceassociates.com/projects/GlenLkTowerext.html">Balance Associates Architects</a> worked with the owners to come up with a warm and modern abode that hoisted off the ground to accomodate a covered parking area.</p>
<p><span id="more-56693"></span></p>
<p>The public spaces of the house are actually at the very top of the cabin, affording the kitchen and the living room the most impressive views of Glen Lake, and even Lake Michigan beyond. Between the parking and the public spaces, a master suite and a guest bedroom/office have balconies that look out toward the lake. The most dramatic balcony though, is the one off of the living room. Along with the overhanging roofline, the cantilevered deck makes the house look elegantly top-heavy, in a way that makes me think the public could one day appreciate brutalism again. Sadly, for the time being, all I can imagine is an icicle reaching from the roof all the way to the ground.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re big fans of British singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.keatonhenson.com/">Keaton Henson</a>. Not only are his lyrics thoughtful and poetic, his delivery is so subtle and beautiful, his emotion seems to stir yours with every listen. Already an artist with an armful of thoughtful and interesting music videos that function more as short films, his latest, &#8220;Lying to You&#8221;, is a collaboration with photographer <a href="http://www.autumndewilde.com/">Autumn de Wilde</a>. An ode to the teenage girl, it stars de Wilde&#8217;s enigmatic daughter, Arrow, as she traverses suburban streets dotted with cat topiaries and errant Winnebagos in such a way as to make you remember the pangs of adolescent loneliness. We were so taken with it, we recently spoke to de Wilde to find out more about her inspiration and process for the video.</p>
<p><span id="more-56701"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obsessed with fallen glory,&#8221; de Wilde said. &#8220;Places that once were cookie cutter but starting to disintegrate. There&#8217;s an unfinished perfection that I like.&#8221; Director of photography, <a href="http://www.mjl2006.com/">Matthew Lloyd</a>, chose Pacoima, California, a neighborhood full of languid decay, stereotypical suburban houses, and random, carefully carved hedges. Arrow is the sole focus, though, and we follow her every footfall as she delicately lip syncs along with Henson&#8217;s lyrics. &#8221;We were tearing through the neighborhood following Arrow&#8217;s stride,&#8221; de Wilde said, &#8220;The reason why we cast a teenage girl was because if it wasn&#8217;t going to be Keaton [in the video] we wanted it to be something very left field. I&#8217;ve never directed Arrow in anything, so I didn&#8217;t want her to feel too much pressure, but she didn&#8217;t. She really flew away with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inspired partly by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langley_Schools_Music_Project">The Langley School Music Project</a>, a collection of 1970&#8242;s recordings of pop songs sung by a children&#8217;s chorus (specifically the song &#8220;Desperado&#8221; sung by a lone, sweet-voiced girl), as well as the time when teens transition into adults, the video also stars Arrow&#8217;s denim jacket festooned with vintage pins and a tampon dipped in glitter. &#8220;I love the combination of old fashioned girlie and badass,&#8221; said de Wilde. &#8220;I grew up watching Kristy McNichol, Tatum O&#8217;Neal, and Jodie Foster, all these tough teenagers who also had a little bit of a girlie thing going on. <em>Little Darlings</em>, <em>Foxes</em>, and even <em>Candleshoe</em>—those movies are a big influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>We think you&#8217;ll find your own influences, too, as the subject matter is something we can all relate to. Though there&#8217;s no specific story, the intention is clear, and even though there isn&#8217;t an ending, that adds to the depth and emotion of the song. As Henson and de Wilde decreed, &#8220;We wanted to leave it a mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The f0nk. <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/03/15/flowers-by-dudley-perkins/">We&#8217;ve discussed it before</a>, and now it&#8217;s back again. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SFt7JHwJeg">Released in 1974 by Kool and the Gang</a>, &#8220;Summer Madness&#8221; remains one of the best grooves from the 70&#8242;s. The beat is not only irrepressible but one of the most familiar samples of all time. G-funk and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr0tTbTbmVA"> Mr. Smith with Jazzy Jeff</a> helped reintroduce the song to a younger audience, and to them, it is the definition of summer. </p>
<p>So now it gets a flip by one of the best drummers in the game.</p>
<p><span id="more-56679"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="800" height="500" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MYciNjzMj_Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.stonesthrow.com/karriemriggins">Karriem Riggins</a> cannot be classified as just another guy with a beat. Currently drumming for Diana Krall, Riggins has worked with Paul McCartney, Madlib, Oscar Peterson, Talib Kweli, J Dilla, Common, Erykah Badu&#8230; the list goes on and on and on, it&#8217;s pretty ridiculous. His debut record, <em>Alone Together</em>, was a product of his time in Los Angeles. With a drum kit, keyboard, and a sampler the record came together. His take on this classic track got the real treatment: a slick five minute video. Riggins&#8217; &#8220;Summer Madness&#8221; focuses on the spirit of the original yet he delves into deeper grooves. The extended cut takes you into a jam of the original beat, showcasing some drum skills and the tightness of the band. If you want to make your day sunnier, look no further.</p>

<p>While I was visiting Reykjavik, hands down the coolest person I met was <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/" title="Siggi Odds">Siggi Odds</a>. Siggi is an artist and designer who&#8217;s style is heavily influenced by Native American art and nature itself, with a touch of Matisse thrown in. It&#8217;s both contemporary and abstract at the same time, with lots of energy and color to everything he does. Siggi&#8217;s work feels a lot like what the vibe of Iceland is, and I think Icelanders agree. He recently was chosen to have <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/Puffin-Stamp">his work put on a national stamp</a>, celebrating one of the most beautiful birds their country has, the puffin. Like Iceland, Siggi&#8217;s work ranges from fine art to branding and identity.</p>
<p><span id="more-56482"></span></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//KEX_logo_cmyk-10_o.gif" alt="KEX Hostel branding" width="905" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56716" />
<p>One of my favorite examples of this is <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/KEX-Hostel" title="Siggi Odds - KEX Hostel">the branding he did for KEX Hostel</a>, essentially the Ace Hotel of Reykjavik.</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea for this identity was to represent the many different types of people from all over the world that come to KEX Hostel with typography and early 20th century visuals. The identity has 8 different logos, created from mostly bespoke type designed especially for this project, with a few exceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve included a few more examples of his work below which shows you the immense range of work he makes. I&#8217;d highly suggest paying him a visit and seeing what else he&#8217;s made.</p>

<p>Late last year the Canadian singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.adventuresinyourownbackyard.com/">Patrick Watson</a> ran a competition asking fans to create a music-video for his track &#8220;Blackwind&#8221;. The entries were really impressive and it&#8217;s incredible to see the quality of fan-made videos being made. Last month he finally <a href="http://genero.tv/blog/2013/patrick-watson-blackwind-video/">announced the winner as Chloe Poirier-Sauve</a> but also gave special mention to six other entries; one of which is this video created by the South-Korean director <a href="http://www.deeshin.com/">Dee Shin</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-56494"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/58775828?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="800" height="340" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>Dee Shin&#8217;s video is beautifully shot and it is filled with subtle motifs. It&#8217;s the type of video that demands multiple viewings, as new patterns emerge with every watch and visual links become clearer. The promo follows a young artist as he sets off on adventure, leaving the comfort of his own home behind. Dee Shin&#8217;s video feels dreamlike and magical and it marks her out as a real talent to watch. </p>
<p>&#8220;Blackwind&#8221; is taken from Patrick Watson&#8217;s fourth studio album <em>Adventures in Your Own Backyard </em>. It was released last year on Domino Records and you can buy a copy of it <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/albums/27-01-12/adventures-in-your-own-backyard/">here</a>. </p>

<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//s-s-s-beak-and-claw-2.jpg" alt="s / s / s - Beak &amp; Claw - Sufjan Stevens, Son Lux, Serengeti" width="800" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56722" />
<p><iframe width="400" height="100" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3167510414/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=eb374f/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"><a href="http://anticon.bandcamp.com/album/beak-claw">Beak &amp; Claw by s / s / s</a></iframe></p>
<p>Collaborations are always interesting, especially when they involve individuals who you wouldn&#8217;t image working together. The EP above is the culmination of three different but equally talented artists: <a href="http://music.sufjan.com/" title="Sufjan Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="http://sonlux.tumblr.com/" title="Son Lux">Son Lux</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/serengetidave" title="Serengeti">Serengeti</a>. I don&#8217;t know how I missed this, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention it before either.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stranger things have happened, but rarely do they make such beautiful music. The three esses that comprise the enigmatically titled s / s / s are as follows: Sufjan Stevens, he of the Fifty States Project and various baroque folk-pop opuses; Serengeti, the wry-witted rapper known for in-depth on-record character studies; and Son Lux, silken-voiced singer, studio wizard and singular beatsmith. The project’s roots reach back to 2009’s Dark Was the Night compilation, where Stevens and Geti met over a Buck 65 remix of a song written by psych-folkie Castanets. Continuing in the spirit of (unlikely) collaboration, the pair passed beats and raps back and forth, eventually enlisting Son Lux to dream Beak &#038; Claw into fruition. </p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-56720"></span></p>
<p>Listening to the EP you certainly get a sense of the musical density that&#8217;s been packed in. It reminds me quite a bit of Sufjan&#8217;s last album <a href="http://music.sufjan.com/album/the-age-of-adz" title="The Age of Adz by Sufjan Stevens"><em>The Age of Adz</em></a> which went all over the place stylistically, but somehow it all made perfect sense. What you&#8217;ve got with this EP, called <em>Beak &#038; Claw</em>, is the culmination of an avant garde indie pop artist, an experimental electronic producer and a talented rapper who, when combined, actually make something quite remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>While this momentous EP comprises a mere four songs, each covers an immense stretch of sonic territory and emotional range. At six minutes, “Museum Day” may be the most adventurous and also the most satisfying, opening with a swath of AutoTuned heartache courtesy of Stevens, cresting with the darkly detailed raps of Geti, and closing in a hail of crashing cymbals, orchestral glitch and haunted coos from Son Lux. “Beyond Any Doubt” exchanges that taut splendor for deeper grooves whose farthest-out moments bring to mind Shabazz Palaces’ cracked futurisms, albeit spiked with a falsetto’d pop hook. Fuzzy bass and industrial clang crash into lines about unrealized escapism and unpaid bills. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think this album is pretty amazing. I&#8217;m glad I <a href="http://rd.io/x/QFCKPlbuAQ/">found it on Rdio</a> so that I can listen to it on repeat now. Hopefully we get to hear more great tracks from s / s / s.</p>

<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39381/surrounded-by-art-material-an-interview-with-alex-israel/">Surrounded By Art Material: An Interview With Alex Israel</a></big><br />
Alex Israel is one of our favorite LA artists. He&#8217;s conceptual, he&#8217;s very LA, and he is all about abusing entertainment structures in Los Angeles to make art. It&#8217;s super fascinating and fun work. For our Featured Interview with the artist, we rode around Los Angeles with him as he took us from destination to destination that has had an influence on him. It was a lot of fun. Also, note that he has a really rad piece up at LAXART called <i><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39665/alex-israels-lens/">Lens</i></a> that is a giant lens from a pair of sunglasses blown up for us all to examine. It&#8217;s up through April 20.</p>
<p><span id="more-56611"></span></p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39384/get-ready-for-the-times/">Get Ready For The Times</big></a><br />
You know <a href="http://nationalforest.com/">National Forest</a>? Well, the guys of the super popular LA design firm have finally taken the next logical step for the brand: they&#8217;ve made a clothing line! The line is The Times and it is a t-shirt and sweatshirt brand (at the moment) that is very lighthearted and fun and thoroughly Californian. We&#8217;re mildly obsessed with their Cosmic Pretzel shirt..</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39554/heidis-salsa/">Heidi&#8217;s Salsa</big></a><br />
Luko Foods&#8217; Heidi&#8217;s Salsa is a homegrown LA salsa maker. They&#8217;re good at what they do and they certainly are a great entry into the LA salsa community which, really, is a big community. The best part? Their Mexi-American totally fun branding and packaging. We had to snag a jar because it looked so great. The contents could have tasted dreadfully OK&#8211;and we still would have loved it because it looks so cool. We highly recommend this!</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39682/river-mouth/"><em>River Mouth</em></big></a><br />
Friend and filmmaker Felipe Lima recently teamed up with locals Generic Surplus and Commes des Garçons to make a video about the brands&#8217; recent shoe collaboration. The result? A pretty tripped out South American wanderlust video that sees Lima&#8217;s brothers traveling the city and jungle and giving occasional sexy glimpses of the shoes. It&#8217;s extremely well done.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39766/spring-forward/"><i>Spring Forward</i></big></a><br />
The LA Kidrobot and LA Blu Dot stores have teamed up for a customized Munny art show that sees the funny little vinyl figures dressed for Spring. Set in the beautiful Blu Dot store/showroom, the pieces certainly reflect Spring in LA and the cultures that surround us. You know what else is there? Some Munnys we made! We suggest you check it out and take a peek at what went into making ours <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39499/making-munnys-for-kidrobot-and-blu-dot/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine your home was wallpapered in the wildest array of mismatched stripes, and every time you entered it felt like a graphic designer&#8217;s fun house that danced with prism rhythm. This is the work of Dutch artist <a href="http://www.wiespreijde.com/">Wies Preijde</a>. A recent graduate of the Textile Design Department at the Royal Academy of Art (aka The Hague), Preijde specializes in textile design installations that truly defy imagination.</p>
<p><span id="more-56268"></span></p>
<p>Not only does she conceive and create the textile patterns herself, she then constructs angular rooms covered in the varying pastel stripes and shapes. Inspired by architecture and everyday objects, her work creates a flat, holographic experience for the observer that feels like an illusion. If you squint your eyes, it feels like you&#8217;re looking at the coolest wallpaper ever rather than meticulously designed fiber walls. I don&#8217;t know if this is Preijde&#8217;s intention, but I&#8217;d paper a whole house in the stuff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Christo_Balloon.jpg" alt="Christo&#039;s Big Air Package" width="800" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56616" />
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//christo-big-air-package.jpg" alt="Christo&#039;s Big Air Package" width="1050" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56628" />
<p>When I think of balloons, I usually think of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/a-helium-shortage-leads-to-fewer-balloons-in-the-sky.html?_r=0">helium</a> variety. They&#8217;re like brightly-colored bubbles of optimism that can only be held down to earth by white <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=secret-of-ribbon-curling">curling ribbon</a> and mailboxes. But balloons can be so much more. They come in all shapes and sizes, and the size of this balloon is&#8230; humongous.</p>
<p><span id="more-56612"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually the largest balloon in history, or the largest &#8220;inflated envelope&#8221; if you prefer, but this is a huge bag of gas no matter what you call it. I thought nothing could be bigger than the parachute we played with in P.E. when I was a second grader. Then, I saw a hot air balloon. And now I&#8217;m seeing <a href="http://christojeanneclaude.net/press/big-air-package">beautiful pictures of this installation by Christo</a>. It&#8217;s 90 meters tall! That&#8217;s nearly 300 feet, filling the <a href="http://www.gasometer.de/en/">Gasometer Oberhausen</a>&#8216;s dark-walled cylinder with taught, white fabric.</p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Christo_Balloon4.jpg" alt="Christo&#039;s Big Air Package" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56613" />
<p>The best part of this work may be that you can go inside the installation. I can only imagine what it would feel like to stand inside and stare into the enormity of the space above. Folks lucky enough to find themselves around Oberhausen between now and the end of 2013 can let the giant white balloon swallow them, at least for a little bit, and experience the expanse for themselves. What&#8217;s clear is that this definitely isn&#8217;t a helium ballon. It isn&#8217;t the sad ballon trapped against a tall ceiling, or the sagging bunch of balloons tied a mailbox days after a birthday party. This is an exploration of space and light where the balloon is as tall as a football field and the ribbon tying the balloon in place is really steel cables to make sure the 5.3 tons of fabric don&#8217;t fall back down to earth before the party is over.</p>

<p>During stressful launches, NASA&#8217;s jet Propulsion Laboratory mission control <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/how-jpls-peanut-tradition-started-120815.htm">eats handfuls of peanuts for good luck</a>. Peanuts have been a part of space exploration for a long time. A dedicated reader passed along the above <em>Peanuts</em> <a href="http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20944/lot/136/">Snoopy astronaut action figure</a>: Snoopy was the NASA Manned Flight Awareness Program mascot (with the blessing of <em>Peanuts</em> creator Charles Schultz) and spoke out for flight safety. NASA even awards a &#8220;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/sfa/award_silver_snoopy.html">Silver Snoopy Award</a>&#8221; to employees and contractors for outstanding human flight safety achievements.</p>
<p>Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan of Apollo X named their Lunar Module (LM) Snoopy. The Command Service Module was named Charlie Brown.</p>
<p><span id="more-56630"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Apollo-X-Snoopy-Stafford.jpeg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Apollo-X-Snoopy-Stafford-800x597.jpeg" alt="Apollo X-Snoopy-Stafford" width="800" height="597" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-56649" /></a></p>
<p>The Apollo X mission was launched on May 18, 1969 and the mission was considered a dress rehearsal for the XI lunar landing later that year. Above, Mission Commander Stafford taps Snoopy&#8217;s nose for good luck.</p>
<p>This most lovable cartoon pup will always be a part of space exploration. Today a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum16/HTML/000553.html">Snoopy statue sits in Kennedy Space Center&#8217;s Rocket Garden</a>. The statue was donated by the Schulz family in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Space Agency.</p>
<p>Pups will always have their place in space exploration. The first earthling to orbit the home planet was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika">Laika</a>, the first of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_dogs">Soviet space dogs</a>. Additionally, my all-time favorite NASA crew patch is for <a href="http://www.spacepatches.nl/sts_mis/STS69a.html">STS-69 Mission: Dog Crew II</a>. The crew had previously flown together on STS-53, the final space shuttle dedicated to the Department of Defense flight, and had named themselves the &#8220;dogs of war.&#8221; For STS-69, each crew member was assigned a &#8220;dog tag&#8221;: Commander David Walker &#8211; Red Dog; James Voss &#8211; Dogface; Ken Cockrell &#8211; Cujo; Michael  Gernhardt &#8211; Under Dog; and James Newman &#8211; Pluto. The Dog Crew II patch features a bulldog peering out from a doghouse shaped like the Space Shuttle. They even ate their pre-launch breakfast out of dog bowls.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//sts69-dog-crew-II-space-shuttle.jpg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//sts69-dog-crew-II-space-shuttle.jpg" alt="sts69- dog crew II - space shuttle" width="626" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56650" /></a></p>
<p>Who let the dogs out?</p>

<p>I stumbled upon these beautiful photos by <a href="http://dbarreto.com/" title="Daniel Barreto">Daniel Barreto</a> this morning and I thought they were rather lovely. Daniel is a Boston based illustrator, designer, photographer who does all sorts of interesting work. He even makes cute animated GIFs, like this one called <a href="http://dbarreto.com/#/post/45252606427/bearandmaths" title="Bear and Maths by Daniel Barreto">Bear and Maths</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-56636"></span></p>
<p>With this double exposure series I thought the balance between people and places was really well done. The interaction between both is interesting, like the clock tower in the bun of the girl in the image at the bottom, or the bokeh of the lights streaking through the face of the woman at the top. I think it&#8217;s also nice that the nightscapes are in color while the portraits are in a subdued sort of sepaia tone, providing a nice contrast between both.</p>
<p>Also be sure to check out <a href="http://dbarreto.com/#/post/45840536337/a-new-series-of-photo-manipulation-im-making">his new series where he&#8217;s combining houses and trees</a>, it&#8217;s super rad looking so far.</p>

<p>About an hour ago <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/" title="Sigur Rós">Sigur Rós</a> dropped an email announcing the release of a new album called <em>Kveikur</em> which is being released on June 17/18. In addition they also released a new video to accompany it titled &#8220;Brennisteinn&#8221;, which takes Sigur Rós into a much harder musical territory. Like I&#8217;ve never heard Sigur Rós sound this bad ass before, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. Plus the video, directed by Andrew Huang, is also pretty gnarly. I think it&#8217;s about a ritual sacrifice and the end of the world, but you can make your own assumptions. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Brandon-Locher-Confuses-Reality-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Brandon-Locher-Confuses-Reality-1.jpg" alt="Brandon Locher Confuses Reality 1" width="800" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56342" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a little bit obsessed with the work of <a href="http://www.myideaoffun.org/myideaoffun.html">Brandon Locher</a> for a few months now. I first caught wind of him when avant-techno artist Holly Herndon <a href="https://twitter.com/hollyherndon/status/288117969333129218">Tweeted</a> about a sound piece Locher did involving phone conversations being looped and volleyed from one caller to another. The resulting sound piece&#8211;<i><a href="http://brandonlocher.bandcamp.com/album/conversations-revisited">Conversations (Revisited)</a></i>&#8211;represents a very simple wrinkle in reality caused by a simple mirroring of a phone conversation. Investigating Locher&#8217;s work, you find that he has a great talent for warping what is real: he is an artist obsessed with the circuitous.</p>
<p><span id="more-56341"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="100" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3547871686/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"><a href="http://brandonlocher.bandcamp.com/album/conversations-revisited">Conversations (Revisited) by Brandon Locher</a></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myideaoffun.org/brandonlocher/2012/index.html"><i>Mazes to the Motherlode XIV</a></i>, an illustration series of ink on paper drawings Locher did, furthers this confusing of reality by playing with planes. The pieces range from very delicate, almost precious, mazes to thick, knotted tangles of shapes. They look like galaxies of twists and turns and&#8211;like <i>Conversations</i> (above)&#8211;make very strange connections out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Locher is certainly an intriguing artist and he looks to be constantly working as you can see from his website. He&#8217;s definitely doing some very heady stuff and we&#8217;re totally feeling it. I recommend you peruse more of his work and, if you have the time, you <i>must</i> listen to <i>Conversations</i> in its entirety. It is a fairly hysterical, odd, and enveloping sound piece.

<p>This is a delightful little animated promo for <a href="http://www.theleisuresociety.co.uk/">The Leisure Society&#8217;s</a> new single &#8220;Fight For Everyone&#8221; which is animated by the British animation studio <a href="http://www.persistentperil.com/">Persistent Peril</a>. The video shows the creation of a new planet by a giant blue hand but unfortunately things don&#8217;t go quite according to plan as chaos unfolds when evolution steps in. It&#8217;s a lot of fun, featuring great colors and a lot of playful whimsy. </p>
<p>The track is taken from the bands third album <em>Alone Aboard The Ark</em> which comes out on April 01st on <a href="http://www.fulltimehobby.co.uk/main/">Full Time Hobby</a>.</p>
