I asked Kyle what he thought of the track and his off the cuff opinion was the it sounded &#8220;like a David Guetta song&#8221;, haha&#8230; I think it is a bit Pharrell heavy, I would have liked more robots, so I&#8217;m curious to see what the rest of the <em>Random Access Memory</em> ends up sounding like. </p>

<p>New York based illustrator <a href="http://nickiluzada.com/" title="Nick Iluzada">Nick Iluzada</a> caught my eye with his illustrations that are filled with vibrant colors and tons of movement. Finding his work was great because it allows me to continue on with this crazy colored streak of posts I&#8217;ve been putting up today.

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//renault-twinz-concept-ross-lovegrove-5.jpg" alt="Renault Twin’Z Concept Car by Ross Lovegrove" width="660" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58460" /></p>
<p>I tend not to post about cars very often, but when I do they&#8217;re usually pretty forward thinking and a bit out there. More cars on the road are kind of boring, though I do think we&#8217;re starting to see some interesting shapes from Nissan and Kia. Renault (who now owns a 43% in Nissan, funny enough) could also be added to that list. The vehicle above is the Renault Twin&#8217;Z concept, designed by <a href="http://www.rosslovegrove.com/" title="Ross Lovegrove">Ross Lovegrove</a> as a part of Renault&#8217;s <a href="http://www.renault.com/en/innovation/l-univers-du-design/pages/strategie-design-renault.aspx">Cycle of Life project</a>.</p>
<p>Lovegrove, a veteran of the design industry, is known for his biologically inspired work (<a href="http://www.rosslovegrove.com/index.php/custom_cat/lighting/">his work in lighting</a> is a good example of this), creating objects that feel&#8230; natural. He&#8217;s taken this distinct style and brought it to the Twin&#8217;Z and I think it&#8217;s totally brilliant. </p>
<p><span id="more-58439"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//renault-twinz-concept-ross-lovegrove-2.jpg" alt="Renault Twin’Z Concept Car by Ross Lovegrove" width="660" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58457" /></p>
<p>To me this car feels alive, like a creature that you&#8217;d find living in a coral reef. The vibrancy of the blue body paired with the neon yellow would certainly make this stand out in any city. The wheels especially are a stand out, like neon colored sea anemones. Inside the palette is just as bright but everything has been extremely pared down. What you&#8217;re left with is a steering wheel and two touch devices for your inputs. </p>
<p>This vehicle might be extreme for most people but I think seeing cars like this is exactly what the world needs. Smaller, bright, and exciting. A welcome change from the mundanity of the road today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Hursley_Silo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58442" alt="Timothy Hursley Silo Hale County Alabama" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Hursley_Silo.jpg" width="800" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>Growing up in a rural area, I probably passed by dozens and dozens of useless, sinking grain silos without ever stopping to think about them. But I&#8217;m not photographer <a href="http://timothyhursley.com/">Timothy Hursley</a>, who has spent the last six years documenting a ruined grain silo which is slowly slouching toward the ground in Hale County, Alabama. One day he happened to drive by a tornado-damaged grain silo, and became enamored. You may be asking what an architectural photographer would be doing in Hale County in the first place. I&#8217;m guessing he was photographing work from the <a href="http://www.ruralstudio.org/">Rural Studio</a>, a division of the <a href="http://cadc.auburn.edu/">Auburn School of Architecture</a> that has been transforming public space in Hale County for years. We actually talked about <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2010/11/03/mobile-concessions-by-rural-studio/">the concession stands</a> the studio created a couple of years ago, and I&#8217;m happy to see the <a href="http://www.ruralstudio.org/projects/lions-park-playscape">innovative play structure</a> that has been completed since.</p>
<p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qj5yME3zh2c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="http://youtu.be/Qj5yME3zh2c?t=20s">a video from the Oxford American</a>, Timothy describes how his fascination with the silo began. He compares the form of he silo to the work of Frank Gehry, and even explains how he eventually purchased the silo for himself. If you live in a rural area, it may change the way you look at your surroundings, or it may make you wonder how many other silos are on the brink of collapse and will spend the rest of their days rusting in a scrap yard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58319" rel="attachment wp-att-58319"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58319" alt="Rapha mens" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//rapha-mens.jpg" width="800" height="385" /></a></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s because of Gestalten&#8217;s <a href="http://news.gestalten.com/motion/life-cycle">ode to cycling</a> this week or because I recently took up spinning, but riding a bike is having a serious comeback. Not that it ever went away, mind you, but with the increasing popularity of spin classes, as well as urban dwellers opting for self-transportation in warmer months, cycling is having its day. Not knowing much about the effects of pedaling or the importance of proper attire, I took to the internet to find out more. My searching led me to <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/">Rapha</a>, a cycling clothing and accessories company that also shoots inspiring ride films as well as publishing books and magazines.</p>
<p><span id="more-58316"></span></p>
<p>Headquartered in London, with offices stateside in Portland, Oregon, Rapha offers beautifully designed performance wear for the minimally-minded. They also offer rides all over the world in the form of challenge rides and retreats. If you&#8217;re more of a spectator, I highly recommend watching a few of their videos highlighting both the beauty of a good ride and the stunning scenery in places like Corsica and Australia. Rapha is so passionate about cycling (most of their employees bike to work) that they created <a href="http://www.rapha.cc/rouleur-magazine">Rouleur Magazine</a> to celebrate the drama of road riding complete with striking photography. They print a series of guides to rides all over the world, too. And even if you aren&#8217;t interested in taking up the sport, one can argue that a flipped up hat, dotted scarf, and graphic water bottle suit just about everybody.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58317" rel="attachment wp-att-58317"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58317" alt="Rapha products" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//rapha-products.jpg" width="800" height="643" /></a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s something really fun and playful about these objects and it&#8217;s terrific to see how his interpretation of such simple things can be filled with so much personality. From cartons of orange juice to jars of salsa, and from window cleaner to radio-cassette players, El Grio&#8217;s minimalist still lives are fantastically fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//chris-ruebo.jpg" alt="Chris Ruebo" width="800" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58436" /></p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of music do you like?&#8221; is a perfectly reasonable and polite question, but it usually makes me a bit panicky. What kind of music do I like? Well, it&#8217;s kind of <em>iffy</em>, to be honest. Unlike every other contributor to this site, my ear is distinctly un-cool, un-hip and if you saw the kind of music I listen to when I&#8217;m alone, you might suspect that I&#8217;m a retired shopping mall Santa who is now supplementing his income on a gay cruise ship.</p>
<p>So imagine my horror when Bobby tells us three months ago that we should start contributing to a monthly playlist for the site. I felt like it was inviting judgement into an arena where I already felt an excess of judgement, highlighting my lousy eardrums. So I added a few songs from bands that I knew were passable as cool and started scouring Rdio for new music. I found a bumper crop of new bands that I sincerely enjoy and ones that I think are cool enough to share with all of you. If you&#8217;re curious what this sounds like, I&#8217;ve started <a href="http://rd.io/x/QR71aTN3_a8/">this playlist</a> as a way to force myself to get rid of the anxiety I&#8217;ve attached to my musical preferences for so long.</p>
<p><span id="more-58391"></span></p>
<p>But what I <em>really</em> want to talk about is an artist that hasn&#8217;t yet found his way onto the Rdio universe: <a href="http://chrisrubeo.com/">Chris Rubeo</a>. That&#8217;s a photo of him at the top that I found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chrisrubeo">on his Facebook page</a>. I first heard <a href="http://chrisrubeo.com/album/lovers-spit-cover">his cover of &#8220;Lovers Spit&#8221;</a> in the phenomenal webseries <a href="http://theouts.squarespace.com/"><em>The Outs</em></a>. (Fair warning: don&#8217;t watch any episodes from the series at work.) Chris&#8217;s first EP is called <a href="http://chrisrubeo.com/album/ships-of-sticks-and-twine-ep"><em>Ships of Sticks and Twine</em></a>, and he is currently recording a second album. He has recently released <a href="http://chrisrubeo.com/track/i-love-you-but-sometimes-you-make-me-feel-crazy">a song from the upcoming album</a> to give everyone an idea of what it might sound like, and he&#8217;s also posted a cover of The White Stripes&#8217; &#8220;Seven Nation Army.&#8221; I can only hope you&#8217;ll like listening his music as much as I do. You can listen to some of it below.</p>

<p>I first came across the work of UK artist <a href="http://whitevinyldesign.com/" title="Luke Twyman">Luke Twyman</a> late last year and I was amazed at how beautiful it was. He painted <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/11/16/illustrations-of-snowy-retreats-by-luke-twyman/">these incredible snowy landscapes</a> which had so much texture and detail. So it was immediately obvious that I needed him to create a wallpaper for the site. </p>
<p>Moving away from the snow he&#8217;s embraced a space-centric wallpaper that I&#8217;ve been using for about a month now. A lonely observatory sits atop a remote peak, peering off at a far-off quasar. I love the mystery and depth of tones in this piece, it&#8217;s just astounding. I&#8217;ve been using this as my wallpaper for the past month, I&#8217;m fond of darker backgrounds, and it works quite well.</p>
<p>Be sure to check back every Wednesday for a new wallpaper!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always exciting to come across an artist like <a href="http://iandavisart.com/" title="Ian Davis">Ian Davis</a>. Based in New York, Davis creates paintings that seem to explore the relationship between man and the world around him. All of his pieces features a group of identically drawn men usually congregating around a single, massive objects or group of objects. It makes for extremely striking paintings, especially when he uses an extreme scale like the painting above.</p>
<p><span id="more-58073"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//ian-davis-painting-1.jpg" alt="Ian Davis Paintings" width="796" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58074" /></p>
<p>For me personally, I kind of see his work as commentary on how we think everything is so important, but maybe it isn&#8217;t? You also have all the men gathered around in their coats and suits, staring and pointing, but none of them really seem to actually be doing anything. So maybe his pieces are about the Internet itself and how potentially, one day, all of it will have been in vain? It&#8217;s fun to place meaning into Davis&#8217; work, they&#8217;re very inviting to such interpretations. They&#8217;re also just downright beautiful.</p>

<p><a href="http://thereconstructionists.org/">The Reconstructionists</a> is an exciting new web project celebrating the women who have changed the world and our culture. A collaboration between illustrator <a href="http://lisacongdon.com/">Lisa Congdon</a> and writer <a href="https://twitter.com/brainpicker">Maria Popova</a>—remarkable women in their own right—each week sees an illustrated portrait paired with a short essay about a subject&#8217;s life and work. Delving into the inspiring work of well-known female creatives, scientists, and trailblazing pioneers, The Reconstructionists also highlights unsung heroes.</p>
<p><span id="more-58101"></span>Congdon is a prolific artist with a long roster of loyal clients and fans, many of whom were introduced to her work via the internet, and her portraits for the project truly capture the spirit of the women profiled. The same can be said for Popova, whose fantastic <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a> website acts as a creative bullhorn for all that is curious, interesting, and inspiring. Not only does she reveal the elements of a subject&#8217;s life you may not know, she writes about them in such a friendly, accessible way.</p>
<p>So far, The Reconstructionists have celebrated everyone from writers Joan Didion and Charlotte Brontë to photographer Bernice Abbott and groundbreaking editor Ursula Nordstrom. Pairing gracefully detailed art with insightful writing to reveal the remarkable women who have shaped our world beyond the boundaries of gender, is a project we think is remarkable itself. We&#8217;re looking forward to following the project every week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58298" rel="attachment wp-att-58298"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Aaron-Meola1_photo-by-Patti-Miller-800x515.jpg" alt="aaron meola by patti miller" width="800" height="515" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-58298" /></a></p>
<p>I was first introduced to the Portland-based label <a href="http://droppinggems.bandcamp.com/">Dropping Gems</a> two years ago when they released their first compilation, <a href="http://droppinggems.bandcamp.com/album/gem-drops" title=""Gem Drops" by Dropping Gems"><em>Gem Drops</em></a>. I was shocked. Here was a labor of love, done by friends for friends, with incredible beats and songs, and all the revenue went to the American Cancer Society. I stayed fresh and young, I got down with some kale jams (seriously), and I loved it so much I even featured a track on my <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/07/11/bootstrap-paradoxes-a-mixtape-by-the-redford-rise/">Redford Rise mixtape</a>, for all of you to enjoy. </p>
<p><a href="http://droppinggems.bandcamp.com/album/gem-drops-two"><em>Gem Drops Two</em></a> followed the next year with the same inspired blend of tracks. Anything from synth pop, hip hop beats, ambient, drone&#8230; it was there. This was music to fall in love to, to get lost in a forest with, to make you dance in the sunshine. Once again, the proceeds went to cancer. Once again, I was smitten with the music.</p>
<p><a href="http://droppinggems.bandcamp.com/album/gem-drops-three"><em>Gem Drops Three</em></a> came out yesterday. Many of the same things are there, but after several years, the sound is more refined. This is a labor of love. So through some help by friends of friends, I got a chance to ask label founder and Portland native <a href="http://www.droppinggems.com/">Aaron Meola</a> how he does it. And in the loving tradition of The Fox Is Black interviews, I asked him five questions about music, love, and passion.</p>
<p><span id="more-58178"></span></p>
<p><big><strong>Everyone talks about wanting to start their own record label. What made you do it?</strong></big></p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> A lot of my friends were making interesting music and didn&#8217;t have a proper outlet for it. This was in Olympia, WA, around the time I was graduating from college in 2009. There was a cluster of us playing shows and collaborating with some frequency, but there wasn’t much organization behind what was going on, or a way to present it as a whole. All the components were there: a group of talent, a base of listeners, and a creative environment to foster us. I stepped in, decided that the pieces needed to be put together, and helped provide a framework for the artists and community to grow.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58301" rel="attachment wp-att-58301"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Gem-Drops_painted-by-Rob-Pea.jpg" alt="Gem Drops by Rob Pea" width="500" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58301" /></a></p>
<p><big><strong>How much did the environment (specifically, Pacific North-West) influence this decision and which artists to pick?</strong></big></p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> The artists are really what created the label, the ones who helped determine what it represents, and I think the environment is a big part of what drew all of us to the Northwest to begin with. The founding members were all interested in similar sonics, and we all still share creative influences, so in a way we picked each other. The cities we represent, Portland, Olympia and Seattle, have very rich musical histories, and we&#8217;re attempting to be the modern incarnation of that legacy, as far as electronic music is concerned.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58300" rel="attachment wp-att-58300"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Gem-Drops-Two_design-by-Thoughtcloud-e1366136451330.jpg" alt="Gem Drops Two by Thoughtcloud" width="700" height="700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58300" /></a></p>
<p><big><strong>What styles of music do you look for? What defines the Gem Drops series, to you?</strong></big></p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> When I’m curating the Gem Drop series I’m basically looking for introspective and emotive material. Sometimes it&#8217;s pretty groovy or funky, but it&#8217;s all thoughtful music that was made by an artist expressing an emotion, extending beyond an attempt at making a club banger. Generally the music contains a lot of lo-fi elements, ambient textures and field recordings, but that’s not a requirement. Another thing that holds the music together is a true community vibe. Although the artists who have been featured in the series span the globe, I would say they all have a similar DIY ethos and commitment to true artistic expression.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Gem-Drops-Three_photo-by-Patti-Miller.jpg" alt="Gem Drops Three Patti Miller" width="1000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58299" /></p>
<p><big><strong>When it comes to the visual aesthetic, where is inspiration drawn from? Any particular style or artist?</strong></big></p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> When it comes to our aesthetic, to our overall tone and presentation, I’d say our natural environment is the biggest influence. The Northwest is basically beautiful greenery clashed with innovative technologies, and so it’s no surprise that our aesthetic reflects this. It&#8217;s a mix of organic and natural looking elements that have a mysterious or futuristic quality to them.</p>
<p>There are several artists I work with on a regular basis that help further define out visual presence. <a href="http://www.patti-miller.net">Patti Miller</a> is a major one. She’s done artwork for us from beginning, everything from podcasts, album covers, press shots, you name it. Her cross-discipline work has strong lo-fi qualities to it, with a mystical undertone that does a good job of catching the essence of our sound. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThoughtCloudDesign">Thoughtcloud</a> is a team of designers that have also done a lot of our visual material. They create highly customized digital atmospheres from scratch using tools like Cinema4D. Their stuff is an interesting mix of modern digital forms crossed with more natural geometry. Two others talented folks who have collaborated with us are <a href="http://www.steveteeps.com">Teeple</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/mikorevereza/videos">Miko Reevereza</a>, both inspiring in their own ways. I’ve been really happy with the talent we’ve attracted and the opportunities we’ve had.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//citymout-holodecker-ep.jpg" alt="Holodecker Ep by Citymouth" width="787" height="709" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58370" /></p>
<p><big><strong>What advice would you give to anyone getting started in this?</strong></big></p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> It&#8217;s not going to happen overnight. Stick to it, by pushing for what you truly believe in, and by creating things that you want to stand by artistically. Bandcamp, social media tools, and the Gem Drops series have been the biggest components to our growth, but it took years. Beyond that, shows are how artists build a real fan base, by getting on the road and reaching listeners directly. The whole process is crucial to success. Lastly, trust your gut when it comes to the big decisions.</p>

<p>You probably know by now that I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/">Nobrow Press</a>. Yet despite my enthusiasm for the indie publishers, it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I got to check out their self-titled flagship magazine. Already up to issue 8, each publication is a fantastic compendium of contemporary graphic art, bringing together a wonderful collection of comic creators and illustrators. </p>
<p><span id="more-57978"></span><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Nobrow-8-Sam-Bosma.jpg" alt="Nobrow 8 - Sam Bosma" width="800" height="569" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57994" /></p>
<p>Each issue is based around a theme, with issue 8 taking &#8216;Hysteria&#8217; as its starting point. It&#8217;s a rather fitting theme for the times we live in and a wonderful inspiration for the artists involved. It&#8217;s exciting reading through and seeing so many unique interpretations. These range from ritualistic sacrifices (<a href="http://www.sbosma.com/">Sam Bosma</a> &#8211; above) to the challenges of life as a teenage girl (<a href="http://dilrajmann.tumblr.com/">Dilraj Mann</a> with Laura Halliwell &#8211; below) and everything in-between.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Nobrow-8-Dilraj-Mann-with-Laura-Halliwell.jpg" alt="Nobrow 8 - Dilraj Mann with Laura Halliwell" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57991" /></p>
<p>Divided into two parts, Nowbrow 8 is almost like two magazines rolled into one, with side one dedicated to comics and side two chock-full of drawings. It&#8217;s a great format and one which can introduce you to a broad range of talent. I was particularly taken by the work of <a href="http://www.emmanuellewalker.com/">Emmanuelle Walker</a>, <a href="http://nggraphics.blogspot.fr/">Nicolas Galkowski</a> and <a href="http://www.dharbin.com/">Dustin Harbin</a> (below). It was also nice to see some of my old favorites too such as <a href="http://lukepearson.com/">Luke Pearson</a>, <a href="http://martamonteiro.com/">Marta Monteiro</a> and <a href="http://philippajrice.com/">Philippa Rice</a>. </p>

<p>Printed with 4 spot colors, Nobrow 8 has an unusual color palette but it&#8217;s one which works quite well, tying the work of all 45 artist together nicely. It&#8217;s occasionally quite bold and brash, but considering the &#8216;hysteria&#8217; theme this works quite well. You can view more images from the magazine on the Nobrow website <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/11443">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nowbrow 8 is out now and features two front covers (one by <a href="http://www.maxbardin.com/index_en.html">Max Capdevila</a> and one by <a href="http://www.karinebernadou.com/">Karine Bernadou</a>). You can order your copy <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/11443">here</a>. </p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3575843&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of great things about <a href="http://erbpfilm.com/film/upstreamcolor" title="Upstream Color"><em>Upstream Color</em></a>, a film that was written, directed, produced, stars, edited, and scored by Shane Caruth. I swear I&#8217;m not making any of that up. I purposely don&#8217;t know much about it, but I was able to find this interesting short description. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for dramatic situations set in sci-fi-esque worlds and this is definitely up my alley. While I don&#8217;t want to know more about the plot, I did dabble in the films score. A mentioned earlier Caruth also created all the music for the film, which when you listen to it that seems quite impressive. I&#8217;m no expert on film scores, but this sounds like something that can stand toe-to-toe with anything Hans Zimmer has done recently. </p>
<p>The music has eerie, mechanical tones interlaced with deep resonating cellos. It&#8217;s both familiar with and undercurrent that&#8217;s alien and machine-like. It reminds me a bit of Takagi Masakatsu&#8217;s music, only with a more orchestral root to it. If you&#8217;re into soundtracks I think this is certainly one not to miss. </p>

<p>Phenomenal UK illustrator <a href="http://matttaylordraws.tumblr.com/post/48125441108/rejoice-there-is-new-daft-punk-material-imminent">Matt Taylor has created a pair of amazing images featuring the Daft Punk</a> duo in their most recent incarnations and he&#8217;s done an incredible job. These aren&#8217;t official, he&#8217;s done them for fun, but someone should totally hire him to do more. You can see larger versions under the cut.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember how but a few weeks back I signed up for Quora&#8217;s weekly email and I must admit, it&#8217;s one of the only newsletters I look forward to getting in my inbox. With this week&#8217;s mailing there was a rather broad but juicy question: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Photography/What-is-the-most-amazing-photo-you-have-ever-taken">What is the most amazing photo you have ever taken?</a></p>
<p>My favorite answer came from photographer <a href="http://www.kentmiller.com/" title="Kent Miller">Kent Miller</a>  on how he took the photo above: A Boeing 747 flying right over the heads of beachgoers in St. Maartens. And no, that&#8217;s not Photoshopped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I focused on people reacting to the scene rather than the scene itself. I shot people getting blown off their feet under the aircraft. I shot people running from the spit of the sand blasting on their flesh. There were a lot of jetliners coming in that day, and a lot of commuter jets. I left enough room over their heads to keep the planes in the background. I was just really lucky to be in that place and time when the 747 Jumbo Jet came in. I think we felt like we were in a very safe place to make that picture then, but when it came in, it was like a shock. It took my breath away. It was like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the rest of Kent&#8217;s answer directly by <a href="http://www.quora.com/Photography/What-is-the-most-amazing-photo-you-have-ever-taken/answer/Kent-Miller-2">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//currency-converter-app-2a.png" alt="Currency - A precisely designed currency converter app for iPhone" width="800" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58291" /></p>
<p>Converting currency in foreign countries can be tricky and frustrating. Conversion rates can shift quickly, it can be embarrassing figuring out numbers in your head, and you don&#8217;t want to get fleeced by a local merchant who can tell you&#8217;re not certain. Well, <a href="http://dribbble.com/alexpenny" title="Alex Penny">Alex Penny</a> and <a href="http://www.mattdavenport.net/" title="Matt Davenport">Matt Davenport</a> may have come up with the best solution for these dilemmas.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve created <a href="http://simplesimple.co/currency/" title="Currency">a brand new app called Currency</a> for iOS which quickly converts over 160 different currencies. Currency converting apps are far from new, but up until now I&#8217;ve never seen one as polished as this. Everything has been considered: the fonts, the color scheme, the custom flag icons (inspired by nautical flags) and most important in my mind, the touch gestures. You enter a value, check the conversion rate, and when you&#8217;re done, you can swipe the numbers to the right which feels like you&#8217;re smashing them into a wall, which is how you clear the field. And if you didn&#8217;t mean to erase the value you simply swipe the field to the left and &#8220;resurrect&#8221; it. Effects like this just make the overall experience that much more enjoyable and Alex and Matt have nailed it. Watch the video below and you&#8217;ll totally see what I mean. </p>
<p>If you travel frequently (or are simply going on vacation abroad) and give a damn what your apps look and feel like, Currency is probably for you. You can get in the App Store by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currency-made-simple/id628148586?ls=1&#038;mt=8">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>Do you ever feel small? It&#8217;s easy to feel tiny in the shadow of a huge building or the in the wake of a weighty event. And there has been plenty of news about destructive actions for the past day or so here in the States, so let&#8217;s look at some construction. The scale of construction and engineering projects is frequently enormous, but the work is still carried out by the hands of workers who aren&#8217;t bigger or smaller than the rest of us. Sure, those hands may be steering gargantuan trucks or controlling cranes so large they easily dwarf the trucks, but realizing large projects is about people our size working to build something. These photos are of the people who get it done.</p>
<p><span id="more-58235"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//02_ENR01142013_PCON_lg.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58238" alt="Engineering New Report Construction Photos " src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//02_ENR01142013_PCON_lg.jpg" width="800" height="532" /></a></p>
<p>They are part of <a href="http://enr.construction.com/opinions/viewpoint/2013/0114-enr8217s-2012-the-year-in-construction-photo-contest-winners.asp">Engineering News-Record&#8217;s &#8216;Year in Construction&#8217;</a> from this past year. The interface to navigate the photos is a little cumbersome, but the point is the photos, a small portion of which are shown above and below. These are fantastic construction photos and my favorites tend to highlight the folks who aren&#8217;t frequently highlighted. If architects have the vision, and engineers the know-how, then it&#8217;s the workers who have the hands. It&#8217;s strange to think of the handiwork that goes into realizing these projects (all the welding, tedious rebar tying, etc.) and how traces of construction workers tend to disappear as a project nears completion. While the traces are out of sight, they&#8217;re often lurking just beneath the surface. Hiding behind the drywall and drop ceilings of finished projects you&#8217;ll find the handprints, dropped tools, and the food wrappers of people you&#8217;ll never know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-10.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58226" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-1.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58217" /></p>
<p>The older I get the more I gravitate toward plants. It started about two years ago when I visited Joshua Tree for the first time. While hiking around the desert I began to notice the variety of plant life, and how a lot of it looked like things you would find under the ocean. The plants reminded me of seaweed, of urchins&#8230; and this was a crazy concept to me, that the desert and the ocean would have plants that could look so similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/encyclopedia-of-flowers" title="Encyclopedia of Nature"><em>Encyclopedia of Nature</em></a>, a new book released by Lars Müller Publishers, explores the breathtaking floral arrangements by <a href="http://azumamakoto.com/" title="Makoto Azuma">Makoto Azuma</a>. You could describe Azuma with the general term of a flower arranger, but that would be a serious over-simplification. Azuma takes the idea of flower arranging and turns the potentially mundane practice and completely flips it. He takes flowers and plants and creates what can only be called works of art.</p>
<p><span id="more-58193"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-2.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58218" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-6.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58222" /></p>
<p>Azuma&#8217;s ability to combine plants and flowers is uncanny, creating otherworldly creations that have touches of sensuality and mystery to them. His goal with arranging, a Neo-Ikebana as it&#8217;s been called, is to truly appreciate the significant role they play in our lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>The true glory of flowers cannot be reduced to that time of life&#8217;s blossoming, when they reach their peak commercial value. Which is why my arrangements include roots and bulbs, nameless weeds, or fifty-year-old pine bonsai. Plants whither and decay. It is their essence and their drama.</p></blockquote>
<p>These ideas are further reenforced by the brilliant photos by Shunsuke Shiinoki, who Azuma has been working with since 2002 when they opened a haute-coutre flower shop in Ginza. Because of the transient and fleeting nature of plants Shiinoki&#8217;s photos helps Azuma&#8217;s creations live on, potentially, forever. His photos are filled with an amazing amount of depth and color. The brightest of greens and reds are always enveloped in a rich blackness that sets an intense mood to each photograph. </p>
<p>The book itself is perfectly straightforward, that&#8217;s with some help from acclaimed designer Kenya Hara, with a foreword from Azuma, and the book itself being split into five sections: Whole, Flock, Coexistence, Hybrid, and Appearance. These sections have different styles of arrangements, such as the Hybrid section, which is about plants that have been crossbred, or artificially tampered with to improve the beauty of the flowers. Impressively the book has nearly 500 pages of the most beautiful flower and plant arrangements you&#8217;ll ever see. I don&#8217;t think you even need to be a fan of flowers to enjoy this book as the imagery is so lush and exquisite.</p>
<p>You can order a copy of the book on Amazon by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3037783133/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=211189&#038;creative=373489&#038;creativeASIN=3037783133&#038;link_code=as3&#038;tag=thfoisbl-20">clicking here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/16/the-night-and-day-of-tokimonstas-half-shadows/5520e0878b8c82a9eff473707fe84603/" rel="attachment wp-att-58120"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//5520e0878b8c82a9eff473707fe84603-800x721.jpg" alt="TOKiMONSTA" width="800" height="721" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-58120" /></a></p>
<p>The beautiful thing with music is, that while getting what you expect is pretty great, when you get something you never expected it&#8217;s the best. That seems to be the case with <a href="http://tokimonstamusic.tumblr.com/">Jennifer Lee aka TOKiMONSTA</a>, the LA-based beatsmith, producer, and songwriter. The versatility of her style seems as random and spasmodic as her home city. One minute you&#8217;re in a chopped up hip hop song, the next a slow R&#038;B crooner, then a beat-heavy banger, and finally some electronic bliss pop. It&#8217;s almost a trademark of the whole Low End Theory/Brainfeeder crew. If you think you understand what&#8217;s happening, you might have missed the whole point.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re more than amped to see what is happening on her new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Half-Shadows/dp/B00CA88RXC">Half Shadows</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-57961"></span></p>
<p><iframe src='http://aff7ba5452b19562188d-94a4304dda9e3fda4b4cf2a2dd1232a0.r28.cf1.rackcdn.com/1366123351516d6357d3b4d2.99102620.html' width='650' height='250' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0'></iframe></p>
<p>With exceptional technique, <em>Half Shadows</em> oscillates between hip hop fire and synth sing-a-longs. &#8220;The Center&#8221; bangs away on a heavy bass end and a heavy harmonic end, drums crashing into the reverb. &#8220;The Force,&#8221; featuring the incomparable Kool Keith, begins with a tribal pulse and staccato drumming. But when it hits&#8230; you just want another piece of the piece. &#8220;Focused Chaos&#8221; emotes the funny funk of your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vloYvK2sK1g">16 bit Sega Genesis games</a> alongside the convulsive mania of Brainfeeder bangers. &#8220;Soul to &#8220;Seoul&#8221; builds into a swirling seduction. Yet &#8220;Foolish&#8221; might end up being the biggest keeper of the album, a perfect lead up to the inevitably beautiful summer. While the album has the occasional misstep, it provides more than enough beauty and variety to not just satiate your party brain but your romantic bone as well. </p>
