<p>You probably know by now that I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/">Nobrow Press</a>. Yet despite my enthusiasm for the indie publishers, it wasn&#8217;t until recently that I got to check out their self-titled flagship magazine. Already up to issue 8, each publication is a fantastic compendium of contemporary graphic art, bringing together a wonderful collection of comic creators and illustrators. </p>
<p><span id="more-57978"></span><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Nobrow-8-Sam-Bosma.jpg" alt="Nobrow 8 - Sam Bosma" width="800" height="569" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57994" /></p>
<p>Each issue is based around a theme, with issue 8 taking &#8216;Hysteria&#8217; as its starting point. It&#8217;s a rather fitting theme for the times we live in and a wonderful inspiration for the artists involved. It&#8217;s exciting reading through and seeing so many unique interpretations. These range from ritualistic sacrifices (<a href="http://www.sbosma.com/">Sam Bosma</a> &#8211; above) to the challenges of life as a teenage girl (<a href="http://dilrajmann.tumblr.com/">Dilraj Mann</a> with Laura Halliwell &#8211; below) and everything in-between.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Nobrow-8-Dilraj-Mann-with-Laura-Halliwell.jpg" alt="Nobrow 8 - Dilraj Mann with Laura Halliwell" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57991" /></p>
<p>Divided into two parts, Nowbrow 8 is almost like two magazines rolled into one, with side one dedicated to comics and side two chock-full of drawings. It&#8217;s a great format and one which can introduce you to a broad range of talent. I was particularly taken by the work of <a href="http://www.emmanuellewalker.com/">Emmanuelle Walker</a>, <a href="http://nggraphics.blogspot.fr/">Nicolas Galkowski</a> and <a href="http://www.dharbin.com/">Dustin Harbin</a> (below). It was also nice to see some of my old favorites too such as <a href="http://lukepearson.com/">Luke Pearson</a>, <a href="http://martamonteiro.com/">Marta Monteiro</a> and <a href="http://philippajrice.com/">Philippa Rice</a>. </p>

<p>Printed with 4 spot colors, Nobrow 8 has an unusual color palette but it&#8217;s one which works quite well, tying the work of all 45 artist together nicely. It&#8217;s occasionally quite bold and brash, but considering the &#8216;hysteria&#8217; theme this works quite well. You can view more images from the magazine on the Nobrow website <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/11443">here</a>.</p>

<p>Nowbrow 8 is out now and features two front covers (one by <a href="http://www.maxbardin.com/index_en.html">Max Capdevila</a> and one by <a href="http://www.karinebernadou.com/">Karine Bernadou</a>). You can order your copy <a href="http://www.nobrow.net/11443">here</a>. </p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F3575843&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of great things about <a href="http://erbpfilm.com/film/upstreamcolor" title="Upstream Color"><em>Upstream Color</em></a>, a film that was written, directed, produced, stars, edited, and scored by Shane Caruth. I swear I&#8217;m not making any of that up. I purposely don&#8217;t know much about it, but I was able to find this interesting short description. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A man and woman are drawn together, entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism. Identity becomes an illusion as they struggle to assemble the loose fragments of wrecked lives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for dramatic situations set in sci-fi-esque worlds and this is definitely up my alley. While I don&#8217;t want to know more about the plot, I did dabble in the films score. A mentioned earlier Caruth also created all the music for the film, which when you listen to it that seems quite impressive. I&#8217;m no expert on film scores, but this sounds like something that can stand toe-to-toe with anything Hans Zimmer has done recently. </p>
<p>The music has eerie, mechanical tones interlaced with deep resonating cellos. It&#8217;s both familiar with and undercurrent that&#8217;s alien and machine-like. It reminds me a bit of Takagi Masakatsu&#8217;s music, only with a more orchestral root to it. If you&#8217;re into soundtracks I think this is certainly one not to miss. </p>

<p>Phenomenal UK illustrator <a href="http://matttaylordraws.tumblr.com/post/48125441108/rejoice-there-is-new-daft-punk-material-imminent">Matt Taylor has created a pair of amazing images featuring the Daft Punk</a> duo in their most recent incarnations and he&#8217;s done an incredible job. These aren&#8217;t official, he&#8217;s done them for fun, but someone should totally hire him to do more. You can see larger versions under the cut.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember how but a few weeks back I signed up for Quora&#8217;s weekly email and I must admit, it&#8217;s one of the only newsletters I look forward to getting in my inbox. With this week&#8217;s mailing there was a rather broad but juicy question: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Photography/What-is-the-most-amazing-photo-you-have-ever-taken">What is the most amazing photo you have ever taken?</a></p>
<p>My favorite answer came from photographer <a href="http://www.kentmiller.com/" title="Kent Miller">Kent Miller</a>  on how he took the photo above: A Boeing 747 flying right over the heads of beachgoers in St. Maartens. And no, that&#8217;s not Photoshopped.</p>
<blockquote><p>I focused on people reacting to the scene rather than the scene itself. I shot people getting blown off their feet under the aircraft. I shot people running from the spit of the sand blasting on their flesh. There were a lot of jetliners coming in that day, and a lot of commuter jets. I left enough room over their heads to keep the planes in the background. I was just really lucky to be in that place and time when the 747 Jumbo Jet came in. I think we felt like we were in a very safe place to make that picture then, but when it came in, it was like a shock. It took my breath away. It was like, &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the rest of Kent&#8217;s answer directly by <a href="http://www.quora.com/Photography/What-is-the-most-amazing-photo-you-have-ever-taken/answer/Kent-Miller-2">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//currency-converter-app-2a.png" alt="Currency - A precisely designed currency converter app for iPhone" width="800" height="667" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58291" /></p>
<p>Converting currency in foreign countries can be tricky and frustrating. Conversion rates can shift quickly, it can be embarrassing figuring out numbers in your head, and you don&#8217;t want to get fleeced by a local merchant who can tell you&#8217;re not certain. Well, <a href="http://dribbble.com/alexpenny" title="Alex Penny">Alex Penny</a> and <a href="http://www.mattdavenport.net/" title="Matt Davenport">Matt Davenport</a> may have come up with the best solution for these dilemmas.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve created <a href="http://simplesimple.co/currency/" title="Currency">a brand new app called Currency</a> for iOS which quickly converts over 160 different currencies. Currency converting apps are far from new, but up until now I&#8217;ve never seen one as polished as this. Everything has been considered: the fonts, the color scheme, the custom flag icons (inspired by nautical flags) and most important in my mind, the touch gestures. You enter a value, check the conversion rate, and when you&#8217;re done, you can swipe the numbers to the right which feels like you&#8217;re smashing them into a wall, which is how you clear the field. And if you didn&#8217;t mean to erase the value you simply swipe the field to the left and &#8220;resurrect&#8221; it. Effects like this just make the overall experience that much more enjoyable and Alex and Matt have nailed it. Watch the video below and you&#8217;ll totally see what I mean. </p>
<p>If you travel frequently (or are simply going on vacation abroad) and give a damn what your apps look and feel like, Currency is probably for you. You can get in the App Store by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currency-made-simple/id628148586?ls=1&#038;mt=8">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>Do you ever feel small? It&#8217;s easy to feel tiny in the shadow of a huge building or the in the wake of a weighty event. And there has been plenty of news about destructive actions for the past day or so here in the States, so let&#8217;s look at some construction. The scale of construction and engineering projects is frequently enormous, but the work is still carried out by the hands of workers who aren&#8217;t bigger or smaller than the rest of us. Sure, those hands may be steering gargantuan trucks or controlling cranes so large they easily dwarf the trucks, but realizing large projects is about people our size working to build something. These photos are of the people who get it done.</p>
<p><span id="more-58235"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//02_ENR01142013_PCON_lg.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58238" alt="Engineering New Report Construction Photos " src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//02_ENR01142013_PCON_lg.jpg" width="800" height="532" /></a></p>
<p>They are part of <a href="http://enr.construction.com/opinions/viewpoint/2013/0114-enr8217s-2012-the-year-in-construction-photo-contest-winners.asp">Engineering News-Record&#8217;s &#8216;Year in Construction&#8217;</a> from this past year. The interface to navigate the photos is a little cumbersome, but the point is the photos, a small portion of which are shown above and below. These are fantastic construction photos and my favorites tend to highlight the folks who aren&#8217;t frequently highlighted. If architects have the vision, and engineers the know-how, then it&#8217;s the workers who have the hands. It&#8217;s strange to think of the handiwork that goes into realizing these projects (all the welding, tedious rebar tying, etc.) and how traces of construction workers tend to disappear as a project nears completion. While the traces are out of sight, they&#8217;re often lurking just beneath the surface. Hiding behind the drywall and drop ceilings of finished projects you&#8217;ll find the handprints, dropped tools, and the food wrappers of people you&#8217;ll never know.</p>

<p>The older I get the more I gravitate toward plants. It started about two years ago when I visited Joshua Tree for the first time. While hiking around the desert I began to notice the variety of plant life, and how a lot of it looked like things you would find under the ocean. The plants reminded me of seaweed, of urchins&#8230; and this was a crazy concept to me, that the desert and the ocean would have plants that could look so similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/encyclopedia-of-flowers" title="Encyclopedia of Nature"><em>Encyclopedia of Nature</em></a>, a new book released by Lars Müller Publishers, explores the breathtaking floral arrangements by <a href="http://azumamakoto.com/" title="Makoto Azuma">Makoto Azuma</a>. You could describe Azuma with the general term of a flower arranger, but that would be a serious over-simplification. Azuma takes the idea of flower arranging and turns the potentially mundane practice and completely flips it. He takes flowers and plants and creates what can only be called works of art.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-2.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58218" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Encyclopedia-of-Nature-photo-6.jpg" alt="Encyclopedia of Flowers - Flower Works by Makoto Azuma, photographed by Shunsuke Shiinoki" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58222" /></p>
<p>Azuma&#8217;s ability to combine plants and flowers is uncanny, creating otherworldly creations that have touches of sensuality and mystery to them. His goal with arranging, a Neo-Ikebana as it&#8217;s been called, is to truly appreciate the significant role they play in our lives.</p>
<blockquote><p>The true glory of flowers cannot be reduced to that time of life&#8217;s blossoming, when they reach their peak commercial value. Which is why my arrangements include roots and bulbs, nameless weeds, or fifty-year-old pine bonsai. Plants whither and decay. It is their essence and their drama.</p></blockquote>
<p>These ideas are further reenforced by the brilliant photos by Shunsuke Shiinoki, who Azuma has been working with since 2002 when they opened a haute-coutre flower shop in Ginza. Because of the transient and fleeting nature of plants Shiinoki&#8217;s photos helps Azuma&#8217;s creations live on, potentially, forever. His photos are filled with an amazing amount of depth and color. The brightest of greens and reds are always enveloped in a rich blackness that sets an intense mood to each photograph. </p>
<p>The book itself is perfectly straightforward, that&#8217;s with some help from acclaimed designer Kenya Hara, with a foreword from Azuma, and the book itself being split into five sections: Whole, Flock, Coexistence, Hybrid, and Appearance. These sections have different styles of arrangements, such as the Hybrid section, which is about plants that have been crossbred, or artificially tampered with to improve the beauty of the flowers. Impressively the book has nearly 500 pages of the most beautiful flower and plant arrangements you&#8217;ll ever see. I don&#8217;t think you even need to be a fan of flowers to enjoy this book as the imagery is so lush and exquisite.</p>
<p>You can order a copy of the book on Amazon by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3037783133/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=211189&#038;creative=373489&#038;creativeASIN=3037783133&#038;link_code=as3&#038;tag=thfoisbl-20">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>The beautiful thing with music is, that while getting what you expect is pretty great, when you get something you never expected it&#8217;s the best. That seems to be the case with <a href="http://tokimonstamusic.tumblr.com/">Jennifer Lee aka TOKiMONSTA</a>, the LA-based beatsmith, producer, and songwriter. The versatility of her style seems as random and spasmodic as her home city. One minute you&#8217;re in a chopped up hip hop song, the next a slow R&#038;B crooner, then a beat-heavy banger, and finally some electronic bliss pop. It&#8217;s almost a trademark of the whole Low End Theory/Brainfeeder crew. If you think you understand what&#8217;s happening, you might have missed the whole point.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re more than amped to see what is happening on her new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Half-Shadows/dp/B00CA88RXC">Half Shadows</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-57961"></span></p>
<p><iframe src='http://aff7ba5452b19562188d-94a4304dda9e3fda4b4cf2a2dd1232a0.r28.cf1.rackcdn.com/1366123351516d6357d3b4d2.99102620.html' width='650' height='250' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0'></iframe></p>
<p>With exceptional technique, <em>Half Shadows</em> oscillates between hip hop fire and synth sing-a-longs. &#8220;The Center&#8221; bangs away on a heavy bass end and a heavy harmonic end, drums crashing into the reverb. &#8220;The Force,&#8221; featuring the incomparable Kool Keith, begins with a tribal pulse and staccato drumming. But when it hits&#8230; you just want another piece of the piece. &#8220;Focused Chaos&#8221; emotes the funny funk of your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vloYvK2sK1g">16 bit Sega Genesis games</a> alongside the convulsive mania of Brainfeeder bangers. &#8220;Soul to &#8220;Seoul&#8221; builds into a swirling seduction. Yet &#8220;Foolish&#8221; might end up being the biggest keeper of the album, a perfect lead up to the inevitably beautiful summer. While the album has the occasional misstep, it provides more than enough beauty and variety to not just satiate your party brain but your romantic bone as well. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58111" rel="attachment wp-att-58111"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58111" alt="Matt Leines &quot;Frank&quot;" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//matt-leines-frank.jpg" width="800" height="1069" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mattleinesart.tumblr.com/">Matt Leines</a> doesn&#8217;t have the most elaborate bio. His website explains that he&#8217;s an artist from New Jersey currently living in Brooklyn—that&#8217;s it. It doesn&#8217;t shout about his already impressive roster of accolades or map out his course study as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design. But his work has shown steadily all over the world since 2002, and his latest show, <em>Hyperbolic</em>, opened last week at Brooklyn&#8217;s <a href="http://www.beginnings-nyc.com/upcoming">Beginnings</a> gallery. Besides all that, his surrealist paintings continue to shock and awe.</p>
<p><span id="more-58108"></span></p>
<p>A mishmash of imagery seemingly referencing everything from Picasso and Pollock to Ettore Sottsass and the Memphis Group design movement, his work is intricate, amusing, and deftly beautiful. Though his contemporary subjects are often abstract and vaguely human, he uses techniques like marbling to give texture and dimension. There are hints of tribal art and 1980s motifs, and every painting is telling a story you can&#8217;t quite comprehend. He infuses each of his pieces with color, movement, and a weird kind of whimsy that I find both arresting and uplifting. Thus, if you&#8217;re in the NYC area, check out his show in <a href="http://www.beginnings-nyc.com/">Greenpoint</a> or visit his <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/mattleines?ref=seller_info">Etsy store</a> for more, including the 2008 monograph, <em>You Are Forgiven, </em>which chronicles the bulk of his work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//the-fox-is-black-night-mode.jpg" alt="Night Mode on The Fox Is Black" width="800" height="566" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58256" /></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been making improvements to TFIB over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been wondering why websites aren&#8217;t more responsive to people? Why should they remain static and not bend to our needs? In that way I&#8217;ve been trying to think of the site more like an app and less like a blog. So I decided to take some inspiration from <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios" title="Twitteriffic">Twitteriffic</a>, my go-to Twitter reading app who&#8217;ve done an incredible job of making my tweet reading experience even better. They&#8217;ve got this great feature where you can shift the app to a dark theme, which makes it a lot easier to read at night. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take this concept and bring it to TFIB, which I&#8217;m simply calling Night Mode. At 7pm the site will switch themes, turning to an inverted version of itself (but not so dark that you can&#8217;t see the fox). At 7am, Night Mode switches off and the site goes back to normal. This is based on your computers clock, so it doesn&#8217;t matter where in the world you are. My hope is that you&#8217;ll have a better reading experience with this change. There&#8217;s nothing worse than reading a website that&#8217;s too damn bright when you&#8217;re laying in bed, whether it&#8217;s late at night or early in the morning.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to let me know if you like it this new feature or not. You can hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/thefoxisblack">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151634545427216&#038;set=a.10150795334382216.477873.98861597215&#038;type=1">on Facebook</a> and let me know either way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//shigeru-ban.jpg" alt="Shigeru Ban" width="800" height="574" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58204" /></p>
<p>Came across <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/04/07/people/peoples-architect-shigeru-ban-combines-permanence-and-paper/">this interview by Edan Corkill with Shigeru Ban</a> in which they discuss his growing up, his education at Cooper Union, and his love of paper tubes. Before this article I honestly had no idea that cardboard could be so damn durable. You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Ban#Materiality_of_Paper">his practical uses of paper tubes on his Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this piece though is at the end when Shigeru explains what&#8217;s important to him in regards to architecture.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What’s the most important thing when making architecture?</strong></p>
<p>Even something that I intended as a temporary structure, like a paper church I made in Kobe in 1995, can end up being permanent. That church was relocated to Taiwan in 2006, after they had an earthquake there, and it still exists today. Ultimately, what determines the permanence of a building is not the wealth of the developer or the materials that are used, but the simple question of whether or not the resulting structure is supported — loved — by the people.</p>
<p>Architecture made simply for profit — even if it’s in concrete — is in fact temporary. Commercial architecture is precisely that. If it is made for making money then eventually some other developer will come along and try to make more money out of it by demolishing it and rebuilding it. And it just repeats. In that way concrete is in fact temporary.</p>
<p>However, if you make architecture that is loved by the people, then regardless of what it is made of, it will be kept.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/earthpix/status/323628873684226049">an interesting tweet from EarthPix</a> with one of the most beautiful photos I&#8217;d ever seen. A stunning sliver of moon looming giant over a minuscule sun, beautifully reflected in the crystal water below. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//hideaway-inya-nielsen.jpg" alt="&#039;Hideaway&#039; by Inga Neilsen" width="1024" height="670" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58149" /></p>
<p>I was stunned by this photo and how beautiful earth can be&#8230; but perhaps it&#8217;s too good to be true?</p>
<p><span id="more-58086"></span></p>
<p>As it turns out the image above isn&#8217;t a photo at all, but <a href="http://gate-to-nowhere.deviantart.com/art/Hideaway-61855403?q=gallery%3Agate-to-nowhere%2F820552&#038;qo=32">an amazing piece of art by Inga Nielsen called <em>Hideaway</em></a>. Inga clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>After someone spread it on the web as photograph of a &#8220;Sunset at the north pole&#8221;, this image became quite popular. It is of course not a photo and it does not show a place anywhere near the terrestrial north pole. Side note: the moon sets in that angle towards the horizon only close to the terrestrial equator. This is because Earth and Moon share the same plane of rotation around the sun.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how the Internet can take an image and run with it, losing all sense of what it truly is. <em>Hideaway</em> was posted back in 2007 and yet still it&#8217;s being posted as if it&#8217;s a real photo. Inga was able to render this piece with such clarity and realness that it&#8217;s probably fooled millions at this point. </p>
<p>Also, Phil Plait over at the Discover blog has a great breakdown of <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/an-unreal-picture-of-sunset-at-the-north-pole/#.UWw1WCv70fE">why the piece could never take place on Earth</a> which is pretty amusing and certainly worth a read.</p>

<p>These twisting twin bridges are the work of the Shanghai-based <a href="http://www.cagroup.cn/">CA Group</a>, but the photographs of the bridges are the work of photographer <a href="http://m-ra.es/">Montse Zamora</a>. The bridges look a little bit like the double helix of DNA to me, but I&#8217;m a bit of a science nerd and it turns out that they&#8217;re inspiration is more geographical than biological. The form of the bridges is a reference to mountains which are absent in this particular region of China. The shape also suits the structural system of the arched suspension bridge. What&#8217;s unique about this bridge is that the arches jump from side to side, making the bridge more dynamic while also ensuring that they have the same sort of formal legibility from more angles. And the angles of these bridges are captured very well by Montse.</p>
<p><span id="more-58090"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58132" alt="CA Group Xidayinggang Twin Bridges" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang.jpg" width="800" height="479" /></a></p>
<p>Although she is now based in Madrid, Montse did live in Shanghai after graduating from the Escuela Técnica Superior Arquitectura with a Master&#8217;s degree focused on Architectural Photography (her thesis <em>Ezra Stoller y Julius Shulman: Dos miradas enfrentadas </em>contrasted the work of the two folks who might be the most widely celebrated photographers of modernism.) And her photographs of the two tripple-span, sextuple-arch bridges at Xidayinggang are simultaneously straightforward and dramatic. Seen rising from a field of bright and optimistic flowers, the graceful arcs of the bridge start to resemble the mountains the designers describe as inspiration, varied and complex in a way that natural features often are. We can only hope that these mountain bridges will stand long and are built well; built to withstand the environment that would see them crumble as a result of natural forces, corruption or a debilitating <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/29/160231137/chinese-blame-failed-infrastructure-on-corruption">collusion of both</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been two years since celebrated singer-songwriting Samuel Beam, aka <a href="http://www.ironandwine.com/ghostonghost">Iron and Wine</a>, has released a studio album. The latest, <em>Ghost on Ghost</em>, arrives tomorrow, and we&#8217;re already fans per the live stream <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/08/grace-for-saints-and-ramblers-a-new-song-from-iron-and-wine/">first listen</a> last week. We can attest that it&#8217;s a satisfyingly exuberant and uplifting new direction for Beam and his band, and it&#8217;s amplified by the album&#8217;s first music video for the song &#8220;Joy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="http://hayleymorris.net/">Hayley Morris</a>, we&#8217;re taken on a colorful journey through a blossoming wilderness. Cow skulls sprout flowers while dried flowers explode in shades of neon. It&#8217;s a stunning piece of animation created by projecting hand-painted watercolor animations into stop-motion landscapes. Morris was inspired by a particular lyric from the song—&#8221;deep inside the heart of this crazy mess, I&#8217;m only calm when I get lost within your wilderness&#8221;—and chose to visually show how love transforms and colors the world around you.</p>
<p>Aside from interpreting the romance of the lyrics in a beautifully literal way, the animation itself stands alone as a depiction of what it is to feel joy. &#8220;[It's] a song about love and taking a moment to realize how someone can vastly change how you perceive yourself and the world around you,&#8221; Morris says. &#8220;My goal was to have the viewer feel the effect through bursts of color, growth and transformation.&#8221;</p>

<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41002/painting-place-an-interview-with-fleurette-west/">Painting Place: An Interview With Fleurette West</a></big><br />
Artist Fleurette West is really inspired by her surroundings. Her paintings are about place but do not represent how the place looks: she represents how the place feels. She ties all of this together in ways that are bright and abstract and really do give a feel for a part of town. Her story of getting to art through behavioral sciences is fascinating, too.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41004/helping-urs-fischer-at-moca/">Helping Urs Fischer At MOCA</a></big><br />
Urs Fischer has a huge MOCA show coming up. What is he doing for it? He had tons of LA people make clay things for him. Not just little things: people went batshit insane and made huge, crazy clay pieces for him. We went and helped him out and, boy, was it wild. You may see some familiar items at the show, namely a black fox.</p>

LACMA&#8217;s entry into the new, not-as-hyped Pacific Standard Time architecture show is a collection of Shindler furniture painted bright pink and organized like they are in an invisible house. What is this? Stephen Prina&#8217;s <i>As He Remembered It</i>, a show based on his seeing a bright pink Schindler desk in an office window on La Brea that obviously did not belong. It&#8217;s a really special show.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41408/duc-kein-has-a-jacket-for-you/">Duc Kien US Jean Jackets</a></big><br />
Duc Kien US is hoping to be your new jean maker. How are they getting their start? With a really sleek jean jacket that is super, super streamlined and very nice. They&#8217;re currently Kickstarting the effort and have already gotten lots of accolades, namely by way of GQ. If you are looking for a light jacket, consider purchasing this affordable, high-end item.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41409/symmetria/">Symmetía</a></big><br />
Graphic designer Victoria Macey is inspired by what she sees in Los Angeles. What does this mean? She has been taking imagery that surrounds her and turning it into very neat, abstract patterns. It&#8217;s a very simple concept and the link between pattern and reference is balanced so delicately that you have to pay attention to them. We love these!</p>
<p>Some items that barely missed the cut: we have a new series called <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/category/where-shall-we-meet/">Where Shall We Meet?</a> that suggests meeting and working places in LA and one of our contributors found a <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/40992/unseen-la-a-hidden-noguchi-museum/">hidden Noguchi museum</a> in Costa Mesa.</p>

<p>The last time I wrote about an endangered building it was <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/01/06/should-neutras-cyclorama-be-demolished/">Richard Neutra&#8217;s 1963 Cyclorama at Gettysburg</a>. After years of legal battle, the 50 year old building was demolished just last month. It&#8217;s a disappointing outcome, but the building did stand for five decades which is longer than many buildings. Sadly, one of those buildings that will not make it to the fifty year mark is the <a href="http://www.folkartmuseum.org/">American Folk Art Museum</a> by <a href="http://www.twbta.com/">Tod Williams and Billie Tsien</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-58029"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58037" alt="American Folk Art Museum Tod Williams Billie Tsien Demolition MoMA" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg" width="800" height="619" /></a></p>
<p>Completed just twelve years ago, the distinctive and small museum sits next to MoMA on 53rd street in Manhattan. It won several awards upon its completion and has a remarkable facade that uses folded planes of a bronze alloy called tombasil in a way which looks hand-forged. MoMA bought the building a couple of years ago after the Folk Art Museum ran into financial hot water which forced the institution to pack up the folk arts and relocate. So after years of mulling over what was to become of the funny little building next to it, MoMA announced this week <a href="http://www.designboom.com/architecture/american-folk-art-museum-destined-for-demolition/">they plan to tear it down</a>. Why? According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/arts/design/moma-to-raze-ex-american-folk-art-museum-building.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">an article in the NYT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MoMA officials said the building’s design did not fit their plans because the opaque facade is not in keeping with the glass aesthetic of the rest of the museum. The former folk museum is also set back farther than MoMA’s other properties, and the floors would not line up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m biased or just annoyed, but when I read the snippet above, I think &#8220;so MoMA is tearing this building down because they can&#8217;t see through the front of it?&#8221; I know it&#8217;s more complicated than that, but Folk Art Museum&#8217;s former building deserves better rationale for it&#8217;s demolition than &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t match.&#8221; The bigger problem to me isn&#8217;t that the museum officials can&#8217;t see through bronze alloy, but that they can&#8217;t see or imagine a future where they would protect an architecturally significant project in their possession. If the leadership of MoMA is being this myopic about the expansion of their campus, what other terrible decisions are they making when it comes to doing what museums are supposed to do?</p>

<p>For the last two days Kyle and I have been hanging out in Las Vegas. Yesterday was my mother&#8217;s 60th birthday and she wanted to spend it here. I haven&#8217;t been here for about 5 or 6 years, but in that short period of time things have changed quite a bit. It&#8217;s more polished, less kid-friendly, but essentially how it was. We ended up staying at the <a href="http://www.arialasvegas.com/" title="Aria Resort and Casino">Aria</a>, an extremely contemporary casino that was opened in 2009. It actually fits me and Kyle quite well, eschewing the kitch of most Las Vegas hotels.</p>
<p>Situated next to the Aria though is essentially a super fancy mall called <a href="http://www.crystalsatcitycenter.com/" title="Crystals at City Center">Crystals at City Center</a>. There are shops from all the major fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Gucci, Saint Laurent, etc. It&#8217;s Rodeo Drive contained in a beautiful, Daniel Libeskind designed building (which also happens to be LEED+ certified). Walking around the shops I started to take notice of just how on-point everything was, how all the details were done right. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a surprise by any means, but when you look at these shops from purely a design perspective it&#8217;s actualyl quite fascinating. </p>
<p><span id="more-58048"></span></p>
<p>Below are a series of photos I took of the Crystals, the interiors and exteriors of shops, and so on. I found a lot of inspiration in these, so I thought I&#8217;d post share them. Perhaps you&#8217;ll find something that piques your interest as well?</p>

<p>Last year the fashion designer <a href="http://www.rebeccatorres.co.uk/">Rebecca Torres</a> collaborated with illustrator <a href="http://www.saskiapomeroy.com">Saskia Pomeroy</a> to create a bold and brash collection for women. Her vision was to create a line which drew inspiration from her signature style whilst also captured the raw essence of native, ancient and decorative arts. Fortunately Saskia was the perfect partner to see that vision come to life.</p>

<p>The Glasgow-born duos work is filled with bold and bright colors. Combing modern fabrics and a daring brashness, this collection is a wonderful combination of both Torres and Pomeroy&#8217;s unique styles. The photographs by <a href="http://www.joelandmattias.com/">Joel &#038; Mattias</a> also do a great job of capturing the vibrancy and playfulness of the collection. </p>
<p>You can check out more work from Rebecca Torress <a href="http://www.rebeccatorres.co.uk/">here</a> and Saskia Pomeroy <a href="http://www.saskiapomeroy.com">here</a>.</p>
