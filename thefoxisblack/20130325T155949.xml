				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//siggi-odds-1.jpg" alt="Siggi Odds" width="800" height="1107" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56484" />
<p>While I was visiting Reykjavik, hands down the coolest person I met was <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/" title="Siggi Odds">Siggi Odds</a>. Siggi is an artist and designer who&#8217;s style is heavily influenced by Native American art and nature itself, with a touch of Matisse thrown in. It&#8217;s both contemporary and abstract at the same time, with lots of energy and color to everything he does. Siggi&#8217;s work feels a lot like what the vibe of Iceland is, and I think Icelanders agree. He recently was chosen to have <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/Puffin-Stamp">his work put on a national stamp</a>, celebrating one of the most beautiful birds their country has, the puffin. Like Iceland, Siggi&#8217;s work ranges from fine art to branding and identity.</p>
<p><span id="more-56482"></span></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//KEX_logo_cmyk-10_o.gif" alt="KEX Hostel branding" width="905" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56716" />
<p>One of my favorite examples of this is <a href="http://www.siggiodds.com/KEX-Hostel" title="Siggi Odds - KEX Hostel">the branding he did for KEX Hostel</a>, essentially the Ace Hotel of Reykjavik.</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea for this identity was to represent the many different types of people from all over the world that come to KEX Hostel with typography and early 20th century visuals. The identity has 8 different logos, created from mostly bespoke type designed especially for this project, with a few exceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve included a few more examples of his work below which shows you the immense range of work he makes. I&#8217;d highly suggest paying him a visit and seeing what else he&#8217;s made.</p>

<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Screenshot-from-Patrick-Watson-Blackwind-3.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Patrick Watson - Blackwind" width="800" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56504" />
<p>Late last year the Canadian singer-songwriter <a href="http://www.adventuresinyourownbackyard.com/">Patrick Watson</a> ran a competition asking fans to create a music-video for his track &#8220;Blackwind&#8221;. The entries were really impressive and it&#8217;s incredible to see the quality of fan-made videos being made. Last month he finally <a href="http://genero.tv/blog/2013/patrick-watson-blackwind-video/">announced the winner as Chloe Poirier-Sauve</a> but also gave special mention to six other entries; one of which is this video created by the South-Korean director <a href="http://www.deeshin.com/">Dee Shin</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-56494"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/58775828?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="800" height="340" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Screenshot-from-Patrick-Watson-Blackwind-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Patrick Watson - Blackwind" width="800" height="339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56502" />
<p>Dee Shin&#8217;s video is beautifully shot and it is filled with subtle motifs. It&#8217;s the type of video that demands multiple viewings, as new patterns emerge with every watch and visual links become clearer. The promo follows a young artist as he sets off on adventure, leaving the comfort of his own home behind. Dee Shin&#8217;s video feels dreamlike and magical and it marks her out as a real talent to watch. </p>
<p>&#8220;Blackwind&#8221; is taken from Patrick Watson&#8217;s fourth studio album <em>Adventures in Your Own Backyard </em>. It was released last year on Domino Records and you can buy a copy of it <a href="http://www.dominorecordco.com/uk/albums/27-01-12/adventures-in-your-own-backyard/">here</a>. </p>

<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//s-s-s-beak-and-claw-2.jpg" alt="s / s / s - Beak &amp; Claw - Sufjan Stevens, Son Lux, Serengeti" width="800" height="253" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56722" />
<p><iframe width="400" height="100" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3167510414/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=eb374f/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"><a href="http://anticon.bandcamp.com/album/beak-claw">Beak &amp; Claw by s / s / s</a></iframe></p>
<p>Collaborations are always interesting, especially when they involve individuals who you wouldn&#8217;t image working together. The EP above is the culmination of three different but equally talented artists: <a href="http://music.sufjan.com/" title="Sufjan Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="http://sonlux.tumblr.com/" title="Son Lux">Son Lux</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/serengetidave" title="Serengeti">Serengeti</a>. I don&#8217;t know how I missed this, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention it before either.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stranger things have happened, but rarely do they make such beautiful music. The three esses that comprise the enigmatically titled s / s / s are as follows: Sufjan Stevens, he of the Fifty States Project and various baroque folk-pop opuses; Serengeti, the wry-witted rapper known for in-depth on-record character studies; and Son Lux, silken-voiced singer, studio wizard and singular beatsmith. The project’s roots reach back to 2009’s Dark Was the Night compilation, where Stevens and Geti met over a Buck 65 remix of a song written by psych-folkie Castanets. Continuing in the spirit of (unlikely) collaboration, the pair passed beats and raps back and forth, eventually enlisting Son Lux to dream Beak &#038; Claw into fruition. </p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-56720"></span></p>
<p>Listening to the EP you certainly get a sense of the musical density that&#8217;s been packed in. It reminds me quite a bit of Sufjan&#8217;s last album <a href="http://music.sufjan.com/album/the-age-of-adz" title="The Age of Adz by Sufjan Stevens"><em>The Age of Adz</em></a> which went all over the place stylistically, but somehow it all made perfect sense. What you&#8217;ve got with this EP, called <em>Beak &#038; Claw</em>, is the culmination of an avant garde indie pop artist, an experimental electronic producer and a talented rapper who, when combined, actually make something quite remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>While this momentous EP comprises a mere four songs, each covers an immense stretch of sonic territory and emotional range. At six minutes, “Museum Day” may be the most adventurous and also the most satisfying, opening with a swath of AutoTuned heartache courtesy of Stevens, cresting with the darkly detailed raps of Geti, and closing in a hail of crashing cymbals, orchestral glitch and haunted coos from Son Lux. “Beyond Any Doubt” exchanges that taut splendor for deeper grooves whose farthest-out moments bring to mind Shabazz Palaces’ cracked futurisms, albeit spiked with a falsetto’d pop hook. Fuzzy bass and industrial clang crash into lines about unrealized escapism and unpaid bills. </p></blockquote>
<p>I think this album is pretty amazing. I&#8217;m glad I <a href="http://rd.io/x/QFCKPlbuAQ/">found it on Rdio</a> so that I can listen to it on repeat now. Hopefully we get to hear more great tracks from s / s / s.</p>

<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39381/surrounded-by-art-material-an-interview-with-alex-israel/">Surrounded By Art Material: An Interview With Alex Israel</a></big><br />
Alex Israel is one of our favorite LA artists. He&#8217;s conceptual, he&#8217;s very LA, and he is all about abusing entertainment structures in Los Angeles to make art. It&#8217;s super fascinating and fun work. For our Featured Interview with the artist, we rode around Los Angeles with him as he took us from destination to destination that has had an influence on him. It was a lot of fun. Also, note that he has a really rad piece up at LAXART called <i><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39665/alex-israels-lens/">Lens</i></a> that is a giant lens from a pair of sunglasses blown up for us all to examine. It&#8217;s up through April 20.</p>
<p><span id="more-56611"></span></p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39384/get-ready-for-the-times/">Get Ready For The Times</big></a><br />
You know <a href="http://nationalforest.com/">National Forest</a>? Well, the guys of the super popular LA design firm have finally taken the next logical step for the brand: they&#8217;ve made a clothing line! The line is The Times and it is a t-shirt and sweatshirt brand (at the moment) that is very lighthearted and fun and thoroughly Californian. We&#8217;re mildly obsessed with their Cosmic Pretzel shirt..</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39554/heidis-salsa/">Heidi&#8217;s Salsa</big></a><br />
Luko Foods&#8217; Heidi&#8217;s Salsa is a homegrown LA salsa maker. They&#8217;re good at what they do and they certainly are a great entry into the LA salsa community which, really, is a big community. The best part? Their Mexi-American totally fun branding and packaging. We had to snag a jar because it looked so great. The contents could have tasted dreadfully OK&#8211;and we still would have loved it because it looks so cool. We highly recommend this!</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39682/river-mouth/"><em>River Mouth</em></big></a><br />
Friend and filmmaker Felipe Lima recently teamed up with locals Generic Surplus and Commes des Garçons to make a video about the brands&#8217; recent shoe collaboration. The result? A pretty tripped out South American wanderlust video that sees Lima&#8217;s brothers traveling the city and jungle and giving occasional sexy glimpses of the shoes. It&#8217;s extremely well done.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39766/spring-forward/"><i>Spring Forward</i></big></a><br />
The LA Kidrobot and LA Blu Dot stores have teamed up for a customized Munny art show that sees the funny little vinyl figures dressed for Spring. Set in the beautiful Blu Dot store/showroom, the pieces certainly reflect Spring in LA and the cultures that surround us. You know what else is there? Some Munnys we made! We suggest you check it out and take a peek at what went into making ours <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/39499/making-munnys-for-kidrobot-and-blu-dot/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine your home was wallpapered in the wildest array of mismatched stripes, and every time you entered it felt like a graphic designer&#8217;s fun house that danced with prism rhythm. This is the work of Dutch artist <a href="http://www.wiespreijde.com/">Wies Preijde</a>. A recent graduate of the Textile Design Department at the Royal Academy of Art (aka The Hague), Preijde specializes in textile design installations that truly defy imagination.</p>
<p><span id="more-56268"></span></p>
<p>Not only does she conceive and create the textile patterns herself, she then constructs angular rooms covered in the varying pastel stripes and shapes. Inspired by architecture and everyday objects, her work creates a flat, holographic experience for the observer that feels like an illusion. If you squint your eyes, it feels like you&#8217;re looking at the coolest wallpaper ever rather than meticulously designed fiber walls. I don&#8217;t know if this is Preijde&#8217;s intention, but I&#8217;d paper a whole house in the stuff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Christo_Balloon.jpg" alt="Christo&#039;s Big Air Package" width="800" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56616" />
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//christo-big-air-package.jpg" alt="Christo&#039;s Big Air Package" width="1050" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56628" />
<p>When I think of balloons, I usually think of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/a-helium-shortage-leads-to-fewer-balloons-in-the-sky.html?_r=0">helium</a> variety. They&#8217;re like brightly-colored bubbles of optimism that can only be held down to earth by white <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=secret-of-ribbon-curling">curling ribbon</a> and mailboxes. But balloons can be so much more. They come in all shapes and sizes, and the size of this balloon is&#8230; humongous.</p>
<p><span id="more-56612"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually the largest balloon in history, or the largest &#8220;inflated envelope&#8221; if you prefer, but this is a huge bag of gas no matter what you call it. I thought nothing could be bigger than the parachute we played with in P.E. when I was a second grader. Then, I saw a hot air balloon. And now I&#8217;m seeing <a href="http://christojeanneclaude.net/press/big-air-package">beautiful pictures of this installation by Christo</a>. It&#8217;s 90 meters tall! That&#8217;s nearly 300 feet, filling the <a href="http://www.gasometer.de/en/">Gasometer Oberhausen</a>&#8216;s dark-walled cylinder with taught, white fabric.</p>

<p>The best part of this work may be that you can go inside the installation. I can only imagine what it would feel like to stand inside and stare into the enormity of the space above. Folks lucky enough to find themselves around Oberhausen between now and the end of 2013 can let the giant white balloon swallow them, at least for a little bit, and experience the expanse for themselves. What&#8217;s clear is that this definitely isn&#8217;t a helium ballon. It isn&#8217;t the sad ballon trapped against a tall ceiling, or the sagging bunch of balloons tied a mailbox days after a birthday party. This is an exploration of space and light where the balloon is as tall as a football field and the ribbon tying the balloon in place is really steel cables to make sure the 5.3 tons of fabric don&#8217;t fall back down to earth before the party is over.</p>

<p>During stressful launches, NASA&#8217;s jet Propulsion Laboratory mission control <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/history-of-space/how-jpls-peanut-tradition-started-120815.htm">eats handfuls of peanuts for good luck</a>. Peanuts have been a part of space exploration for a long time. A dedicated reader passed along the above <em>Peanuts</em> <a href="http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20944/lot/136/">Snoopy astronaut action figure</a>: Snoopy was the NASA Manned Flight Awareness Program mascot (with the blessing of <em>Peanuts</em> creator Charles Schultz) and spoke out for flight safety. NASA even awards a &#8220;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/sfa/award_silver_snoopy.html">Silver Snoopy Award</a>&#8221; to employees and contractors for outstanding human flight safety achievements.</p>
<p>Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan of Apollo X named their Lunar Module (LM) Snoopy. The Command Service Module was named Charlie Brown.</p>
<p><span id="more-56630"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Apollo-X-Snoopy-Stafford.jpeg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Apollo-X-Snoopy-Stafford-800x597.jpeg" alt="Apollo X-Snoopy-Stafford" width="800" height="597" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-56649" /></a></p>
<p>The Apollo X mission was launched on May 18, 1969 and the mission was considered a dress rehearsal for the XI lunar landing later that year. Above, Mission Commander Stafford taps Snoopy&#8217;s nose for good luck.</p>
<p>This most lovable cartoon pup will always be a part of space exploration. Today a <a href="http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum16/HTML/000553.html">Snoopy statue sits in Kennedy Space Center&#8217;s Rocket Garden</a>. The statue was donated by the Schulz family in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Space Agency.</p>
<p>Pups will always have their place in space exploration. The first earthling to orbit the home planet was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika">Laika</a>, the first of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_space_dogs">Soviet space dogs</a>. Additionally, my all-time favorite NASA crew patch is for <a href="http://www.spacepatches.nl/sts_mis/STS69a.html">STS-69 Mission: Dog Crew II</a>. The crew had previously flown together on STS-53, the final space shuttle dedicated to the Department of Defense flight, and had named themselves the &#8220;dogs of war.&#8221; For STS-69, each crew member was assigned a &#8220;dog tag&#8221;: Commander David Walker &#8211; Red Dog; James Voss &#8211; Dogface; Ken Cockrell &#8211; Cujo; Michael  Gernhardt &#8211; Under Dog; and James Newman &#8211; Pluto. The Dog Crew II patch features a bulldog peering out from a doghouse shaped like the Space Shuttle. They even ate their pre-launch breakfast out of dog bowls.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//sts69-dog-crew-II-space-shuttle.jpg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//sts69-dog-crew-II-space-shuttle.jpg" alt="sts69- dog crew II - space shuttle" width="626" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56650" /></a></p>
<p>Who let the dogs out?</p>

<p>I stumbled upon these beautiful photos by <a href="http://dbarreto.com/" title="Daniel Barreto">Daniel Barreto</a> this morning and I thought they were rather lovely. Daniel is a Boston based illustrator, designer, photographer who does all sorts of interesting work. He even makes cute animated GIFs, like this one called <a href="http://dbarreto.com/#/post/45252606427/bearandmaths" title="Bear and Maths by Daniel Barreto">Bear and Maths</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-56636"></span></p>
<p>With this double exposure series I thought the balance between people and places was really well done. The interaction between both is interesting, like the clock tower in the bun of the girl in the image at the bottom, or the bokeh of the lights streaking through the face of the woman at the top. I think it&#8217;s also nice that the nightscapes are in color while the portraits are in a subdued sort of sepaia tone, providing a nice contrast between both.</p>
<p>Also be sure to check out <a href="http://dbarreto.com/#/post/45840536337/a-new-series-of-photo-manipulation-im-making">his new series where he&#8217;s combining houses and trees</a>, it&#8217;s super rad looking so far.</p>

<p>About an hour ago <a href="http://www.sigur-ros.co.uk/" title="Sigur Rós">Sigur Rós</a> dropped an email announcing the release of a new album called <em>Kveikur</em> which is being released on June 17/18. In addition they also released a new video to accompany it titled &#8220;Brennisteinn&#8221;, which takes Sigur Rós into a much harder musical territory. Like I&#8217;ve never heard Sigur Rós sound this bad ass before, it&#8217;s kind of amazing. Plus the video, directed by Andrew Huang, is also pretty gnarly. I think it&#8217;s about a ritual sacrifice and the end of the world, but you can make your own assumptions. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Brandon-Locher-Confuses-Reality-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Brandon-Locher-Confuses-Reality-1.jpg" alt="Brandon Locher Confuses Reality 1" width="800" height="602" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56342" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a little bit obsessed with the work of <a href="http://www.myideaoffun.org/myideaoffun.html">Brandon Locher</a> for a few months now. I first caught wind of him when avant-techno artist Holly Herndon <a href="https://twitter.com/hollyherndon/status/288117969333129218">Tweeted</a> about a sound piece Locher did involving phone conversations being looped and volleyed from one caller to another. The resulting sound piece&#8211;<i><a href="http://brandonlocher.bandcamp.com/album/conversations-revisited">Conversations (Revisited)</a></i>&#8211;represents a very simple wrinkle in reality caused by a simple mirroring of a phone conversation. Investigating Locher&#8217;s work, you find that he has a great talent for warping what is real: he is an artist obsessed with the circuitous.</p>
<p><span id="more-56341"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="100" style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3547871686/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"><a href="http://brandonlocher.bandcamp.com/album/conversations-revisited">Conversations (Revisited) by Brandon Locher</a></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.myideaoffun.org/brandonlocher/2012/index.html"><i>Mazes to the Motherlode XIV</a></i>, an illustration series of ink on paper drawings Locher did, furthers this confusing of reality by playing with planes. The pieces range from very delicate, almost precious, mazes to thick, knotted tangles of shapes. They look like galaxies of twists and turns and&#8211;like <i>Conversations</i> (above)&#8211;make very strange connections out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Locher is certainly an intriguing artist and he looks to be constantly working as you can see from his website. He&#8217;s definitely doing some very heady stuff and we&#8217;re totally feeling it. I recommend you peruse more of his work and, if you have the time, you <i>must</i> listen to <i>Conversations</i> in its entirety. It is a fairly hysterical, odd, and enveloping sound piece. Get more on Brandon <a href="http://www.myideaoffun.org/myideaoffun.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This is a delightful little animated promo for <a href="http://www.theleisuresociety.co.uk/">The Leisure Society&#8217;s</a> new single &#8220;Fight For Everyone&#8221; which is animated by the British animation studio <a href="http://www.persistentperil.com/">Persistent Peril</a>. The video shows the creation of a new planet by a giant blue hand but unfortunately things don&#8217;t go quite according to plan as chaos unfolds when evolution steps in. It&#8217;s a lot of fun, featuring great colors and a lot of playful whimsy. </p>
<p>The track is taken from the bands third album <em>Alone Aboard The Ark</em> which comes out on April 01st on <a href="http://www.fulltimehobby.co.uk/main/">Full Time Hobby</a>.</p>

<p>Gestalten&#8217;s latest architecture and design book, <a href="http://news.gestalten.com/node/25249"><em>Northern Delights</em></a>, poses the eternal question of what would go into the ultimate dream house. While they imagine the architecture might be Italian, the furniture Japanese, and the garden of British design, they agree wholeheartedly—and we concur—that the interior should be left to the Scandinavians. Longstanding leaders in a timeless, spare, and streamlined aesthetic unafraid to mix in bold color or the occasional touch of whimsy, <em>Northern Delights</em> explores both classic and newer designers from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland, as well as the latest in product and home design.</p>

<p>Nothing makes me happier than finding a science-centric video that is also well designed. And that&#8217;s what this video is: a mesmerizing and sleek animation that explains the very basics of DNA. What is it? Why is it such a big deal?</p>
<p><span id="more-56477"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/60747882?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff0179" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>These are the basics that you probably learned in high school biology and quickly forgot. But even for the most staunchly sciencephobic internet surfer, the video still offers three minutes of simple and fluid motion graphics. The graphics just happen animate the importance of DNA. Made by <a href="http://www.territorystudio.com/work/motion/?p=BBC-knowledge-DNA">Territory Studio</a> for the BBC, Director Will Samuel says that the style of the video was purposely nostalgic:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We needed to find a graphic style to communicate the beauty and intricacy of DNA. We wanted to create nostalgia; taking the audience back to the days of textbook diagrams and old science documentaries, such as Carl Sagan&#8217;s COSMOS and IBM’s POWER OF TEN (1977). Using the double helix circular theme as a core design we focused on form, movement and colour to create a consistent flow to the animation, drawing on references from nature, illustrating how DNA is the core to everything around us.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//DNA_Knowledge_DNA_02.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56478" alt="DNA Territory Studio BBC Knowledge Explainer " src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//DNA_Knowledge_DNA_02.jpg" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>DNA is often called the &#8220;blue print for life&#8221; (this video calls it the &#8220;instruction manual for life&#8221;) which wasn&#8217;t really clear to me until I understood that when folks say blueprint and instruction manual, they&#8217;re talking about the blueprints and instructions for the <em>production of all the proteins</em> in your body. That&#8217;s the life, it&#8217;s all the proteins that, as far as I can tell, make and pretty much do everything inside our bodies. And it&#8217;s all thanks to DNA, the smaller-than-microscopic twisting ladders that help build us all.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a sucker for weird, tripped out, colorful imagery&#8211;especially in motion. NYC-based multidisciplinary design studio <a href="http://www.eyebodega.com/">EyeBodega</a> is thoroughly all of those things, describing their work as &#8220;post-apocalyptic modernism.&#8221; With a focus on work for underground art and music culture, founders Rob Chabebe and Joe Perez have created a body of work spanning print, interactive, photography, and video that is jarring, glitchy, and perfect for the contemporary music scene it often finds itself in.</p>
<p><span id="more-56548"></span></p>
<p>While you could argue that EyeBodega&#8217;s work is hip to many contemporary design trends, their aesthetic is rooted in an experimental and challengingly abstract place that is very much their own. I love the way their visual landscape combines hallmarks of digital image manipulation with distorted, static-filled analog imagery.</p>
<p>Their work is being featured as part of an interactive video event at the MoMA on April 7th called <a href="http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2013/03/18/poprally-presents-abstract-currents-an-interactive-video-event">Abstract Currents</a>, centered around creating an environment for abstract animated content. Naturally they&#8217;re also on Vine, sending out <a href="https://vine.co/v/bp5L9p5nj7Q">6-second nuggets of audiovisual weirdness</a> just about every day. You can check out more of their work <a href="http://www.eyebodega.com/">here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//the-fox-is-black-10-travel-essentials.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black 10 Travel Essentials" width="800" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56469" />
<p>Traveling, especially to a place you may be unfamiliar with, is usually stressful. Unplanned delays or overly chatty neighbors on the plane; you&#8217;re never sure what you might end up with. That&#8217;s why I find it critical to pack just the right things, not too much and not too little, to make sure that you&#8217;re properly prepared. Below are the essential items I brought with me to Iceland that made sure I was connected, stylish, and most importantly, warm. </p>
<p><span id="more-56403"></span></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-alloy-incase-backpack.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Incase Alloy Backpack" width="800" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56415" />
<p><big>Incase Alloy Backpack</big><br />
A sturdy backpack is the number one thing on my list, and the Alloy from <a href="http://goincase.com" title="Incase">Incase</a> is my go-to when I&#8217;m traveling locally or abroad. I was tempted to go with a shoulder or tote bag but comfort over style ended up winning out. The Alloy&#8217;s padded shoulder straps and padding in the area where your back meets the bag means you&#8217;re protected in all the right places.</p>
<p>The critical thing that the Incase backpack has is it&#8217;s robust amount of storage. It&#8217;s not the biggest model in the Alloy collection but it still allowed me to carry my 17&#8243; MacBook Pro, iPad, magazines, notebooks, pens, chargers, camera, etc. With comfort and storage taken care of there&#8217;s also the fact that its incredibly weather proof. Iceland&#8217;s weather can be erratic, snowing and then sunny in a heartbeat, so I was fully prepared.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-barbour-bedale-jacket.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Barbour Bedale Jacket" width="800" height="1094" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56419" />
<p><big>Barbour Bedale Jacket</big><br />
The thing that saved my ass the most though was having the right jacket. I knew Reykjavik would be chilly, but the wind really kicked my sorry, California climate loving butt. Thankfully before I left I bought the <a href="http://www.barbour.com/mens/jackets-and-coats/wax/mens-classic/bedale-jacket" title="Barbour Bedale Jacket">Bedale jacket from Barbour</a>. The Bedale&#8217;s waxed cotton exterior helped keep out the rain and kept me feeling warm. It also has an extra tall collar which really helped fight against the harsh arctic winds. Lastly, it has a big pocket on the inside of the jacket which was the perfect place to store my travel wallet (more on that further down), which actually made me feel a little bit safer.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-generic-man-obey-giant-sneakers.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Generic Man/Obey Giant Sneakers" width="800" height="579" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56417" />
<p><big>Generic Surplus/Obey Giant Sneakers</big><br />
I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to have a car in Reykjavik, so I wanted to have a comfortable pair of shoes that could potentially take on the rain or the snow. I decided to travel with a pair of <a href="http://www.genericsurplus.com/" title="Generic Surplus">Generic Surplus</a> high tops which were made <a href="http://store.genericsurplus.com/obey.html" title="Generic Surplus / Obey Giant">in collaboration with Obey Giant</a>. These slick black leather sneakers are obviously functional but they also look great whether you&#8217;re trekking around the city, stomping around a field, or going out for a nice dinner. Just be sure to bring a show cleaning kit (you can see how dirty mine got), I recommend <a href="http://jasonmarkk.com/products/3691-4-oz-premium-kit" title="Jason Markk shoe cleaning kit">this kit from Jason Markk</a>.</p>

<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-nudie-jeans-2.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Nudie Jeans Slim Jim" width="800" height="587" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56447" />
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-nudie-jeans-1.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Nudie Jeans Slim Jim" width="800" height="440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56448" />
<p><big>Nudie Jeans Thin Finn</big><br />
When I was prepping for my trip I figured I would only bring one pair of jeans with me. So I took a trip to the Nudie Jeans showroom here in Los Angeles (<a href="http://www.laimyours.com/38998/the-los-angeles-nudie-jeans-showroom/">you can see the space and read more about it here</a>) and snagged <a href="http://shop.nudiejeans.com/en/product/1104/org-dry-twill" title="Nudie Jeans Thin Finn">a pair of their Thin Finns</a>. They&#8217;re made of organic raw denim, which at first scared me a bit, but they&#8217;ve got some stretch to them so they were actually super comfortable. Wearing these around Reykjavik was great because they fit perfectly and I always felt like I looked presentable, even if I had been to a night full of parties or trudging around the city all day.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-bellroy-wallet.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Bellroy Wallet" width="800" height="614" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56449" />
<p><big>Bellroy Wallet</big><br />
Traveling internationally, and especially for business, means you end needing to carry quite a few things on your person at one time. I ended up having to carry my passport, credit cards, cash, business cards, TFIB stickers, rook key, and needing a place to store my travel receipts. Thankfully I had the <a href="http://us.bellroy.com/products/travel-wallet#video" title="Belroy Travel Wallet">Bellroy Travel Wallet</a> to help me track of all my items. It has a dedicated sleeve for for your passport, ample room for cards and two different areas to hold cash and receipts. Not to mention that it&#8217;s beautifully made out of leather.</p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-pentax-k-01.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Pentax K-01" width="800" height="583" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56451" />
<p><big>Pentax K-01 Camera</big><br />
Reykjavik and Iceland in general is known for its breathtaking scenery so I knew would be taking my Pentax K-01 with me to document the trip. What&#8217;s great about the K-01 is that it&#8217;s not too large but still takes amazing photos. Plus, no matter where you go people take notice of the came a because of its unique body design. Like I said at the beginning, stylish and functional. </p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-baxter-finley.jpg" alt="The Fox Is Black Travel Essentials - Baxter Finley Dop Kit" width="800" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56406" />
<img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//tfib-travel-essentials-baxter-finley-2.jpg" alt="tfib-travel-essentials-baxter-finley-2" width="800" height="390" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56407" />
<p><big>Baxter Finely Dop Kit &#038; Accessories</big><br />
When I travel I&#8217;m always skeptical of hotel toiletries. Unless you&#8217;re staying at a fairly fancy place the potential for having nice body wash or facial lotion is usually pretty low. Hotels are starting to carry nicer products, but still, I didn&#8217;t want to take a chance. I decided to pack up my Baxter Finley dop kit with the things that make me feel like home&#8230; in the shower. My go to bath products come from <a href="http://www.baxterofcalifornia.com/shop" title="Baxter of California">Baxter of California</a> and <a href="https://www.malinandgoetz.com/" title="Malin &#038; Goetz">Malin &#038; Goetz</a>. I brought along body wash, shampoo, and body lotion, which was especially helpful against the cold, Icelandic winds. For teeth I went with Marvis whitening, and to protect against body odor I brought along my most favorite deodorant on earth: Natural Grooming by Herban Cowboy. If you&#8217;re a man you should own this deodorant. This small cache easily lasted me 6 days and they&#8217;ll be around for my next adventure as well. </p>
<p><img src="http://thefoxisblack.com/blogimages/comment-divider.gif"></p>
<p><big>iPhone/iPad/MacBook Pro</big><br />
I figured I should round this list out with the few things I can&#8217;t leave home without, my Apple products. I ended up using all of three of these devices on my trip, but they all serve very different purposes for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start with my iPhone, which is consider to be my lifeline. I call it that because it helped me out numerous times on my trip, especially thanks to the AT&#038;T data plan I activated before I left. Having a searchable map in a city I don&#8217;t know was crucial, helping me find that cool restaurant I&#8217;d heard about or simply being able to find my way back to my hotel. Plus I was able to reach out to friends and find out where they were. I personally don&#8217;t care for old fashioned notions of romantic times with paper maps. It&#8217;s 2013, I want to be connected and I don&#8217;t want to feel lost, dammit. </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s my iPad, which I use as my in between device. For example, I&#8217;ve written this entire post on my iPad on my plane ride home because my laptop is too large to really be comfortable. It also cam with me to the lobby bar of the Natura to crank out some late night emails while drinking a Tuborg or two. </p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s my laptop, which is my blogging machine. Blogging for me is finding an exciting combination of writing and images. In order to find that combination I can&#8217;t simply dump in a bunch of half ass images I find randomly off the Internet. I need to be able to a dust my photos or make a graphic or combine images to create an editorial feeling to a post. I can do all of that with my laptop but it would be slow and cumbersome to try and achieve that with my iPad or iPhone. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Isbjerget_Aarhus3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56454" alt="Isbjerget Iceberg Aarhus Denmark JDS Architects, Cebra, SeARCH and Louis Paillard" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Isbjerget_Aarhus3.jpg" width="800" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>An ocean or two away in Aarhus, a team of four architects has finished <em>Isbjerget</em>, a residential project on the waterfront of Denmark&#8217;s second-largest city. The pointy-roofed Iceberg is a collaboration between <a href="http://jdsa.eu/">JDS Architects</a>, <a href="http://www.cebra.info/">Cebra</a>, <a href="http://www.search.nl/">SeARCH</a> and <a href="http://www.louispaillard.com/">Louis Paillard</a>. All great firms, but it&#8217;s especially exciting for me to see the project finish because I feel like I witnessed the conception of the project at the desk next to mine while I worked at JDS. And what does it take to conceive architecture? A lot of blue foam.</p>
<p><span id="more-56441"></span></p>
<p>When I first saw the project, Andy was working directly with Julien, burning through dozens of models to come up with a few iterations to take to a meeting in Aarhus. And I really mean it when I say Andy was burning through them, the early sketch models were made with rigid <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2010/11/30/vacant-nl-by-rietveld-landscape/">blue</a> <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2010/11/29/a-model-by-radim-louda/">foam</a> insulation that is cut using a hot wire. It&#8217;s fast and honestly a fun way to make massing models, but I remember that even from the earliest models, a primary focus of the project was to make sure that each occupant would have plenty of natural light in his/her space and that as many occupants as possible would have views of the waterfront. That&#8217;s why the site plan of the project changed from a prescribed perimeter building with a courtyard into a series of L-shaped canyons. As I recall, the project didn&#8217;t even start out trying to resemble an iceberg, it just happened somewhere along the way.</p>
<p>So now, nearly five years after the first massing models were made the project stands by the waterfront kind of looking like an iceberg. Five years may seem like a long time, but this iceberg hasn&#8217;t been moving at a glacial pace; it&#8217;s taken a lot of work to crystalize this project because of its scale and the economic rough seas that tend to drown architecture. What&#8217;s left next to the water in Aarhus is handsome and bright. But would you live inside an giant iceberg? Sadly, I haven&#8217;t been able to find any photos from the interior of the project– my guess is that they&#8217;re still finishing work inside- but these great exterior pictures are all taken from <a href="http://www.search.nl/">SeARCH&#8217;s website</a>. Even though I had nothing to do with the project (Well, I think I may have built a box to transport a model once?) it&#8217;s exciting to see the blue model all grown up into a white building, even if that building is very far away.</p>

<p>Back in January staff writer Andi Teran posted about the work of <a href="http://julieskitchen.me/" title="Julie Lee">Julie Lee</a>, a Los Angeles based artist who <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/01/17/instagram-food-collages-by-julie-lee/">created the most amazing food collages</a>. I remember seeing those beautiful pieces filled with beet ends and slices of peach with a garnish of lemon zest laid out in an almost wallpaper-esque pattern. I thought they were so beautiful, and immediately I began to wonder if she&#8217;d do a wallpaper for the site?</p>
<p>I wrote her and luckily enough she said she&#8217;d make something. So we plotted a bit and decided that she should make a beautiful wallpaper for the first day of Spring, which is today for those of us in the northern hemisphere. It also happens to be my grandma&#8217;s birthday, so a big happy birthday to her! It might be difficult to see in the small preview above but her wallpaper features a combination of food stuffs paired with vibrantly colored flowers. You&#8217;ll find a bit of asparagus, a peeled snap pea, some lavender, a little broccolini&#8230; you get the picture. </p>
<p>Be sure to check back every Wednesday for a new wallpaper!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/03/20/han-kjobenhavn-menswear-opens-first-u-s-store/han-kjobenhavn-ny-store/" rel="attachment wp-att-56334"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56334" alt="Han Kjøbenhavn Store NYC" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//han-kjobenhavn-ny-store.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.hankjobenhavn.com/">Han Kjøbenhavn</a> is a menswear company founded in Copenhagen in 2008. Designers Jannik Wikkelso Davidsen and Tim Faith have been building a steady following ever since with their unique brand of timeless vintage workwear imbued with streamlined Danish design. There&#8217;s an easygoing wearability to the clothing and accessories (at an affordable price point too) and an unconventional rowdiness echoed in their marketing. And, luckily, with a retail space newly opened in New York City, the company is finally poised to reach a much larger audience.</p>
<p><span id="more-56238"></span></p>
<p>Much like fashion compatriots Acne Studios and Henrik Vibskov, the Han Kjøbenhavn flagship boutique is located in NYC&#8217;s Soho neighborhood and is very much in keeping with the brand&#8217;s spare yet durable spirit. The space is white-walled with accents of blonde wood, and the pops of color come from the clothing and accessories as well as design books and magazines peppered throughout. The latest Han Kjøbenhavn collection even features a New York sensibility from tailored navy trench coats and backpacks to classic sunglasses and heavy duty shirting featuring pigeon prints.</p>
<p>Though new to the U.S. market, Han Kjøbenhavn makes a fine addition to the ever-growing menswear retail landscape. Even if you can&#8217;t make it out to the store, I highly suggest giving the <a href="http://www.hankjobenhavn.com/">webshop</a> a look. The bizarre collection <a href="http://vimeo.com/61179100">video</a> is proof enough that there&#8217;s something wonderfully rotten yet appealing going on in Denmark.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kirrajamison.com/">Kirra Jamison</a> makes beautiful work filled with energy, playfulness and fun. The pieces featured here are taken from a series called <em>LOCOMOTOR</em>. Created as a series of large-scale acrylic paintings for an exhibition in Brisbane last year, the work was inspired by Jamison&#8217;s <a href="http://www.kirrajamison.com/Total-Control">earlier work in silkscreen printing</a>. </p>
<p><span id="more-56099"></span></p>
<p>In <em>LOCOMOTOR</em> Jamison attempts to mimic the layering process of silk-screening but is freed-up from the difficulties of the medium&#8217;s often haphazard nature by working in acrylic. Here she gets to celebrate the looseness of the silkscreen while having more control and a richer color-palette. </p>
<p>Jamison&#8217;s use of simple shapes and strong colors is just perfect and I can imagine these images looking particularly beautiful hanging in a sunny apartment. Make sure to check out more of her work by visiting her website <a href="http://www.kirrajamison.com/">here</a>. </p>
