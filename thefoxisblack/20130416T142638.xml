				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/?attachment_id=58111" rel="attachment wp-att-58111"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58111" alt="Matt Leines &quot;Frank&quot;" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//matt-leines-frank.jpg" width="800" height="1069" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://mattleinesart.tumblr.com/">Matt Leines</a> doesn&#8217;t have the most elaborate bio. His website explains that he&#8217;s an artist from New Jersey currently living in Brooklyn—that&#8217;s it. It doesn&#8217;t shout about his already impressive roster of accolades or map out his course study as a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design. But his work has shown steadily all over the world since 2002, and his latest show, <em>Hyperbolic</em>, opened last week at Brooklyn&#8217;s <a href="http://www.beginnings-nyc.com/upcoming">Beginnings</a> gallery. Besides all that, his surrealist paintings continue to shock and awe.</p>
<p><span id="more-58108"></span></p>
<p>A mishmash of imagery seemingly referencing everything from Picasso and Pollock to Ettore Sottsass and the Memphis Group design movement, his work is intricate, amusing, and deftly beautiful. Though his contemporary subjects are often abstract and vaguely human, he uses techniques like marbling to give texture and dimension. There are hints of tribal art and 1980s motifs, and every painting is telling a story you can&#8217;t quite comprehend. He infuses each of his pieces with color, movement, and a weird kind of whimsy that I find both arresting and uplifting. Thus, if you&#8217;re in the NYC area, check out his show in <a href="http://www.beginnings-nyc.com/">Greenpoint</a> or visit his <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/mattleines?ref=seller_info">Etsy store</a> for more, including the 2008 monograph, <em>You Are Forgiven, </em>which chronicles the bulk of his work.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve been making improvements to TFIB over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve been wondering why websites aren&#8217;t more responsive to people? Why should they remain static and not bend to our needs? In that way I&#8217;ve been trying to think of the site more like an app and less like a blog. So I decided to take some inspiration from <a href="http://twitterrific.com/ios" title="Twitteriffic">Twitteriffic</a>, my go-to Twitter reading app who&#8217;ve done an incredible job of making my tweet reading experience even better. They&#8217;ve got this great feature where you can shift the app to a dark theme, which makes it a lot easier to read at night. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take this concept and bring it to TFIB, which I&#8217;m simply calling Night Mode. At 7pm the site will switch themes, turning to an inverted version of itself (but not so dark that you can&#8217;t see the fox). At 7am, Night Mode switches off and the site goes back to normal. This is based on your computers clock, so it doesn&#8217;t matter where in the world you are. My hope is that you&#8217;ll have a better reading experience with this change. There&#8217;s nothing worse than reading a website that&#8217;s too damn bright when you&#8217;re laying in bed, whether it&#8217;s late at night or early in the morning.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to let me know if you like it this new feature or not. You can hit me up <a href="https://twitter.com/thefoxisblack">on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151634545427216&#038;set=a.10150795334382216.477873.98861597215&#038;type=1">on Facebook</a> and let me know either way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//shigeru-ban.jpg" alt="Shigeru Ban" width="800" height="574" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58204" /></p>
<p>Came across <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2013/04/07/people/peoples-architect-shigeru-ban-combines-permanence-and-paper/">this interview by Edan Corkill with Shigeru Ban</a> in which they discuss his growing up, his education at Cooper Union, and his love of paper tubes. Before this article I honestly had no idea that cardboard could be so damn durable. You can read more about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Ban#Materiality_of_Paper">his practical uses of paper tubes on his Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite part of this piece though is at the end when Shigeru explains what&#8217;s important to him in regards to architecture.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What’s the most important thing when making architecture?</strong></p>
<p>Even something that I intended as a temporary structure, like a paper church I made in Kobe in 1995, can end up being permanent. That church was relocated to Taiwan in 2006, after they had an earthquake there, and it still exists today. Ultimately, what determines the permanence of a building is not the wealth of the developer or the materials that are used, but the simple question of whether or not the resulting structure is supported — loved — by the people.</p>
<p>Architecture made simply for profit — even if it’s in concrete — is in fact temporary. Commercial architecture is precisely that. If it is made for making money then eventually some other developer will come along and try to make more money out of it by demolishing it and rebuilding it. And it just repeats. In that way concrete is in fact temporary.</p>
<p>However, if you make architecture that is loved by the people, then regardless of what it is made of, it will be kept.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/earthpix/status/323628873684226049">an interesting tweet from EarthPix</a> with one of the most beautiful photos I&#8217;d ever seen. A stunning sliver of moon looming giant over a minuscule sun, beautifully reflected in the crystal water below. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//hideaway-inya-nielsen.jpg" alt="&#039;Hideaway&#039; by Inga Neilsen" width="1024" height="670" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58149" /></p>
<p>I was stunned by this photo and how beautiful earth can be&#8230; but perhaps it&#8217;s too good to be true?</p>
<p><span id="more-58086"></span></p>
<p>As it turns out the image above isn&#8217;t a photo at all, but <a href="http://gate-to-nowhere.deviantart.com/art/Hideaway-61855403?q=gallery%3Agate-to-nowhere%2F820552&#038;qo=32">an amazing piece of art by Inga Nielsen called <em>Hideaway</em></a>. Inga clarifies:</p>
<blockquote><p>After someone spread it on the web as photograph of a &#8220;Sunset at the north pole&#8221;, this image became quite popular. It is of course not a photo and it does not show a place anywhere near the terrestrial north pole. Side note: the moon sets in that angle towards the horizon only close to the terrestrial equator. This is because Earth and Moon share the same plane of rotation around the sun.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how the Internet can take an image and run with it, losing all sense of what it truly is. <em>Hideaway</em> was posted back in 2007 and yet still it&#8217;s being posted as if it&#8217;s a real photo. Inga was able to render this piece with such clarity and realness that it&#8217;s probably fooled millions at this point. </p>
<p>Also, Phil Plait over at the Discover blog has a great breakdown of <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/17/an-unreal-picture-of-sunset-at-the-north-pole/#.UWw1WCv70fE">why the piece could never take place on Earth</a> which is pretty amusing and certainly worth a read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58131" alt="CA Group Xidayinggang Twin Bridges" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang2.jpg" width="800" height="482" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58138" alt="CAGroup_Xidayinggang4" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang4.jpg" width="800" height="511" /></a></p>
<p>These twisting twin bridges are the work of the Shanghai-based <a href="http://www.cagroup.cn/">CA Group</a>, but the photographs of the bridges are the work of photographer <a href="http://m-ra.es/">Montse Zamora</a>. The bridges look a little bit like the double helix of DNA to me, but I&#8217;m a bit of a science nerd and it turns out that they&#8217;re inspiration is more geographical than biological. The form of the bridges is a reference to mountains which are absent in this particular region of China. The shape also suits the structural system of the arched suspension bridge. What&#8217;s unique about this bridge is that the arches jump from side to side, making the bridge more dynamic while also ensuring that they have the same sort of formal legibility from more angles. And the angles of these bridges are captured very well by Montse.</p>
<p><span id="more-58090"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58132" alt="CA Group Xidayinggang Twin Bridges" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//CAGroup_Xidayinggang.jpg" width="800" height="479" /></a></p>
<p>Although she is now based in Madrid, Montse did live in Shanghai after graduating from the Escuela Técnica Superior Arquitectura with a Master&#8217;s degree focused on Architectural Photography (her thesis <em>Ezra Stoller y Julius Shulman: Dos miradas enfrentadas </em>contrasted the work of the two folks who might be the most widely celebrated photographers of modernism.) And her photographs of the two tripple-span, sextuple-arch bridges at Xidayinggang are simultaneously straightforward and dramatic. Seen rising from a field of bright and optimistic flowers, the graceful arcs of the bridge start to resemble the mountains the designers describe as inspiration, varied and complex in a way that natural features often are. We can only hope that these mountain bridges will stand long and are built well; built to withstand the environment that would see them crumble as a result of natural forces, corruption or a debilitating <a href="http://www.npr.org/2012/08/29/160231137/chinese-blame-failed-infrastructure-on-corruption">collusion of both</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been two years since celebrated singer-songwriting Samuel Beam, aka <a href="http://www.ironandwine.com/ghostonghost">Iron and Wine</a>, has released a studio album. The latest, <em>Ghost on Ghost</em>, arrives tomorrow, and we&#8217;re already fans per the live stream <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/08/grace-for-saints-and-ramblers-a-new-song-from-iron-and-wine/">first listen</a> last week. We can attest that it&#8217;s a satisfyingly exuberant and uplifting new direction for Beam and his band, and it&#8217;s amplified by the album&#8217;s first music video for the song &#8220;Joy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Directed by <a href="http://hayleymorris.net/">Hayley Morris</a>, we&#8217;re taken on a colorful journey through a blossoming wilderness. Cow skulls sprout flowers while dried flowers explode in shades of neon. It&#8217;s a stunning piece of animation created by projecting hand-painted watercolor animations into stop-motion landscapes. Morris was inspired by a particular lyric from the song—&#8221;deep inside the heart of this crazy mess, I&#8217;m only calm when I get lost within your wilderness&#8221;—and chose to visually show how love transforms and colors the world around you.</p>
<p>Aside from interpreting the romance of the lyrics in a beautifully literal way, the animation itself stands alone as a depiction of what it is to feel joy. &#8220;[It's] a song about love and taking a moment to realize how someone can vastly change how you perceive yourself and the world around you,&#8221; Morris says. &#8220;My goal was to have the viewer feel the effect through bursts of color, growth and transformation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finnish electro-pop duo <a href="https://soundcloud.com/shine2009">Shine 2009</a> have just released a new single called &#8220;Eurozone&#8221;. It&#8217;s a wonderfully catchy tune filled with glittering chimes, operatic samples and a terrific late-80s / early-90s style funk. The track is the first single from their upcoming second album, and a brilliant taste of what&#8217;s to come. &#8220;Eurozone&#8221; has certainly been clocking up a good number of plays in my studio over the last few days, and I&#8217;m already looking forward to the new album!</p>
<p>You can download &#8220;Eurozone&#8221; <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/eurozone-single/id626291449">here</a> from iTunes. Their forthcoming album, <em>Our Nation</em> is set for release this fall through Cascine.</p>

<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41002/painting-place-an-interview-with-fleurette-west/">Painting Place: An Interview With Fleurette West</a></big><br />
Artist Fleurette West is really inspired by her surroundings. Her paintings are about place but do not represent how the place looks: she represents how the place feels. She ties all of this together in ways that are bright and abstract and really do give a feel for a part of town. Her story of getting to art through behavioral sciences is fascinating, too.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41004/helping-urs-fischer-at-moca/">Helping Urs Fischer At MOCA</a></big><br />
Urs Fischer has a huge MOCA show coming up. What is he doing for it? He had tons of LA people make clay things for him. Not just little things: people went batshit insane and made huge, crazy clay pieces for him. We went and helped him out and, boy, was it wild. You may see some familiar items at the show, namely a black fox.</p>
<p><span id="more-58042"></span></p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41285/wandering-through-pink-offices-stephen-prinas-as-he-remembered-it/">Wandering Through Pink Offices: Stephen Prina&#8217;s <i>As He Remebered It</i></a></big><br />
LACMA&#8217;s entry into the new, not-as-hyped Pacific Standard Time architecture show is a collection of Shindler furniture painted bright pink and organized like they are in an invisible house. What is this? Stephen Prina&#8217;s <i>As He Remembered It</i>, a show based on his seeing a bright pink Schindler desk in an office window on La Brea that obviously did not belong. It&#8217;s a really special show.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41408/duc-kein-has-a-jacket-for-you/">Duc Kien US Jean Jackets</a></big><br />
Duc Kien US is hoping to be your new jean maker. How are they getting their start? With a really sleek jean jacket that is super, super streamlined and very nice. They&#8217;re currently Kickstarting the effort and have already gotten lots of accolades, namely by way of GQ. If you are looking for a light jacket, consider purchasing this affordable, high-end item.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41409/symmetria/">Symmetía</a></big><br />
Graphic designer Victoria Macey is inspired by what she sees in Los Angeles. What does this mean? She has been taking imagery that surrounds her and turning it into very neat, abstract patterns. It&#8217;s a very simple concept and the link between pattern and reference is balanced so delicately that you have to pay attention to them. We love these!</p>
<p>Some items that barely missed the cut: we have a new series called <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/category/where-shall-we-meet/">Where Shall We Meet?</a> that suggests meeting and working places in LA and one of our contributors found a <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/40992/unseen-la-a-hidden-noguchi-museum/">hidden Noguchi museum</a> in Costa Mesa.</p>

<p>The last time I wrote about an endangered building it was <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/01/06/should-neutras-cyclorama-be-demolished/">Richard Neutra&#8217;s 1963 Cyclorama at Gettysburg</a>. After years of legal battle, the 50 year old building was demolished just last month. It&#8217;s a disappointing outcome, but the building did stand for five decades which is longer than many buildings. Sadly, one of those buildings that will not make it to the fifty year mark is the <a href="http://www.folkartmuseum.org/">American Folk Art Museum</a> by <a href="http://www.twbta.com/">Tod Williams and Billie Tsien</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-58029"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58037" alt="American Folk Art Museum Tod Williams Billie Tsien Demolition MoMA" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg" width="800" height="619" /></a></p>
<p>Completed just twelve years ago, the distinctive and small museum sits next to MoMA on 53rd street in Manhattan. It won several awards upon its completion and has a remarkable facade that uses folded planes of a bronze alloy called tombasil in a way which looks hand-forged. MoMA bought the building a couple of years ago after the Folk Art Museum ran into financial hot water which forced the institution to pack up the folk arts and relocate. So after years of mulling over what was to become of the funny little building next to it, MoMA announced this week <a href="http://www.designboom.com/architecture/american-folk-art-museum-destined-for-demolition/">they plan to tear it down</a>. Why? According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/arts/design/moma-to-raze-ex-american-folk-art-museum-building.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">an article in the NYT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MoMA officials said the building’s design did not fit their plans because the opaque facade is not in keeping with the glass aesthetic of the rest of the museum. The former folk museum is also set back farther than MoMA’s other properties, and the floors would not line up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m biased or just annoyed, but when I read the snippet above, I think &#8220;so MoMA is tearing this building down because they can&#8217;t see through the front of it?&#8221; I know it&#8217;s more complicated than that, but Folk Art Museum&#8217;s former building deserves better rationale for it&#8217;s demolition than &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t match.&#8221; The bigger problem to me isn&#8217;t that the museum officials can&#8217;t see through bronze alloy, but that they can&#8217;t see or imagine a future where they would protect an architecturally significant project in their possession. If the leadership of MoMA is being this myopic about the expansion of their campus, what other terrible decisions are they making when it comes to doing what museums are supposed to do?</p>

<p>For the last two days Kyle and I have been hanging out in Las Vegas. Yesterday was my mother&#8217;s 60th birthday and she wanted to spend it here. I haven&#8217;t been here for about 5 or 6 years, but in that short period of time things have changed quite a bit. It&#8217;s more polished, less kid-friendly, but essentially how it was. We ended up staying at the <a href="http://www.arialasvegas.com/" title="Aria Resort and Casino">Aria</a>, an extremely contemporary casino that was opened in 2009. It actually fits me and Kyle quite well, eschewing the kitch of most Las Vegas hotels.</p>
<p>Situated next to the Aria though is essentially a super fancy mall called <a href="http://www.crystalsatcitycenter.com/" title="Crystals at City Center">Crystals at City Center</a>. There are shops from all the major fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Gucci, Saint Laurent, etc. It&#8217;s Rodeo Drive contained in a beautiful, Daniel Libeskind designed building (which also happens to be LEED+ certified). Walking around the shops I started to take notice of just how on-point everything was, how all the details were done right. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a surprise by any means, but when you look at these shops from purely a design perspective it&#8217;s actualyl quite fascinating. </p>
<p><span id="more-58048"></span></p>
<p>Below are a series of photos I took of the Crystals, the interiors and exteriors of shops, and so on. I found a lot of inspiration in these, so I thought I&#8217;d post share them. Perhaps you&#8217;ll find something that piques your interest as well?</p>

<p>Last year the fashion designer <a href="http://www.rebeccatorres.co.uk/">Rebecca Torres</a> collaborated with illustrator <a href="http://www.saskiapomeroy.com">Saskia Pomeroy</a> to create a bold and brash collection for women. Her vision was to create a line which drew inspiration from her signature style whilst also captured the raw essence of native, ancient and decorative arts. Fortunately Saskia was the perfect partner to see that vision come to life.</p>
<p><span id="more-57552"></span></p>
<p>The Glasgow-born duos work is filled with bold and bright colors. Combing modern fabrics and a daring brashness, this collection is a wonderful combination of both Torres and Pomeroy&#8217;s unique styles. The photographs by <a href="http://www.joelandmattias.com/">Joel &#038; Mattias</a> also do a great job of capturing the vibrancy and playfulness of the collection. </p>

<p>ADHD sounds like an affliction, and it is. If you&#8217;ve caught snippets of FOX&#8217;s latest cartoon series online or follow their hilarious <a href="http://foxadhd.tumblr.com">GIFs on Tumblr</a>, then you&#8217;re probably already hooked on what I&#8217;m decreeing is the best thing to happen to animation in eons. Referencing pop culture and the completely non sequitur, <a href="http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=animation-domination-hd">Animation Domination High-Def</a> (the official title) will be a block of adult animation airing every Saturday night from 11pm &#8211; 12:30am starting on July 27. It will feature the new series <em>Axe Cop</em>, originally created by a five-year-old, as well as 50 original short-form pieces. Currently, the online content encompasses everything from a <em>Saved by the Bell</em> spoof (retitled &#8220;Saved by the Horn&#8221;) featuring a dance contest and pizza spirit guide to a Charlie Brown/Louis CK mashup that sees the whole Peanuts gang as dysfunctional grown-ups.</p>
<p><span id="more-57919"></span></p>
<p>While FOX&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fox.com/animationdomination/">Animation Domination</a> block of programming on Sundays continues to entertain, ADHD feels like it&#8217;s scrappier little brother, the one prone to pulling dastardly R-rated pranks on you while you sleep. (It&#8217;s also prone to incite belly laughs while you try to watch it covertly at work.) There are so many gems currently on its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FOXADHD">You Tube</a> channel that it was hard to pick one. &#8220;Future Travel&#8221; is a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.blinkink.co.uk/#!artist_layzellbros">Layzell Bros</a> that imagines love in the future, while &#8220;Pikachu Gets Pokemon Rabies&#8221; is exactly what you might imagine that title to be.  My current favorite, though, is &#8220;Really Clever Girl&#8221;, a ridiculous homage to <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p>

<p><a href="jamianjulianovillani.com">Jamian Juliano-Villani</a> is an artist based in NYC whose paintings are an interesting mix of reappropriated cartoon pop culture and surreal, unsettling, and sometimes narrative scenes in a flat, graphic style. Jamian&#8217;s work is similar to some contemporary nostalgia-referencing artists but retains a uniquely mysterious quality.</p>
<p><span id="more-57965"></span></p>
<p>Looking at Jamian&#8217;s work, one of the first things I was reminded of was the work of <a href="http://ausgangart.com/">Anthony Ausgang</a>, whose work occupies a similar aesthetic realm and utilizes some of the same motifs and cartoon-like characters. Jamian&#8217;s figures are whimsical and familiar but have a dark, dreamlike quality that is like a child&#8217;s nightmare filtered through naive imagery. In one image a pair of bell-bottom-clad legs with Mickey Mouse arms is discovered hanging by its neck-waist, which is also the belt around its goofy pants. Another image features shirtless pig-humans that look a lot like the thing from Super Mario Bros. 2 that shot eggs out of its nose (<em>Editor&#8217;s Note</em>: She was called <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Birdo" title="Birdo">Birdo</a>). It all looks a lot like the subconscious imaginings of a kid who&#8217;s overdosed on cartoons and early 90&#8242;s video games.

<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/12/crossing-over-into-bonobos-the-north-borders/bonobo/" rel="attachment wp-att-57955"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//bonobo-800x629.jpeg" alt="bonobo" width="800" height="629" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-57955" /></a></p>
<p>The career of Sean Green, aka <a href="http://bonobomusic.com/">Bonobo</a>, has been one of slow yet steady ascent. A DJ and producer, his debut record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Magic-Bonobo/dp/B00004VWWG"><em>Animal Magic</em></a> contained the trademarks of a man impressed in the details. One could listen to the record without realizing the jazzy, funkified trip-hop beats have been playing and seeping into your brain. The sitars ring, the guitar strings fuzz, drums mute, and all of a sudden the listener is transfixed. When <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sands-Bonobo/dp/B0035UHJCE/ref=pd_sim_m_4">Black Sands</a> came out in 2010, the formula was complete &#8211; global melodies, hip hop precussion, a meditative producers touch. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7m86aMNjlQ">&#8220;Kiara&#8221;</a> remains one of my favorite &#8220;play-this-any-time-of-day&#8221; track of the past 5 years, while &#8220;Eyesdown&#8221; is the most seductive 9 megabytes available for remixes. Listening to <em>Black Sands</em> can be akin to sitting in a Van der Rohe chair. The details are everywhere, you just have to look.</p>
<p>So needless to say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-North-Borders/dp/B00C0YQLDE/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1365706278&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=bonobo+north+borders">The North Borders</a> might be the most anticipated release on Ninja Tune this year.</p>
<p><span id="more-57496"></span></p>
<p><iframe src='http://aff7ba5452b19562188d-94a4304dda9e3fda4b4cf2a2dd1232a0.r28.cf1.rackcdn.com/136578005751682659a5c582.41859154.html' width='650' height='250' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0'></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of diverging from his formula, Bonobo uses this record as a chance to expand and elaborate on the ideas crystallized so well in <em>Black Sands</em>. Earlier in 2013 <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/01/28/cirrus-a-trippy-new-video-for-bonobo-directed-by-cyriak/">Bobby brought you the video for Cirrus</a>, the first single. With impulsive, whimsical energy, the percussion builds the cyclical song into a swarming mess. Erykah Badu herself makes an appearance in &#8220;Heaven for a Sinner,&#8221; a track built so well for the chanteuse that I can&#8217;t imagine them not working together. Yet the meditative complexes of the record showcase Bonobo&#8217;s finest talents. &#8220;First Fire&#8221; drips with infatuation, Grey Reverend croons “Honestly I can’t believe it’s burning again / Like the first fire,” and wine glasses clink as lips entwine. &#8220;Jets&#8221; is an instant mainstay for any lounge worldwide while &#8220;Antennae&#8221; will populate every urbanite&#8217;s travel mix, public transportation be warned.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t <em>Black Sands</em> Part Deux; this is a border you want to cross. Feel free to hire your <em>coyote</em> for this one. </p>

<p>Life can get hectic, and sometimes I wish being stranded on a desert island was an option&#8230; for like, a weekend. I would catch-up on some reading, get a tan, think about life, maybe play some cards. In essence, I would re-group. The one thing I wouldn’t expect to think about would be what I was wearing, and if my clothes were in season. The west coast based surf and skate shop <a href="http://sitka.ca/">Sitka</a>, has put some serious thought into the desert island dream for the concept of their Fall/Winter 2013 ad campaign with <i><a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/58869875">Stranded</a></i>, a short film directed by Benjamin Schuetze and Ben Gulliver.</p>
<p>The production on <i>Stranded</i> is phenomenal. For at least 6 of the 8 minute film, it had me fashionably duped before I realized I was essentially watching a commercial. <i>Stranded</i> is a novel and a seriously fun way that Sitka’s brand can reach farther than any print campaign possibly could</p>

<p>This beautifully austere science building addition is on the campus of the University of Alcalá in Spain, and from the drafting boards of <a href="http://www.hfelorza.com/">Héctor Fernández Elorza</a>. Because the technological and spatial needs of research buildings tend to evolve quickly, the original building was in desperate need of a renovation to bring the building up to the working standards of a modern facility.</p>
<p><span id="more-57913"></span></p>

<p>One example would be the importantance that the space expands to accommodate new genetics research and office facilities. <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/355917/faculty-of-cellular-and-genetic-biology-hector-fernandez-elorza/">The result</a> is an elegantly top heavy slice of building that is long but Shallow. You can see the extensive use of naturally-colored materials in the video along with the excess of natural light that floods the corridors and rooms of the addition. Of course, it helps to have photographers/videographers like <a href="http://m-ra.es/">Montse Aamorano</a> showing the building in the best possible light.</p>

<p>The Milan Furniture Fair, or <a href="http://www.cosmit.it/tool/home.php?s=0,2,67,71,75">Salone Internazionale del Mobile</a>, is happening this week, and it will feature a new collaboration between renowned Italian design company <a href="http://www.alessi.com/en/">Alessi</a> and Swedish design studio <a href="http://www.big-game.ch/index.php?home">Big Game</a>. Alberto Alessi specifically asked the studio to create &#8220;anonymous Swiss objects&#8221; and , as a reference, cited a classic 1930&#8242;s Swiss toolbox. Big Game took the suggestion quite literally and created a series of CARGO objects, pairing their streamlined aesthetics with colorful utilitarian simplicity.</p>
<p><span id="more-57899"></span></p>
<p>The CARGO toolbox reinvents Alessi&#8217;s request. The handles are a light, smooth wood anchored by hyper-colored plastic with three simple compartments. There&#8217;s also a hammer—because &#8220;everybody needs one at home&#8221;—made with a light wooden handle and an elegantly modernized hammer head. Though based in Sweden and fully steeped in those aesthetics, Big Game also chose to reference Japan with the CARGO catchall inspired by traditional Japanese wooden carrying boxes. There&#8217;s no word on if the products will be made available for purchase yet, but our fingers are crossed.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//The-Quiet-City-Winter-in-Paris-1.jpg" alt="The Quiet City - Winter in Paris" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57567" /></p>
<p>This winter has hung around for far too long. Last month the UK saw their second coldest March on record and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that I&#8217;ve had enough with snow, the cold and everything else that comes with this horrendous weather&#8230; that is, until I saw this beautiful video of Paris in wintertime by <a href="https://vimeo.com/andrewjulian/videos">Andrew Julian</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-57553"></span>Paris is undoubtedly one of the prettiest cities in the world and Andrew&#8217;s video capture so much of what is to love about the place. Filmed on a recent trip to France, the video is filled with many of the city&#8217;s most famous sights, but unlike each time that I&#8217;ve been there, Andrew seems to be able to capture these locations without the hoards of tourists that so often get in the way. His portrait of Paris is a far more tranquil, empty and &#8211; as his title puts it &#8211; quite city. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//The-Quiet-City-Winter-in-Paris-2.jpg" alt="The Quiet City - Winter in Paris" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57568" /></p>
<p>Andrew explains: “Until this trip, I had only ever experienced Paris in the summer and I was struck by just how different the city is when most of us tourist are gone. We were equipped with our metro and museum passes and were able to easily access most places of interest without even waiting in line. It was incredible!” Andrew&#8217;s video has me wishing it was winter all over again so I could grab my passport and head to Paris right away! </p>

<p>For those wondering about the music in the video, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_im_Spiegel">Spiegel im Spiegel</a> by Arvo Pärt. You should also check out Andrew&#8217;s <a href="https://vimeo.com/andrewjulian/videos">Vimeo page</a> to see more of his work including videos from Big Sur, Utah, Mexico and more. Enjoy!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m endlessly fascinated by the idea of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency that&#8217;s certainly shaking up the ideas of traditional financial institutions. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, read this excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" title="Bitcoin">the Wikipedia article on Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency based on an open-source, peer-to-peer internet protocol. It was introduced in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins can be exchanged through a computer or smartphone locally or internationally without an intermediate financial institution. In trade, one bitcoin is subdivided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis, defined by eight decimal places.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not managed like typical currencies: it has no central bank or central organization. Instead, it relies on an Internet-based peer-to-peer network. The money supply is automated and given to servers or &#8220;bitcoin miners&#8221; that confirm bitcoin transactions as they add them to a decentralized and archived transaction log approximately every 10 minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The well-produced video below gives a really great sense of illustrating what Bitcoin is and how it works. It seriously feels like the future of currency, even if Bitcoin isn&#8217;t necessarily the future itself. Watch and learn.</p>
