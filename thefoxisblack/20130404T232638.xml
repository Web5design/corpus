<p><a href="http://yourstru.ly/">Yours Truly</a>, SF based music documentarians, have spent the better part of the last year videotaping some of the more innovative trendsetters in music. Be it the newest smoldering <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hernameisbanks">Los Angeles IT-girl</a> or <a href="http://yourstru.ly/2013/02/24/kwabs-spirit-fade/">a new soul singer</a>, they have chronicled some of the best emerging artists in the past few years. Recently, they taped Shlomo and Jeremih while they worked on a new single.</p>
<p><span id="more-57499"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84057449"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fofmusic.net/media/shlohmo/">Shlomo</a>, a friend of friends, is emerging as a real Los Angeles favorite. Chicago&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.jeremih.com/">Jeremih</a> might be known for his ubiquitous single &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMxOzxKYYo">Birthday Sex</a>,&#8221; but that doesn&#8217;t mean the young star shies away from riskier, ambitious productions. The video above chronicles the process. Shlomo does his thing, expertly blending the UK garage and R&#038;B sounds into a swirling seductive mash. Jeremih&#8217;s ability to switch between falsetto and a staccato chorus remains impeccable. Could there be a better collaboration in 2013? I doubt it.</p>

<p><a href="http://monocle.com/film/business/making-scents/">Monocle takes a look at Grasse</a> in the south of France, a town known for it&#8217;s robust creation of perfumes. The video is beautiful, framing the town in an incredible light. But it&#8217;s also quite an interesting piece as you get to see the changing culture of perfumery. There are artistans who&#8217;ve been making scents for hundreds of years, which is based on traditions and experienced noses. On the other hand you have science now playing a large part in the market, being able to manipulate and change how scents are created. As the  correspondant Gillian Dobias mentions in the piece, these artists work to create something invisible from raw materials that are so very visible. What a fascinating career.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a fun place to hang out and interact with data (and who isn&#8217;t?) try the Teton County Library in Jackson, Wyoming. The library has a new addition built by <a href="http://gildayarchitects.com/">Gilday Architects</a>. And inside the new entrance lobby, you&#8217;ll find a stunning installation created by <a href="http://eboarch.com/">E/B Office</a>. The New York-based practice has filled the lobby with five miles of fiber optic cable cut into a thousand segments.</p>
<p><span id="more-57457"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/59626512?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>The segments swoop from a central tower that controls the fibers&#8217; illumination to 940 text labels mounted on parallel walls, one label for each category in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">the Dewey Decimal Classification system</a>. The installation changes color whenever a library user in the state uses the Internet to look up a book in any of these categories; if they click on an item to check out, the color will change again. The installation has the effect of turning the lobby into a interactive web of flashing data, which is exactly what E/B Office had in mind. &#8220;It’s inspired by the concept that our civic spaces should be intelligent and responsive, communicating as much to us as we do to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Off the top of your head, how far away from Earth do you think Mars is? If you were to ask me I&#8217;d say something ridiculous like, &#8220;a million billion miles.&#8221; Now there&#8217;s a rather fun way of answering that question: a pixel-by-pixel journey from Earth to Mars which takes place in your browser. </p>
<p>Created by David Paliwoda, <a href="http://www.distancetomars.com/" title="How Far is It To Mars?">How Far Is It To Mars?</a> starts with the simple idea that the earth is 100 pixels wide, as you can see above. If the Earth is 100 pixels wide then it would be 3000 pixels to the Moon (which would only be 27 pixels wide, for comparison). You then zoom down the page, travelling toward Mars at a rate of 7,000 pixels per second. It honestly takes a good minute or two to get down to Mars, which ends up being 428,000 pixels away. </p>
<p>You really need to just click the link and do this for yourself. Using pixels and the browser as a way to measure scale is actually a really neat idea, one I haven&#8217;t personally seen before. I feel like we might start seeing more of this sort of exploration in the near future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57440" alt="Funny Games a film by Akiko Stehrenberger" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Funny-Games-a-film-by-Akiko-Stehrenberger.jpg" width="750" height="1112" /></p>
<p>Before any discussion of the poster for <em>Funny Games</em> ensues, I must emphasize that the German turned American film, by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, is without a doubt a terrifying, horror movie. <em>Funny Games</em> is grotesque, actually, with very sinister undertones and a fair bit of gore. In designing a poster for this film, L.A. based creative <a href="http://akikomatic.com/group/movie-posters/">Akiko Stehrenberger</a>, made a definitive choice. Rather than funnel perception of the film toward a bloody and bone chilling horror mess, Stehrenberger focused the branding toward a clean and minimal approach, one that is rarely seen within the horror genre.</p>
<p><span id="more-57439"></span></p>
<p>By eliminating the clichés of traditional horror genre, like distressed fonts or heavy distortion and dark hues, the poster uses only one key element: the mysterious crying face of Naomi Watts. This strong visual is taken from the exact moment in the film when things turn seriously ugly. The vision for <em>Funny Games</em> freezes Watts in a moment of sheer exhaustion and devastation at the hands of two terrorizing &#8221;neighbours&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stehrenberger, an illustrator, painter and art director, used digital painting in calm muted undertones to recreate the anguished face that haunts the film. Reminiscent of a Chuck Close photorealist sketch, Stehrenberger’s take, similar to the events that unfold in the film, bring on a horrific sense of extended reality. The simple typography and smaller placement of the text in relation to the size and space that is given to the image of Watts in agony, conveys the true terror of the film, and allows for the haunting image to speak for itself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57468" alt="Film posters by Akiko Stehrenberger" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Film-posters-by-Akiko-Stehrenberger.jpg" width="1813" height="1350" /></p>
<p>An avid film poster designer, Stehrenberger has also created  posters for the Todd Solondz film <em>Life During Wartime</em>, Sophia Coppola’s film <em>Somewhere</em>, the haunting drama <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em>, and the ultra fun, eccentric documentary <em>Surfwise</em>. Most recently Akiko Stehrenberger won the SXSW award for excellence in poster design for the 2012 film <em>Kiss of the Damned</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/04/raw-color-brand-identity-keukenconfessies/keukenconfessies/" rel="attachment wp-att-57269"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57269" alt="Keukenconfessies" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//keukenconfessies.jpg" width="800" height="591" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/04/raw-color-brand-identity-keukenconfessies/keukenconfessies_identity/" rel="attachment wp-att-57270"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57270" alt="Keukenconfessies by Raw Color" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//keukenconfessies_identity.jpg" width="800" height="452" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a joy to find inspiring brand imagery. <a href="http://www.keukenconfessies.nl/welcome/">Keukenconfessies</a> (Kitchen Confessions) is an Eindhoven-based food design company with an incredibly creative brand identity. Created by Netherlands design studio <a href="http://www.rawcolor.nl/welcome/">Raw Color</a>, the logo is ever changing and represents the company&#8217;s adherence to elevating cuisine through environment and food. Much more than a catering service, Kitchen Confessions promises to transform any event into a sensorial adventure, whether your food is served in a drawer or on a conveyor belt.</p>
<p><span id="more-57268"></span></p>
<p>Thus, when challenged with an ever-changing logo, Raw Color created a series of spare food illustrations with minimal type. The results speak to the brand&#8217;s inherent playfulness and can be used in marketing as they see fit. Is that an apple on a stick? Do they offer purple sausage made of beets? Will cocktails be garnished with leaves? The branding draws you in and tickles the imagination. The only criticism I have is that the letterhead isn&#8217;t for sale and the logos aren&#8217;t available as prints.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/04/raw-color-brand-identity-keukenconfessies/keukenconfessies_letterhead/" rel="attachment wp-att-57271"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57271" alt="Keukenconfessies by Raw Color" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//keukenconfessies_letterhead.jpg" width="800" height="581" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://theknife.net/" title="The Knife">The Knife</a>, the acclaimed Swedish electronic duo, released a stream of their new album <em>Shaking The Habitual</em>, and boy is it a doozie. It&#8217;s been over seven years since they released their last album <em>Silent Shout</em>, so I don&#8217;t think anyone was really sure what would be released. I can say the album is definitely weird, and much more like <em>Deep Cuts</em>, not as polished as <em>Silent Shout</em>. Still, I&#8217;m excited to listen to this more, see how it grows on me. What do you think?</p>
<p>And how about that album art? Try staring at it for 5 minutes straight, my guess is that you&#8217;ll probably go blind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Crumpler-Prahran-Strore-By-George-Russell-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57396" alt="Ryan Russell Crumpler Store Melbourne" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Crumpler-Prahran-Strore-By-George-Russell-3.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>On the south side of Melbourne, designer <a href="http://ryanrussell.com.au/">Ryan Russell</a> of <a href="http://russellandgeorge.com/">Russell &amp; George</a> has recently completed a bright, playful space for Australian bag maker <a href="http://www.crumpler.com/">Crumpler</a>, their twelfth store in Australia. What immediately makes the store stand out is the grid of fluorescent lights that defines the ceiling and moves down the walls of the retail space. The lights are big, looking almost like the largest and most fragile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K'Nex">K&#8217;Nex</a> project you&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>
<p><span id="more-57395"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Crumpler-Prahran-Strore-By-George-Russell-5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57398" alt="Ryan Russell Crumpler Store Melbourne" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//Crumpler-Prahran-Strore-By-George-Russell-5.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>Almost everything inside the store is grey, from the walls and curtains behind the glowing tubes, to the rocks on the floor, and to the moving images thrown on the walls by projectors in the space. The limited palette not only makes the colorful bags stand out but also contributes to the overall effect of the space: that it is a sophisticated optical illusion. And the optical illusion of the lights and their infinite reflections is compelling. Why else would folks dressed so well wander around the store wearing 3-D glasses?</p>

I&#8217;m a huge fan of the work they&#8217;ve helped produce over the years, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_chair" title="Tulip Chair by Eero Saarinen">the Tulip chair</a> designed by Eero Saarinen or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassily_Chair" title="Wassily chair by Marcel Breuer">the Wassily chair</a> by Marcel Breuer, both iconic pieces of furniture design.</p>
<p>For the wallpaper this week we worked with <a href="http://www.knolltextiles.com/" title="Knoll Textiles">KnollTextiles</a> to make a wallpaper that showed off their beautiful textile designs but also made your iPhone, iPad or desktop look <em>pretty sweet</em> at the same time. I loved the flower pattern with it&#8217;s mix of different textures and the primary colors are bright and bold, just in time for spring.</p>
<p>Be sure to check back every Wednesday for a new wallpaper!</p>

<p>Camilla Ebdrup is a former Girl Scout and Camilla Kørschen a self proclaimed &#8220;child priest&#8221;. Together they comprise <a href="http://www.luckyboysunday.dk/">LuckyBoySunday</a>, a line of modern home accessories steeped in childlike wonder. Both Danish designers have backgrounds in fashion and art, but they joined forces in Copenhagen in 2007, to &#8220;make the best brand&#8221; they could think of. That translates to pairing the softest alpaca wool with the finest free trade craftswomen in Bolivia to bring a range of whimsically poetic products to life—or death, as is the case of their <a href="http://www.luckyboysunday.dk/node/27">Dead Buddy</a> toys.</p>
<p><span id="more-57246"></span></p>
<p>LuckyBoySunday&#8217;s home line features colorful pillows and throws in everything from harlequin patterns to motifs like cry babies, six-fingered hands, and Uffies, or beanie wearing creatures that are afraid of shadows. Their imagery straddles the line between cute and slightly disturbing, but every piece radiates impeccable Danish design. Their toys are just as suitable for adults as they are for children and seem to hint at Tim Burton and Edward Gorey with their often dour or perplexed expressions. Their latest collection, Soft Light, is all about sunny pastel colors, but there are a few mustachioed men with eye patches and giant eyeballs to keep it interesting.</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F85379432&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to be premiering a new track from my old friends <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teramelosmusic" title="Tera Melos">Tera Melos</a> called &#8220;Bite&#8221;. It&#8217;s taken from their upcoming record <em>X&#8217;ed Out</em> which comes out on April 16. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the band they&#8217;ve been described as making &#8220;math rock&#8221;, that they&#8217;re &#8220;jazz inspired&#8221;, that their sound is something like &#8220;Beach Boys meets The Flaming Lips.&#8221; I can say with certainty that these descriptions and influences are true as I grew up with two guys from the band, Nick and Nathan, so I have a bit of a unique perspective.</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve heard of the <em>X&#8217;ed Out</em> this is their most ambitious effort yet. &#8220;Bite&#8221; actually reminds me of a pop inspired version of a Deftones song, but with a lot more complexity. I&#8217;m also getting a Primus vibe when it comes to the drums, in particular. That&#8217;s an odd combination but it&#8217;s exactly what makes Tera Melos such a unique band. I think it&#8217;s also interesting how the track is mixed, with the vocals being at an equal weight to the rest of the instruments. Lead singer Nick Reinhart&#8217;s voice and choruses float and along with the other instruments, combining to create a cohesive whole.</p>
<p><span id="more-57294"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F78822863&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe></p>
<p>You should also take a listen to &#8220;Sunburn&#8221; which is also on <em>X&#8217;ed Out</em>. It&#8217;s a serious summer time jam which totally defies anything they&#8217;ve done before, which I think is a great step for them to take. The guys have always been influenced by pop music, so why not let that shine through? This song is still 1000x better than what you hear on most radio stations. </p>

<p>I featured the work of the Finnish illustrator and designer <a href="http://www.janinerewell.com/">Janine Rewell</a> on The Fox Is Black <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2011/08/16/illustrations-by-janine-rewell/">nearly two-years ago</a>. Since then it would seem that her work has only gone from strength-to-strenghth. Jaine studied at both Helsinki&#8217;s <i>University of Art and Design</I>, as well the <i>Rhode Island School of Desgin</i>, and she now lives and works in Helsinki where she is represented by the wonderful <a href="http://www.agentpekka.com/illustrators/janine-rewell/">Agent Pekka</a>. </p>

<p>Since I last checked in with Janine she&#8217;s been really busy, holding both solo exhibitions and group exhibitions. She has also been illustrating for an impressive number of clients including <em>Toyota</em>, <em>Nokia</em>, <em>Swarovski</em>, <em>Businessweek</em> and <em>Finnair</em>. I particularly love the limited edition teapot she designed for <em>Crate &#038; Barrel</em> last year as part of their 50th anniversary collection.</p>

<p>The variety of Janine&#8217;s work is what I think I like most about it. Her illustrations can be seen in a number of places including on posters and in magazines. It&#8217;s also been painted on porcelain, displayed in Christmas windows and even features on packaging design (such as the <em>Arla Filmjolk</em> sour milk packaging seen above). </p>

<p>Janine Rewell has a particularly nice website so make sure to <a href="http://www.janinerewell.com/">give it a visit</a> as soon as you can and check out more of her great work!</p>

<p>Artists <a href="http://harveyjames.tumblr.com/" title="James Harvey">James Harvey</a> and <a href="http://ryanhumphrey.co.uk/" title="Ryan Humphrey">Ryan Humphrey</a> have brewed up what just might be one of the coolest art projects I&#8217;ve seen in quite a while: Bartkira. The goal of the project is recreate all 6 volumes of Akira using characters from The Simpsons to tell the story, a massive goal. Each participant would have to create 5 pages each, meaning 768 people would need to participate to finish all six volumes. As it turns out, that wasn&#8217;t a problem as 768 have already signed up. Pretty cool, right?</p>
<p>(Also, I think it&#8217;s important to point out that yes, Ralph is Akira, so why is it called Bartkira? Well, Akiralph doesn&#8217;t do a good job of communicating what the project is about. Before you read this post you instantly knew that this was about Bart Simspon and Akira.)</p>
<p>As for the story itself you have Bart as Kaneda, Milhouse as Tetsuo, and of course, Ralph Quimby as Akira. You can <a href="http://harveyjames.tumblr.com/post/46123764908/springfield-is-about-to-eoxopolooodoe-whew-just" title="Bartkira cast of characters">click here</a> for a full rundown of all the characters. Under the jump I&#8217;ve included some of the art from the project that I really liked.

<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//mvrdv_porous_city_07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57333" alt="MVRDV Porous City" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//mvrdv_porous_city_07.jpg" width="800" height="529" /></a></p>
<p>Even if they weren&#8217;t your favorite, you may have spent a portion of your childhood building things out of blocks. I loved playing with the blocks at school because they were huge; I could stack the pieces into symmetrical piles half my height and stomp around the mess durring recess. Sadly, at home I was relegated to playing with lincoln logs or Legos, neither of which are any fun to stomp on with bare feet. As it turns out, some architects grow up and never stop playing with blocks. Instead, when these architects start to work/play, the result becomes more complex than anything I made when I was little and their building blocks become much more expensive. But not always.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//mvrdv_porous_city_04.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57335" alt="MVRDV Porous City" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//mvrdv_porous_city_04.jpg" width="800" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>Here are two recent works by the Dutch firm <a href="http://www.mvrdv.nl/">MVRDV</a>. To me, most of the firm&#8217;s work can appear blocky at times, but these <a href="http://www.bustler.net/index.php/article/mvrdv_builds_porous_city_exhibition_with_legos_in_cannes/">tall white towers made for an exhibition in Cannes</a> are especially blocky because they are made from white legos. The exhibition is called <em>Porous City</em> and these towers (which were made with help from <a href="http://www.thewhyfactory.com/">the Why Factory)</a> are investigations about how to break up the solid mass of a skyscraper. These legos are the building blocks that aren&#8217;t so expensive.</p>
<p><span id="more-57312"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//60159521_3b04c98c70.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57338" alt="MVRDV Oslo Norway Blocky DnB" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//60159521_3b04c98c70.jpeg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//60159559_7c43c5c9c4.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57337" alt="MVRDV Oslo Norway DnB" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//60159559_7c43c5c9c4.jpeg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>The expensive building blocks are the ones used for building the new DnB NOR headquarters in Oslo. And they&#8217;re not super expensive for a building&#8230; just more expensive than legos. And maybe after seeing the massing of the towers in the exhibition, it&#8217;s not surprising that this project is the work of the same firm. The headquarters is an intricate mass of cubic modules that come together to resemble a game of Tetris gone berserk. Communal spaces (which read from the exterior as glass pixels) wind their way through the building, connecting all the way from the entryway to a rooftop bar. It&#8217;s a project that is playful while at the same time responding to the demands of the client and climate. These works are not just whims of an architect, but serious play that&#8217;s advancing an architectural inquiry one block at a time.</p>

<p>The Irish duo have a really great eye for color and pattern, and their work manages to feel both fresh and modern while still maintaining a vintage feel. Over the last few years they&#8217;ve been pouring their illustrative talents into a variety of fun and exciting projects including a range of cards and wrapping paper as well as cushions and even <a href="http://poppyandred.com/111812/1022684/gallery/kovet-iphone-case-designs">iPhone cases</a>.

<p><a href="http://brianallensimon.com/" title="Anenon">Anenon</a> is the musical moniker of L.A. based musician Brian Allen Simon, and he&#8217;s just released a new EP titled <em>Sunsets and Clocks</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Anenon recorded &#8216;Sunsets and Clocks&#8217; in the weeks directly preceding a whirlwind tour of Japan, where expectations and preconceptions (both false and true), collided over and over again in anticipation of the trip to come. In this collection of songs, Brian Allen Simon shares that intimate space, where he was both highly conscious of the relentless march of time and simultaneously removing himself from it, delving into an inner space where the lack of time smeared memories, fantasies, and fears into one another.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title track above is something I&#8217;ve been listening to on repeat for the past week or so. It&#8217;s got this saxophone part that loops over and over that&#8217;s absolutely beautiful. Add in some hand claps and steady backbeat and you&#8217;ve got yourself quite an infectious track. He also has <a href="http://nonprojects.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-sunsets-and-clocks-photo-book-by-brian-allen-simon">a limited edition book of photos</a> that&#8217;s meant to accompany the album, providing a visual element to the musical tracks.</p>

<p>If there&#8217;s any one band known for its music videos it&#8217;s <a href="http://okgo.net/">OK Go</a>. The LA-based quartet began making indie rock in the early 2000&#8242;s only to have their career explode following the release of the music video &#8220;Here it Goes Again&#8221;, which featured the band performing a choreographed dance number on treadmills. Within six days of being posted on You Tube, the video had one million views, and it catalyzed a clever, over-the-top video style the band has continued to cultivate ever since. They&#8217;ve worked with trained dogs, <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2010/11/09/last-leaf-by-ok-go-video-by-geoff-mcfetridge/">toast</a>, the dance company <a href="http://www.pilobolus.com/home.jsp">Pilobulus</a>, and even collaborated on an intricate (and truly amazing) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w">Rube Goldberg Machine</a> experiment. But for their next video they want you to come up with something.</p>
<p><span id="more-57224"></span></p>
<p>Currently recording their new album, OK Go have partnered with <a href="http://www.saatchi.com/en/news/okgo">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and Talenthouse</a> for a music video challenge. They&#8217;ve released the new track &#8220;I&#8217;m Not Through&#8221; and ask that aspiring filmmakers use it to make a video for the band. Lead singer Damian Kulash asks that people &#8220;make a good video&#8230; a boundary pushing video.&#8221; No pressure, of course, but if their last video for &#8220;Needing Getting&#8221; is any indication, ingenuity, insanity, and a whole lot of fun will be requirements.</p>

<p>Odd pairings are always interesting. Earlier today Alec Bladwin released a new episode of his podcast <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/" title="Here's The Thing with Alec Baldwin">Here&#8217;s The Thing</a> featuring Radiohead and Atoms For Peace frontman Thom Yorke. To me, it sounds like an incredibly odd pairing, the movie star and the rock star, trading stories and getting deep. But the end result is actually quite interesting to listen to. Baldwin is a fantastic host who can masterfully guide the conversation to get such wonderful answers out of Yorke, while Yorke actually turns out to be a delightful, chatty guest. Highly recommended if you&#8217;re a fan of either of these guys.</p>

<p><em>Update: I wrote this at 5am, and that was a poor decision. I&#8217;ve rewritten this to be clearer and easier to understand.</em></p>
<p>On April 1, 2007, after a long bout of not understanding what I wanted to do in life, I decided that it might be fun to start a blog. I didn&#8217;t know anything about running a blog. I didn&#8217;t know any HTML or CSS, and my writing skills were mediocre at best. But I was excited to share my thoughts and my ideas and anything else that might pop into my head. That enthusiasm has now led me to write nearly every day for six years straight, a feat I never imagined happening. Currently, the site has three full-time writers and 5 part-time writers, all of which add so much value to the site. I trust the taste and opinions of these folks so much and I feel like they help to round out our content in so many ways. Without them the site wouldn&#8217;t be what it is, so a huge thanks to them.</p>
<p>I also need to say thanks to anyone who&#8217;s reading this. Running a website is hard work, especially when you have a day job like I do. But I&#8217;ve had the experience of meeting and interacting with so many rad people in the world because of this website, and for that I&#8217;m eternally grateful. Thank you so much for reading and supporting The Fox Is Black.</p>
<p>As with each anniversary I try and refine the site, making the experience better in subtle ways. With this &#8220;redesign&#8221; there are many style changes, like the texture in the background of the page, plus a lot of larger improvements that I&#8217;m really excited about. These were all made possible thanks to my friend <a href="http://look.itst.im/" title="Tim Mather">Tim Mather</a>, who you might know as one of the founders of the app <a href="https://untappd.com/" title="Untappd">Untappd</a>. He did an amazing job of turing my design into beautifully functioning code.</p>
<p>Under the jump I&#8217;ve put a list of features that are new or updated on the site. This will be particularly interesting to design and web design lovers.</p>
<p><span id="more-57158"></span></p>
<p><big>Responsibly Responsive</big><br />
The site has been responsive for a while now but in it&#8217;s current incarnation it means serious business. Whether you&#8217;re viewing the site on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device you&#8217;re getting the optimal view. I read a lot of back and forth about how important responsive design is or isn&#8217;t, but for TFIB it&#8217;s a must, the content needs to read well on any sized device.</p>
<p><big>Extremely Touchable</big><br />
I&#8217;ve been concerned with the legibility of the site for a while now, but the touchability was a new factor I was really interested in. <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1699">This post by Luke Wroblewski</a> does a good job of summing up a lot of the thoughts around touchability. Essentially with the rise of tablets and hybrid devices like touchscreen laptops it&#8217;s important to have large hit areas. So the size of the main nav has been increased to accomodate for fingers and the Older/Newer buttons are chunky, being larger than 44px x 44px, the web standard.</p>
<p><big>Author Information</big><br />
A problem that the site faced was that readers were often confused by who wrote which post. The info was always there, but it was obviously not large enough for readers to find it. Now we&#8217;ve got a nice big block of author information, making it clear not only who wrote the post but having the ability to read more posts from that author. </p>
<p><big>Big Footer</big><br />
For years now I&#8217;ve played with the idea of adding a footer to the site. The footer is a powerful tool for helping readers find more content, to give them something to do when they hit the bottom of the page. I was also really inspired by the footer on <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/" title="It's Nice That">It&#8217;s Nice That</a>, which I always felt did a good job of sharing lots of information in a clean and uniform way. So I went for it and created a big footer with lots of info. There&#8217;s a big block of categories, you can view the site by month, you can get in touch with me, read the posts of a certain writer, or search the site. Lots of opportunities down there.</p>
<p><big>Pagination Is Back</big><br />
A complaint I heard every now and then is that it was hard for readers to get to older content. Now with pagination back I think it&#8217;ll be a lot easier. You can always change the page number in the URL or use the month by month navigation in the footer.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for all the support from readers, artists, designers, and anyone else who&#8217;s helped me along the way. We still have a few more tricks we&#8217;re going to be rolling out in the next few days, one of which I think is pretty awesome. I&#8217;ll be sure to write about it once it goes into effect.</p>
