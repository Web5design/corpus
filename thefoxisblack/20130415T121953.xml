<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41002/painting-place-an-interview-with-fleurette-west/">Painting Place: An Interview With Fleurette West</a></big><br />
Artist Fleurette West is really inspired by her surroundings. Her paintings are about place but do not represent how the place looks: she represents how the place feels. She ties all of this together in ways that are bright and abstract and really do give a feel for a part of town. Her story of getting to art through behavioral sciences is fascinating, too.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41004/helping-urs-fischer-at-moca/">Helping Urs Fischer At MOCA</a></big><br />
Urs Fischer has a huge MOCA show coming up. What is he doing for it? He had tons of LA people make clay things for him. Not just little things: people went batshit insane and made huge, crazy clay pieces for him. We went and helped him out and, boy, was it wild. You may see some familiar items at the show, namely a black fox.</p>
<p><span id="more-58042"></span></p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41285/wandering-through-pink-offices-stephen-prinas-as-he-remembered-it/">Wandering Through Pink Offices: Stephen Prina&#8217;s <i>As He Remebered It</i></a></big><br />
LACMA&#8217;s entry into the new, not-as-hyped Pacific Standard Time architecture show is a collection of Shindler furniture painted bright pink and organized like they are in an invisible house. What is this? Stephen Prina&#8217;s <i>As He Remembered It</i>, a show based on his seeing a bright pink Schindler desk in an office window on La Brea that obviously did not belong. It&#8217;s a really special show.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41408/duc-kein-has-a-jacket-for-you/">Duc Kien US Jean Jackets</a></big><br />
Duc Kien US is hoping to be your new jean maker. How are they getting their start? With a really sleek jean jacket that is super, super streamlined and very nice. They&#8217;re currently Kickstarting the effort and have already gotten lots of accolades, namely by way of GQ. If you are looking for a light jacket, consider purchasing this affordable, high-end item.</p>
<p><big><a href="http://www.laimyours.com/41409/symmetria/">Symmetía</a></big><br />
Graphic designer Victoria Macey is inspired by what she sees in Los Angeles. What does this mean? She has been taking imagery that surrounds her and turning it into very neat, abstract patterns. It&#8217;s a very simple concept and the link between pattern and reference is balanced so delicately that you have to pay attention to them. We love these!</p>
<p>Some items that barely missed the cut: we have a new series called <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/category/where-shall-we-meet/">Where Shall We Meet?</a> that suggests meeting and working places in LA and one of our contributors found a <a href="http://www.laimyours.com/40992/unseen-la-a-hidden-noguchi-museum/">hidden Noguchi museum</a> in Costa Mesa.</p>

<p>The last time I wrote about an endangered building it was <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2012/01/06/should-neutras-cyclorama-be-demolished/">Richard Neutra&#8217;s 1963 Cyclorama at Gettysburg</a>. After years of legal battle, the 50 year old building was demolished just last month. It&#8217;s a disappointing outcome, but the building did stand for five decades which is longer than many buildings. Sadly, one of those buildings that will not make it to the fifty year mark is the <a href="http://www.folkartmuseum.org/">American Folk Art Museum</a> by <a href="http://www.twbta.com/">Tod Williams and Billie Tsien</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-58029"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58037" alt="American Folk Art Museum Tod Williams Billie Tsien Demolition MoMA" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//AFAM_01.jpg" width="800" height="619" /></a></p>
<p>Completed just twelve years ago, the distinctive and small museum sits next to MoMA on 53rd street in Manhattan. It won several awards upon its completion and has a remarkable facade that uses folded planes of a bronze alloy called tombasil in a way which looks hand-forged. MoMA bought the building a couple of years ago after the Folk Art Museum ran into financial hot water which forced the institution to pack up the folk arts and relocate. So after years of mulling over what was to become of the funny little building next to it, MoMA announced this week <a href="http://www.designboom.com/architecture/american-folk-art-museum-destined-for-demolition/">they plan to tear it down</a>. Why? According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/arts/design/moma-to-raze-ex-american-folk-art-museum-building.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">an article in the NYT</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MoMA officials said the building’s design did not fit their plans because the opaque facade is not in keeping with the glass aesthetic of the rest of the museum. The former folk museum is also set back farther than MoMA’s other properties, and the floors would not line up.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m biased or just annoyed, but when I read the snippet above, I think &#8220;so MoMA is tearing this building down because they can&#8217;t see through the front of it?&#8221; I know it&#8217;s more complicated than that, but Folk Art Museum&#8217;s former building deserves better rationale for it&#8217;s demolition than &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t match.&#8221; The bigger problem to me isn&#8217;t that the museum officials can&#8217;t see through bronze alloy, but that they can&#8217;t see or imagine a future where they would protect an architecturally significant project in their possession. If the leadership of MoMA is being this myopic about the expansion of their campus, what other terrible decisions are they making when it comes to doing what museums are supposed to do?</p>

<p>For the last two days Kyle and I have been hanging out in Las Vegas. Yesterday was my mother&#8217;s 60th birthday and she wanted to spend it here. I haven&#8217;t been here for about 5 or 6 years, but in that short period of time things have changed quite a bit. It&#8217;s more polished, less kid-friendly, but essentially how it was. We ended up staying at the <a href="http://www.arialasvegas.com/" title="Aria Resort and Casino">Aria</a>, an extremely contemporary casino that was opened in 2009. It actually fits me and Kyle quite well, eschewing the kitch of most Las Vegas hotels.</p>
<p>Situated next to the Aria though is essentially a super fancy mall called <a href="http://www.crystalsatcitycenter.com/" title="Crystals at City Center">Crystals at City Center</a>. There are shops from all the major fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford, Gucci, Saint Laurent, etc. It&#8217;s Rodeo Drive contained in a beautiful, Daniel Libeskind designed building (which also happens to be LEED+ certified). Walking around the shops I started to take notice of just how on-point everything was, how all the details were done right. This isn&#8217;t necessarily a surprise by any means, but when you look at these shops from purely a design perspective it&#8217;s actualyl quite fascinating. </p>
<p><span id="more-58048"></span></p>
<p>Below are a series of photos I took of the Crystals, the interiors and exteriors of shops, and so on. I found a lot of inspiration in these, so I thought I&#8217;d post share them. Perhaps you&#8217;ll find something that piques your interest as well?</p>

<p>Last year the fashion designer <a href="http://www.rebeccatorres.co.uk/">Rebecca Torres</a> collaborated with illustrator <a href="http://www.saskiapomeroy.com">Saskia Pomeroy</a> to create a bold and brash collection for women. Her vision was to create a line which drew inspiration from her signature style whilst also captured the raw essence of native, ancient and decorative arts. Fortunately Saskia was the perfect partner to see that vision come to life.</p>
<p><span id="more-57552"></span></p>
<p>The Glasgow-born duos work is filled with bold and bright colors. Combing modern fabrics and a daring brashness, this collection is a wonderful combination of both Torres and Pomeroy&#8217;s unique styles. The photographs by <a href="http://www.joelandmattias.com/">Joel &#038; Mattias</a> also do a great job of capturing the vibrancy and playfulness of the collection. </p>

<p>ADHD sounds like an affliction, and it is. If you&#8217;ve caught snippets of FOX&#8217;s latest cartoon series online or follow their hilarious <a href="http://foxadhd.tumblr.com">GIFs on Tumblr</a>, then you&#8217;re probably already hooked on what I&#8217;m decreeing is the best thing to happen to animation in eons. Referencing pop culture and the completely non sequitur, <a href="http://www.fox.com/programming/shows/?sh=animation-domination-hd">Animation Domination High-Def</a> (the official title) will be a block of adult animation airing every Saturday night from 11pm &#8211; 12:30am starting on July 27. It will feature the new series <em>Axe Cop</em>, originally created by a five-year-old, as well as 50 original short-form pieces. Currently, the online content encompasses everything from a <em>Saved by the Bell</em> spoof (retitled &#8220;Saved by the Horn&#8221;) featuring a dance contest and pizza spirit guide to a Charlie Brown/Louis CK mashup that sees the whole Peanuts gang as dysfunctional grown-ups.</p>
<p><span id="more-57919"></span></p>
<p>While FOX&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fox.com/animationdomination/">Animation Domination</a> block of programming on Sundays continues to entertain, ADHD feels like it&#8217;s scrappier little brother, the one prone to pulling dastardly R-rated pranks on you while you sleep. (It&#8217;s also prone to incite belly laughs while you try to watch it covertly at work.) There are so many gems currently on its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FOXADHD">You Tube</a> channel that it was hard to pick one. &#8220;Future Travel&#8221; is a collaboration with the <a href="http://www.blinkink.co.uk/#!artist_layzellbros">Layzell Bros</a> that imagines love in the future, while &#8220;Pikachu Gets Pokemon Rabies&#8221; is exactly what you might imagine that title to be.  My current favorite, though, is &#8220;Really Clever Girl&#8221;, a ridiculous homage to <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p>

<p>Looking at Jamian&#8217;s work, one of the first things I was reminded of was the work of <a href="http://ausgangart.com/">Anthony Ausgang</a>, whose work occupies a similar aesthetic realm and utilizes some of the same motifs and cartoon-like characters. Jamian&#8217;s figures are whimsical and familiar but have a dark, dreamlike quality that is like a child&#8217;s nightmare filtered through naive imagery. In one image a pair of bell-bottom-clad legs with Mickey Mouse arms is discovered hanging by its neck-waist, which is also the belt around its goofy pants. Another image features shirtless pig-humans that look a lot like the thing from Super Mario Bros. 2 that shot eggs out of its nose (<em>Editor&#8217;s Note</em>: She was called <a href="http://www.mariowiki.com/Birdo" title="Birdo">Birdo</a>). It all looks a lot like the subconscious imaginings of a kid who&#8217;s overdosed on cartoons and early 90&#8242;s video games.

<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/12/crossing-over-into-bonobos-the-north-borders/bonobo/" rel="attachment wp-att-57955"><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//bonobo-800x629.jpeg" alt="bonobo" width="800" height="629" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-57955" /></a></p>
<p>The career of Sean Green, aka <a href="http://bonobomusic.com/">Bonobo</a>, has been one of slow yet steady ascent. A DJ and producer, his debut record <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Magic-Bonobo/dp/B00004VWWG"><em>Animal Magic</em></a> contained the trademarks of a man impressed in the details. One could listen to the record without realizing the jazzy, funkified trip-hop beats have been playing and seeping into your brain. The sitars ring, the guitar strings fuzz, drums mute, and all of a sudden the listener is transfixed. When <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sands-Bonobo/dp/B0035UHJCE/ref=pd_sim_m_4">Black Sands</a> came out in 2010, the formula was complete &#8211; global melodies, hip hop precussion, a meditative producers touch. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7m86aMNjlQ">&#8220;Kiara&#8221;</a> remains one of my favorite &#8220;play-this-any-time-of-day&#8221; track of the past 5 years, while &#8220;Eyesdown&#8221; is the most seductive 9 megabytes available for remixes. Listening to <em>Black Sands</em> can be akin to sitting in a Van der Rohe chair. The details are everywhere, you just have to look.</p>
<p>So needless to say, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-North-Borders/dp/B00C0YQLDE/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1365706278&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=bonobo+north+borders">The North Borders</a> might be the most anticipated release on Ninja Tune this year.</p>
<p><span id="more-57496"></span></p>
<p><iframe src='http://aff7ba5452b19562188d-94a4304dda9e3fda4b4cf2a2dd1232a0.r28.cf1.rackcdn.com/136578005751682659a5c582.41859154.html' width='650' height='250' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0'></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of diverging from his formula, Bonobo uses this record as a chance to expand and elaborate on the ideas crystallized so well in <em>Black Sands</em>. Earlier in 2013 <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/01/28/cirrus-a-trippy-new-video-for-bonobo-directed-by-cyriak/">Bobby brought you the video for Cirrus</a>, the first single. With impulsive, whimsical energy, the percussion builds the cyclical song into a swarming mess. Erykah Badu herself makes an appearance in &#8220;Heaven for a Sinner,&#8221; a track built so well for the chanteuse that I can&#8217;t imagine them not working together. Yet the meditative complexes of the record showcase Bonobo&#8217;s finest talents. &#8220;First Fire&#8221; drips with infatuation, Grey Reverend croons “Honestly I can’t believe it’s burning again / Like the first fire,” and wine glasses clink as lips entwine. &#8220;Jets&#8221; is an instant mainstay for any lounge worldwide while &#8220;Antennae&#8221; will populate every urbanite&#8217;s travel mix, public transportation be warned.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t <em>Black Sands</em> Part Deux; this is a border you want to cross. Feel free to hire your <em>coyote</em> for this one. </p>

<p>Life can get hectic, and sometimes I wish being stranded on a desert island was an option&#8230; for like, a weekend. I would catch-up on some reading, get a tan, think about life, maybe play some cards. In essence, I would re-group. The one thing I wouldn’t expect to think about would be what I was wearing, and if my clothes were in season. The west coast based surf and skate shop <a href="http://sitka.ca/">Sitka</a>, has put some serious thought into the desert island dream for the concept of their Fall/Winter 2013 ad campaign with <i><a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/58869875">Stranded</a></i>, a short film directed by Benjamin Schuetze and Ben Gulliver.</p>
<p>The production on <i>Stranded</i> is phenomenal. For at least 6 of the 8 minute film, it had me fashionably duped before I realized I was essentially watching a commercial. <i>Stranded</i> is a novel and a seriously fun way that Sitka’s brand can reach farther than any print campaign possibly could</p>

<p>This beautifully austere science building addition is on the campus of the University of Alcalá in Spain, and from the drafting boards of <a href="http://www.hfelorza.com/">Héctor Fernández Elorza</a>. Because the technological and spatial needs of research buildings tend to evolve quickly, the original building was in desperate need of a renovation to bring the building up to the working standards of a modern facility.</p>
<p><span id="more-57913"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/52888858?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<p>One example would be the importantance that the space expands to accommodate new genetics research and office facilities. <a href="http://www.archdaily.com/355917/faculty-of-cellular-and-genetic-biology-hector-fernandez-elorza/">The result</a> is an elegantly top heavy slice of building that is long but Shallow. You can see the extensive use of naturally-colored materials in the video along with the excess of natural light that floods the corridors and rooms of the addition. Of course, it helps to have photographers/videographers like <a href="http://m-ra.es/">Montse Aamorano</a> showing the building in the best possible light.</p>

<p>The Milan Furniture Fair, or <a href="http://www.cosmit.it/tool/home.php?s=0,2,67,71,75">Salone Internazionale del Mobile</a>, is happening this week, and it will feature a new collaboration between renowned Italian design company <a href="http://www.alessi.com/en/">Alessi</a> and Swedish design studio <a href="http://www.big-game.ch/index.php?home">Big Game</a>. Alberto Alessi specifically asked the studio to create &#8220;anonymous Swiss objects&#8221; and , as a reference, cited a classic 1930&#8242;s Swiss toolbox. Big Game took the suggestion quite literally and created a series of CARGO objects, pairing their streamlined aesthetics with colorful utilitarian simplicity.</p>
<p><span id="more-57899"></span></p>
<p>The CARGO toolbox reinvents Alessi&#8217;s request. The handles are a light, smooth wood anchored by hyper-colored plastic with three simple compartments. There&#8217;s also a hammer—because &#8220;everybody needs one at home&#8221;—made with a light wooden handle and an elegantly modernized hammer head. Though based in Sweden and fully steeped in those aesthetics, Big Game also chose to reference Japan with the CARGO catchall inspired by traditional Japanese wooden carrying boxes. There&#8217;s no word on if the products will be made available for purchase yet, but our fingers are crossed.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//The-Quiet-City-Winter-in-Paris-1.jpg" alt="The Quiet City - Winter in Paris" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57567" /></p>
<p>This winter has hung around for far too long. Last month the UK saw their second coldest March on record and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that I&#8217;ve had enough with snow, the cold and everything else that comes with this horrendous weather&#8230; that is, until I saw this beautiful video of Paris in wintertime by <a href="https://vimeo.com/andrewjulian/videos">Andrew Julian</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-57553"></span>Paris is undoubtedly one of the prettiest cities in the world and Andrew&#8217;s video capture so much of what is to love about the place. Filmed on a recent trip to France, the video is filled with many of the city&#8217;s most famous sights, but unlike each time that I&#8217;ve been there, Andrew seems to be able to capture these locations without the hoards of tourists that so often get in the way. His portrait of Paris is a far more tranquil, empty and &#8211; as his title puts it &#8211; quite city. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//The-Quiet-City-Winter-in-Paris-2.jpg" alt="The Quiet City - Winter in Paris" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57568" /></p>
<p>Andrew explains: “Until this trip, I had only ever experienced Paris in the summer and I was struck by just how different the city is when most of us tourist are gone. We were equipped with our metro and museum passes and were able to easily access most places of interest without even waiting in line. It was incredible!” Andrew&#8217;s video has me wishing it was winter all over again so I could grab my passport and head to Paris right away! </p>

<p>For those wondering about the music in the video, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiegel_im_Spiegel">Spiegel im Spiegel</a> by Arvo Pärt. You should also check out Andrew&#8217;s <a href="https://vimeo.com/andrewjulian/videos">Vimeo page</a> to see more of his work including videos from Big Sur, Utah, Mexico and more. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//bitcoin-explained.png" alt="Bitcoin Explained (video)" width="958" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57894" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m endlessly fascinated by the idea of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency that&#8217;s certainly shaking up the ideas of traditional financial institutions. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar, read this excerpt from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" title="Bitcoin">the Wikipedia article on Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency based on an open-source, peer-to-peer internet protocol. It was introduced in 2009 by a pseudonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoins can be exchanged through a computer or smartphone locally or internationally without an intermediate financial institution. In trade, one bitcoin is subdivided into 100 million smaller units called satoshis, defined by eight decimal places.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is not managed like typical currencies: it has no central bank or central organization. Instead, it relies on an Internet-based peer-to-peer network. The money supply is automated and given to servers or &#8220;bitcoin miners&#8221; that confirm bitcoin transactions as they add them to a decentralized and archived transaction log approximately every 10 minutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The well-produced video below gives a really great sense of illustrating what Bitcoin is and how it works. It seriously feels like the future of currency, even if Bitcoin isn&#8217;t necessarily the future itself. Watch and learn.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//OMA_ToolsForLiving3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57857" alt="OMA Tools for Living Knoll 3013 Milan" src="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/blogimages//OMA_ToolsForLiving3.jpg" width="800" height="571" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://oma.eu/" title="OMA">OMA</a> and <a href="http://www.knoll.com/knoll_home.jsp">Knoll</a> have officially debuted a new <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2013/04/08/tools-for-life-furniture-by-oma-for-knoll-at-prada-milan/">line of furniture called Tools for Living</a>, in Milan. The kinetic and boxy pieces may look familiar to fashion-savvy readers because they were first seen back in January on the runway of <a href="http://www.gq.com/fashion-shows/blogs/fashion-week/2013/01/prada-throws-a-koolhaas-party.html">Prada&#8217;s 2013 Autumn/Winter Men&#8217;s Runway show</a>. What&#8217;s remarkable is that most of the furniture that makes up Tools for Living is somehow kinetic: it swivels, has complex inner hinges, or an adjustable height. It sounds almost more like a Swiss Army Knife than a line of furniture, but these aren&#8217;t meant to be static and stately pieces, and they&#8217;re called tools for a reason.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tools for Life range is based on the idea that furniture should be understood as a high-performance instrument rather than a design statement. OMA conceived the furniture to facilitate the contemporary flow between work and social life, while adjusting to the different needs of both.</p>
<p>Rem Koolhaas commented: &#8220;We wanted to create a range of furniture that performs in very precise but also in completely unpredictable ways, furniture that not only contributes to the interior but also to the animation of the interior.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news is that the same tools can turn your space into a casual and social space again at the push of a button.</p>

<p>Spring is definitely starting to settle in here in Los Angeles so having a wallpaper to match the vibe is always nice. This week&#8217;s wallpaper is by Toronto based designer and illustrator <a href="http://www.siobhan-gallagher.com/" title="Siobhán Gallagher">Siobhán Gallagher</a>. She wrote me a few months ago, interested in doing a wallpaper, and after having looked through her work I was hooked. I was especially smitten with <a href="http://www.siobhan-gallagher.com/works/illustration/uarts-senior-illustration.html">this poster</a> she did for the University of the Art&#8217;s Senior Illustration Thesis Show, portraying a flock of multi-colored birds.</p>
<p>So I asked Siobhán if she&#8217;d be interested in creating another scene filled with critters, scarab beetles to be exact, and she was totally down with the idea. I absolutely love how this piece turned out. She not only created a slew of differently shaped beetles but the variation in colors and textures are fantastic. I think even people who aren&#8217;t fans of bugs would see the beauty in this wallpaper.</p>
<p>Be sure to check back every Wednesday for a new wallpaper!</p>

<p><a href="http://randrenfrow.com/" title="Rand Renfrow">Rand Renfrow</a> is a Texas based illustrator with probably the best name ever and a great style to match. Every time I see Rand&#8217;s work it makes me really happy because he always creates these unique textures and off the wall colors which give his pieces that unique look. I also really like his take on perspective. It seems like he really enjoys creating these sculptural vignettes that most people probably couldn&#8217;t put together in real life.</p>
<p><span id="more-57863"></span></p>
<p>Rand has just <a href="http://randrenfrow.com/index.html" title="Rand Renfrow">updated his personal site</a> as well as <a href="http://randrenfrow.com/shop.html" title="Rand Renfrow shop">his shop</a> with a pretty sweet subscription service. The deal is you pay $115 and get six zines and six prints distributed over a years time, but there are only 25 spots available. Sounds like a steal to me.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you purchase this you will recieve art in the mail. From me. Rand Renfrow. For one year. This art shall include, at least 6 new zines and 6 new prints, over the course of the next year, shipped right to your home. I&#8217;ll probably toss in a few goodies, so most likely you&#8217;ll get even more than that. If I miss a month, you&#8217;ll get two items the following month. And they won&#8217;t trade off either, you might get 2 or 3 prints in a row, and then 2 zines in a row, who knows. What you are guaranteed is 6 zines and 6 prints. And they won&#8217;t just be screen prints. I&#8217;ll dabble in some other processes. Also, subscribers will receive the new art before anyone on the interenet gets to even see it. So you&#8217;ll have brand new Rand Renfrow editions before the world knows they exist.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4F37Yg17-JQ?rel=0" height="450" width="800" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;re big fans of Swedish electronic duo <a href="http://theknife.net">The Knife</a>. The band&#8217;s latest album, <em>Shaking the Habitual</em>, is finally out this week despite the <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/04/03/listen-to-shaking-the-habitual-the-new-album-from-the-knife/">free stream</a> they gifted to fans earlier in the month. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, they&#8217;ve released a new short film to go along with it called &#8220;The Interview&#8221;, featuring the band explaining the album in their own words. Shot in collaboration with director Marit Östberg (who also directed their provocative video <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2013/02/08/full-of-fire-a-new-music-video-by-the-knife/">&#8220;Full of Fire&#8221;</a>), The Knife&#8217;s Karin Dreijer Andersson and Olof Dreijer layer explanations over natural imagery like clouds, rivers, and swimming swans. &#8220;What we do is political &#8230; the border between normal and strange is erased,&#8221; they explain in tandem.</p>
<p><span id="more-57828"></span></p>
<p>They go on to reveal that the album&#8217;s lyrics are inspired by 1970&#8242;s protest songs from their childhood and how they asked their friends and loved ones for help. &#8220;Through our community, we felt less alone,&#8221; they said noting that they wanted to create music that was impossible to consume in a quick and easy way. The band is known for their esoteric, hard-to-define sound, and this is intentional. They&#8217;ve found that through play and experimentation, as well as using homemade instruments or traditional instruments used in nontraditional ways, often catalyzes something unimaginable.</p>
<p>Inspiration came from books and the &#8220;language of others&#8221; as a means of challenging themselves to shed their former selves and forge ahead as creators in a new way. &#8221;We are people trying to do something we haven&#8217;t done before &#8230; to not reproduce identities that are expected from us,&#8221; they say in the film. Östberg touches upon contemplation through multiple images of swinging on a swingset, as well as hints at transformation with the duo donning wigs and brightly colored clothes. There&#8217;s something celebratory and community-building, as well, with scenes of euphoric dance parties where people are pictured having fun and being who they are in a place devoid of judgement. The band looks at music in a similar way. &#8220;[We] think music can be a tool to create movements, a room where everything is possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recently discovered the work of <a href="http://www.marinamuun.com/">Marinna Muun</a> and I love it! Born in Bulgaria, Munn says that she “grew up all over the place” and now is currently based in the UK. To me, her work feels quite mystical. Her acrylic paintings and digital illustrations mix the unnatural and the supernatural to create characters and illustrations that feel somewhat spiritual or ritualistic.</p>
<p><span id="more-57554"></span>Munn&#8217;s color choices are particularly ace and I love how she mixes the visual-language of the unnatural with that of nature. That top image is especially brilliant! You can check out more of her work by visiting her portfolio <a href="http://www.marinamuun.com/">here</a>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve certainly been on a photography kick today, so I thought I&#8217;d wrap up the day with these amazing photos by <a href="http://www.marktipple.com/" title="Mark Tipple">Mark Tipple</a>. Going where most men fear to tred, Mark takes photographs of waves from below, capturing a swirling chaos that few people ever really experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>We both knew the reefs on the island were shallow; we&#8217;d been there before and surfed the waves, but shooting The Underwater Project dictates no boards and definitely no wetsuits &#8211; meaning the danger of losing skin was increased tenfold. With a wary eye watching for rogue waves I watched as Mike left the water, he stumbled on a few urchin spines adding insult to injury; and I wondered if there was something else that I could shoot underwater.</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-57743"></span></p>
<p>These images are from his underwater project, specifically from his <a href="http://www.marktipple.com/marevida" title="Mark Tipple - Mare Vida photo series">Mare Vida series</a>. What&#8217;s incredible to me is that he&#8217;s able to capture these photographs at all. Somehow he manages to bring a focus to the discord despite the incredible circumstances. You can see many more photos of his photos by <a href="http://www.marktipple.com/" title="Mark Tipple">clicking here</a>. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been kind of terrible at video games. Any video game, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I automatically make anyone else playing a game with me look expertly skilled. It started when I plugged in my very own <a href="http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2010/05/26/safety-first/">Sega Genesis on my seventh birthday</a> and continues to this day when I get together with friends to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson:_The_Experience">Michael Jackson: The Experience</a> on Wii. However, I did have the fleeting experience of skillful gaming one summer when my parents sent my twin sister and I to spend time with our Aunt and Uncle in Minneapolis and they, in turn, sent us to spend time at a computer camp.</p>
<p><span id="more-57749"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I remember from my week as a computer day-camper: dusty gray carpet and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity" title="SimCity">SimCity</a>. I probably played the entire week, not even fully aware that I could deduce the rules that guided city development. Still, by the time I returned home, I knew how to make cities that looked pretty and didn&#8217;t collapse in fifteen minutes. This limited skill set made me pretty popular in the computer lab in 4th grade, and it lasted until the computers were upgraded with CD-ROMs and Microsoft Encarta was installed. Then nobody cared that I could make symmetrical towns with alternating patches of color, they just wanted to put in the Encarta CD and watch the video about the rainforest.</p>

<p>But I didn&#8217;t quit playing.  I stuck around for SimCity2000, SimCity 3000, and even played The Sims before switching from PC to Mac, parting with the Sim universe for nearly a decade now. I&#8217;ve been seeing an awful lot about <a href="http://simcity.com" title="SimCity">the newest release of SimCity</a> on the Internet since its release last month. Plenty of coverage has centered on folks unable to connect to the servers to play online. But the best coverage of the game is what happened with architecture critic <a href="http://nymag.com/arts/architecture/features/sim-city-justin-davidson-2013-4/#print">Justin Davidson sat down to play the game</a>. It&#8217;s truly entertaining to read someone thinking critically about the design of the game that most people play to unwind and turn off their brain for a while. He discovers dubious principles for gameplay success and the less exciting, cumbersome zoning obstacles. And even while thinking critically of the game while he plays it, his city fails. It&#8217;s oddly reassuring to see an expert in one area fail in another. Not because it makes them real people, I know he&#8217;s a real person, but because it makes us feel like we&#8217;re just as capable as some really smart people.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;d probably still fare worse than Davidson or anyone else playing the game today, which is fine. I would get better with practice, making meticulously patterns in concrete and trees before some other advance in digital encyclopedias made my skills obsolete. So I&#8217;ll just think back to all of the thriving cities I created like FrankLloydWrightDreamland or Artown and try to forget my abysmal performance of &#8220;Smooth Criminal&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always associated crocheting with my grandma. I grew up around crochet doilies as a kid and always remember them at holidays or hanging around once-a-year china. Though knitting and embroidery have enjoyed a crafty-cool renaissance in recent years, I&#8217;m surprised the art of crochet hasn&#8217;t been resurrected in the same way. For one, it only uses one needle instead of knitting&#8217;s two, and if the insanely awesome work of <a href="http://www.cardigan.ltd.uk/kate-jenkins.php">Kate Jenkins</a> is any indication, the possibilities for creating something truly unique are endless.</p>
<p><span id="more-57733"></span></p>
<p>Treating the handmade craft as an elevated artform, Jenkins weaves wool and yarn into everything from a diner spread—complete with NYC coffee and a breakfast fry-up—to comic fun like a literal can of worms and &#8220;French&#8221; fries in stripes, mustaches, and berets. Her work (done in her Brighton studio) draws you in with its whimsy, but it&#8217;s the intricate artistry that defies imagination. I had a hard time choosing which pieces to showcase because all are so clever and fun. Thus, I urge you to peruse Jenkins&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cardigan.ltd.uk/exhibitions.php">website</a> to check out the smoked salmon on a bagel (clue: the salmon is smoking) as well as her market collection and crochet cafe. Who wouldn&#8217;t want a a gang of googly-eyed sausages hanging around all the time?</p>
