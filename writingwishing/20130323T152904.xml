				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I have written about this in a different form, maybe more than once, over the last nearly-two years of blogging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This crippling self-inflicted issue of low self-esteem, which grips me seasonally.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-doubt-quote-by-Sylvia-Plath.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6202 aligncenter" alt="Self-doubt quote" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-doubt-quote-by-Sylvia-Plath.jpg" width="672" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I&#8217;m not good enough. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Everyone else is better than me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I suck.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I should quit.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I should be good at this, why am I not good at this?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why do I feel the need for validation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am all woe-is-me for a few days (okay, weeks), and I truly question myself. I doubt everything I do. I second-guess every decision I make. I want to curl up in a corner and eat chocolate. I berate myself endlessly. I talk myself into a tizzy of not-good-enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, I come crashing down in a pile. I lie there, and I just don&#8217;t want to face it, whatever<em> it</em> is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, I raise my head. I push myself up. I reach out to a *trusted friend. I pour my heart out. I ask for advice (not for validation). I am asked some hard questions. I try to find answers. I am talked off the ledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slowly, I come back to life. I find a renewed sense of purpose. I feel the energy coming back. My mind is buzzing again, with good vibes. There is light at the end of the tunnel. I feel a little more like myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tiptoe gingerly around the things that brought me down in the first place. I look at them objectively. I talk to people. I approach it from another angle. I realize, it&#8217;s not that bad after all. I am not that bad after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisis in confidence &#8211; over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until we meet again in a few months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* Thanks, <a href="http://thestrategicmama.com" target="_blank">Vanita</a>, for being there for me, and lending me a listening ear. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>How do you overcome any confidence issues? Do you have confidence issues? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Motherhood-is-crazy.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6174" alt="Motherhood is crazy" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Motherhood-is-crazy.jpg" width="438" height="404" /></a>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to the place of pain where my stomach felt like it was being ripped out</p>
<p>to the point where my knees meet the floor as gravity pulls</p>
<p>to the very ends of my physical strength and endurance</p>
<p>to a place where inhibitions were shed</p>
<p>to a state of mind where happiness and sadness collide</p>
<p>to a plane of joy where my heart expanded, and contracted, just like my insides.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to the edges of sanity</p>
<p>to a screaming voice that cannot be mine</p>
<p>to the middle of a crying storm</p>
<p>to a peace of mind</p>
<p>to a heart beating for two now</p>
<p>to feelings so alien yet familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to gentle sighs</p>
<p>to tiny limbs and big eyes</p>
<p>to giggles and laughter so true</p>
<p>to cheering on of little steps</p>
<p>to hands that clasp fingers so naturally</p>
<p>to a warm body next to mine in a space that was never there before.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to arms and legs going forth</p>
<p>to talking voices and questioning minds</p>
<p>to hearts in hands as a part of us grow further away</p>
<p>to hearts in throats as pain is more than just a scrape on the outside</p>
<p>to open arms as salve to soothe the hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to highs so high and lows so low</p>
<p>to thoughts so deep and so shallow</p>
<p>to others who are the same, but different</p>
<p>to come to a love undefinable</p>
<p>to moments of great wisdom and silliness</p>
<p>to the point of no return.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where has motherhood or parenting taken you?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember those Internet memes everyone was doing years ago via email or Facebook notes (I didn&#8217;t blog then), where you&#8217;ll answer some questions, tag some people and spread the word?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elaine of <a href="http://www.misselaineouslife.com/2013/03/old-school-blogging-march.html" target="_blank">The Miss Elaine-ous Life</a> and Heather of <a href="http://thetamom.com" target="_blank">Theta Mom</a> are bringing Old School Blogging back in style every month! (I am more than excited about this &#8211; does it show my age?)</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.misselaineouslife.com" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff437/elainea1/OSBimage125.jpg" border="0" /></a></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What were you doing 10 years ago?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was working at a public relations agency, I was single and I was loving being 26 going on 27. It was also the year I met my husband, though we didn&#8217;t get together until the following year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What  5 Things are on your To Do List?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arrange a play date for next week with my cousin and her 10.5 month old daughter. They&#8217;re visiting from Australia and I&#8217;m so excited to meet her baby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finish my articles for<a href="http://everydayfamily.com" target="_blank"> Everyday Family</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spring clean my boys&#8217; wardrobes. They have outgrown so many things. Cue tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on some top secret stuff for <a href="http://littlelovemedia.com" target="_blank">Little Love Media</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meal plan for next week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What 5 snacks do you enjoy?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chocolate. My downfall and indulgence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bananas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homemade granola with Greek yogurt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Raisins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My children&#8217;s leftovers. Okay, technically not something I <em>enjoy</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some things you would do if you were a millionaire.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One million doesn&#8217;t stretch too far these days, does it? I&#8217;d give it to charity. Charities that help impoverished women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some places you have lived.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ipoh, where I was born. Leeds, United Kingdom, where I went to university. Kuala Lumpur, where I live now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some bad habits you have.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I stay up too late. I don&#8217;t drink enough water (though I am trying to be better at this).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some jobs you have had.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waitress. Bartender. Administrative assistant at stockbroking firm. Internet advertising sales person. Events planner. Public relations manager. Marketing manager. Now, I write freelance, and I run and own Little Love Media, making social media easy for YOU. In between doing all that, I&#8217;m also the official butt/ snot wiper for the young &#8216;uns around here, short order cook, child hugger and entertainer. But that&#8217;s who I am, not what I do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was so fun! Thanks Elaine and Heather for this great idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tell me: what jobs have you had?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do you want to win a $300 Amazon gift card? Then come play along in a fun little game I&#8217;m doing with 22 of my blogger friends, Name That Kindergartner! <a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/2013/03/name-that-kindergartner/" target="_blank">More details here</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>UPDATE: We have our winners! Congratulations to Amy Pike, you&#8217;re the grand prize winner of a $300 Amazon gift card! Congratulations are also in order to our runner-ups, Renee and Julie, enjoy your $80 Amazon gift cards. Thank you all for playing!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was the easy guess in this little game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Then-and-now.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6205" alt="Comparison photos" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Then-and-now.jpg" width="617" height="309" /></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And here are the rest of the answers! How many did you guess right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Name-That-Kindergartner-Answers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6206" alt="Kindergartner game answers" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Name-That-Kindergartner-Answers.jpg" width="650" height="1172" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have vivid memories of kindergarten &#8211; gold stars on little hands for doing a good job; that small hill between the main kindergarten building and the smaller one where the really tiny kids went to; the two swings everyone fought over; the sandbox; the yearly school performance we all partook in, like it or not; the French toast my mother packed for my breakfast; the first time someone called me a name (it was elephant, because it sounded like my name, yeah, it took me a while to get over).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten too, that I was first bullied. There was a girl, a little bigger than me, who would always try to push me off the swing. I&#8217;d get off, shrug my shoulders, and walk off. It was my first lesson in standing up for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten that my first true friendship was forged. Melanie&#8217;s parents and mine were friends, and our birthdays were 5 weeks apart. We were thick as thieves. We are still friends to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten that my love for reading and books was nurtured. I finished Peter &amp; Jane quickly, and moved on to the &#8216;difficult&#8217; books &#8211; Aesop&#8217;s fables, classic fairy tales, encyclopedias. I devoured words even then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved kindergarten. I also had a dreadful haircut. What better way to combine those two things, get together with a fabulous bunch of bloggers (there are 23 of us!), and do something fun for you, our readers? We present to you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KinderHeader.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6116" alt="Name that kindergartner" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KinderHeader.jpg" width="650" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It&#8217;s very simple &#8211; just match the picture (with the assigned alphabet) to the blogger whose blog is listed below.</strong> What&#8217;s in it for you? Other than some fun (and it&#8217;s fun, promise), you can win an awesome <strong>$300 Amazon gift card</strong>. You can also get to know some of the bloggers listed here, if you don&#8217;t already. You can have a laugh at our expenses. Don&#8217;t worry, we did. Now, go forth and play!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You may have seen my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.216373351840577.67311.117824198362160&amp;type=3" target="_blank">daily self-portraits on my Facebook page </a>(or not, if you don&#8217;t follow me there &#8211; that&#8217;s okay. Sort of.), going on two weeks now, and either applauded me for my &#8216;bravery&#8217;, or unliked my Page for being self-indulgent and narcissistic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-Portrait-Collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6137" alt="30 Days of Self-Portraits project" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-Portrait-Collage.jpg" width="560" height="560" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless, I was inspired by my friend Sarah of The Sunday Spill, a talented photographer, who embarked on a <a href="http://sundayspill.com/2013/02/18/the-sunday-spill-4/" target="_blank">daily self-portrait project</a>. Go on and read her lovely post about why she&#8217;s doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why am I doing this? Why am I taking pictures of me without make up, wearing my old but comfortable clothes, sometimes with my children, most times alone, and half of them, you see me from the back (and my ample posterior)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to get into and stay in the picture. I want my children to see what their mother looked like at 36. I want a chance to play around with the camera. I want to be creative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this process, I have learned a few things. Pretty interesting things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. I am at home. A lot. I only get out of the house to do preschool pickups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. I don&#8217;t mind being home a lot. It&#8217;s a privilege.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. I spend half my day on the floor with the kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. I spend a fair amount of time in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. It&#8217;s really difficult to get shots of both my boys with me. Someone&#8217;s always trying to grab the camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. We have really shiny floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. We have great natural light in our apartment. Actually, we have a really cozy place. I&#8217;m appreciating it a little more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. I own many pairs of black pants. They&#8217;re not the same pair, promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. I am treasuring my daily moments more, because I&#8217;m thinking about them more. If that makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. I&#8217;m falling in love with photography again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Would you do a self-portrait project? </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS: I do love making lists. That seems to be how I&#8217;m writing my posts these days. I can&#8217;t help myself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A life list or bucket list, or list of things to do before you&#8217;re 40/ 50 and so on. Have you made one?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I haven&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t because I am a little nervous about actually committing to some of those things that I will probably just put on the list because it seems that one should do it, because everyone else has (I&#8217;m talking about you, bungee jumping and sky diving).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the spirit of my one word, Do, I would like to write a list of things to do before I&#8217;m 40. I figured it&#8217;d be easier to figure out what I do want to do, if I decide on things I will never, ever do. I know, it sounds negative, but stay with me on this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10-Things-I-Will-Never-Ever-Do.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6108" alt="10 things I will never, ever do" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10-Things-I-Will-Never-Ever-Do.jpg" width="374" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. I will never, ever have washboard abs, or abs or any kind that I can self-photograph and Instagram (one has to know one&#8217;s limitations).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. I will never, ever complete a 365 photography project (I have tried, twice).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. I will never, ever bake anything with cake mix (I know, baking snob).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. I will never, ever own a glue gun or have glitter in my house (I just don&#8217;t have a crafty bone in my body).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. I will never, ever write a book (no desire or discipline).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. I will never, ever figure out HTML, CSS or .php (too baffling).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. I will never, ever be able to quit eating chocolate (why would anyone ever give up chocolate?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. I will never, ever wear jeggings, leggings or skinny jeans (I&#8217;ve tried these on in a fitting room before. Never again).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. I will never, ever go bungee jumping (nope, not doing this).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. I will never, ever have a baby in my belly again (this makes me a little sad, but it is what it is, we&#8217;ve decided we are done).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What will you never, ever do?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>I have a <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/never-the-same-again/" target="_blank">guest post at Scary Mommy, about how motherhood has changed me</a>. It was originally posted here in 2012, but if you haven&#8217;t read it, do head over for a read and some share/ comment love? It&#8217;d be much appreciated, thank you!</strong></h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I read an article in the Parents section of the Huffington Post a couple of days ago, it was a point of view that&#8217;s not new, but it was well-written and clearly thought out. What struck me though, was one comment, which I shall paraphrase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t get why you &#8216;mom bloggers&#8217;, oh, excuse me, &#8216;writers&#8217;, are making a &#8216;career&#8217; of writing about how you&#8217;re raising your kids, I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;ll just go read some fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ouch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am one of those &#8216;mom bloggers&#8217;. I write about my children, I share tidbits of our lives, I talk about how I&#8217;m raising them, or want to raise them. I write about my struggles and challenges as a mother, I share my joys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My readers commiserate, relate, challenge, provoke, agree, disagree, are inspired. They laugh and cry with me. They understand. They thank me for saying out loud what they are thinking, but dare not write. They tell me to chin up, toughen up, write it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also write about my passions &#8211; writing itself, social media, baking, friendships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, I talk about my husband. Other times, I write about just me. The pre-Mom me. The child me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&#8217;t make me less or more of  a &#8216;mom blogger&#8217;. It doesn&#8217;t make me less or more of a writer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not writing about motherhood and parenting, to make a career out of it. Sure, I get paid to write about it in some places, and it&#8217;s nice to get published elsewhere, <em>but that is not why I write about motherhood</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mom blog because I need to write these things that are in my heart, my head. I need to write on this blog, a public forum, because I need to feel less alone in this life as a mother, because yes, it gets fucking lonely sometimes. I mom blog because I want my children, when they&#8217;re all grown up, to have a piece of their mother, right here, right now, to appreciate, in a way they can&#8217;t at this young age. I write about the challenges and joys of motherhood because some days, when the clouds hang over my head, when I think I really, really suck as a mother, I can look at my words and know that no, I don&#8217;t always suck. I mom blog because there are so many little moments in the day that I want to grab hold of, make it tangible, and a part of me, so I can remember forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So yes, I&#8217;m mom blogging, and proud of it. And make no mistake, I AM a writer. So there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Im-a-mom-blogger-and-proud-of-it.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6054" alt="Mom blogger" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Im-a-mom-blogger-and-proud-of-it.jpg" width="571" height="565" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Edited to add: This post echoes Tracy of Sellabit Mum&#8217;s post about <a href="http://sellabitmum.com/2012/11/27/dear-daughters-why-i-blog/" target="_blank">why she blogs</a>, which you must absolutely read. If you&#8217;ve written something similar, or plan to, let me know, I&#8217;ll add your post here!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">After I read Kate&#8217;s post, <a href="http://sluiternation.com/2013/02/friday-funnies/" target="_blank">Friday Funnies</a>, where she shared adorable and funny stories of her boys, I realized I haven&#8217;t really done that here, a space for memory keeping. Total fail.</p>
<p>I want to remember all the little things the boys do, and I just know, over time (very little time), these memories will fade and I&#8217;ll forget.</p>
<p>Some snippets:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scrumplet has become really verbal of late. He will crawl to his favorite spot on the couch, stand up, shout &#8220;Dada! Dada! Tata! Tata!&#8221;, and wag a chubby finger at the front door. I&#8217;m guessing his indignant shouts have something to do with the fact that he doesn&#8217;t get to go out with Papa every morning. Stuck with me, buddy!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re usually on the floor, the Scrumps and me, and sometimes, he&#8217;ll go behind me, stand up, and lay his head on the back of my shoulder. It&#8217;s a tender moment. I go &#8220;Awwww&#8221; &#8211; then he digs his teeth in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He likes to crawl away from me these days. He&#8217;ll go down the corridor, turn left into the master bedroom and try to shut the door on me. He succeeded in closing the door a few times, making me wish I had X-ray eyes so I can see where he is while I gently push the door open. He always looks guilty on the other side.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last night at around 8.00pm, just before his bedtime, Monkey pulled my hand, and said, &#8220;night night&#8221;, telling me to lie down on the couch. He arranged himself around the empty spot right near my legs, and patted my back. &#8220;Time for bed, buddy?&#8221; &#8220;NO! Night night Mama!&#8221; Okay then. (I <strong>wish</strong> I could go to bed at 8 o&#8217;clock.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This:</p>
<div id="attachment_6038" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 622px"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A-boy-in-the-exersaucer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6038" alt="Pardon the low-quality picture - bad lighting" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A-boy-in-the-exersaucer.jpg" width="612" height="612" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pardon the low-quality picture &#8211; bad lighting</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A-post-about-saying-NO.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6023" alt="Quote about saying no" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/A-post-about-saying-NO.jpg" width="496" height="496" /></a></p>
<p>Most of us, by nature, find it difficult to say no (yes, based on my very scientific method of personal experience and talking to a few friends).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was of that variety &#8211; a Yes Girl. I would agree to clean up the equipment we used in chemistry class in school, wanting to be amicable and liked. I said yes to dinner parties with people I didn&#8217;t really know, while in university in a new country, in the guise of making new friends. I raised my hand for projects which ate into my study time, as part of a student committee for foreign students, to &#8216;pad my resume&#8217; (and to be liked &#8211; see the pattern?). I got roped into extra activities at work at my last job because I didn&#8217;t want to be known as that girl who said no.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wrote an average of one guest post a week in my first year of blogging, in part to boost traffic to my blog, and in part because I just couldn&#8217;t say no. I joined linky parties and participated in blog hops when I was asked by blog friends in the early days, because I didn&#8217;t want to come off as a snob by saying no.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I couldn&#8217;t say no because I wanted to be liked, accepted, looked up to, loved, be relied on, be trusted, be the go-to-girl. I couldn&#8217;t say no because I didn&#8217;t want to hurt feelings, cause a misunderstanding, disappoint, or make someone feel rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I said yes when I wanted to say no, I was exhausted, tapped out, guilty and resentful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Things had to change. I started saying no.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said no to a baby shower invitation because in the 3 kid-free hours I managed to wrangle, I chose to go for a haircut instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said no to doing product reviews on this blog because I realized I was faking it til I made it. To write as yourself while raving about a product, turned out to be really, really hard. Kudos to those of you who pull this off regularly. I just can&#8217;t do it. <em>Although I have a review on a writing resource next week &#8211; that, I found useful, so I said yes. Exception made.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I said no to many guest posts from fellow bloggers because I was all out of good writing, and I always want to put my best foot forward. I was barely doing enough good writing on my own space, and selfish as it seems, I want to save my good writing for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because I chose to say no when I meant no, I feel freer, I feel more like me, I feel in control. I don&#8217;t feel guilty, trapped, or stressed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So please understand that when I say no, it doesn&#8217;t mean I love or like you any less, or that I don&#8217;t respect you. I&#8217;m just looking after my own sanity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Do you have a hard time saying no?</em></strong></p>

<p>Dear Future Blog Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for taking the time, twice a week, to read my little essays about parenting, blogging and well, me. If you&#8217;re a commenter, I thank you with the love for a thousand cupcakes (and if you know me &#8211; which you will once you start reading the blog regularly &#8211; cupcakes are VERY important to me). I know, I shouldn&#8217;t judge how well a post is received by the number of comments received, but boy, is it a nice feeling when someone does have something to say. I hope you don&#8217;t mind the occasional photo, I like to dress up a post with something visual. You can&#8217;t very well not like pictures of cute children, yes?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, don&#8217;t answer that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, Blog Friend, I hope we will get to know each other better. To the point where I will say &#8220;I love you,&#8221; and sign off all our correspondence with &#8220;xoxo&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Love, Alison</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Dear Future Facebook Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I cannot promise I won&#8217;t unfriend you. I know, I can be an asshat that way. I like to keep my friend list small, as I share a lot more of my personal life there. By that token, I&#8217;m very selective with who I&#8217;m Facebook friends with. I have no problems with you sharing whatever you like, but if you vaguebook, call people names, or make unsavory comments on pictures of my children &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s buh-bye. I&#8217;m sure you understand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Love, Alison</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS: I wouldn&#8217;t mind if you liked my <a href="http://facebook.com/WritingWishing" target="_blank">blog&#8217;s Facebook page</a> though. I&#8217;m much funnier there anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Dear Future <a href="http://twitter.com/AlisonSWLee" target="_blank">Twitter </a>Friend,</p>
<p>I may occasionally let fly the &#8216;F&#8217; word. Don&#8217;t be alarmed.</p>
<p>Love, Alison</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Dear Future <a href="http://pinterest.com/AlisonSWLee" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> Friend,</p>
<p>I know I will love you because you love my dessert Boards.</p>
<p>Love, Alison</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS: Please don&#8217;t take it personally if I unfollow your health and fitness Boards, I am not against exercise or a healthy lifestyle, I&#8217;m just tired of seeing pictures of women with washboard abs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Dear Future <a href="http://instagram.com/AlisonSWLee" target="_blank">Instagram</a> Friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There will be many pictures of my children. It&#8217;s the only way I can capture anything with them, as they like to stop doing whatever cute thing they were doing, as soon as I whip out the big camera. Also, forgive my many caption typos. My phone hates me. I look forward to seeing your lovely pictures. But please, not too many of pets. Or snow.</p>
<p>Love, Alison</p>
