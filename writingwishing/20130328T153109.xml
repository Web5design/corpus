				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear boys,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are growing up in the era of social media, over-sharing and the &#8220;Me, Me, Me&#8221; culture. This is both exhilarating and frightening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Exhilarating because your (almost) entire childhood will be captured. Every small, silly, momentous event in your lives will be recorded right here, on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and who-knows-what-else-in-the-future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frightening because your (almost) entire childhood will be captured. Every small, silly, momentous event in your lives will be recorded right here, on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and who-knows-what-else-in-the-future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see, nothing is really erased when you put something out there in the digital world. You can take things down, delete frantically, or just hope that by virtue of the crushing enormity of information out there, certain things will just be buried (like a picture of kids on the potty &#8211; not that I&#8217;ve ever, or will ever do that to you).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you grow up, and apply for jobs, you will likely be Googled (that&#8217;s the faith I have in Google, it will still be around 20 years from now). Do I want your potential boss to see you frolicking in the pool? Will it hurt your chances if I dress you in a bee suit? Will they think differently of you if they knew you had a speech delay when you were 3? Will they hold it against you if your parents are politically inclined one way or the other? Will they like you more because they saw that at age 5, you were a champion reader? Will they decide on whether you&#8217;re a good fit or not because your mother blogged and occasionally dropped the F-bomb? Will you be judged in any way because of your digital footprint, most of which in your young life, you had no say over?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I certainly hope that you can hold your own as young men. That we, your parents, have instilled the right values in you. I hope that your personalities will shine through on their own, and that any digital history of you, will just be a small reflection of you as a whole. I want to believe that everything we&#8217;re doing now, online and offline, is considered, measured, well thought out, and nothing that any of us will regret.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will all be be judged in life. I just hope you won&#8217;t be because of what we did online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Love, Mama</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>This post was inspired by <a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/kendallmorris/1324386/warning-your-facebook-posts-may-be-harmful-your-childs-future" target="_blank">this article I read on Social Media Today</a>, where the author warned that what we put online now, can affect our children in the future. It has made me think long and hard about my social media behavior. It&#8217;s not just about me. </em></p>

Today,<a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/my-mother/" target="_blank"> I wrote about my mother</a>. It was hard because it&#8217;s not flattering to her. But it&#8217;s an important post, so it would be so wonderful if you could read it. Thank you.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s hard to be a writer. It&#8217;s harder to be a writer who wants to make money from writing. And it&#8217;s really, really hard to put yourself out there and ask for a writing job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You plan the perfect pitch in your head. You run it by a few trusted people. You write and rewrite your pitch. You sit on it for a few days to make sure that it feels right. You send your pitch and you wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You hear nothing back after a week, so you do the right thing and send a polite follow up email.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And you get this &#8211; &#8220;Thank you for your submission, but it&#8217;s not the right fit for us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Period. The end. No other explanation. You look at the rest of their site and think that what you were offering was <em>absolutely the perfect fit. </em>You doubt yourself. You suffer a blow to your confidence. Again. You shout, &#8220;Can&#8217;t I catch a freaking break??&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You will want to curl up in a fetal position and eat copious amounts of chocolate (or whatever &#8216;bad&#8217; food makes you feel better). Don&#8217;t. There are better ways to handle rejection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pity-party-drawing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6218" alt="Pity party drawing" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pity-party-drawing.jpg" width="509" height="687" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Cry. Yes, let it out. You&#8217;ll feel a smidgen better. Just a smidgen. You&#8217;ll still want to hit something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Hit something. Preferably something inanimate, but soft. Like a pillow. Yes, hit a pillow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Swear. Loudly and profusely. Preferably out of the earshot of children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. Tell someone. Like I did. (&#8220;I was *splutter* rejected *sob*. Why *sob* would *sob* they *sob* not *sob* l-l-l-o-v-e me *sob*?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Tell two more people. Preferably one who will say, &#8220;I never liked &lt;the rejector&gt; anyway, and I like them even less now!&#8221;. Then ask her to marry you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. Eat chocolate. But sitting up. Not curled up in a fetal position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. Bake something, preferably something you are really good at, so as to feel a sense of achievement. Make sure your family members get a slice so they can tell you how awesome you are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. Do something you love. Like, watch TV. What?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. Write a post about how to handle rejection. Inject some humor into it because you really need to laugh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. Go out there and try again. Someone will think YOU are awesome and the right fit. Also? Be grateful for the opportunities that have come your way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>How do you handle rejection? If you&#8217;ve never been rejected, don&#8217;t tell me, heh.</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#8217;d think in this day and age of social media, Community Managers of Facebook Pages for businesses would be trained and savvy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because if they were, they wouldn&#8217;t call their customers &#8220;bitches&#8221; and tell someone who posted a complaint on their wall, that it&#8217;d &#8220;kill&#8221; them to have customers like these. Couple that with a poor grasp of the English language, and you have an almost laughable social media disaster, as evidenced by Le Deux Garcons, a bakery (or as they call themselves, a patisserie) based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">{In Sarcasm Font} Here&#8217;s how you kill your brand and business in a few simple steps:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. When a customer has a valid complaint, and a helpful suggestion to improve customer service, tell them to buy their desserts elsewhere. For dramatic flair, tell your customer it&#8217;d kill you to have to serve people like her. Oh, and insult the French while you&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcon-FB-update.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6235" alt="Le Deux Garcons FB wall status" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcon-FB-update.jpg" width="634" height="626" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Following that exchange, tell your customers that you can manage without their patronage because you can &#8220;afford to.&#8221; Use the word &#8220;whatever&#8221; when possible, to emphasize how little you care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-update-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6237" alt="Le Deux Garcons FB wall status 2" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-update-1.jpg" width="595" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>3. Delete the wall status above. But only after it&#8217;s been screen grabbed.</p>
<p>4. Proceed to call your customers &#8220;bitches&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-FB-update-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6236" alt="Le Deux Garcons calls customers bitches" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-FB-update-2.jpg" width="672" height="426" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Delete the wall post above and pretend nothing happened, while everyone in Kuala Lumpur spreads word that your bakery is not worth visiting, unless you want to be called a bitch and served up a side of attitude.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As of this writing (March 24, Sunday morning), Le Deux Garcons has not responded to this unfolding disaster in any way. Their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Les-Deux-Garcons/190072754350375" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>&#8216;s last update is over two months old. The non-recommendations are rolling in, with folks saying they will never, ever step foot into that store again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not once have they apologized for the poor service the original poster complained about, nor their rude responses to their customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Le Deux Garcons, I think you need to hire a social media consultant and/ or a PR team to clean up your social media mess. Good luck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update #1: Le Deux Garcons posted this apology (which sounds very template, or is it just me?) at 1.00 p.m. on 24 March. From the comments, it doesn&#8217;t look like it made much difference, with customers calling for a more sincere approach.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-update-Sun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6240" alt="Le Deux Garcons apology" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Le-Deux-Garcons-update-Sun.jpg" width="585" height="788" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update #2: The largest local newspaper covered this &#8220;brouhaha&#8221; as they called it, quoting the owner Ben Yeong as saying that the apology above is sufficient, and that&#8217;s that. He also insisted that the remarks above were written by a &#8220;staff member&#8221;. So, Mr. Yeong, your shop assistants are allowed to login to your business&#8217;s Facebook account? Or worse, do you have a social media manager who is clearly clueless? My take? Mr. Ben Yeong is the perpetrator. Between Pussy Street and Man-Up Road, we know which way he took.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>I will be following this as it unfolds further, and post updates when they happen.</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I have written about this in a different form, maybe more than once, over the last nearly-two years of blogging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This crippling self-inflicted issue of low self-esteem, which grips me seasonally.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-doubt-quote-by-Sylvia-Plath.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6202 aligncenter" alt="Self-doubt quote" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-doubt-quote-by-Sylvia-Plath.jpg" width="672" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I&#8217;m not good enough. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Everyone else is better than me.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I suck.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I should quit.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I should be good at this, why am I not good at this?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Why do I feel the need for validation?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am all woe-is-me for a few days (okay, weeks), and I truly question myself. I doubt everything I do. I second-guess every decision I make. I want to curl up in a corner and eat chocolate. I berate myself endlessly. I talk myself into a tizzy of not-good-enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, I come crashing down in a pile. I lie there, and I just don&#8217;t want to face it, whatever<em> it</em> is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, I raise my head. I push myself up. I reach out to a *trusted friend. I pour my heart out. I ask for advice (not for validation). I am asked some hard questions. I try to find answers. I am talked off the ledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slowly, I come back to life. I find a renewed sense of purpose. I feel the energy coming back. My mind is buzzing again, with good vibes. There is light at the end of the tunnel. I feel a little more like myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tiptoe gingerly around the things that brought me down in the first place. I look at them objectively. I talk to people. I approach it from another angle. I realize, it&#8217;s not that bad after all. I am not that bad after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crisis in confidence &#8211; over.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until we meet again in a few months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>* Thanks, <a href="http://thestrategicmama.com" target="_blank">Vanita</a>, for being there for me, and lending me a listening ear. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>How do you overcome any confidence issues? Do you have confidence issues? </strong></em></p>

<p>to the place of pain where my stomach felt like it was being ripped out</p>
<p>to the point where my knees meet the floor as gravity pulls</p>
<p>to the very ends of my physical strength and endurance</p>
<p>to a place where inhibitions were shed</p>
<p>to a state of mind where happiness and sadness collide</p>
<p>to a plane of joy where my heart expanded, and contracted, just like my insides.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to the edges of sanity</p>
<p>to a screaming voice that cannot be mine</p>
<p>to the middle of a crying storm</p>
<p>to a peace of mind</p>
<p>to a heart beating for two now</p>
<p>to feelings so alien yet familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to gentle sighs</p>
<p>to tiny limbs and big eyes</p>
<p>to giggles and laughter so true</p>
<p>to cheering on of little steps</p>
<p>to hands that clasp fingers so naturally</p>
<p>to a warm body next to mine in a space that was never there before.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to arms and legs going forth</p>
<p>to talking voices and questioning minds</p>
<p>to hearts in hands as a part of us grow further away</p>
<p>to hearts in throats as pain is more than just a scrape on the outside</p>
<p>to open arms as salve to soothe the hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Motherhood has taken me</strong></p>
<p>to highs so high and lows so low</p>
<p>to thoughts so deep and so shallow</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember those Internet memes everyone was doing years ago via email or Facebook notes (I didn&#8217;t blog then), where you&#8217;ll answer some questions, tag some people and spread the word?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elaine of <a href="http://www.misselaineouslife.com/2013/03/old-school-blogging-march.html" target="_blank">The Miss Elaine-ous Life</a> and Heather of <a href="http://thetamom.com" target="_blank">Theta Mom</a> are bringing Old School Blogging back in style every month! (I am more than excited about this &#8211; does it show my age?)</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.misselaineouslife.com" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://i1235.photobucket.com/albums/ff437/elainea1/OSBimage125.jpg" border="0" /></a></center>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What were you doing 10 years ago?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was working at a public relations agency, I was single and I was loving being 26 going on 27. It was also the year I met my husband, though we didn&#8217;t get together until the following year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What  5 Things are on your To Do List?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arrange a play date for next week with my cousin and her 10.5 month old daughter. They&#8217;re visiting from Australia and I&#8217;m so excited to meet her baby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finish my articles for<a href="http://everydayfamily.com" target="_blank"> Everyday Family</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spring clean my boys&#8217; wardrobes. They have outgrown so many things. Cue tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on some top secret stuff for <a href="http://littlelovemedia.com" target="_blank">Little Love Media</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meal plan for next week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What 5 snacks do you enjoy?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chocolate. My downfall and indulgence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bananas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Homemade granola with Greek yogurt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Raisins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My children&#8217;s leftovers. Okay, technically not something I <em>enjoy</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some things you would do if you were a millionaire.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One million doesn&#8217;t stretch too far these days, does it? I&#8217;d give it to charity. Charities that help impoverished women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some places you have lived.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ipoh, where I was born. Leeds, United Kingdom, where I went to university. Kuala Lumpur, where I live now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some bad habits you have.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I stay up too late. I don&#8217;t drink enough water (though I am trying to be better at this).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Name some jobs you have had.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waitress. Bartender. Administrative assistant at stockbroking firm. Internet advertising sales person. Events planner. Public relations manager. Marketing manager. Now, I write freelance, and I run and own Little Love Media, making social media easy for YOU. In between doing all that, I&#8217;m also the official butt/ snot wiper for the young &#8216;uns around here, short order cook, child hugger and entertainer. But that&#8217;s who I am, not what I do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was so fun! Thanks Elaine and Heather for this great idea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Tell me: what jobs have you had?</strong></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do you want to win a $300 Amazon gift card? Then come play along in a fun little game I&#8217;m doing with 22 of my blogger friends, Name That Kindergartner! <a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/2013/03/name-that-kindergartner/" target="_blank">More details here</a>.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>UPDATE: We have our winners! Congratulations to Amy Pike, you&#8217;re the grand prize winner of a $300 Amazon gift card! Congratulations are also in order to our runner-ups, Renee and Julie, enjoy your $80 Amazon gift cards. Thank you all for playing!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I was the easy guess in this little game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Then-and-now.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6205" alt="Comparison photos" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Then-and-now.jpg" width="617" height="309" /></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And here are the rest of the answers! How many did you guess right?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Name-That-Kindergartner-Answers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6206" alt="Kindergartner game answers" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Name-That-Kindergartner-Answers.jpg" width="650" height="1172" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have vivid memories of kindergarten &#8211; gold stars on little hands for doing a good job; that small hill between the main kindergarten building and the smaller one where the really tiny kids went to; the two swings everyone fought over; the sandbox; the yearly school performance we all partook in, like it or not; the French toast my mother packed for my breakfast; the first time someone called me a name (it was elephant, because it sounded like my name, yeah, it took me a while to get over).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten too, that I was first bullied. There was a girl, a little bigger than me, who would always try to push me off the swing. I&#8217;d get off, shrug my shoulders, and walk off. It was my first lesson in standing up for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten that my first true friendship was forged. Melanie&#8217;s parents and mine were friends, and our birthdays were 5 weeks apart. We were thick as thieves. We are still friends to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was in kindergarten that my love for reading and books was nurtured. I finished Peter &amp; Jane quickly, and moved on to the &#8216;difficult&#8217; books &#8211; Aesop&#8217;s fables, classic fairy tales, encyclopedias. I devoured words even then.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved kindergarten. I also had a dreadful haircut. What better way to combine those two things, get together with a fabulous bunch of bloggers (there are 23 of us!), and do something fun for you, our readers? We present to you:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KinderHeader.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6116" alt="Name that kindergartner" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KinderHeader.jpg" width="650" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>It&#8217;s very simple &#8211; just match the picture (with the assigned alphabet) to the blogger whose blog is listed below.</strong> What&#8217;s in it for you? Other than some fun (and it&#8217;s fun, promise), you can win an awesome <strong>$300 Amazon gift card</strong>. You can also get to know some of the bloggers listed here, if you don&#8217;t already. You can have a laugh at our expenses. Don&#8217;t worry, we did. Now, go forth and play!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">You may have seen my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.216373351840577.67311.117824198362160&amp;type=3" target="_blank">daily self-portraits on my Facebook page </a>(or not, if you don&#8217;t follow me there &#8211; that&#8217;s okay. Sort of.), going on two weeks now, and either applauded me for my &#8216;bravery&#8217;, or unliked my Page for being self-indulgent and narcissistic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-Portrait-Collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6137" alt="30 Days of Self-Portraits project" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Self-Portrait-Collage.jpg" width="560" height="560" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regardless, I was inspired by my friend Sarah of The Sunday Spill, a talented photographer, who embarked on a <a href="http://sundayspill.com/2013/02/18/the-sunday-spill-4/" target="_blank">daily self-portrait project</a>. Go on and read her lovely post about why she&#8217;s doing this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why am I doing this? Why am I taking pictures of me without make up, wearing my old but comfortable clothes, sometimes with my children, most times alone, and half of them, you see me from the back (and my ample posterior)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to get into and stay in the picture. I want my children to see what their mother looked like at 36. I want a chance to play around with the camera. I want to be creative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this process, I have learned a few things. Pretty interesting things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. I am at home. A lot. I only get out of the house to do preschool pickups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. I don&#8217;t mind being home a lot. It&#8217;s a privilege.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. I spend half my day on the floor with the kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. I spend a fair amount of time in the kitchen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. It&#8217;s really difficult to get shots of both my boys with me. Someone&#8217;s always trying to grab the camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. We have really shiny floors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. We have great natural light in our apartment. Actually, we have a really cozy place. I&#8217;m appreciating it a little more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. I own many pairs of black pants. They&#8217;re not the same pair, promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. I am treasuring my daily moments more, because I&#8217;m thinking about them more. If that makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. I&#8217;m falling in love with photography again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Would you do a self-portrait project? </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS: I do love making lists. That seems to be how I&#8217;m writing my posts these days. I can&#8217;t help myself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A life list or bucket list, or list of things to do before you&#8217;re 40/ 50 and so on. Have you made one?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I haven&#8217;t. I haven&#8217;t because I am a little nervous about actually committing to some of those things that I will probably just put on the list because it seems that one should do it, because everyone else has (I&#8217;m talking about you, bungee jumping and sky diving).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the spirit of my one word, Do, I would like to write a list of things to do before I&#8217;m 40. I figured it&#8217;d be easier to figure out what I do want to do, if I decide on things I will never, ever do. I know, it sounds negative, but stay with me on this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10-Things-I-Will-Never-Ever-Do.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6108" alt="10 things I will never, ever do" src="http://www.writingwishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/10-Things-I-Will-Never-Ever-Do.jpg" width="374" height="374" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. I will never, ever have washboard abs, or abs or any kind that I can self-photograph and Instagram (one has to know one&#8217;s limitations).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. I will never, ever complete a 365 photography project (I have tried, twice).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. I will never, ever bake anything with cake mix (I know, baking snob).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. I will never, ever own a glue gun or have glitter in my house (I just don&#8217;t have a crafty bone in my body).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. I will never, ever write a book (no desire or discipline).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. I will never, ever figure out HTML, CSS or .php (too baffling).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">7. I will never, ever be able to quit eating chocolate (why would anyone ever give up chocolate?).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">8. I will never, ever wear jeggings, leggings or skinny jeans (I&#8217;ve tried these on in a fitting room before. Never again).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">9. I will never, ever go bungee jumping (nope, not doing this).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10. I will never, ever have a baby in my belly again (this makes me a little sad, but it is what it is, we&#8217;ve decided we are done).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>What will you never, ever do?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">I read an article in the Parents section of the Huffington Post a couple of days ago, it was a point of view that&#8217;s not new, but it was well-written and clearly thought out. What struck me though, was one comment, which I shall paraphrase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t get why you &#8216;mom bloggers&#8217;, oh, excuse me, &#8216;writers&#8217;, are making a &#8216;career&#8217; of writing about how you&#8217;re raising your kids, I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;ll just go read some fiction.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ouch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am one of those &#8216;mom bloggers&#8217;. I write about my children, I share tidbits of our lives, I talk about how I&#8217;m raising them, or want to raise them. I write about my struggles and challenges as a mother, I share my joys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My readers commiserate, relate, challenge, provoke, agree, disagree, are inspired. They laugh and cry with me. They understand. They thank me for saying out loud what they are thinking, but dare not write. They tell me to chin up, toughen up, write it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also write about my passions &#8211; writing itself, social media, baking, friendships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes, I talk about my husband. Other times, I write about just me. The pre-Mom me. The child me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&#8217;t make me less or more of  a &#8216;mom blogger&#8217;. It doesn&#8217;t make me less or more of a writer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not writing about motherhood and parenting, to make a career out of it. Sure, I get paid to write about it in some places, and it&#8217;s nice to get published elsewhere, <em>but that is not why I write about motherhood</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mom blog because I need to write these things that are in my heart, my head. I need to write on this blog, a public forum, because I need to feel less alone in this life as a mother, because yes, it gets fucking lonely sometimes. I mom blog because I want my children, when they&#8217;re all grown up, to have a piece of their mother, right here, right now, to appreciate, in a way they can&#8217;t at this young age. I write about the challenges and joys of motherhood because some days, when the clouds hang over my head, when I think I really, really suck as a mother, I can look at my words and know that no, I don&#8217;t always suck. I mom blog because there are so many little moments in the day that I want to grab hold of, make it tangible, and a part of me, so I can remember forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So yes, I&#8217;m mom blogging, and proud of it. And make no mistake, I AM a writer. So there.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Edited to add: This post echoes Tracy of Sellabit Mum&#8217;s post about <a href="http://sellabitmum.com/2012/11/27/dear-daughters-why-i-blog/" target="_blank">why she blogs</a>, which you must absolutely read. If you&#8217;ve written something similar, or plan to, let me know, I&#8217;ll add your post here!</p>
