				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You guys, can you believe I’ve been living in Buffalo for the past nine months and I have yet to really say anything about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_wing">Buffalo wings</a> on my blog?</p>
<p>Trust me, this is not because I haven’t been eating my fair share of Buffalo wings since my return.</p>
<div id="attachment_5934" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7606.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5934" alt="IMG_7606" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7606-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Buffalo wings &amp; me. Reunited at last!</p></div>
<p>I mean, this is <i>me </i>we’re talking about here.</p>
<p>I’ve been eating my fair share of EVERYTHING since my return.</p>
<div id="attachment_4573" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_6919.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4573" alt="And by &quot;everything&quot; I mean &quot;ALL THE CHEESE&quot;" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_6919-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And by &#8220;everything&#8221; I mean &#8220;ALL THE CHEESE&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Except for maybe kale. I’m most definitely behind on my kale consumption. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever eaten kale, like, EVER. I can’t say I feel too bad about that.</p>
<p>The reason why I haven’t yet talked about Buffalo wings on my blog is because, well, I don’t like to sound all preachy and tell people they’re doing stuff wrong.</p>
<p>At least not on my blog.</p>
<p>In real life, I have absolutely no problem with being a preachy jerk and telling people they’re doing stuff wrong all the time.</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, you guys, <i>someone</i> needs to tell them.</p>
<p>And that someone might as well be me.</p>
<p>But in my bloggy life, I want people to like me.</p>
<p>So that’s why I never write posts like “Top Ten Things You’re Doing Wrong While Traveling” or “Reasons Why You’re Wrong. I Bet You Can’t Even Read This Right Because You Do Everything Wrong. In Fact, I Bet Your Name is Wrongity Wrongpants III. That’s How Wrong You Are ALL THE TIME.”</p>
<p>But, here’s the thing, guys, about the Buffalo wings?</p>
<p>YOU’RE TOTALLY DOING THEM ALL WRONG.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you grew up in Buffalo or have spent considerable time in Buffalo.</p>
<p>In which case, you might be doing them right.</p>
<p>But we never can be too sure.</p>
<p>You may have to complete some kind of test or something to prove to me that you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>You see, in order to be considered a Buffalo wing, the wing needs to meet a number of strict requirements.</p>
<p>And these requirements go like this:</p>
<p>1. The wings must be deep-fried. There is no such thing as a “baked Buffalo wing.” Sure, you will see such a creation advertised on menus. You should probably just go ahead and burn that menu because it’s a LIAR.</p>
<p>2. The wings must be covered in hot sauce. Not barbecue sauce. Not Italian marinade. Not honey-soy-pineapple-pomegranate-Jamaican-Southwestern-jerk-STOP-IT-JUST-STOP-IT-YOU’RE-MAKING-MY-HEAD-HURT sauce.</p>
<p>3. The wings must have bones in them. Again, you may see something called “boneless Buffalo wings” on a menu here or there but that’s only because you didn’t burn the menu when I already expressly told you to. Sheez. Must I be the one forced to go around the world burning menus? Because I will. I really will.</p>
<p>4. The wings must be served with blue cheese dressing on the side. Do not even ask for ranch dressing. Just don’t. Listen to me. If you ask for ranch dressing instead of blue cheese dressing, this will be justification enough for the server to set<i> you </i>on fire. Don’t say you haven’t been warned.</p>
<p>I know this all sounds a bit strict.</p>
<p>So I’m going to go easy on you guys.</p>
<p>First, I’ll totally let you order the mild wings. Because, honestly, I’m a mouth-wimp myself and can’t handle anything above a medium without my mouth threatening to leave my face.</p>
<p>I’ll also let you get your wings from any restaurant or bar or pizza joint or hole-in-the-wall you want. Whereas some Buffalonians I know are extremely particular about this kind of thing. Like, you have to get wings from &#8220;their place&#8221;, or they will probably never talk to you again. I’m not even kidding you.</p>
<p>While pretty much any restaurant or bar in the city serves Buffalo wings, the two big Buffalo wing contenders are <a href="http://www.anchorbar.com/">Anchor Bar</a> and <a href="http://www.duffswings.com/">Duff’s.</a></p>
<p>If I have people in town visiting me, I usually take them to the Anchor Bar.</p>
<p>This is because Anchor Bar is where Buffalo wings <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_Bar">were originally invented,</a> and I’m all about the history.</p>
<div id="attachment_5932" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7597.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5932" alt="Anchor Bar. This is where the magic first happened." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7597-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anchor Bar. This is where the magic first happened.</p></div>
<p>I’m also all about cheesy statues and kitschy doodads, which Anchor Bar happens to have a lot of.</p>
<div id="attachment_5933" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7602.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5933" alt="IMG_7602" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7602-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At the Anchor Bar. Who doesn&#8217;t love a good kissing waitress statue?</p></div>
<p>But many people I know swear by Duff’s, which is a local chain of chicken wing joints.</p>
<p>I’d only ever been to Duff’s once in my life, and I couldn’t really remember much about my visit. Probably because I&#8217;m blocking out the memory as I was in a lot of pain at the time. You see, I went with a friend who bullied me into ordering wings so hot my face started to melt off. It wasn’t pleasant.</p>
<p>But I was excited to have a do-over with Duff’s this week when a friend invited me there for a get-together.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5924" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2430.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5924" alt="Notice the crazy-pants blowing snow. In March. Because, of course, Buffalo." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2430-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Notice the crazy-pants blowing snow. In March. Because, of course, Buffalo.</p></div>
<p>I was a bit worried, though, when I entered, and this sign was the very first thing that greeted me.</p>
<div id="attachment_5925" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2432.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5925 " alt="Ahhh!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2432-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yikes!</p></div>
<p>Apparently, this was not just a warning, but the restaurant’s motto, as it was all over the place – from the servers’ t-shirts to the menus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2433.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5926" alt="IMG_2433" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2433-237x300.jpg" width="237" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Luckily, not all the wings were some version of hot &#8212; they did have a mild option. And it wasn’t labeled “Mild <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Is</span> Still Totally Going to Melt Your Face Off.”</p>
<p>Despite my face-melting fears, I ended up going with something called “mild medium,” which was supposed to be a little bit hotter than the mild. I wasn&#8217;t going to, but everyone at the table around me was ordering medium and hot wings, and I felt like ordering just the mild would be way too wimpy. Even for me.</p>
<p>Besides, who needs a face?</p>
<p>My friend who was sitting next to me ordered the “medium light” wings – which were supposed to be a notch of hotness above my order. They came out slathered in so much hot sauce my eyes actually started to sting.</p>
<div id="attachment_5929" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 245px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2446.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5929  " alt="IMG_2446" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2446-235x300.jpg" width="235" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Medium Light Is Still Slathery &amp; Eye-Hurtingly-Hot</p></div>
<p>Seriously, you guys, it’s not just my mouth that’s a wimp &#8212; my entire face is a wuss. Even my eyes are like, “Ahh, ahh, too much hot! Why are you always trying to set us on fire?”</p>
<p>When my order came out, my wings looked decidedly less slathery.  While they still had a nice kick to them, I was able to get through half of them without my face melting off.</p>
<div id="attachment_5930" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 280px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2451.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5930 " alt="" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2451-270x300.jpg" width="270" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mild Medium Is Probably Not Going to Kill You. Phew!</p></div>
<p>That was a good thing.</p>
<p>Because, actually, as it turns out, I do kind of need my face.</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed the fact that the stalks of celery they served with the wings were HUGE. I’m usually not the type to rave about a vegetable – especially one as flavorless as celery &#8212; but, seriously, this celery was not messing around, you guys.</p>
<p>And, while my order definitely lived up to the aforementioned set of Super Strict Buffalo Wing Rules and Regulations, I was a bit surprised to see that the menu at Duff’s included a barbecue wing option.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5927" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 249px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2436.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5927  " alt="" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2436-239x300.jpg" width="239" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BBQ? WTF?</p></div>
<p>Which we all know is TOTALLY AGAINST THE RULES.</p>
<p>I was really hoping it was some kind of test or joke or something.</p>
<p>Like, if you ordered the barbecue wings, the floor would open up and swallow you whole or a bucket of blue cheese would land on your head like on some kind of Japanese game show.</p>
<p>But then my friend ordered the barbecue wings AND a side of ranch dressing.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is a friend who grew up in Buffalo and has spent much of her adult life here. She, of all people, should have known better.</p>
<p>(In her defense, she said the ranch dressing was for her fries. But I wasn&#8217;t so sure I could trust anything coming out of her mouth after the whole ordering-barbecue-wings incident. I now even suspect she&#8217;s been lying about growing up in Buffalo. It&#8217;s possible she grew up in some place like California, where all the Buffalo wings are made out of tofu and coated in honey-soy-ginger sauce and happy thoughts.)</p>
<p>Surprisingly, her order of barbecue wings came out, she ate them, and nothing bad happened to her.</p>
<p>You know, besides me totally losing all respect for her.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, just kidding.</p>
<p>Kind of.</p>
<p><i>What’s your favorite hometown food? And are people in other parts of the world always getting it wrong?</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you missed the announcement at the end of <a title="Lewiston, NY: Small Town, Big History" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/03/lewiston-ny/">my last post</a> and the fifty billion times I screamed about it on the <a href="www.facebook.com/unbravegirlblog">Facebook</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/unbravegirl">Twitter</a>, <a href="2013.bloggi.es">this</a> happened on Sunday:</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5861" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Picture-3.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5861 " alt="" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Picture-3-300x201.png" width="300" height="201" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!</p></div>
<p>I could pretend to be all surprised and, like, “Wow, I had no idea I would win.”</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not going to lie.</p>
<p>I kind of had an idea I was going to win.</p>
<p>Mind you, this is not because I think my blog is a better travel blog than any of the other super awesome travel blogs that were nominated.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, now.</p>
<p>Not only do I not think my blog is a better travel blog, I don&#8217;t even really think my blog is a travel blog. I mean, wouldn&#8217;t that require me to actually write about travel or something?</p>
<p>Instead, <a title="Weeklyish Challengey Thingie: Demouse the House" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/11/demouse-the-house/">I write about my cat</a>.</p>
<p>And then I post photos of myself in my bathrobe.</p>
<div id="attachment_4712" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 244px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_9088.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4712" alt="Well, hello there." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_9088-234x300.jpg" width="234" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Well, hello there.</p></div>
<p>But I do think my readers are pretty much THE BEST BLOG READERS ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET EVER.</p>
<p>If anybody could have made this happen, it would totally be you guys.</p>
<p>Now I know <a title="Thank you for your support. And for almost getting me arrested. But mostly for your support." href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/2013-bloggies-nomination/">I said I’d give you all ponies</a> if I won.</p>
<p>But I decided you deserve something even more awesomer than ponies.</p>
<p>And, of course, we all know that unicorns are better than ponies.</p>
<p>But do you know what’s even better than a unicorn?</p>
<p>A UNICORN-PONY!</p>
<p>Or, what I like to call, a Unicornie!</p>
<div id="attachment_5867" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 247px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2498.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5867" alt="Ta-da! She's all yours! " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2498-237x300.jpg" width="237" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ta-da! She&#8217;s all yours!</p></div>
<p>As you can see, there&#8217;s only one of her and a whole lot of you, so you&#8217;re probably going to have to take turns. Maybe someone could come up with some kind of sign-up sheet, or something?</p>
<p>But, that&#8217;s not all, folks!</p>
<p>Because, seriously, have you ever known me to NOT totally overdo something?</p>
<p>I mean, come on, this is <em>me</em> we&#8217;re talking about here.</p>
<p>I also got you this super magical uni-cat:</p>
<div id="attachment_5869" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 288px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2461.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5869 " alt="IMG_2461" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2461-278x300.jpg" width="278" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">See? MAGICAL.</p></div>
<p>And this other super magical uni-cat:</p>
<div id="attachment_5864" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2476.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5864" alt="IMG_2476" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2476-240x300.jpg" width="240" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SO, SO, SO MAGICAL.</p></div>
<p>Because you can never have enough cats. Especially magical unicorn cats. (What? It&#8217;s true. You can&#8217;t. Cats are like cheese. The more you have in your life, the awesomer your life becomes.)</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also this amazing one-eyed uni-chihuahua:</p>
<div id="attachment_5863" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 231px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2471.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5863   " alt="IMG_2471" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2471-221x300.jpg" width="221" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The one and only one-eyed, one-horned wonder!</p></div>
<p>I assure you what he lacks in vision, he totally makes up for in MAGIC.</p>
<p>And, don&#8217;t worry, his missing eyeball is not the result of his getting into a horn fight with one of the uni-cats.</p>
<p>Although, I think we all know who’d win if that ever happened.</p>
<p>It would have to be this tough guy right here:</p>
<div id="attachment_5865" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2485.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5865" alt="Bad-assest uni-cat EVER, amirite?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2485-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bad-assest uni-cat EVER, amirite?</p></div>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Umm, I don&#8217;t really have any questions for you right now. I just   really wanted to say THANK YOU and YOU ROCK and you deserve about twenty-billion unicorns but these were the only animals that would allow us to put horns on their heads without trampling us to death or pecking out our eyeballs. Oh, and I need to thank <a title="Stuff I Really Kind of Like about My Life at Home: My Parents" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/12/my-parents/">my Mom</a> who made the unicorn horns because  I can&#8217;t really be trusted with glitter and spray paint.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2198.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5815" alt="IMG_2198" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2198-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This may sound strange coming from a girl who’s spent most of the past decade living overseas, but I’ve always dreamed of moving to some small town in America.</p>
<p>You know, the kind of town with a quaint little Main Street that’s lined with family-owned businesses, cute cafes and that one bar where everyone hangs out after work.</p>
<p>The kind of town where everyone smiles and greets you when you walk down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The kind of town where everyone in the local bakery knows your name and what kind of pie you want and doesn’t make a big deal about it if you happen to replace all your meals with pie for a week because it’s just this thing you’re doing right now, okay?</p>
<div id="attachment_4941" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9739.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4941" alt="Breakfast, lunch, &amp; dinner. COVERED." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9739-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Breakfast, lunch, &amp; dinner. COVERED.</p></div>
<p>In this dream, the locals would be a loveable, ragtag bunch – a mix of down-to-Earth good people and offbeat, quirky folks.</p>
<p>Of course, at first they would be wary of me and my big city ways. (What? I’m from <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/109701488495992792701/albums/5825899316356522721">Buffalo</a>. It’s a big city. Kind of.)</p>
<p>But slowly they would come to embrace me as one of their own. Especially after I save the local bowling alley. And cure the high school football star from a nasty mystery illness. And, then, there would be an on-again, off-again romance with a certain, feisty airplane pilot.</p>
<p>If this all sounds a bit familiar it’s probably because I was more than a little bit obsessed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Exposure"><i>Northern Exposure</i> </a>when I was in high school. And then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28TV_series%29"><i>Ed</i></a>. Do we all remember <i>Ed</i>? Omigod, I had such a crush on Ed. And, yes, it’s possible I’ve watched more than a few episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_of_Dixie"><i>Hart of Dixie </i></a>lately. Why do you ask?</p>
<p>I’ve obviously yet to fulfill my TV-dramedy-induced dreams of moving to Small Town, USA. Probably, because, well, I’ve been a bit too busy moving to <a title="The Lingshan Wonderland of Buddhism (And, yes, it is just as awesome as it sounds)" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/04/lingshan-buddha/">Big Huge Massive City of Four Million People That No One Has Ever Heard Of, China</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5624" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8691.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5624" alt="Yeah, not quite small-town America." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8691-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, not quite small-town America.</p></div>
<p>But I do so enjoy visiting small towns in the States and imagining what my life might be like if I lived there.</p>
<p>On my recent visit to Lewiston, NY, I got to do just that.</p>
<p>Located a mere fifteen minutes away from <a href="http://www.niagara-usa.com/">Niagara Falls</a>, <a href="http://historiclewiston.org/index.html">Lewiston</a> is pretty much the perfect American small town.</p>
<p>And it has been for some time.</p>
<p>Established in 1822, after hundreds of years of Native American and European settlement, Lewiston has a whole lot of history jam-packed into its tiny circumference.</p>
<p>In fact, it seemed like half of the buildings in the town had plaques outside of them boasting exactly how historic they were.</p>
<div id="attachment_5816" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2199.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5816" alt="Ooo, historical." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2199-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, historical.</p></div>
<p>And the other half of the buildings had signs on them telling people that they were private residences. You know you’re living in a historic town when you have to put a sign on your house that says, “Sorry, guys, this is not a museum. It’s just my house. And you can’t come in. Move along now.”</p>
<p>Before hitting up the town’s downtown area, I stopped by one of Lewiston’s main attractions &#8212; the <a href="http://www.fatimashrine.com/">Our Lady of Fatima Shrine.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5802" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 256px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2038.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5802" alt="Our Lady of Fatima Shrine" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2038-246x300.jpg" width="246" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our Lady of Fatima Shrine</p></div>
<p>Started in 1963, the shrine is stunning with its glass-domed basilica, topped with a thirteen-foot tall statue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_F%C3%A1tima">Our Lady of Fatima</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5801" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2034.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5801" alt="IMG_2034" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2034-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Statue on top of the shrine</p></div>
<p>Inside the basilica, mass was being held when I got there.</p>
<div id="attachment_5800" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2026.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5800" alt="Inside the shrine" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2026-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside the shrine</p></div>
<p>So I checked out the two small, peaceful chapels, where a few people were quietly praying.</p>
<div id="attachment_5799" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 234px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2020.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5799" alt="One of the chapels" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2020-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the chapels</p></div>
<p>Outside of the basilica, the grounds house over one hundred life-size marble statues of the saints.</p>
<div id="attachment_5804" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2071.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5804" alt="One of the many statues on the grounds" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2071-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the many statues on the grounds</p></div>
<p>There was even a giant rosary made up of lights.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2053.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5803" alt="IMG_2053" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2053-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>As cool as the building and all the statues were, definitely my favorite part about visiting the shrine was meeting Father Julio.</p>
<p>As it was Friday, the Father was in the kitchen preparing for the afternoon’s fish fry when I arrived. You see, as well as being one of the priests at the basilica, Father Julio also happens to be the Chief Fish Fryer.</p>
<p>In addition to giving me a brief overview of the basilica’s history and a quick tour, the Father informed me that the secret to a successful fish fry is all in the coleslaw (who knew?) and then he blessed me.</p>
<p>I’m telling you guys, if I ever fulfill my dream of moving to small-town America, there had better be a fish-frying Father there.</p>
<p>I mean, I think that should be some kind of requirement in every small town in America, right? Everyone who lives there has to have some secret, unexpected skill. Like, <a title="LeRoy, New York: Home to the Jello Gallery… and Possibly Me" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/03/jello-gallery-leroy-new-york/">the town mayor is also the museum’s tour guide</a>. The local librarian is a weekend chili-eating champion. And all the priests should be able to fry fish and dispense coleslaw tips.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stick around long enough to try the shrine’s famed coleslaw, as the next stop on my tour was lunch at <a href="http://www.brickyardpub.com/">The Brickyard Pub &amp; BBQ</a> in downtown Lewiston.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2104.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5808" alt="IMG_2104" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2104-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I could smell the barbecue fumes coming from the restaurant before I could even see it.</p>
<p>And then I spotted a huge pile of firewood behind the restaurant, which was stacked up ready to be used in the pit smoker.</p>
<div id="attachment_5805" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 251px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2078.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5805" alt="Oh, yeah." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2078-241x300.jpg" width="241" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, yeah.</p></div>
<p>That, my friends, is <i>always</i> a good sign.</p>
<p>Jam-packed with locals on their Friday lunch breaks, The Brickyard is totally <i>the </i>place to hang out. It’s the kind of place where you know everyone and everyone knows you and you don’t have to be all embarrassed about having food all over your face because you’re with friends, you know?</p>
<div id="attachment_5806" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2086.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5806" alt="We're all friends, here, right, guys?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2086-300x215.jpg" width="300" height="215" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We&#8217;re all friends, here, right, guys?</p></div>
<p>Which is a good thing because I’m pretty sure I had food all over my face the entire time I was there.</p>
<p>On the waitress’ suggestion, I ordered something called a Po’ Boy, which was a big, delicious mess of a sandwich piled high with pulled pork and coleslaw.</p>
<div id="attachment_5807" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2094.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5807" alt="My meal. Before it ended up all over my face." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2094-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My meal. Before it ended up all over my face.</p></div>
<p>It sounded like a strange combination at first, but the coleslaw really added a nice tanginess and crunch to the sweet, smokiness of the pulled pork.</p>
<p>Which just goes to show you that it’s possible the secret to EVERYTHING good in life is coleslaw.</p>
<p>Seriously, who knew?</p>
<p>After I managed to scrub all my lunch off my face, I then stopped by the very swanky <a href="http://www.bartonhillhotel.com/">Barton Hill Hotel and Spa</a>, where I was scheduled to meet up with local historian, Tim Henderson.</p>
<div id="attachment_5814" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 273px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2186.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5814" alt="Barton Hill Hotel &amp; Spa" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2186-263x300.jpg" width="263" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Barton Hill Hotel &amp; Spa</p></div>
<p>Even though the family-owned boutique hotel has only been around for about seven years, it totally fits into the town’s quirky, historic feel.</p>
<p>There were even cannonballs in the lobby.</p>
<div id="attachment_5810" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2117.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5810" alt="The lobby. And its cannonballs." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2117-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The lobby. And its cannonballs.</p></div>
<p>Cannonballs, you guys!</p>
<p>The next time I stay in a hotel there’d better be cannonballs in the lobby. That’s all I have to say.</p>
<p>Tim Henderson gave me a low-down on Lewiston’s extensive history, including its involvement in the Underground Railroad. As Lewiston is just across the river from Canada, it was the final stop for many escaped slaves before they reached freedom.</p>
<p>He showed me the <a href="http://historiclewiston.org/freedomcrossing.html">Freedom Crossing Monument</a>, which was built to commemorate the Underground Railroad. And, which he just so happened to be one of the models for.</p>
<div id="attachment_5811" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2129.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5811  " alt="Freedom Crossing Monument &amp; Tim" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2129-300x232.jpg" width="300" height="232" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Freedom Crossing Monument &amp; Tim Henderson &#8212; historian/sculpture model</p></div>
<p>See?</p>
<p>I told you everyone in small-town America needs a secret, unexpected skill – like, say, sculpture model.</p>
<p>He also informed me that Lewiston was the birthplace of the first cocktail. You see, back in the 1800’s a tavern-keeper named Catherine Hustler started mixing up gin drinks with rooster feathers, and, hence, the name “cocktail” was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2205.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5821" alt="IMG_2205" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2205-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I even got to visit her grave, which is in the local cemetery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2133.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5812" alt="IMG_2133" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2133-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>That was pretty cool. I mean, this woman is like my HERO. Cocktails are only one of my most favoritest alcoholic drinks EVER.</p>
<p>Although I wish I would have known I was going to visit her grave, so I could have properly prepared to pay my respects. Like, with a bouquet of swizzle sticks or something.</p>
<p>Before leaving Lewiston, I took one last walk down the town’s main road, Center Street, where, as to be expected, people smiled and greeted me as I went by.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2106.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5809" alt="IMG_2106" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2106-218x300.jpg" width="218" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The street is jam-packed with quirky, little, locally-owned mom and pop shops. Or grandpop shops, as the case may be.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2200.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5822" alt="IMG_2200" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2200-300x277.jpg" width="300" height="277" /></a></p>
<p>There was even a local travel agent. Like, a place that you could actually walk in and talk to a real-live human being about booking a trip. And not have to deal with some creepy, heartless Expedia robot. I had no idea this kind of place still existed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2209.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5817" alt="IMG_2209" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2209-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>And, of course, there was a <a href="http://www.dicamillobakery.com/">bakery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2217.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5819" alt="IMG_2217" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2217-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Which, of course, I went in.</p>
<p>And, of course, I stared at all the pie.</p>
<p>But then I opted for a maple-apple donut instead. Because you know us big city types &#8212; we can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re always talking about pie, and then we just go ahead and order donuts.</p>
<div id="attachment_5818" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2210.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5818" alt="Maple-apple donut.

Kind of like pie. But more donuty.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2300.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5757" alt="IMG_2300" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2300-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Have you ever really thought about maple syrup?</p>
<p>Like, really, <i>really</i> thought about it?</p>
<p>Like how does maple syrup even exist? I mean, who was the first person that decided, “Hey, why don’t we just tap into this tree over here and if some kind of liquid comes out, let’s boil it down and pour it over some stuff.”</p>
<p>I mean, seriously, who <i>did</i> that?</p>
<p>Because we really need to have some kind of holiday already to celebrate that person.</p>
<p>I imagine this holiday would be like a cross between Christmas and The Best Day in the World Ever.</p>
<p>Instead of decorating Christmas trees, of course, we would decorate Maple trees.</p>
<p>And instead of Santa Claus there would be Syrup Sprites, who would bring gallon jugs of maple syrup to all the good little boys and girls. And to me because I&#8217;d really like a gallon jug of maple syrup, too, thank you very much.</p>
<p>And we would all eat pancakes all day long until we&#8217;re sick of eating pancakes. Which would never even happen because, you guys, you can’t get sick of eating pancakes. That’s not humanly possible, okay?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that that holiday actually does kind of exist.</p>
<p>At least, here in New York State.</p>
<p>And it’s called <a href="http://www.mapleweekend.com/">Maple Weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Despite what the name might have you believe, Maple Weekend actually lasts two weekends. Because, really, when it comes to maple syrup it’s best not to limit yourself.</p>
<p>During those two weekends you can visit local farms that produce maple syrup. And you can even go into their sugar shacks! (What? That’s not a dirty word. I swear, you guys. “Sugar shack” is the building where they make the syrup. It also happens to be the name of my future home. Just so you know.)</p>
<p>And, of course, Maple Weekend involves pancakes.</p>
<p>But not just <i>any</i> kind of pancakes.</p>
<p>These are ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PANCAKES!</p>
<p>Which to me sounded like a challenge &#8212; a challenge I willingly accepted last Saturday when I went to <a href="http://www.mooresmaple.com/">Moore’s Maple Shack Pancake House</a> to celebrate the first Maple Weekend of the year.</p>
<div id="attachment_5751" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 240px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2269.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5751 " alt="IMG_2269" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2269-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another possible name for my future home: Maple Shack Pancake House. Just keeping my options open.</p></div>
<p>This, apparently, is one of <i>the</i> places to go in the area, as we had to wait in line at least an hour before we were seated.</p>
<p>Luckily, the lobby was full of stuff to keep us entertained while we waited.</p>
<p>Like pancake drawings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2272.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5752" alt="IMG_2272" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2272-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>And fascinating maple syrup facts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2273.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5753" alt="IMG_2273" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2273-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Because you never know when there might be a quiz.</p>
<p>Inside the pancake house, there were even more things to keep us entertained.</p>
<p>Like lots of old-timey knick-knacks and saw paintings. I mean, a pancake house really isn’t complete without a little saw art, amirite?</p>
<div id="attachment_5755" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2284.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5755" alt="IMG_2284" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2284-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, saw art!</p></div>
<p>And for our reading pleasure there was a detailed family history on the back of our menu. Possibly, well, a bit <i>too</i> detailed.</p>
<div id="attachment_5756" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2285.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5756 " alt="IMG_2285" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2285-300x222.jpg" width="300" height="222" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Check out the 3rd paragraph &#8212; it&#8217;s a doozy!</p></div>
<p>Because, really, while I feel bad for Earl, I’m not so sure if I want to hear about his heart stents before breakfast.</p>
<p>And, of course, there was a maple syrup quiz.</p>
<div id="attachment_5767" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_22801.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5767" alt="IMG_2280" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_22801-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I totally knew there was going to be a quiz, you guys! I should have studied harder!</p></div>
<p>But, the real reason why we were there was not for the wall art and maple trivia, but for the pancakes and syrup, of course.</p>
<p>And, well, there were definitely some pancakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2303.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5759" alt="IMG_2303" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2303-300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>And there was definitely some syrup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2301.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5758" alt="IMG_2301" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2301-253x300.jpg" width="253" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And then there were some more pancakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2304.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5760" alt="IMG_2304" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2304-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And some more syrup.</p>
<div id="attachment_5761" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2307.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5761" alt="Umm, where did all the syrup go?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2307-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Umm, where did all the syrup go?</p></div>
<p>Until none of us could eat any more pancakes. Which, apparently, is totally humanly possible. I really had no idea.</p>
<p>After breakfast, we headed out to the sugar shack to watch the maple syrup being made.</p>
<p>It turns out this is a rather high-tech, scientific process involving lots of big shiny equipment. And absolutely no sprites.</p>
<div id="attachment_5762" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2315.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5762 " alt="IMG_2315" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2315-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, shiny. But about the sprites&#8230;</p></div>
<p>There was also a gift shop where you could stock up on all your essentials like syrup and cotton candy. Because, yes, I live in a world where syrup and cotton candy are totally considered essentials.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2318.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5763" alt="IMG_2318" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2318-214x300.jpg" width="214" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And, then, because we hadn’t had nearly enough maple action for the day, we decided to hop on a wagon and head into the woods to see the sap being tapped from the trees.</p>
<div id="attachment_5764" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2334.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5764" alt="IMG_2334" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2334-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the wagon into the woods.</p></div>
<p>Which, also, turned out to be a rather technical process involving a lot of rubber tubing.</p>
<div id="attachment_5782" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2338.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5782" alt="IMG_2338" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2338-300x193.jpg" width="300" height="193" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, very tube-y.</p></div>
<p>I do have to admit, the tubing did look quite festive as it ran from tree to tree across the forest. It was almost like the trees were decorated for the holiday.</p>
<p>Except next year, I&#8217;d suggest they add a little bit of tinsel.</p>
<p>And sprites. Let&#8217;s not forget about the sprites.</p>
<p><em>Are you a lover of the maple syrup? What do you like to put it on? Where do you go to get your maple syrup fix?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2008.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5718" alt="IMG_2008" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2008-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You guys, I have a teensy little confession to make.</p>
<p>I am a nerd.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Shocking, right?</p>
<p>Up until now, I bet you thought I was the hippest bombdiggity on the Internet, yo.</p>
<p>(Confession: I have no idea what a bombdiggity is. I just heard it on a commercial.)</p>
<p>But, it’s true, guys.</p>
<p>I’m a total nerdball.</p>
<p>One of my favorite activities to do as a child was to memorize random facts from the set of animal flashcards we had at my school, and then attempt to amaze my classmates with my extensive knowledge of water buffalo. (Mind you, they did a very good job of hiding their amazement. By telling me to go away.)</p>
<p>I spent my teenage years secretly reading <a title="Stuff I Really Kind of Like About My Life in China: Old Timey Villages" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2011/12/old-timey-villages/">historical fiction novels</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5732" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8407.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5732 " alt="Don't let my sophisticated beret-wearing fool you. I was actually a nerd!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8407-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nerd alert. Don&#8217;t let my sophisticated beret-wearing fool you.</p></div>
<p>And you should probably never challenge me to a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit">Trivial Pursuit</a> because I <i>will</i> play dirty. Plus, you know, if there’s ever a question about water buffalo, you are so going <i>down.</i> Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>I try to keep my nerdy tendencies on the down low when I’m hanging out with friends so that, you know, they’ll keep on hanging out with me.</p>
<p>Every once in a while I get a bit tipsy and let on that I know way too much about nerdy stuff like Elizabethan book-binding.</p>
<p>But usually I’m pretty good at playing it cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1107.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5720" alt="IMG_1107" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1107-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I mean, OBVIOUSLY.</p>
<p>But I have absolutely no qualms about letting my geek flag fly when I’m on my own or in front of random strangers.</p>
<p>Which is one of the reasons why I love traveling solo so much – I can basically be the biggest nerd there is and nobody has to know. (Well, that, and the fact that I can wear the same pants for five days straight and nobody has to know. And, you know, eat two breakfasts and nobody has to know. And pretty much DO EVERYTHING EVER and nobody has to know.)</p>
<p>So I was super excited when the <a href="http://www.niagara-usa.com/">Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation</a> invited me to visit <a href="http://oldfortniagara.org/">Old Fort Niagara</a> and write a post about my experience as a solo traveler there.</p>
<p>Located less than half an hour away from Niagara Falls, NY, the fort dates all the way back to 1726 when it was built by the French as a means of controlling the Great Lakes, and, subsequently, it played an integral role in the French &amp; Indian War, the American Revolution and the War of 1812. The fort, which is now a National Historic Landmark, is <a href="http://oldfortniagara.org/visit/admissions.php">open to the public</a> year-round and hosts a number of <a href="http://oldfortniagara.org/events/">cultural events</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, as far as opportunities to be a total nerdball in public, it doesn’t really get much better than visiting a 300-year-old military fort, now does it?</p>
<div id="attachment_5729" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1917.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5729" alt="At Old Fort Niagara. Things about to get nerdy up in here." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1917-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">At Old Fort Niagara. Things about to get nerdy up in here.</p></div>
<p>When I arrived at the Fort on Friday morning, I was greeted by Jason Buckley, the staff member who would be giving me a tour of the museum and grounds.</p>
<p>I felt a bit bad for the guy.</p>
<p>I mean, he probably had no idea he was in for a two-hour nerdy question-fest by yours truly.</p>
<p>We started off the tour by watching a video that showed a brief overview of the fort’s history.</p>
<div id="attachment_5722" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 276px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1885.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5722" alt="Movie time!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1885-266x300.jpg" width="266" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Movie time!</p></div>
<p>Honestly, it was all a bit confusing for me because it was nine o’clock in the morning, and I was severely under-caffeinated, and, while I am a huge history nerd, I have never been particularly good at dates or really anything that involves numbers.</p>
<p>Plus, the Fort changed hands almost a half dozen times in less than a hundred years – from French control to British control to American control and then back again to British control before it was finally ceded to the United States in 1815.</p>
<p>Trying to keep track of all of that felt kind of like trying to keep track of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a>’s love life.</p>
<p>Except with a lot less angsty pop songs.</p>
<p>And a lot more funky hats and half-clad Native American dudes.</p>
<p>Not that I’m complaining as I am a fan of both funky hats and half-clad Native American dudes.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, who isn’t?</p>
<div id="attachment_5721" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 242px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_18861.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5721" alt="Why, hello there, sir." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_18861-232x300.jpg" width="232" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Why, hello there, sir.</p></div>
<p>What the movie failed to mention, and what I learned later on in the tour of the museum, was that all that warring and fort-seiging and basically the entire colonization of North America was caused by beavers.</p>
<p>Yes, BEAVERS.</p>
<p>You see, apparently, everyone in Europe was all crazy about felt hats like this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1891.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5702" alt="IMG_1891" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1891-266x300.jpg" width="266" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And, apparently, the best kind of felt was made from beaver fur.</p>
<p>And, apparently, the best kind of beaver fur could be found on beavers in North America – specifically those found in Northern United States and Canada.</p>
<p>And, apparently, the French and English were all like, “Let’s go get us some beaver fur. And colonize a continent. And, you know, have a whole bunch of wars and stuff.”</p>
<p>So, yes, beavers.</p>
<p>Totally to blame.</p>
<p>POSSIBLY FOR EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>Which just goes to show you that you probably shouldn’t trust any mammals with webbed feet.</p>
<div id="attachment_5701" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 239px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1889.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5701 " alt="Not to be trusted." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1889-229x300.jpg" width="229" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Totally cute. And totally not to be trusted.</p></div>
<p>Another fun fact that I didn’t know about until my tour of the museum was that back in the day, soldiers drank something called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer">small beer</a>” for Vitamin C.</p>
<div id="attachment_5703" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 272px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1893.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5703 " alt="Old-timey beer keg. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1893-262x300.jpg" width="262" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Old-timey beer keg.</p></div>
<p>I think this means we can all just go ahead and replace our breakfast orange juice with a nice tall glass of beer. And when someone asks you why you’re drinking beer at eight o’clock in the morning you can reply, “Because HISTORY, okay?”</p>
<p>In addition to its enlightening displays on beavers and beer, the museum also housed an extensive collection of old weapons.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1907.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5706" alt="IMG_1907" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1907-300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>There were also the remnants of the original flag that used to fly over the fort, which just so happens to be one of the oldest surviving American flags.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1899.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5705" alt="IMG_1899" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1899-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>As fascinating as the museum was, my favorite part of the tour was definitely when we left the museum and stepped out on to the grounds of the fort.</p>
<p>I totally felt like I was stepping back in history.</p>
<div id="attachment_5739" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1909.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5739" alt="History, here I come!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1909-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">History, here I come!</p></div>
<p>I was tempted to start acting all old-timey and throw out some old-timey slang words. But, sadly, I don’t know any old-timey slang words as they hardly ever have any old-timey slang words in commercials.</p>
<p>While the fort has been the home of almost one hundred different buildings during its history, today the grounds of the fort contain about a dozen different structures, including many of the original buildings as well as some reconstructed ones.</p>
<p>There were a couple big, impressive stone gates.</p>
<div id="attachment_5719" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 259px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5719 " alt="Ooo, impressive." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2010-249x300.jpg" width="249" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, very big and gate-y.</p></div>
<p>There was a storehouse that is now full of displays.</p>
<p>Like this one about the different names for barrels:</p>
<div id="attachment_5709" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1935.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5709" alt="Firkins and hogsheads and butts and puncheons, oh my!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1935-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Firkins and hogsheads and butts and puncheons, oh my!</p></div>
<p>Which, I’m not even kidding you, was totally fascinating. And I can’t guarantee you that I won’t get drunk some point soon and start pulling out all my newfound barrel vocabulary.</p>
<p>And there was a bakehouse where they used to bake a million-billion loaves of bread each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_5711" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1945.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5711 " alt="In the bakehouse. Sadly, there were no free bread samples." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1945-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In the bakehouse. Sadly, there were no free bread samples. Because I could always go for some free bread.</p></div>
<p>By far the most impressive building on the grounds is definitely the French Castle. It also happened to be the oldest building at the fort.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5710" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1944.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5710" alt="The French Castle" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1944-300x209.jpg" width="300" height="209" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The French Castle</p></div>
<p>This is where you could see how the soldiers really lived.</p>
<p>Which, honestly, didn’t seem that bad to me. I mean, usually when I imagine the lives of Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century soldiers (and, yes, I have been known to imagine that kind of thing on occasion), I imagine a lot of hardship.</p>
<p>Not an indoor well decorated with oil paintings.</p>
<div id="attachment_5712" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 221px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1949.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5712" alt="Indoor well with fancy French-looking painting above it. Ooo, la, la!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1949-211x300.jpg" width="211" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Indoor well with fancy French-looking painting above it. Ooo, la, la!</p></div>
<p>Sure, the barracks room looked like it might be kind of a tight squeeze, especially considering it used to house thirty soldiers.</p>
<div id="attachment_5714" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1984.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5714" alt="The barracks room" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1984-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The barracks room</p></div>
<p>But, honestly, I’ve seen worse at some hostels.</p>
<p>And check out these officer’s digs:</p>
<div id="attachment_5716" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2000.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5716" alt="Officer's quarters" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2000-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Officer&#8217;s quarters</p></div>
<p>Pretty fancy pants, right?</p>
<p>The officer’s dining room even had a table set up for the serving of booze and hot chocolate. Somehow I never imagined military officers hanging out, drinking booze and hot chocolate.</p>
<p>I mean, add my cat and a bathrobe, and that sounds pretty much like my typical Friday night.</p>
<div id="attachment_5715" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 274px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1997.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5715" alt="This was where the hot chocolate &amp; booze were served. Again, sadly, no free samples were given out on the tour." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1997-264x300.jpg" width="264" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This was where the hot chocolate &amp; booze were served. Again, sadly, no free samples were given out on the tour.</p></div>
<p>As if my whole tour wasn’t totally awesome enough and so full of interesting tidbits of information that I simply cannot wait to blather on about at the next party I happen to get a bit too tipsy at, I then got to learn how to shoot a musket.</p>
<p>A MUSKET, YOU GUYS.</p>
<div id="attachment_5713" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1969.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5713" alt="Musket demonstration by Old Fort Niagara staff member" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1969-238x300.jpg" width="238" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Musket demonstration by Old Fort Niagara staff member</p></div>
<p>So, in addition to knowing way too much about beavers and beer and barrels, I now know how to operate old-timey firearms.</p>
<p>You all might want to watch your backs.</p>
<p>Or, at least, make a point of not inviting me to any of your parties.</p>
<p><i>What historic place did you visit and love and then talk about way too much at parties later?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>P.S. I’d like to give a huge thank you to the fine people of <a href="http://www.niagara-usa.com/">Niagara Tourism and Convention Corporation</a> for arranging my tour and to Jason Buckley at <a href="http://oldfortniagara.org/">Old Fort Niagara</a> for giving me an awesome tour and for putting up with my countless questions about barrels and beavers and bedbugs and pretty much EVERYTHING EVER.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>P.P.S. It’s the last day to vote for the <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/">Bloggies</a>! Voting closes tonight (Sunday, March 17<sup>th</sup>) at 10 PM EDT. If you haven’t voted already, would you please consider voting for me for the Best Travel Weblog? I would love you forever. And I promise not to bore you at parties with talk of barrels. Okay, so maybe I can’t promise that, but I WILL totally love you forever.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1323.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5655" alt="IMG_1323" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1323-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I’ve often thought that the reason why I keep on picking up and moving to a new country or city every couple years is not because I’m running away from home as many people have accused me of – but because I’m looking for one.</p>
<p>I figure that when I reach the place that I am destined to call home for the rest of my life I will receive some kind of a sign – a sign that says, “Here. Stay here. You belong <i>here</i>.”</p>
<p>Well, you guys, it’s possible I got that sign this week.</p>
<p>And it happened in the least likely of places.</p>
<p>Not in an exotic <a title="Unbrave Girl Gone Wild: Beach Break Survival Guide" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2010/07/beach-survival-guide/">beachy village in Malaysia</a>. Or some<a title="Chiang Mai on the Cheap: the Unbrave Girl’s Guide to (Reluctant) Budget Living" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2011/01/chiang-mai-on-the-cheap/"> laid-back mountain town in Thailand</a>. Or some <a title="The Oriental Pearl Tower: More Fun Than a Barrel Full of Babies (The title will make sense to you later. I think.)" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/06/oriental-pearl-tower/">mega-megapolis in China</a>. Or in the quiet, dimly lit alleyways of <a title="Feeling Natsukashii in Nikko" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/01/nikko-japan/">Japan</a>.</p>
<p>But in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Roy,_New_York">LeRoy, New York</a>, a sleepy little town located just a couple dozen miles away from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York">Rochester.</a></p>
<p>And that sign?</p>
<p>It looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1699.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5677" alt="IMG_1699" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1699-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I mean, seriously, you guys, Bacon Street? How is that not a sign I should move there? It could have only gotten better if it intersected with Pancake Road.</p>
<p>I went to LeRoy on Wednesday with a carful of fun ladies for the express purpose of visiting <a href="http://www.jellogallery.org/">The Jello Gallery</a>, which is exactly what it sounds like – a museum dedicated to Jello.</p>
<p>You see, in addition to being home to possibly the best-named street ever, LeRoy also happens to be the birthplace of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jell-O">Jello</a>, America’s most famous dessert.</p>
<div id="attachment_5653" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1303.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5653" alt="All aboard the Jello mobile!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1303-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All aboard the Jello mobile!</p></div>
<p>Well, according to the fine people of LeRoy, Jello is America’s most famous dessert.</p>
<p>According to the fine people of <i>me</i>, Jello is not a dessert at all.</p>
<p>I mean, <i>come on.</i></p>
<p>It tastes like fruit and doesn’t have any fat in it.</p>
<p>That is <i>not </i>a dessert, people.</p>
<p>That’s a trick.</p>
<p>Personally, I tend to be suspicious of any dessert that isn&#8217;t chock full of creamy peanut butter and oozey caramel and rich dark chocolate. The only fruit-flavored desserts I approve of must be surrounded by a flaky crust. Preferably one made out of animal fat.</p>
<div id="attachment_4681" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_8937.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4681" alt="Now, THIS. THIS is dessert." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_8937-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Now, THIS. THIS is dessert.</p></div>
<p>And, while I can’t say I’m a huge fan of Jello, I was a huge fan of the museum.</p>
<p>First, we were greeted by our tour guide, Jim, who also happened to be the town’s former mayor.</p>
<div id="attachment_5656" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1346.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5656" alt="Jim, our tour guide &amp; the former mayor. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1346-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jim, our tour guide &amp; the former mayor.</p></div>
<p>Impressive, right?</p>
<p>At least, <em>I</em> was impressed. I mean, I can’t say I’ve had many former mayors give me museum tours before. But, who knows, maybe this kind of thing is commonplace in a wondrous town where the streets are named after pork products?</p>
<p>Jim gave us a brief history of Jello, which turned out to be quite fascinating – or, at least a lot more fascinating than you would expect for a dessert that doesn’t have any chocolate in it.</p>
<p>After our Jello history lesson, we were let loose on the museum itself which consisted of one big room jam-packed with displays.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1501.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5679" alt="IMG_1501" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1501-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There were displays of different old-timey advertisements for Jello.</p>
<div id="attachment_5657" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1361.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5657" alt="Every geisha loves a good Jello mold!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1361-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Every geisha loves a good Jello mold!</p></div>
<p>Including lots of ads featuring the Jello Girl, who was apparently like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerber_baby">Gerber Baby</a> of Jello. But older. And more multi-cultural. Or something.</p>
<div id="attachment_5665" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1466.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5665 " alt="Totally looks Chinese." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1466-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look! She looks just like I did when I was visiting China!</p></div>
<p>There was a display showing the various Jello flavors that came and went over the years.</p>
<p>These flavors ranged from, “Okay, that doesn’t sound so bad.”</p>
<div id="attachment_5663" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1433.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5663 " alt="Chocolate? Coffee? Cola? " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1433-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chocolate? Coffee? Cola? Okay, I can dig it.</p></div>
<p>To the “OMIGOD, WHAT ON EARTH WERE PEOPLE THINKING?”</p>
<div id="attachment_5664" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1435.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5664" alt="Celery??? Mixed vegetable??? Seasoned tomato??? ITALIAN SALAD??? ARE YOU PEOPLE MAD???" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1435-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Celery??? Mixed vegetable??? Seasoned tomato??? ITALIAN SALAD??? ARE YOU PEOPLE MAD???</p></div>
<p>There was another display with recipes for unusual Jello-based concoctions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1382.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5681" alt="IMG_1382" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1382-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>And by “unusual” I mean, “SERIOUSLY. WHAT WERE PEOPLE THINKING? WERE THEY ALL ON CRACK? THEY HAD TO BE ON CRACK. THAT’S THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION.”</p>
<div id="attachment_5682" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_13951.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5682 " alt="IMG_1395" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_13951-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lemon Jello with lima beans, vinegar &amp; Worcestershire sauce??? Go home, old-timey America, because you are clearly drunk.</p></div>
<p>There were even tidbits of Jello trivia and amazing Jello facts.</p>
<p>Like, you guys, Jello has brain waves.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1522.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5683" alt="IMG_1522" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1522-300x252.jpg" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>BRAIN WAVES!</p>
<p>I told you that we shouldn’t trust a dessert that tastes like fruit!</p>
<p>Don’t say I didn’t warn you when Jello uses its brain waves for evil. Like, to seek revenge on humans by putting <i>us</i> in weird salads with Worcestershire sauce and lima beans.</p>
<p>While all the displays were quite interesting, my favorite part of the museum was the super fancy oil paintings, which hung all over the walls.</p>
<p>They looked like they could be straight out of some European art gallery. Except, instead of featuring scenes of Greek goddesses frolicking or ancient saints looking stern, they featured Jello molds frolicking.</p>
<div id="attachment_5684" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1379.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5684" alt="IMG_1379" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1379-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That Jello mold is totally frolicking.</p></div>
<p>And Jello molds looking stern.</p>
<div id="attachment_5658" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1374.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5658" alt="IMG_1374" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1374-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ooo, cranberry Jello mold is NOT happy.</p></div>
<p>Exiting the museum, we entered the very impressive gift shop, where you could buy pretty much everything Jello.</p>
<p>There were shot glasses so you could do your Jello shots the classy, brand-endorsed way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1619.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5685" alt="IMG_1619" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1619-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And boxer shorts. Because what man wouldn’t want a pair of underwear that says “See It Jiggle! Watch It Wiggle!”?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1620.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5686" alt="IMG_1620" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1620-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>In addition to the Jello museum, the building also housed a transportation museum on the lower floor, where there was a collection of some old-timey sleighs and buggies and bicycles.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1599.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5670" alt="IMG_1599" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1599-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I didn’t quite understand why there was a transportation museum and what it’s connection with LeRoy was.</p>
<p>I’m sure there was an explanation somewhere.</p>
<p>But, frankly, I was too busy giggling over the “Two Seat Pleasure Wagon.”</p>
<div id="attachment_5669" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1572.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5669" alt="IMG_1572" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1572-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As they say, &#8220;If this wagon&#8217;s a&#8217;rockin&#8217;&#8230;.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>And getting my picture taken with the Jello cow.</p>
<p>You know</p>
<p>As you do.</p>
<div id="attachment_5668" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1568.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5668" alt="IMG_1568" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1568-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jello cow &amp; me.</p></div>
<p>Plus, I was really hungry. Like to-the-point-of-considering-Jello-a-viable-food-option-hungry.</p>
<p>Yep, <i>that</i> hungry.</p>
<p>Luckily, our next stop on our short tour of LeRoy was the <a href="http://www.dandrdepot.com/">D &amp; R Depot Restaurant</a>, which just so happens to be a former railroad depot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1628.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5671" alt="IMG_1628" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1628-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>And, you guys, you <i>know</i> how <a title="Five Reasons Why Taking the Train in the States Isn’t Crazy. So Stop Looking at Me So Funny" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/five-reasons-to-take-the-train-in-the-states/">I love me some trains</a>.</p>
<p>So I figured this was another sign I should totally move to LeRoy. Well, that, and the upside-down snowman in the restaurant’s main dining room.</p>
<div id="attachment_5672" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1636.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5672" alt="IMG_1636" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1636-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Why, yes, that IS an upside down snowman. Why do you ask?</p></div>
<p>Okay, so it’s possible that was not a “You should move here” sign, but a “There might be something <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">a bit weird in the water here</a>” sign.</p>
<p>The ladies I was with decided we should start our meal off with Jello. I can’t say this would have been my first choice for a starter. But, you know, as they say, when in Rome.</p>
<p>Or LeRoy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5673" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1650.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5673" alt="IMG_1650" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1650-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Orange Jello appetizer. As you do.</p></div>
<p>Much to my surprise, I actually really enjoyed the Jello. I suspect this had something to do with the fact that I was super hungry. And the fact that there was a huge dollop of whipped cream on top of it. I mean, I would eat an old mop if it was covered in enough whipped cream.</p>
<p>We then continued our meal with onion rings which OMIGOD, YES, PLEASE, MORE, OKAY?</p>
<div id="attachment_5674" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 270px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1665.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5674" alt="IMG_1665" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1665-260x300.jpg" width="260" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">THESE, YOU GUYS.</p></div>
<p>And then I had a spinach salad and the chicken potpie.</p>
<p>Described in the menu as the “conductor’s special,” my potpie was, indeed, very special &#8212; in a flaky crust kind of way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1669.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5675" alt="IMG_1669" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1669-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>And, as it just so happens, flaky-crust-kind-of-special is one of my favoritest kind of specials!</p>
<p>Well, that and the bacon-kind-of-special.</p>
<p><i>What’s the quirkiest museum you’ve ever been to?  </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>P.S. You guys, I know I&#8217;ve bugged you about this a billion-million times, but there are only a few more days for you to vote for me for a <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/">Bloggie for the Best Travel Weblog!</a> Voting closes on Sunday, March 17th at 10 P.M. EDT. So if you haven&#8217;t done so already, please go vote! Pretty, pretty please with whipped cream and flaky crust on top!</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7999.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5612" alt="IMG_7999" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_7999-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Ever since I started my <a title="Advice You Really Shouldn’t Follow: Returning to the United States" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/returning-to-the-united-states/">advice column thingie</a> a few weeks ago, I’ve been getting lots of questions about teaching English overseas.</p>
<p>Because, apparently, you spend ten years of your life doing something and you get a degree in the stuff and people actually expect you to know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Sheez.</p>
<p>People and their unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>Amirite?</p>
<div id="attachment_5526" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5526" alt="Does this look like the face of a girl who knows what she's doing? EVER?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Does this look like the face of a girl who knows what she&#8217;s doing? EVER?</p></div>
<p>I don’t usually write much about teaching on my blog.</p>
<p>Because it’s my job. And I like to keep my work life and my private life separate. (And by &#8220;private life&#8221; I mean &#8220;totally-not-private-Internet-life.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Plus, honestly, it kind of freaks me out – giving advice that people might actually take seriously.</p>
<p>I’d much rather give advice about topics I don’t know anything about. Like unicorns and <a title="Advice You Really Shouldn’t Follow: Returning to the United States" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/returning-to-the-united-states/">raising kids</a> and <a title="Advice You Really Shouldn’t Follow: How To Travel With Annoying People" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/03/how-to-travel-with-annoying-people/">traveling with annoying people</a>.</p>
<p>And now that I just wrote that sentence, I’ve figured out the ultimate way to deal with annoying people while traveling: BRING UNICORNS.</p>
<p>They will totally cancel out the annoying people.</p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
<p><i>Ahem.</i></p>
<p>Where were we again?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, teaching English.</p>
<p>Usually when I get a question about teaching, I just point the person to <a title="8 Questions To Ask Yourself Before Becoming an ESL Teacher Overseas" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2011/11/questions-to-ask-yourself-before-becoming-an-esl-teacher/">this post</a> I wrote about a year and a half ago about questions you should ask yourself before becoming an ESL teacher overseas.</p>
<p>But people still keep on asking <em>me</em> questions.</p>
<p>Because, apparently, you guys don’t like talking to yourselves much.</p>
<p>So because the people keep on asking, I’ve decided to give the people what they want.</p>
<p>Just as long as next week I can go back to talking about unicorns, okay?</p>
<h4>8 Questions You Keep Asking Me About Teaching ESL Overseas Because, Apparently, You Guys Don&#8217;t Like Asking Yourselves Questions</h4>
<h5>1.    Do I need a degree?</h5>
<p>Bad news (if you don’t already happen to have a degree):</p>
<p>Yes, most likely.</p>
<p>In fact, most jobs will require that you show proof of a four-year-degree before they will hire you.</p>
<p>This is usually due to visa restrictions as many countries, like Japan and South Korea, require that you have a degree before you can be granted a working visa.</p>
<p>Good news (if you happen to have a degree and it happens to be in Astrophysical International Communicationology):</p>
<p>It usually doesn’t matter what your degree is in – especially if you’re looking at jobs teaching at a private language school or a local K-12 school overseas.</p>
<p>Even better news (if you happened to have majored in English like I did):</p>
<p>This may be the only job where having an English degree will actually work in your favor.</p>
<p>I know, right?</p>
<p>It doesn’t even matter if you spent your four years in college pretending to read James Joyce novels and writing crappy poetry.</p>
<p>Not that I did that.</p>
<p>Okay, I totally did that.</p>
<div id="attachment_5632" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1240.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5632  " alt="" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1240-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There may have been a few toga parties, too. What?</p></div>
<h5>2.    Do I need teaching experience?</h5>
<p>Good news (if you don’t happen to have any teaching experience):</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Of course, it will totally depend on the school or program you’re applying to and the country it is in.</p>
<p>My first job teaching English was at a high school in tiny fishing village in Japan with the <a href="http://www.jetprogramme.org/">JET Programme</a>, a program that primarily recruits newly graduated university students.</p>
<div id="attachment_5622" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1228.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5622 " alt="My first teaching job." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1228-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My first teaching job. I&#8217;m the one who is not in a high school uniform.</p></div>
<p>Other than a brief stint as a TA in a college writing class, I didn’t have any teaching experience. I definitely didn’t have any experience with high school students. And I had absolutely no idea how to teach grammar or sentence structure. Because, frankly, I didn’t even know sentences <i>had</i> structure.</p>
<p>Of course, it will help if you do happen to have some teaching or training experience – even if it’s non-ESL related stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe you worked as a volunteer camp counselor?</p>
<p>Or helped train other waitresses at your summer restaurant job?</p>
<p>Or are just really good at being bossy?</p>
<p>Brag about it on your resume, yo.</p>
<p>Bad news:</p>
<p>There really is no bad news.</p>
<p>Geez, you guys, why do you always think there’s going to be bad news?</p>
<h5>3.    What about that TEFL Certificate thingie? What is it? Do I need one of those? How do I get it? And what’s the best one to get?</h5>
<p>I’m really not the best person to ask about TEFL certificates because I never got one.</p>
<p>I went straight from Teaching-Without-Any-Certification-Or-Training-Or-Idea-As-To-What-I-Was-Doing to Getting-My-Master’s-Degree-in-TESOL-And-Learning-To-Diagram-Sentences-Like-A-Boss.</p>
<p>Because my philosophy in life is “All or Nothing.”</p>
<p>This also happens to be my philosophy<a title="37 Things I Don’t Know How to Do Despite Being 37 Years Old. So Stop Calling Me Ma’am Already." href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/01/37-things/"> in nachos</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5031" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9047.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5031" alt="Must. Eat. ALL THE NACHOS. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_9047-300x217.jpg" width="300" height="217" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Must. Eat. ALL THE NACHOS.</p></div>
<p>Of course, any kind of training is going to help you both find a job and be prepared to enter the classroom, but the problem is deciding which certification program to do.</p>
<p>There are, like, eleventy-billion-million different types of certificates and certification programs out there. There are programs that can be done completely online. Whereas other programs require a certain number of hours of in-class practice teaching. Some programs may even help you find a job after you finish the certification.</p>
<p>I’d suggest looking at some listings for jobs in the country that you’re interested in. (<a href="http://www.eslcafe.com/">ESL Café</a> is a good place to start.) That will give you a good idea as to what the general requirements for jobs in that country are.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next question:</p>
<h5>4.    Where should I go?</h5>
<p>SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS, WITH THE QUESTIONS?</p>
<p>Must I decide EVERYTHING for you?</p>
<p>I mean, SHEEZ.</p>
<p>How about I ask <i>you</i> a question this time?</p>
<p>Where do you <i>want </i>to go?</p>
<p>Okay, you should totally go there.</p>
<p>Yep, that’s all there is to it.</p>
<h5>5.    Should I line up a job before I go or just go there on a tourist visa and look for a job when I get there?</h5>
<p>Not to get all government official on you, but it is technically illegal to look for a job or work while on a tourist visa.</p>
<p>Not that I haven&#8217;t met plenty of people who&#8217;ve done it.</p>
<p>But I, personally, would rather secure a job beforehand and get the appropriate visa before going overseas to teach. Because I’m a scaredy cat, and I don’t like to break the law, and I am pretty sure I wouldn’t last long in prison. (Although, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, prison <i>would</i> make for a totally awesome blog post.)</p>
<p>Arranging everything beforehand can mean a lot of hassle and paperwork and planning.</p>
<p>This can also mean committing yourself to a school in a less-than-glamorous location</p>
<p>Like, say, a tiny fishing village in Japan.</p>
<div id="attachment_5621" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1234.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5621" alt="IMG_1234" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1234-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I lived here!</p></div>
<p>Or, say, the Brazilian Amazon.</p>
<div id="attachment_5614" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1180.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5614 " alt="IMG_1180" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1180-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And here! (Okay, I didn&#8217;t live ON the Amazon. But not too far from it.)</p></div>
<p>Or, umm, perhaps, <a title="The Lingshan Wonderland of Buddhism (And, yes, it is just as awesome as it sounds)" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/04/lingshan-buddha/">a city of four million people in China that nobody&#8217;s ever heard of.</a></p>
<div id="attachment_5624" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8691.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5624" alt="And I lived here!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_8691-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And I lived here!</p></div>
<p><strong></strong>But it also means that you already have a place to stay and a place to work when you get there &#8212; and that place doesn&#8217;t happen to be a prison.</p>
<p>Win, win, you guys!</p>
<h5>6.    How do I avoid being scammed?</h5>
<p>I’m sure you’ve heard the horror stories.</p>
<p>I’ve certainly heard the horror stories.</p>
<p>You know, the ones of the innocent, naïve, ESL-teacher-wannabe who gets a job overseas and then shows up in her destination of choice only to find she’s been sold into a prostitution ring and her passport is taken away and then she wakes up in a bathtub of ice with her kidneys stolen and there’s a convict on the loose with a hook for a hand and, OMIGOD, THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE.</p>
<p>Despite having heard these stories over and over again, I have never actually met anyone who has been scammed – at least not seriously so.</p>
<p>This is not to say that scams don’t exist.</p>
<p>This is also not to say that you shouldn’t be really careful when applying for and accepting jobs.</p>
<p>Do your research.</p>
<p>Ask people you know who’ve taught ESL overseas what schools or programs they’d recommend.</p>
<p>Talk to the career counselors at your university or your college professors. (True story: The main reason why I applied to the JET Programme was because it was recommended to me by my sociology professor in college.)</p>
<p>Check out the online forums and see what people have to say about the schools or programs you’re applying to. But be warned – the online forums for teaching ESL are like all online forums everywhere on the Internet <i>ever</i> – basically, full of negative, hateful trolls who probably stomp on puppies in their spare time. But if one school in particular keeps on warranting the vitriol of the Internets, I’d stay away.</p>
<p>Ask the school or program you’re applying to if you can talk to any current or former teachers either via email or Skype. If they won’t let you talk to anybody, then I’d be concerned.</p>
<p>And trust your gut.</p>
<p>Basically, if a company feels totally sketchy, chances are they are totally sketchy.</p>
<p>The company I applied to work for in Brazil felt totally sketchy.</p>
<p>The Brazilian Embassy wasn’t even sure if they would give me a visa because they were all like, “This place seems totally sketchy.”</p>
<p>But I still went there.</p>
<p>Because BRAZIL, YOU GUYS.</p>
<div id="attachment_5626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1185.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5626" alt="Hanging out by the spitting fish fountain. Just a typical day in Brazil. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1185-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanging out by the spitting fish fountain. Just a typical day in Brazil.</p></div>
<p>Not surprisingly, when I got there, I discovered the place I worked for was totally sketchy. They were disorganized and gave me absolutely no support. They made me work more hours than the local teachers and paid me less. And they took away the only vacation I had to make me go substitute teach in the jungle for two weeks.</p>
<p>While I was happy I went, I still spent the better part of the year feeling frustrated and helpless.</p>
<p>Luckily, though, nothing horrible happened to me to me.</p>
<p>I didn’t get sold into prostitution or have my passport taken away.</p>
<p>And I was able to leave the country with both of my kidneys.</p>
<p>Or at least I think I still have both of my kidneys.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of test I can do to make sure I still have both of my kidneys, you guys?</p>
<h5>7.    What if I don’t like it?</h5>
<p>I left my first job teaching English in Japan after only a year, and I didn’t think I’d ever go back to teaching ESL again.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that I hadn’t liked the teaching.</p>
<p>I had actually really enjoyed the teaching.</p>
<p>But I didn’t do nearly as much teaching as I would have liked as my classes were often cancelled because they weren’t considered “important.”</p>
<div id="attachment_5618" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1222.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5618" alt="Teaching my students the Hokey Pokey. TOTALLY IMPORTANT." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1222-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Teaching my students the Hokey Pokey. TOTALLY IMPORTANT.</p></div>
<p>So instead of teaching, I spent most of my time sitting at my desk, pretending to do work while I was actually ordering stuff off of Amazon and writing ranty emails to my friends.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a couple years later, when I got a job teaching English part-time to adult students at a private language school in the States, that I really fell in love with teaching and started to consider teaching as a career and not-this-thing-to-do-for-a-year-so-I-can-get-a-visa-to-live-in-a-country-and-not-get-arrested.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: teaching is like pretty much every experience in your life ever.</p>
<p>You’re never going to know if you like it until you try it.</p>
<p>And even if you try it once, you might not even be sure if you like it.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in teaching ESL and think you might like it, you might as well try it.</p>
<p>Because, seriously, what’s the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>Besides having your kidneys stolen.</p>
<p>Just kidding, you guys!</p>
<p>Your kidneys will totally not get stolen.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<h5>8.    How do I get a real job after teaching ESL?</h5>
<p>This question irks me more than just a little bit.</p>
<p>Because, you guys, teaching English <em>is</em> a “real job.&#8221;</p>
<p>You use the exact same skills teaching English as you do with <i>any</i> job – teaching or non-teaching.</p>
<p>You have to be creative but practical.</p>
<p>You have to be able to plan ahead but be flexible.</p>
<p>You have to be able to be confident. But you also have to be able to be humble and take a lot of criticism.</p>
<p>You have to be able to talk to a variety of different people from a variety of different backgrounds. But you also have to be able to listen to people. And not roll your eyes too much when those people won’t shut up already.</p>
<p>And you have to wear pants.</p>
<p>Mind you, I didn’t always feel this way about teaching English.</p>
<p>During my first year of teaching English, I didn’t consider what I was doing a “real job”.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time during that year in Japan thinking about the “real job” I would get when I returned to the States.</p>
<p>And when I returned to the States, I promptly got myself a real job – working in a non-profit in Washington, DC – doing lots of real jobby things.</p>
<p>Like, you know, sitting at my desk, pretending to do work while I was actually ordering stuff off of Amazon and writing ranty emails to my friends.</p>
<p>Okay, so I did actually do a lot of work.</p>
<p>But, here’s the thing, you guys, about jobs (and take this from a girl who has had a <i>lot</i> of jobs in her day):</p>
<p>A job is a job is a job.</p>
<p>You’re going to do some stuff that you really like – like work with some awesome people and do some creative things and maybe occasionally dance.</p>
<div id="attachment_5619" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1224.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5619" alt="IMG_1224" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1224-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Teaching my students how to dance. Again.</p></div>
<p>And you’re going to do some stuff that you don’t like – like sit through really long staff meetings and wear pants.</p>
<p>And some days it’s going to be The Most Awesome Job Ever And You Want To Do It Forever And Ever Until You Die.</p>
<p>And some days it’s going to be The Worst Job Ever And You Want To Quit And Go Live on a Beach And Drink Mai-Tais For A Living And Never Wear Pants Again.</p>
<p>That’s all there really is to it.</p>
<p>Okay, can I go back to talking about unicorns now?</p>

<p>This week’s question appeared in the comments section for <a title="Advice You Really Shouldn’t Follow: How to Begin Traveling" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/how-to-begin-traveling/">my last advice column,</a> and it goes something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Sally, </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Here’s a question for you. Next month I’m traveling to France with my daughter for her eighth-grade class trip. She’s been in a French immersion program for 8 years and the trip is the culmination of a lot of hard work. The problem is that I’m going to be stuck on a giant tour bus with about 40 13-year olds and 10 of their parents for 10 days. I’ve known most of the adults for a while and many are very nice. But I’m concerned about the ones who don’t understand that they actually need to use Euros, not dollars, and say “excusez-moi, parlez vous anglais?” before blathering on in English. How do I keep myself from punching them in the face? </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Signed, </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><em>Going to Go Nuts</em></p>
<p>First of all, Nuts, (I can call you Nuts, right?) thank you so much for using an alias. I appreciate your attempt to make me feel like a real advice columnist!</p>
<p>Even though I totally know who you are.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: Nuts is a long-time friend of mine.)</p>
<p>(Even fuller disclosure: I have actually traveled with Nuts in the past. So it’s understandable that she’s worried about traveling with other people. I mean, I did set the bar pretty high.)</p>
<div id="attachment_5526" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5526" alt="Best. Travel. Partner. EVER. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Best. Travel. Partner. EVER.</p></div>
<p>Second of all, Nuts, let me assure you, you have come to the right place.</p>
<p>You see, while I don’t have lots of experience traveling in a group as I usually travel on my own these days, I do have lots of experience with annoying people.</p>
<p>I attribute this to the fact that I spent a great deal of my life working in customer service.</p>
<p>And because I’m naturally a very cranky person especially if it’s before noon and I haven’t had five gallons of coffee yet and OMIGOD ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO CHEW THAT LOUDLY? BECAUSE, SERIOUSLY.</p>
<p>Luckily, I’ve come up with a whole step-by-step system to help me get through any experiences I might have with annoying people.</p>
<p>And you’ll be happy to know that hardly any of those steps involve punching people in the face!</p>
<p>Because punching people in the face is bad, you guys.</p>
<p>And because it would require some kind of hand-eye coordination.</p>
<p>(More full disclosure: I don’t have any of that.)</p>
<h4>Sally’s Step-by-Step System for Dealing with Annoying People</h4>
<h5>Step 1: Avoid eye contact</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1297.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5589" alt="IMG_1297" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1297-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p>Annoying people are kind of like dangerous forest animals.</p>
<p>As soon as you make eye contact with them, they will attack you. But instead of attacking you with their fangs or claws, they will totally attack you with their annoyingness.</p>
<p>Which, honestly, is a lot worse.</p>
<p>I mean, fangs and claws are bad.</p>
<p>But listening to someone whine on and on about how-nobody-in-this-country-speaks-English-and-if-everyone-spoke-English-already-than-the-barista-would-have-known-to-use-skim-milk-in-my-latte-and-do-they-even-have-skim-milk-in-this-godforsaken-country?</p>
<p>That’s worse.</p>
<p><i>Much worse</i>.</p>
<h5>Step 2: Act busy</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1328.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5590" alt="IMG_1328" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1328-300x269.jpg" width="300" height="269" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s say you made a mistake and actually made eye contact with the annoying person.</p>
<p>EVEN THOUGH I EXPRESSLY TOLD YOU NOT TO MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH THEM AND WHY AM I EVEN GIVING YOU ADVICE IF YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME?</p>
<p>And now the annoying person won’t stop talking to you.</p>
<p>Now would be a really good time to get an important email from home. You’d better read it and respond to it immediately or something might explode.</p>
<p>Or what about that work-thing? Didn’t you say you had some kind of work-thing you were supposed to work on RIGHT NOW? I totally remember you telling me you had some kind of work-thing.</p>
<p>Or, omigod, did you forget to take your vitamins? I think you forgot to take your vitamins. They’re in the bottom of your bag. Way, way, <i>way</i> down in the bottom. It’s probably going to take you at least twenty minutes to find them. You should go do that now. You wouldn’t want to get yourself a bad case of the scurvy while you’re on vacation.</p>
<h5>Step 3: Run away</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0905.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5593" alt="IMG_0905" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0905-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You’ll just need to make sure they’re distracted</p>
<p>You know, so they don’t see you while you’re running away.</p>
<p>Because they <i>will</i> attack you.</p>
<h5>Step 4: Think of the stories!</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1226.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5595" alt="IMG_1226" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1226-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Let’s just say you’re the perfect traveler person.</p>
<p>You speak the language fluently.</p>
<p>You blend in with the locals.</p>
<p>You can convert the exchange rate in your head.</p>
<p>And you have never once ended up accidentally ordering something you didn&#8217;t mean to order.</p>
<p>You’re still going to want some annoying people around you, if only so you’ll have some good stories to tell when you get home.</p>
<p>Because nobody wants to hear <i>your</i> stories – you know, the ones about how you’re so awesome and how your trip was so awesome and how awesomely awesome all the awesome was.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>People don’t like stories about awesome.</p>
<p>People like stories about other people making total asses out of themselves And then accidentally eating pig intestines for lunch.</p>
<div id="attachment_5567" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1537.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5567" alt="&quot;Lift pork&quot;? Could be intestine. Better order it to find out." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1537-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Lift pork&#8221;? Could be intestine. Better order it to find out.</p></div>
<p>I should know.</p>
<p>I’ve been making a total ass out of myself in foreign countries since 1995!</p>
<p>And, not to brag or anything, but people LOVE my stories! Especially the ones that involve my accidentally eating big piles of pig intestines.</p>
<h5>Step 5: Join ‘em.</h5>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1434.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5604" alt="IMG_1434" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1434-300x256.jpg" width="300" height="256" /></a></p>
<p>You know that old saying, “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.”</p>
<p>Well, you can’t beat the annoying people.</p>
<p>Because, again, that would be bad. And would require hand-eye coordination.</p>
<p>So you might as well join them.</p>
<p>Because sometimes you need to be annoying.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to complain about your latte because you know it’s just a latte but you’re tired and you’re under-caffeinated and it’s nine o’clock in the morning and you just wanted skim milk and you’re stuck on a bus with fifty people and WHY IS EVERYONE CHEWING SO LOUDLY?</p>
<p>It’s good to know that during those sometimes when you’re being the annoying person, that you’re not alone – that there are other people on that bus that know exactly how you feel.</p>
<p>Even if they’re totally not making eye contact with you at the moment.</p>
<div id="attachment_5526" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5526" alt="Hey guys!

<p>If you read other blogs regularly, maybe you’ve noticed that there are a lot of bloggers out there who always seem to be going on cool press trips and getting elaborate, comped, restaurant meals and staying in fancy hotel rooms for free.</p>
<p>If you read my blog regularly, maybe you’ve noticed I am not one of those bloggers.</p>
<p>Because, seriously, you guys, if I were one of those bloggers, do you think I’d opt <a title="Unbrave Reads: And, Also, My Palms Are Sweaty" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/and-also-my-palms-are-sweaty/">to sit on a bus for twelve hours</a>?</p>
<div id="attachment_5544" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9828.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5544" alt="This is how I roll. Unfortunately." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9828-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is how I roll. Unfortunately.</p></div>
<p>This is clearly the action of a woman who foots her own travel bill.</p>
<p>And the action of a woman who very accurately matches the <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins133991.html">Albert Einstein definition of insanity</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you read my blog regularly or irregularly or not-really-at-all-but-you’re-doing-it-today, may I remind you to go vote for my blog for a <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/">Bloggie for the Best Travel Weblog</a>. YES, I AM <i>STILL</i> TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU ALL GO VOTE FOR ME AND MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST GIRL EVER, AND I BUY YOU ALL UNICORNS, AND WE DANCE AROUND RAINBOWS TOGETHER!!!</p>
<p>Or until you all hate me, and I end up <a title="Weeklyish Challengey Thingie: Pamper Myself" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2012/12/pamper-myself/">drinking in my shower</a>.</p>
<p>Not like that would be a first.</p>
<div id="attachment_4759" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_9135.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4759" alt="IMG_9135" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_9135-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shower gel? Check. Shampoo? Check. Beer? Check. Let&#8217;s get this shower started.</p></div>
<p><i>Ahem.</i></p>
<p>Where was I, again?</p>
<p>Oh, yes, about The Free Stuff.</p>
<p>Mind you, I do not feel that accepting The Free Stuff would affect my journalistic integrity.</p>
<p>I mean, you’ve read my blog, right?</p>
<p>Whatever “journalistic integrity” is, I assure you, I don’t have it.</p>
<p>The thing is to get The Free Stuff, you have to actually ask The People Who Give The Free Stuff to give it to you.</p>
<p>This is the funny thing about The People.</p>
<p>They usually won’t just email you and say, “Hey, want some Free Stuff?”</p>
<p>Okay, so, sometimes, they do.</p>
<p>I did get this super adorable pair of <a href="http://tieks.com/">Tieks</a> shoes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7906.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4549" alt="IMG_7906" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_7906-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Which are perfect for traveling. But not so perfect for Buffalo, as it&#8217;s been snowing since October, so I&#8217;ve only been able to wear them once. But I promise to wear them and tell you all about them. You know, once I no longer have to risk frostbite to do so.</p>
<p>And I’ve gotten more than one offer for a free travel iron. Because, apparently, The People think I look like a hot mess while I travel.</p>
<p>The People may have a point.</p>
<div id="attachment_5526" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5526" alt="Oh. Dear. Lord." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_6135-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh. Dear. Lord.</p></div>
<p>Usually, in order to get The Free Stuff, you have to do a lot of researching and emailing and networking and talking to The People and going to conferences with The People and then talking to more of The People.</p>
<p>And, well, I’ve been busy.</p>
<p>You know, working and moving home and watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igHaMOX_paM">screaming goat videos</a>.</p>
<p>So it wasn’t until <a title="Thank you for your support. And for almost getting me arrested. But mostly for your support." href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/2013-bloggies-nomination/">last weekend</a> that I got my very first taste of what it feels like to be a travel blogger who wields her travel blogger powers for good.</p>
<p>Or at least for free hotel rooms.</p>
<p>And, let’s just say, you guys, I could <i>totally</i> get used to this.</p>
<p>You see, last Saturday I went up to Toronto to meet up with some other fine lady travel bloggers.</p>
<p>And, in case you&#8217;re wondering, I did totally take the bus there.</p>
<div id="attachment_5508" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0923.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5508" alt="The bus to Toronto. Luckily it didn't take 12 hours. And there was some interesting hair to watch along the way." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0923-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The bus to Toronto. Luckily it didn&#8217;t take 12 hours. And there was some interesting hair to watch along the way.</p></div>
<p>After our afternoon spent <a title="Unbrave Eats: Battle Kimchi at Yakitori Bar in Toronto" href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/battle-kimchi/">shoving kimchi and booze</a> into our faces, we spent the evening in a suite at the <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/royal-york-toronto/">Fairmount Royal York</a>, which was finagled for us by the lovely <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/royal-york-toronto/">Pam</a>.</p>
<p>As the name suggests the Fairmont Royal York is very regal.</p>
<p>The lobby was full of ornate chandeliers and huge flower arrangements and the type of people who look like they might actually iron their clothing while they are on vacation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0941.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5509" alt="IMG_0941" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0941-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There was even a big book in the lobby with autographs from some of the “Guests of the Distinction,” which included royalty and various other celebrities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0951.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5512" alt="IMG_0951" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0951-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Or as I referred to it &#8220;Guests Who Probably Didn&#8217;t Have to Take the Bus Here. And If They Did It Was Probably Some Kind of Crazy Gold-Plated, Hovercraft Bus.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fanciness didn’t stop at the lobby, of course. Our suite was one big room full of super swanky.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="attachment_5514" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1058.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5514 " alt="Our suite. Or half of it." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1058-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our super swanky suite. Or half of it.</p></div>
<p>Our window had a view of <a href="http://www.cntower.ca/Intro.html">CN Tower</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1125.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5525" alt="IMG_1125" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1125-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The television took up half of the wall.</p>
<div id="attachment_5529" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1126.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5529" alt="The wall is somewhere behind the TV. I think." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1126-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The wall is somewhere behind the TV. I think.</p></div>
<p>And the bathroom was stocked with cushy bathrobes and slippers and mini-bottles of fancy French-named toiletries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1060.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5515" alt="IMG_1060" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1060-232x300.jpg" width="232" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There was even a shoe mitten! I mean, you know a place is fancy when there is a mitten for your shoes!</p>
<div id="attachment_5516" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1062.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5516 " alt="Shoe mitten!" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1062-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">French toiletries! Mouth wash! Shoe mitten!</p></div>
<p>But more impressive than the view and the massive TV and the shoe mitten, was the customer service.</p>
<p>Yes, I said <i>more impressive</i> <i>than the shoe mitten. </i></p>
<p>And I bet you didn’t think stuff could get much more impressive than a shoe mitten!</p>
<p>Because I know I certainly didn’t!</p>
<p>Seconds after we stepped into our room, someone from the front desk called us to ask us if we were satisfied with our suite.</p>
<p>Like, what were we going to say to that?</p>
<p>“Oh, no, can you give us a different free suite. This one is <em>way</em> too free. And we want a TV that takes up the <i>whole</i> wall, not just half of it. Sheez.”</p>
<p>Then not five minutes later, room service arrived bearing a cart full of cheese plates and fresh fruit and wine.</p>
<div id="attachment_5520" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1068.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5520" alt="IMG_1068" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1068-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheese!

<p>There was even a handwritten note wishing us all a happy stay.</p>

<p>You guys, I’m pretty sure this is what it’s like when you travel with a rock band.</p>
<p>Except my rock band was a bunch of lady bloggers.</p>
<p>So, you know, instead of setting the carpet on fire and throwing the couch out the window, we spent the evening devouring cheese plates and having heated discussions over how we should hashtag our tweets.</p>
<p>I am not even kidding you.</p>

<p>When my friend, <a href="http://www.spunkygirlmonologues.com/">Pam</a>, first told me that she’d signed us up to attend something called Battle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi">Kimchi</a> at <a href="http://yakitoribar.ca/">Yakitori Bar</a>, one of her favorite haunts in Toronto, <a title="Thank you for your support. And for almost getting me arrested. But mostly for your support." href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/2013/02/2013-bloggies-nomination/">this past weekend</a>, I imagined us being surrounded by lots of hot, hunky, Korean chefs.</p>
<p>Not that this is anything new.</p>
<p>I like to imagine myself being surrounded by lots of hot, hunky, Korean chefs on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Because, I mean, come on, guys.</p>
<p>HOT, HUNKY, KOREAN CHEFS!</p>
<p>Who <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to be surrounded by <em>that</em>?</p>
<div id="attachment_5464" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8247.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5464 " alt="Notice the hunk is in a white shirt. I'm pretty sure that means he's a chef." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8247-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I think this guy is a chef. Notice the white shirt. And the girl swooning in his arms.</p></div>
<p>However, this was the first time I had an opportunity to make my dream become a reality.</p>
<p>Well, other than that time I went to Korea.</p>
<p>But when I was in Korea, I was too busy shoving all the food into my face to check out any of the hot dudes who were cooking it up for me. Because, seriously, you guys, they give you a LOT of food in Korea. Your typical meal consists of, like, ten to eleventy billion dishes. And each dish is totally amazing.</p>
<div id="attachment_5465" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8495.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5465  " alt="A typical Korean meal for one. I'm pretty sure this was the &quot;dainty eater&quot; size." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_8495-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A typical Korean meal for one. How I managed to leave that country still wearing pants is beyond me.</p></div>
<p>These are the kind of meals you need to concentrate all your energy on. No multi-tasking or mooning over the cook allowed!</p>
<p>Before heading over to Yakitori Bar for the battle (or “My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_cute">Meet-Cute</a> With My Future Husband,” as I had started to refer to it), Pam and I stopped by a bar called <a href="http://www.sinandredemption.com/">Sin &amp; Redemption</a> for a few drinks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0972.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5452" alt="IMG_0972" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0972-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Which, you have to admit, is pretty much the best name for a bar <em>ever.</em></p>
<p>Okay, so maybe a better name for a bar might be: Free Beer &amp; Have You Lost Weight?</p>
<p>But Sin &amp; Redemption is pretty up there with epic bar names.</p>
<p>They had this beer there that tasted exactly like grapefruit juice. I’m pretty sure it was some kind of smoothie. Which meant I didn’t have to feel so bad about getting my drink on at noon.</p>
<p>Not that I’d ever feel bad about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>But still.</p>
<div id="attachment_5453" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0975.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5453 " alt="My grapefruity beer." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0975-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My grapefruity beer. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s for lunch.</p></div>
<p>We also met up with two of Pam&#8217;s friends, <a href="http://anywhereandhere.com/">Tammy</a> and <a href="http://mylifeuntethered.com/">Alicia</a>, who were  joining us at Battle Kimchi. Because, you know, you can never have too many wing women.</p>
<p>And when going to something with the word “battle” in the name, it’s a good idea to roll four deep.</p>
<div id="attachment_5476" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1117.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5476 " alt="Getting ready to hit on some chefs with Pam, Alicia &amp; Tammy. (Okay, so this was totally later in the day. But I was too busy drinking earlier to take photos.) " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1117-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Getting ready to hit on some chefs with the ladies. (Okay, so this was totally later in the day. But I was too busy drinking earlier to take photos.)</p></div>
<p>When we arrived at the scheduled smackdown, things were just getting underway.</p>
<p>The chefs were starting to take their places around the restaurant. Each chef was serving their own raw kimchi as well as a unique dish that used kimchi as one of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Next to each chef’s station were ballot cards where you could vote on the dishes.</p>
<div id="attachment_5459" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0992.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5459 " alt="I don't see any place where I get to rate the hunkiness of the chef. " src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0992-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Huh. Where do I get to rate the hunkiness of the chef?</p></div>
<p>To me, this seemed like a surprisingly democratic and not so battley way of determining the winner. I was imagining something more along the lines of shirtless wrestling. Of course, in my imagination all the contestants looked like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2024644/">Daniel Henney</a>. And they’d all be wrestling with me.</p>
<p>While we waited for the food to be ready, we moseyed up to the bar and ordered something called white sake sangria. Our drinks were topped off with floating berries. So, again<i>, totally</i><em> a smoothie.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_5458" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0989.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5458" alt="White sake sangria. It's what's for... what meal are we on now?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0989-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">White sake sangria. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s for&#8230; what meal are we on now?</p></div>
<p>And then we descended upon the kimchi and all its marvelous incarnations.</p>
<p>There was everything from kimchi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crostini">crostini</a> to kimchi bacon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap">bibimbap</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_5462" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1016.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5462  " alt="Hello, there, lover." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_1016-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bacon? And bibimbap? And kimchi? Together? YES, PLEASE.</p></div>
<p>There was even kimchi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">poutine</a>. I mean, we <em>were</em> in Canada after all. I think it&#8217;s some kind of legal requirement that every restaurant has to serve poutine in Canada.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it really should be.</p>
<p>Because GRAVY AND CHEESE AND FRIES AND OMIGOD, YOU GUYS.</p>
<div id="attachment_5463" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_10221.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5463" alt="Kimchi poutine. Hello, there, lover." src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_10221-222x300.jpg" width="222" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kimchi poutine. Hello, there, lover.</p></div>
<p>As I was a little busy stuffing my face full of booze and kimchi and gravy-covered fries, it took me a while to notice that there wasn’t a single hot, hunky Korean chef in the entire place. At least not any hot, hunky Korean chefs of the male variety.</p>
<p>If the demographics of the kimchi chefs in attendance were any indicator, kimchi-making is typically a lady affair.</p>
<div id="attachment_5460" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 288px"><a href="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0996.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5460 " alt="One of the lovely kimchi-making ladies. I wonder if she has a single brother?" src="http://www.unbravegirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0996-278x300.jpg" width="278" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of the lovely kimchi-making lady chefs. I wonder if she has a single brother?</p></div>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s kind of like the Korean version of making jam. Except this jam could put some serious hair on your chest.</p>
<p>I was a little bit heartbroken that I wouldn’t be meeting my future husband in this crowd.</p>
<p>Luckily, that kind of heartbreak is easily cured.</p>
<p>With gravy, of course.</p>
<p><em>If you could go to a food smackdown, what kind of food would you want the chefs to be battling it out over? And would there be any wrestling involved? Preferably with shirtless, Daniel-Henney-lookalikes?<br />

<p><em>P.S. I know I just bugged you about this on <a title="Thank you for your support. And for almost getting me arrested.
