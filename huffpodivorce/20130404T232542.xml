        &lt;p&gt;Following my separation almost three years ago, I thought I was ready. You usually don't split up when things have been going great in the romance department. It was me.  Really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out... I wasn't ready. There were my kids. They needed my total love and attention. There was me. I needed it, too. After years of being someone's other half, I vaguely recalled that I was once a "whole." And, lord help me, a hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also my career to consider. "What career?" my ex might ask. To him success is measured in dollars. Period. And since I stopped having one, I hadn't been making many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dating &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be a distraction. I took solace in the belief that once I got the $$$$$$ happening, the dancing boys would follow. They were both taking their time, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After endless movie nights sans escort, as the loneliness became palpable, my therapist suggested (Hell yes, I have a therapist. I'm Jewish.) that I talk to my kids about my reemergence into the dating world. Reemergence? I'd never really dated. It was... a look across a crowded, smoke-filled room, and then exchange keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kinder were cool. As long as they approved. That list had... no names on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I dipped a toe in the water, or, what I came to fondly call, "the cesspool from hell." First there was the handsome policeman. "Copper" would text me incessantly, all day for days, and then disappear, without explanation, for weeks at a time. After the second round, I "lost" his number. At least it didn't take three strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was the insanely smart and funny guy. I wasn't exactly attracted to "Writer" &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;way, but there's nothing sexier than the smart and the funny. We talked on the phone for hours at a time... sometimes till morning, but it always ended in high drama with him being cold and demeaning. Hey, I can call my mother for that shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was "Midwest Guy," who after a slow-build, mutual flirt, decided to fly left, to take me to dinner, combine a bit of business, and see old pals. On the morning of our rendezvous, "Midwest Guy"  confided to a mutual friend, "I'm having dinner with Vicki. I think she thinks it's a date." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cancel. My therapist talked me out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at what is considered the third most romantic restaurant in L.A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He greeted me with a kiss. On the lips. He escorted me to a dark corner table banquette, the choicest, most secluded spot in the dining room. With &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; word, and I mean every word, he touched my hand, my arm, gazed into my eyes. For hours. As he walked me to my car, he asked permission to kiss me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what they call a non-date in Boise? Go fuck yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there was the "Hero." As in legend, not sandwich. After innumerable attempts to get his attention on Twitter, for &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; reasons, one day, I did. For the next couple of weeks we Tweeted, emailed, spoke on the phone and laughed like hell. Then he began to slide away, without a word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was me. &lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt; It had to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time I was despondent. Sure I was cursed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My therapist thought perhaps I was coming across a tad too strong and independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who &lt;em&gt;me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She challenged me to be vulnerable and ask a man to coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this new friend... "Comic," was younger, handsome, exceedingly sharp and amusing. I sucked it up, held my breath and asked. He proceeded to tell me that he had, only three days prior, joined the "sex program" and was not allowed to coffee with girls. Even, "just friend" girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now even my therapist was despondent. She took to wearing garlic at our sessions. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
There was a coffee date with "I'm a Designer But I'm Not Gay Even Though I'm Wearing a Pink Scarf and Khaki Linen Pants Guy," midday... no food... even though we were both salivating over everyone else's. Was he cheap? Food phobic? Or am I just not salad worthy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago at a friend's intimate soir√©e, I met, "Young, Super Famous, I Never Thought He Was Attractive Till I Met Him and Then, Holy Shit, Guy." He flirted me up like crazy and then got pulled away abruptly before we could exchange info... kind of. He did mention where he lives. &lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt; where he lives. He said, on purpose. I haven't acted upon it. My kids are begging me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marry him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If something doesn't happen soon, I may stalker his ass, and take up that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If your boyfriend has a close relationship with his mother, it's difficult not to feel like second best. Relationship expert &lt;a href="http://www.sussmancounseling.com" target="_hplink"&gt;Rachel Sussman&lt;/a&gt; joined me on Mondays With Marlo to tackle this tricky situation. Often, tension builds in couples when one partner hasn't really separated from their parents or siblings when in a relationship. The best way to handle this, Rachel said, is to speak with your partner calmly -- without acting jealous or shaming him -- and explaining that if he can handle a relationship with his mom differently, you two can become closer. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;When you're a parent going through divorce, your chief concern often lies with how your children's lives will be altered by the split. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new &lt;a href="http://splitfilm.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;documentary "Split,"&lt;/a&gt; San Francisco filmmaker Ellen Bruno has children explain exactly how they were affected by their parents' divorces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doc, set to be released on June 8, features 12 kids -- ages six through 12 -- candidly sharing their feelings about their divorce and all the messy complications that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes I think that because I'm mad or mean or I did something bad to them, I think it's my fault that they're divorced," says one girl in the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's like something that you really love like breaks and you can't put it back together kind of," says another. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a December 2012 &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/vicki-larson/what-kids-think-about-div_b_2236747.html" target="_hplink"&gt;interview with The Huffington Post,&lt;/a&gt; Bruno explained why she decided to let the kids share their experiences in their own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Kids are wise and intuitive, and when given the space to share their experiences, they speak a truth that is clear and profound," Bruno said. "And kids listen to other kids, often far more attentively than they listen to adults." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information on "Split," head to the &lt;a href="http://splitfilm.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;official site for the doc. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Do you have to fess up to everything, or is it healthy to keep a few skeletons in your closet? Relationship expert &lt;a href="http://www.sussmancounseling.com" target="_hplink"&gt;Rachel Sussman&lt;/a&gt; helped me answer that question when she came by Mondays With Marlo. It's important to maintain healthy boundaries, she explained. Couples don't need to share every specific thing that occurred with previous partners. Instead, focus on a person's relationship history, like whether they have had successful relationships in the past or what kind of partners they paired with. &lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;What do Alcoholics Anonymous, a suicide prevention hotline, and confession have in common? They all entail telling your problems to people you don't know (or know well). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But isn't that what friendships are for? Your friends turn to you and you to them in times of need? As the song goes, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Lean on me, when you're not strong. &lt;br /&gt;
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on. &lt;br /&gt;
For it won't be long 'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, talking to friends or a trusted therapist is important, but talking to a stranger has some surprising advantages that friends and family can't match. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the positive aspects of telling your troubles to an unknown party:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can be more honest and open because you have nothing to hide and there's a greater sense of confidentiality:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes personal problems involve details that are too personal to tell friends or family about because you don't want them to know something about you or your situation. One man couldn't tell his best friend about the woman he was romantically involved with because she was the friend's co-worker and she wanted to keep her private life private. He could tell a stranger because there was no chance of the word getting out at her office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don't fear being judged by this stranger:&lt;/strong&gt; A stranger may judge you but who cares? You may never talk to that person again so whatever criticism they have of you won't impact you the way it might with a friend or someone in your social circles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The anonymous person is not emotionally involved so they can give clearer feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; A common tale is the acrimonious dynamic between a woman's husband and her best friend because the woman complains to her husband about the bone-head things the best friend says or does and complains to the best friend about the things her husband does that are not okay. The best friend can't understand why the woman is married to such a jerk, and the husband can't understand why the woman can call the other woman her "best friend." When you talk to an anonymous party, you don't need to worry about the alienation of these two important people in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unbiased opinion can be helpful: &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing that someone is making a decision solely based on the facts presented can be very helpful. Those close to you can't be unbiased. Perhaps they have seen the previous trials and tribulations and they "just want you to feel better," so they tell you what they think is helpful: "Just leave." But that's not really helpful because it's not so easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A stranger is less likely to pry when you're telling them your problems:&lt;/strong&gt; A stranger may ask clarifying questions but he or she is less likely to poke her nose where it doesn't belong like a protective sister or friend might. And a stranger may have more of a "just the facts, Ma'am" attitude which can help focus the issues for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strangers won't pressure you to follow their advice:&lt;/strong&gt; A friend might say, "have you called that attorney I told you about?" If you say, "No," they may get indignant or frustrated and say something like, "What are you waiting for?" or "What's the problem?" whereas a stranger would not have the same judgment and would not likely feel insulted if you weren't able to incorporate the feedback. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no hidden agenda:&lt;/strong&gt; A stranger will not usually engage in politics, guilt trips, schemes, or pushiness. It's inappropriate for anyone to prey on your vulnerabilities in order to advance their agenda or make you feel bad about your choices, but friends and family tend to take more liberties with telling you what you "should" do (or "should have done"). Strangers will never say, "I told you so."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are more likely to get a new perspective you never thought of:&lt;/strong&gt; Going to the same people for advice will often render the same types of feedback or information. Seeking the support of someone completely outside your realm may provide you with a refreshing outlook on your situation that you and your loved ones are too steeped in to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of call in meetings, hotlines and confessions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aatelephonemeetings/" target="_hplink"&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/aatelephonemeetings/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/mr-apology-2_n_2901649.html" target="_hplink"&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/mr-apology-2_n_2901649.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, some of these pros can also be cons, so the bottom line is to find the support that works best for you in your particular situation. I hope this article has helped you think outside the box a bit so that you can expand your support network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to the success of this model, I'll be hosting a call for women who are divorcing or contemplating divorce on Monday, April 22 at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST). The title of the call is,&lt;strong&gt; "The Divorcing Woman's Guide to: "What Keeps You Up at Night." &lt;/strong&gt;The call is free but you must register. Email&lt;a href="mailto: info@changingmarriage.com" target="_hplink"&gt; info@changingmarriage.com&lt;/a&gt; to get your name on the list and get registration details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any men who are interested in this type of call, please email me as well and if there is enough interest, I'll schedule a call just for men at the end of April.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>The first action necessary to embrace the victor over victim mentality is to realize that you have control over your future. Once you accept that you are the only person who controls your destiny, you can let go of any resentment from past trials.</summary>
    <author>

    </author>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;"As long as you think that the cause of your problem is "out there"--as long as you think that anyone or anything is responsible for your suffering--the situation is hopeless. It means that you are forever in the role of victim, that you're suffering in paradise." &lt;br /&gt;
‚Äï Byron Katie,&lt;em&gt; Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	I have two scenarios for you to consider. In the first, you see a single mother. Her husband cheated on her for years.  She is upbeat, she is happy and she goes through life smiling.  She enjoys her children, yet she is able to enjoy the weekends they are with their father when she is able to do some adult things. She encourages her children to have a good relationship with their father and feels glad that they enjoy being with him.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	In the second, you see a single mother. Her husband cheated on her for years. She looks haggard, scowls and goes through life just trying to get through the day. Her children are a chore, but when they are with their father she resents that they are gone.  When they have fun with him, she sees it as a betrayal of her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	We all know people (women or men) who fit into each of these categories.  How is it that some divorced people are able to have a sense of joy and ease about them while others seem to have the weight of the world bearing down on them?  I believe that the difference lies in attitude.  If you live as a victor, you will be a victor.  If you live as a victim, you will be a victim.  I believe if you empower yourself with the mindset of a victor and recognize it as a choice rather than a circumstance, the victim will fall off of you life like the chrysalis of a butterfly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	The first action necessary to embrace the victor over victim mentality is to realize that you have control over your future.  Whatever has happened in the past was difficult.  The nature of divorce is difficulty.  Once you accept that you are the only person who controls your destiny, you can let go of any resentment from past trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	The first step in controlling your own destiny is to relieve yourself from the burden of being invested in your ex. If you are invested in your ex's behavior whether it relates to whom he dates or how he spends money, then it is difficult not to see a cause and effect relationship between what he does and how you feel. This is a two-fold problem.  It leads to wanting to change his behavior (control), and it leads to thinking his behavior affects you (victim).    &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
     The fact is, once you are divorced, you have no say in what your ex does, who he dates and how he spends his money. After all, you don't want your ex to have a say in your decisions, right?  To think that you have a say in your ex's life is to try and maintain some degree of control over him.  When you try to maintain control and realize you can't, it invokes anger, frustration and resentment.  These feelings lead to identifying yourself as a victim of your ex's behavior.  Let go of control.  The knowledge and acceptance that you can only control yourself and what goes on at your house is liberating and empowering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	The next step into victory is to re-learn how to communicate with your ex, particularly in the beginning. Sometimes old habits are hard to break, so in the first stages of separation and divorce, I recommend that you communicate only by email and only about topics specific to the children. These topics are health, schedules and the academic well-being of the children.  This will eliminate the temptation to get into other conversations that may not be related to the children. Anything not related to the children is in opposition to you trying to become un-invested. Eventually things may evolve and communication may flow more easily, but in the beginning, when you are trying to re-learn how to think about yourself and your own goals, it is better not to drift into past habits and hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	Next, practice the Golden Rule.  If you behave as you would like your ex to behave, you do not create conflict. Conflict leads to negative communication and that keeps you invested in the anger and hurt of the past.  If you are the custodial parent, make absolutely certain to provide your ex with schedules, school notices and information about your child necessary for your ex to participate in every way.  If you are the non-custodial parent, make every effort to gather information about your child from readily available sources such as school websites, sports team websites, etc.  Again, practice the Golden Rule by providing information as you would have it provided to you. Otherwise, you are provoking your ex which keeps you invested.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Keep your focus on you, your kids and the future.  When you take responsibility for your own feelings and actions, you are empowered to make changes and be happy.  You are divorced from your ex.  There are reasons for that.  The reasons will probably not change.  If you do not expect the reasons to change, and you can accept the way things are, your only option is to recognize that you and only you control your reaction to your circumstances.  You and only you control your future.  This is your victory.  And this is the lesson to teach your kids.  Empowering yourself to claim responsibility for your destiny and your happiness empowers your children to know they can choose happiness, too.  And they will learn to choose to be victors of their own lives rather than victims.  And that is the greatest victory of all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/">
        &lt;p&gt;Former South Carolina Gov. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/mark-sanford-wins_n_3002674.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Mark Sanford won&lt;/a&gt; the GOP nomination in the race for an open House seat in his state Tuesday night, and in a rare public appearance, his fiancee, Maria Belen Chapur, stood by his side during his victory speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20130404/PC16/130409681/1165/still-mysterious-maria-belen-chapur-slid-in-and-out-quietly" target="_hplink"&gt;Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;, Chapur is only visiting from Argentina for a short while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So who is the woman at the center of the &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/23/sanfords-story-questioned_n_219809.html" target="_hplink"&gt;2009 scandal&lt;/a&gt; that derailed Sanford's political career? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/22/mark-sanford-disappeared_n_219139.html" target="_hplink"&gt;June 2009&lt;/a&gt;, Sanford, then governor of South Carolina, disappeared for several days, claiming to be on a solo hiking trip along the Appalachian Trail. It was soon revealed that the hike was a cover-up -- Sanford was in fact &lt;a href="http://www.thestate.com/2009/06/25/839231/sanford-admits-affair-ive-let.html" target="_hplink"&gt;headed to Argentina&lt;/a&gt; to visit Chapur, with whom he had been having an extramarital affair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the affair became public, Sanford tearfully confessed his infidelity and his wife, &lt;a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/02/26/88776/jenny-sanford-granted-divorce.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Jenny Sanford&lt;/a&gt;, filed for divorce. The former first lady of South Carolina said &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/26/jenny-sanford-how-i-found_n_221785.html" target="_hplink"&gt;she knew&lt;/a&gt; about the affair months before its public revelation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2012, Sanford revealed that he and Chapur are &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/25/mark-sanford-engaged_n_1830330.html" target="_hplink"&gt;engaged&lt;/a&gt;, but still little is known about Chapur's identity. According to &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1908008_1908007_1907930,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Chapur is in her forties and is a former TV reporter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanford and his fiancee rarely appear together in public. Until Tuesday's election night festivities, Chapur was nowhere to be seen during Sanford's &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/19/mark-sanford-2014_n_2716341.html" target="_hplink"&gt;redemption campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Is cheating really that bad? And when are you allowed to forgive someone for going outside the relationship? &lt;a href="http://www.sussmancounseling.com" target="_hplink"&gt;Rachel Sussman&lt;/a&gt; tackled these questions when she joined me on Mondays With Marlo. The short answer, said Rachel, is that it depends on the couple. If someone's trust is broken, it might be one of the most painful things they've experienced, and it can be hard to recover from. But if the relationship is on rocky ground already, this can be an opportunity for both parties to figure out why the cheating happened and work on restoring the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If your significant other has cheated on a partner in the past, does that mean he or she will cheat on you? Relationship therapist &lt;a href="http://www.sussmancounseling.com/" target="_hplink"&gt;Rachel Sussman&lt;/a&gt; set the record straight when she joined me on Mondays with Marlo. Rachel explained that people can change, and if your spouse has a cohesive explanation for their past offense, you probably have nothing to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;

	    <title>Ann Brenoff: What It Was REALLY Like For This Post 50 Woman To Travel Without Her Husband</title>

        &lt;p&gt;When I was single and in my 20s, I loved traveling alone. Traveling with friends required compromises I resented having to make: They wanted to sleep til noon while I rose with the sun raring to go; they preferred booking tours to eliminate any uncertainties while I liked using public transportation for self-guided exploration and saw those uncertainties they worried about as the adrenaline that fueled the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how we take our coffee and our travel changes, I learned, as we pass through life's stages. At some point, standing in front of the Eiffel Tower without someone to pose next to me in the picture made me feel sad and lonely instead of bravely alone. I still wanted to be the captain of my ship, but I knew I wanted a co-captain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shape of my traveling changed further after I got married and had a family. I not only didn't  get to travel alone anymore, it would be accurate to say that I pretty much never went anywhere, including to the bathroom, unaccompanied. I remember a rare stolen moment once when I found myself alone in the grocery store without kids pulling on my arms or needing to be chased down or taken to the bathroom just as I made my way to the front of the checkout line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being alone was so liberating, even if it was just at the supermarket. I lingered in the vegetable aisle thinking the leeks and arugula were as beautiful as the gardens of Versailles; the produce misters reminded me of a Rome cafe in August; and the stranger who struck up a conversation with me in the deli line recalled the handsome Italian tourist I met in the line at the Louvre and with whom I wound up having dinner. When I returned to the car parked in the supermarket lot where my husband had remained behind with our two napping children, he sarcastically noted how long I had taken and asked, "Did you have a nice little vacation in there?" Yes, I had, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my kids are a teen and a tween and I just had a new travel epiphany. The kids were off school for Spring Break and at the last minute, my desert-averse husband begged off on our planned trip to the Palm Springs area. At first I balked; this would be the first time we took a family vacation without all of us there and it simply felt odd. My son joked about how we could "photoshop him" in to the photos when we got home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Dad, we'll leave room for you on the left," my daughter told him. I wasn't comforted or found any of it funny. I was focused instead on not having him there to do all the things he normally does for us on vacations -- research what stuff we should to do, read the restaurant reviews on &lt;a href="http://TripAdvisor.com" target="_hplink"&gt;TripAdvisor.com&lt;/a&gt; so we'd know where to eat, get directions to everything, share the driving, check the hotel bill for extra charges with the passion of Sherlock Holmes and of course remember to bring an extra pair of reading glasses so, between us, someone could see the menu. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small stuff, you say? Sweet stuff, I would answer. Stuff that epitomizes the team work we bring to a marriage, the division of labor where one person's shortcomings are addressed not with resentment but with support. Let's just say this small taste of flying solo was leaving me with a sense of dread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we loaded up the car for the three-hour trip, I flashed back to a woman I met in a youth hostel in Istanbul about 40 years ago. She was a single mom with kids about 8 and 10 and was on an extended year-long journey, homeschooling her son and daughter as she went. I remember thinking how cool she was and how if I ever became a mom, I wanted to be just like her. She was adventurous, untraditional, and with an unending reserve of patience to be alone with her children non-stop. The Istanbul mom and her kids traveled for a year carrying less luggage than I was taking to a resort in the desert for five days. And I was feeling not-so adventurous and quite traditional. I ran out of patience with my kids before we even left the driveway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Are you sure you won't come?" I asked my husband a final time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He understood where I was coming from immediately. He packed me an emergency travel "kit" that included jumper cables, a photo copy of our AAA card to keep in the car, printed out directions (and programmed the GPS as backup), threw in a case of bottled water, two extra pairs of reading glasses and a suggested itinerary (with directions and discount coupons) to area activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did the kids and I fare? Just fine, of course. In fact, on some level not having to worry about whether my husband was having a good time left me feeling more relaxed. We also realized that the pace of our activities was greatly slowed when Mom was the only adult there to direct them. My husband has a tendency to treat vacations as the Bataan Death March, a non-stop activity fest with no rest for the weary. He believes that sleep is something you do on the plane coming home and every waking moment in a foreign locale (and there should be 20 hours a day of waking moments) must be filled with doing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the desert, the kids and I kept to a much less rigorous schedule. We slept in, stayed up late playing Words For Friends with each other, and passed up the experience of trying a hot new restaurant in favor of a poolside dinner of burgers and fries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband would have hated it. But thanks to photoshop, he'll be smiling in all the pictures anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Chantal loves rats. She has since she was 16-years-old, when she got her first one. Since that time, she said she knew this was her calling in life. A calling that got her featured on the season premiere of "&lt;a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-04-crazy-obsession-merman-mermaid-episode-water-tail-harmless-fun" target="_hplink"&gt;My Crazy Obsession&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, Chantal was faced with a choice between her husband and her rats. She now has about 19 pet rats, and her husband has moved out because of them. If for no other reason, this is evidence enough that her love of the rats has become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point in the episode, her son Kevin said, "I grew up with my siblings, and they were rats, so ... " So, that's a "crazy obsession," right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During filming, one of the rats got sick, and it was devastating for Chantal. She did everything she could to resuscitate Blossom, but the rat passed away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hollywood Reporter said that at least &lt;a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tlcs-my-crazy-obsession-gets-426537" target="_hplink"&gt;the show got off to a pet-friendly start&lt;/a&gt; for its second season. Channel Guide Magazine agreed, saying that Chantal was the perfect person to kick off the season because &lt;a href="http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2013/04/02/rat-lady-my-crazy-obsession-season-2-of-tlc-series/" target="_hplink"&gt;she's both obsessed and crazy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune in for more surprises on "My Crazy Obsession," Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET on TLC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TV Replay scours the vast television landscape to find the most interesting, amusing, and, on a good day, amazing moments, and delivers them right to your browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;This morning, an email from my ex-husband: &lt;em&gt;If you get the 25th through the 3rd that's 10 days, which leaves the split at 10 to 6.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how Larry and I discuss divvying up vacation time with our three kids. Matter-of-fact emails; our children checkers we move from square to square on some imaginary game board, keeping close track of how long they stay on each side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have spring break this year&lt;/em&gt;, I email back, my fingers jabbing at the keyboard, livid that Larry wants additional days with the children. We have been splitting our parenting time according to a property settlement agreement signed years ago when we divorced, and the scheduling is still grueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You had winter break&lt;/em&gt; I continue typing, feeling he's deliberately trying to make it impossible for me to make plans. &lt;em&gt;I have to buy the plane tickets.&lt;/em&gt; He does not respond, the emails just stop, and I marinate in my anger. I will not call him. A direct conversation would be worse, my emotions would be amplified by anger and I'd tell him I'm going to call my lawyer -- always my default line. Or his.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work, I try to gain control, organizing the junk in my desk drawers, sorting and tossing and thinking of Larry, the man I once married and had children with, who I now wish would just go away, though I know we are knotted into each other's lives forever, as parents of the same three kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night after work, I lie in bed with my husband, who has an ex-wife we coordinate with, and I consider my stepchildren, Luke and Jamie, who are also on co-parenting schedules. "I envy couples who got it right the first time," I say, considering the swarms of normal parents who don't have to separate from their young children on school vacations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stare at the ceiling, a thin streak of moonlight smearing my nightstand. "Should I buy the plane tickets?" I ask Eric, and fall into sleep, my eyes half open all night as if my face has been starched. I dream my ex-husband does not bring the children back to me in time and we miss the flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I wake at 5:00 a.m. to check email but there is nothing new. Worse, in a few hours I will have to see Larry for our son Johnny's fourth-grade teacher conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Cider Mill School, Mrs. Tate, her blonde hair loose around her face, Johnny's first crush, meets us at the classroom door. Larry and I sit on the kid-sized plastic chairs around a circle table and I try to keep my face, my attitude, neutral. Mrs. Tate shows us Johnny's short story &lt;em&gt;The Frog Who Wanted to Fly&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than consider its content, I'm thinking how I need to be the one to take the story home for Johnny's baby book. I want to sneak it into my bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Johnny also did a wonderful job on his social studies and science projects," Mrs. Tate says. I look at my ex-husband with a look that says&lt;em&gt; I'm the one who did those assignments with Johnny, don't you dare take any credit.&lt;/em&gt; I consider the field trip to the aquarium that I chaperoned, the science experiment two nights ago, a Mentos mint dropped in a Coke bottle that produced a ten-foot geyser in our kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Mrs. Tate talks, I keep a silent tally of what homework gets done at my house and what homework gets done at Larry's. In doing so, I miss some of what she says and I wither in my little seat as I become aware on some level of my petty thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I just love having Johnny in my class. He's a super kid," Mrs. Tate says making direct eye contact first with me then with Larry. I don't even want Mrs. Tate to look at Larry, to consider him, to think he had a part in anything that might have made Johnny smart and good-natured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sit for a bit longer, looking at Johnny's standardized test scores, his self-portrait, and then his family tree, complete with both my family and Larry's. I think of Larry's mother, who I love, and his father, a mathematician, who I never met. I consider Johnny's love of math, so much like his grandfather and father. My small thoughts crack enough to let some other possibilities filter in. I consider this man who was supposed to be my forever. I look at his eyes and see my son in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I know that I'm not solely responsible for the boy Johnny has become. My ex has something to do with it. I can't pinpoint what exactly, but I'm willing to admit for a moment that he's Johnny's father and he makes a contribution. I focus in then on what Mrs. Tate is saying instead of the sharp words from the emails Larry and I have been sending. My emotions flip. For the moment, I'm no longer obsessed with who has what day with the children. I'm thinking about Johnny being a well-adjusted little boy, and how perhaps Larry and I, though our behavior is often bad, have not done so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He's a great kid. We did something right," I say to Larry as we leave the school and walk to our separate cars in the parking lot, the morning gray and windy, the leaves blowing off the trees, unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- A Northern California woman is facing 16 years to life behind bars after being convicted of killing her ex-husband by dousing him with scalding water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Mateo County prosecutors say 41-year-old Jesusa Ursonal Tatad pleaded no contest to second-degree murder on Wednesday. She is scheduled to be sentenced May 17.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tatad and her ex-husband, 36-year-old Ronnie Tatad, shared a Daly City apartment. Prosecutors say she pulled back the blankets while he slept on Nov. 26, 2011, and threw a pot of boiling water on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say she was upset because she believed he was seeing another woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Mateo County Times reports (&lt;a href='http://bit.ly/ZAlm2T'&gt;http://bit.ly/ZAlm2T&lt;/a&gt;) that Ronnie Tatad died about two weeks later of a blood infection connected to his burns.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;After many months (or years!), you've finally met someone you can see yourself being with long term. By this time, you've even made all the necessary introductions: your friends think he's a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; upgrade from your ex and your parents can't stop gushing about how well-matched the two of you are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, wait. You've &lt;em&gt;almost &lt;/em&gt;made all the necessary introductions. The last step? Introducing him to your kids. After waiting to make sure your relationship is the real deal, you're finally ready to make that move.  &lt;/p&gt;
