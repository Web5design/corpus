        &lt;p&gt;Here's one for the books. A Roman Catholic father in Maryland has asked his lawyer, Paul C. Sullivan, to pen one of the most horrific pieces of undeniable bigotry that I have seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Taylor and Kelly Robertson were married, had two sons and then divorced (as has been known to happen). Kelly was awarded custody of the children, with visitation rights for Ed. Since then, it seems that Kelly has become friends with a gay man, Chris. Kelly has since remarried, and she sometimes asks Chris to babysit her kids (as has been known to happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, that's not OK with ultra-Catholic Ed. The following letter was sent to Kelly with regard to her parenting. In the letter, Paul Sullivan engages in a homophobic tirade ignorantly linking being gay with being a child predator, claiming that by having a gay person around the house, Kelly is "encouraging a homosexual lifestyle," and threatening investigations and custody trials should Kelly not reverse the child's dangerous course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the lawyer and father have been in communication with the sheriff, the county commissioners, the vice principal and the guidance counselor of the middle school that Kelly's son attends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly's friend Chris has no record of being a child predator, or really any criminal record whatsoever, but the lawyer's letter also threatens to pursue criminal proceedings against him merely for babysitting Kelly's son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were 1950, I might understand some of the homophobic and vitriolic things being claimed here by Paul Sullivan, but it's 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the full text of the letter, followed by images of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Mrs. XXXXXX
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;I have been retained by Mr. XXX again to address parenting issues related to your two (2) sons. As you know, there has been considerable difficulty recently related to your refusal to support and encourage the children's Roman Catholic faith and certain biblical precepts related to lifestyle choices. It appears as if you are encouraging a homosexual lifestyle for the children and allowing your eldest, XXXX at age 13 to be placed in an environment where he could, and likely would, be exposed to a child predator.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As you know this case was previously assigned to Judge Kenneth long who is currently the administrative judge for the Washington County Circuit Court in Hagerstown. In the event you continue the destructive parenting that encourages XXXX' exploration of decadent choices in behavior, we will have no alternative but to file to obtain sole legal custody and sole physical custody of both children. We have been in communication with Sheriff XXXX, the vice principal of XXXX Middle School, the guidance counselor at XXXX Middle School and the president of the XXXX County Commissioners, seeking their assistance and support in helping XXXX change the path which you seem to be encouraging.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;It may be necessary for us to file a CINA petition, because the actions taken at his school related to detention do not seem to be having any corrective effect. This child appears to be out of control because of your refusal to co-parent with Mr. XXXX on Saturday, March 16th at 8:30 PM as ordered by the court. It is our understanding that you allowed XXXX to stay overnight at the home of a known homosexual whose probable intentions related to XXXX are suspect. Further investigation may lead to the request for criminal charges against that individual due to XXXX minority.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;We're attempting to obtain additional assistance to help XXXX abate the current course you have encouraged him to travel. You seem not to understand the eventual adverse consequences that may occur for XXXX and which could adversely affect him for a lifetime.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;If, however, you would be taking the position in court that you are not encouraging XXXX in the way it is believed you are, and are in fact unable to adequately discipline XXXX or institute and enforce parental boundaries that are needed, you certainly have the option to enter into a consent decree allowing Mr. XXXX to have sole legal and sole physical custody of the children so that he will have the authority, within the bounds of law, to take the corrective action needed to safeguard the best interests of the children.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions concerning this matter. If you are agreeable to the entry of a consent order as suggested above, please call me at your earliest convenience and I will prepare it for your review and signature.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Thank you and kindest regards,
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Very truly yours,
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Paul C. Sullivan&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some further research and a conversation with Kelly has brought some more information to light. It turns out that Ed has released some videos about his wife, "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUbOhjSUXzw" target="_hplink"&gt;The Drug Slut&lt;/a&gt;," and it turns out that their son's "behavior problems" include getting detention for talking in class and simply not wanting to participate in the extreme dogma that his father tries to force upon him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed's organization, Maryland's Fathers Rights League, is also known for lobbying against the &lt;a href="http://wn.com/righteous_anger_of_exiled_fathers,_the_only_sane_response" target="_hplink"&gt;Violence Against Women Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A scorned wife in North Carolina appears to have borrowed Mastercard's "priceless" campaign in order to call out her &lt;a href="http://myfox8.com/2013/03/20/a-wifes-billboard-revenge-on-battleground-ave/" target="_hplink"&gt;cheating husband on a billboard&lt;/a&gt; in Greensboro, WGHP reports.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Story continues below)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="cheating husband billboard" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1049496/thumbs/o-CHEATING-HUSBAND-BILLBOARD-570.jpg?6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is the sign too good to be true? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local newspaper The News &amp; Record noted that the &lt;a href="http://www.news-record.com/home/941590-63/greensboro-billboard-revenge-against-cheating#continue" target="_hplink"&gt;cheating husband billboard &lt;/a&gt;is owned by Outdoor Signage. When the news outlet asked the company about the sign's legitimacy, they were referred to Marty Kotis at Kotis Properties. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marty Kotis did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment, but a brief look into the &lt;a href="http://www.snopes.com/love/revenge/emily.asp" target="_hplink"&gt;history of scorned ex-wife billboards&lt;/a&gt; suggests that such displays have been used in the past as marketing ploys. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As myth-debunking site Snopes previously noted, a similarly themed message from a woman named Emily went up in 2006. That billboard was directed at a man named Steven, and said: "Do I have your attention now? I know all about her, you dirty, sneaking, immoral, unfaithful, poorly-endowed slimeball, Everything's caught on tape."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message was signed, "Your (soon-to-be-ex) Wife, Emily." &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The billboard received so much attention that ABC's "Good Morning America" reportedly wanted Emily to come on the show, according to Snopes. However, the message turned out to be marketing material for a reality television show on Court TV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then again, not all revenge billboards are gimmicks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Signs paid for by a woman named YaVaughnie Wilkins turned out to be legit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilkins claimed to have had an eight-year relationship with a man named Charles Phillips, the New York Post previously reported. However, after he decided to stay with his wife, the &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/she_did_whaaat_CTz3l7zyyaJKLywTNaVSrO" target="_hplink"&gt;woman spent about $250,000 advertising their affair&lt;/a&gt; on billboards in multiple locations across the country, including Times Square.  &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In honor of &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/march-21-national-single-parent-day-fragrance-day-210600839.html" target="_hplink"&gt;National Single Parent Day&lt;/a&gt; on March 21, we wanted to show some appreciation for those parents going at it alone. What better way to do that than by showcasing a thank-you message from someone raised by a single mother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video above, Olivia Joy Stinson, the founder of &lt;a href="http://penpalsbookclub.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;PEN Pals Book Club For Children of Incarcerated Parents,&lt;/a&gt; praises her mom for "always [making] it work." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I can say that we've never gone without and we've always had everything we've needed. Everything I needed and, on top of that, everything I wanted. I'd see the Barbie this, Barbie that and at Christmas I always had it. No idea how it would happen, but I always had it," she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stinson -- a &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/olivia-stinson/" target="_hplink"&gt;Charlottle, N.C. native&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/olivia-stinson/" target="_hplink"&gt;Winston-Salem State University student&lt;/a&gt; -- runs a charitable organization that &lt;a href="http://penpalsbookclub.org/" target="_hplink"&gt;aims to improve literacy&lt;/a&gt; among kids whose parents are incarcerated and prevent those children from following down the same bad path by &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/olivia-stinson/pen-pals-book-club-and-su_b_2370902.html" target="_hplink"&gt;getting them involved in the community. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In Jonathan Swift's 1726 classic Gulliver's Travels, he describes a race of people, the Struldburgs, who are afflicted with the pesky inconvenience of immortality. If two Struldburgs are to marry each other, "of course" the marriage is dissolved, by courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the younger partner hits 80, "for the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned...to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As if taxes aren't complicated enough, it can get worse during a divorce or separation. There are certain things that individuals going through the divorce process -- or who are recently divorced -- should keep in mind when preparing their taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you are going to need to consider your filing status (i.e. "Married Filing Jointly," "Married Filing Single,'' "Head of Household," etc.) The IRS only cares about one day in terms of whether you are married or not, and that is December 31. If you are married on December 31, then it is as if you are married for the whole year -- whether you married on New Year's Eve, or 20 years prior. Likewise, if you get divorced by December 31, it is as if you are divorced for the whole year. So, if your divorce was final by December 31, 2012, then you do not have the option of filing as a married person for your 2012 taxes. Your filing status options are "Head of Household" or "Single."&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Typically, "Head of Household" is going to provide a slight tax advantage over "Married Filing Single" or "Single." However, one should make sure that the requirements to file as "Head of Household" are met:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether the taxpayer paid more than one-half of the housing costs during the year;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the taxpayer lived apart from his or her spouse during the second half of the tax year in question; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether dependent child(ren) lived in the home for at least one-half of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
 
Another important consideration for the newly or soon-to-be divorced taxpayer is which spouse will claim the child(ren) as the dependant(s). The IRS regulations are clear that the parent with whom the child spends more time may claim the child as his/her dependent. That means that if you look at the custody schedule, and one parent has greater than 50 percent of the year with the child(ren) (even if it is only one day), that particular parent may claim the child as his/her dependent.

&lt;p&gt;However, taxpayers can negotiate and contract around this requirement. In other words, the parent with more than 50 percent of the custodial time may elect to let the other parent claim the child as his/her dependent, but must do so in writing and must execute the required IRS form (Form 8332). If the parents did not negotiate or otherwise come to an agreement on who would claim the child as a dependent, then both parents must file the IRS regulations using "time with the child" as the decision-maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about paying support (child or spousal)? Regularly, my clients ask about the deductibility of child support. I hate to break it to them, but the IRS will not accept a deduction for paying for the support of one's own children. In the agency's eyes, it is a parent's legal obligation to financially support his/her child. However, under many circumstances, alimony -- or, spousal support -- is tax deductible to the paying spouse and taxable to the receiving spouse. There are certain clawbacks to look out for and a laundry list of requirements, so consult your licensed CPA, but there is potential for a tax deduction and/or the creation of taxable income related to alimony or spousal support that should be investigated.&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
The transfer of property from one spouse to the other -- whether it is real estate, an investment account, a retirement account, cash, or personal propert -- if made pursuant to a divorce, is not a taxable event. This also includes gift taxes. As the law sees it, you are not making a gift to your spouse or former spouse, you are simply giving him/her their share of the marital estate. The property transferred will retain its original basis for tax purposes so that when it is sold, cashed in, or otherwise disposed of at some point in the future, the tax basis is the same as it was with the spouse who originally held title to that asset. For example, if a husband transfers one-half of his brokerage account to his wife, pursuant to a divorce, the initial transfer is not a taxable event for either individual. However, if the wife starts to liquidate the investments down the road, she will have to pay taxes on those investments based on the original basis in the stocks, bonds or other investments just as if the husband had sold them himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any loss carried forward that the taxpayers have been utilizing will remain available to the taxpayer who held title to the asset. In the event the loss was a result of a jointly titled asset, the IRS presumes that each party gets one-half of any remaining loss carry forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes can be complicated in any year, but in the year of divorce -- and even subsequent years -- when marital assets are sold or otherwise disposed of or alimony is paid or/received, the tax consequences can be more complicated. Any person who is divorced or thinking about getting divorced should certainly consult with a CPA to ensure that the tax affect related to marital assets and support is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;"Incompatibility is grounds for marriage" isn't relationship advice you hear often, but Harville Hendrix, Ph.D. and Helen LaKelly Hunt, Ph.D. are convinced it is exactly the type of thing that couples need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Incompatibility plays a crucial role in preparing you and your partner to meet each other’s needs," wrote Hendrix and Hunt in their recent book “&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Marriage-Simple-Changing-Relationship/dp/0770437125" target="_hplink"&gt;Making Marriage Simple: 10 Truths For Changing The Relationship You Have Into The One You Want&lt;/a&gt;." "…Honestly, compatibility is grounds for boredom."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Making Marriage Simple" contains the basic truths authors Hendrix and Hunt, ages 77 and 64 respectively, have learned about marriage throughout 30 years together. They found inspiration for the book after overcoming a rough patch, which almost threatened to tear the couple apart 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We tried like five therapists, the fifth therapist even called us the couple from hell," said Hunt, whose work in philanthropy got her elected to the &lt;a href="http://www.greatwomen.org/women-of-the-hall/search-the-hall/details/2/81-Hunt" target="_hplink"&gt;National Women’s Hall Of Fame&lt;/a&gt;. “But eventually we mastered [marriage]. We learned how to talk to each other -- we still had issues, but learned how to deal with it in a way so that we still feel intimate at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendrix and Hunt, who &lt;a href="http://www.imagocounseling.com/harville-hendrix-and-helen-lakelly-hunt/" target="_hplink"&gt;now counsel couples around the world&lt;/a&gt;, say negativity was one of the problems that once plagued their marriage. To fix the problem, they made a daily chart that was filled with either a smiley or frown face, depending upon if they made it through the day without negative actions. The idea that "negativity is invisible abuse," is now among one of the basic truths listed in their book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Negativity is like putting toxins in a relationship," said Hendrix. "We made a deliberate attempt to remove the pattern of negativity from our relationship and that was what made the [it] safe again."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the other truths espoused in their book are that couples should embrace their incompatibilities and that marriage should be funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Helen is more expressive, emotional and intuitive, while I’m more logical and detached," said &lt;a href="http://www.harvillehendrix.com/index.php" target="_hplink"&gt;Hendrix&lt;/a&gt;, a pastor who has written several other books including, "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Love-You-Want-Anniversary/dp/0805087001" target="_hplink"&gt;Getting the Love You Want&lt;/a&gt;." "But instead of looking at [these things] as differences and asking 'how come you’re so emotional?' … [look at them as] stimulants for growth."  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunt and Hendrix also believe that although all relationships have serious issues, the issues should not be treated seriously. They try to relay that couples should maintain lightheartedness by filling their book with cartoons and putting polka dots on its cover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Knowing when to be lighthearted is an art form … many couples find themselves working so hard on their relationship, that they forget to actually have fun together," wrote Hunt and Hendrix. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other truths listed in the book are: "romantic love is a trick," "conflict is growth trying to happen," and "being present for each other heals the past."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hendrix wants readers to understand that these truths are not difficult to attain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It’s not rocket science, it’s not easy, but it's simple. Leave negative stuff out, leave positive stuff in, and do that until your relationship is safe and you have the marriage of your dreams,” said Hendrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Everyone can have the marriage of their dreams, don't give up hope," added Hunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Kim Kardashian's divorce trial is fast approaching and the reality star is dead-set on maintaining that her marriage to Kris Humphries wasn't a fraud, as he claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the 32-year-old &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/21/kim-kardashian-deposition-kris-humphries-divorce/" target="_hplink"&gt;was "secretly" deposed, according to TMZ,&lt;/a&gt; and testified under oath that when Humphries proposed to her, and when they actually tied the knot, she was really in love with him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources revealed that the deposition took place at the pregnant reality star's attorney Laura Wasser's office and lasted a whopping nine hours to complete her testimony. Insiders told TMZ that the Brooklyn Nets forward's lawyer grilled Kim for evidence that she defrauded the athlete, &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20671810,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;by marrying him only for publicity and to boost ratings on her reality show&lt;/a&gt; -- but her testimony reportedly hasn't helped her ex's case at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what's most surprising is that sources told the website that Humphries' lawyer didn't press Kim much about her reality show, and whether it was staged. In the past, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/13/kim-kardashian-kris-humphries-divorce_n_2676946.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Humphries' legal team has used threats of exposing the Kardashians' reality show as nothing but a sham&lt;/a&gt;, as evidence that his client was defrauded into marrying Kim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of questioning is especially surprising, since "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" producer Russell Jay reportedly gave damning testimony when he was deposed last month.  According to Life &amp; Style, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/kim-kardashian-proposal-reshot_n_2876766.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Jay admitted that at least two scenes depicting Humphries were scripted, reshot or edited. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay reportedly testified that Kardashian not only knew about Humphries' "surprise" proposal before it actually happened, but it was &lt;a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/01/kris-humphries-kim-kardashian-planned-his-wedding-proposal/" target="_hplink"&gt;reshot because the reality star didn't like her reaction the first time around&lt;/a&gt;. And while it's not uncommon for a reality show to do re-shoots, he also claimed that a scene where Kim confesses she's having doubts about her marriage, to her mother, was not shot on a trip to Dubai as shown, but at a &lt;a href="http://www.realitytea.com/2012/01/14/photos-proof-that-kim-kardashians-reality-show-is-fake-scene-with-kris-jenner-was-staged/" target="_hplink"&gt;later date on a Los Angeles sound stage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously it was believed that Humphries had little chance at proving his marriage to Kardashian was a fraud, and even &lt;a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kris-humphries-divorce-lawyer-quits-just-before-kim-kardashian-court-hearing-2013152" target="_hplink"&gt;parted ways with one of his divorce lawyers &lt;/a&gt;who though it would be impossible to prove. The producer's testimony appeared to be the basketball player's best shot at proving fraud, but as TMZ pointed out, &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/13/kim-kardashian-kris-humphries-divorce-if-marriage-was-scam-he-was-in-on-it/" target="_hplink"&gt;it also could have hurt Humphries' case&lt;/a&gt;. The site points out that since the 27-year-old agreed to re-shoot his proposal, he was in on everything, making it much harder to argue that he was duped by Kardashian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former couple was married for a mere 72 days, before &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/31/kim-kardashian-to-file-fo_n_1067424.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Kardashian filed for divorce on Oct. 31, 2011&lt;/a&gt;. More than a year later,  Kardashian and Humphries' divorce trial is set to begin May 6 -- let the games begin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>Yes, it can be very stressful, but there are actually a lot of benefits too.</summary>
    <author>
        <name>Kerri Zane</name>

    </author>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Although the gold standard in child rearing has traditionally been a dual family unit, being a single parent has a myriad of benefits. Rather than navigating the treacherous territory of constant parental compromise, you can independently make choices for your children that you feel is best. Eleven years ago, when my former husband and I split, I saw my divorce as a glorious opportunity to parent solo. No more discussing the finer points of gymnastics vs. volleyball. I didn't have to debate dessert after dinner vs. never ever letting sugar touch lips. And there was no longer a lengthy discussion over the reason my daughters needed braces.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the state of rock-steady marital bliss in this country continues to falter, more and more adults are joining the ranks of contented uncoupled family units. In fact, based on the latest Census Bureau statistics, there are over &lt;a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/the-number-of-children-living-in-single-parent-homes-has-nearly-doubled-in/" target="_hplink"&gt;14 million single parent households&lt;/a&gt; with children under the age of 18. That is a lot of people and a good reason to celebrate. Which is why, March 21 has been designated as National Single Parent's Day. A time to honor all those tenacious individuals who do what they do, day in and day out, to support, nurture and care for their kids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a single mom advisor and author of&lt;a href="http://kerrizane.com/appearances-events/win-a-free-getaway/" target="_hplink"&gt; It Takes All 5&lt;/a&gt;, I would like to honor the day and offer you five solid reasons why it's better to be a single mom or dad then half of a parenting pair.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.	No Negotiations Necessary:&lt;/strong&gt; While your married counterparts continue to disagree on the state of their children's welfare, you get to make unilateral choices, which in the long run is better for your offspring's well-being. A child's behavior can be negatively affected by adult arguing. It will either leave them crying their eyes out or running for cover. With no one else in the house to challenge your choices, you may continue to be the cozy constant security blanket your children need. Granted, there is a financial price to pay when you are the sole provider, but children need to learn that sometimes we can't give them everything they want. And oftentimes what they thought was a "must-have," really isn't. Ultimately if it is that important, you will find a way. Payment plans were designed for the single parent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.	Stellar Independent Role Model:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the best gifts I was able to give my two daughters was the knowledge that they can make it on their own. Change a light bulb without a dad in the house -- snap Mom. Swoop a stylish up-do for your teen with no mom in sight -- yeah Dad. You embody the the idea that it's better to "want" to be in a relationship because there is a loving bond rather than you "need" to be in a relationship because there is stuff to be done or procured. When your child sees you as a completely whole and independent adult, they will learn to emulate your healthy behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.	Relationship Options May Vary:&lt;/strong&gt; Our society is shifting away from the bonds of matrimony. &lt;a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/12/14/barely-half-of-u-s-adults-are-married-a-record-low/" target="_hplink"&gt;A recent Pew study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that just over half of adult Americans are married, the lowest rate in decades. Children will be enlightened and possibly relieved that they are no longer tied to that traditional lifestyle. Marriage is optional and sometimes not applicable. Long-term relationships without wedding bands can be stronger. My idols in this arena are Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn; they've been together for nearly 30 years. These lessons are particularly important for girls, who were raised on the fictitious belief that Prince Charming would sweep them of their feet to live happily ever after, only to become enormously disappointed when their fairytale ending turns into a hardcore courtroom reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.	Bed Sharing Not Required: &lt;/strong&gt;Married couples may have more sex, but it isn't nearly as much fun. While they constantly have to "spice it up" in the bedroom, the nature of being single and switching partners does all the cooking for us. We tease, experiment and explore the bawdy awareness of every new lover. Researchers at the University of Pisa found that &lt;a href="http://healthyliving.msn.com/health-wellness/men/13-surprising-facts-about-testosterone-1" target="_hplink"&gt;testosterone levels&lt;/a&gt;, in both men and women, make the sex hotter during the first two years of a relationship. My favorite part of becoming single again was the choice to have, or not to have, a mate in my bed. The National Sleep Foundation reported that &lt;a href="http://www.saga.co.uk/health/mind/sleepmatters.aspx" target="_hplink"&gt;sleeping two to a bed&lt;/a&gt; could cause you to lose 49 minutes of sleep per night. That's a lot! On the nights when no one is next to me to snuggle with, I lay diagonally across the mattress, relishing the cool crisp sheets on "his side." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.	Building a Better Body: &lt;/strong&gt;Marriages are like your freshman year in college. You have the tendency to pack on the pounds. &lt;a href="http://www.match.com/magazine/article/6320/" target="_hplink"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that women could gain five to eight pounds in the first few years of their wedded bliss and a whopping 54 pounds by the ten-year mark, while their single counterparts stay slim. Most of us have an overriding desire to want to be attractive to prospective mates of the opposite sex. The result of a divorce? A slimmer, trimmer you -- aka the Divorce Diet. Take a look at Tom Cruise who reportedly lost 15 pounds after splitting with Katie. Jennie Garth lost 20 and Demi Moore has been stick thin since the departure of her sweetheart, Ashton Kutcher. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many reports will tell you that being a single parent is stressful. It is. But no more stressful than being a married parent. Ultimately, we all want to step into our own with confidence and take every curveball life throws us with our independent spirit intact. The best way to handle the inevitable life shifts is to stay positive, reach out for support from your friends and family, relish the time you spend with your children and most importantly, create a daily space for some much deserved me-time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy National Single Parents Day to you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>The myth of the princess wedding with the big dress, tons of flowers, bridesmaids, flower girls and the prince waiting at the end of the aisle prevails, and is what many girls perceive to be the American dream.</summary>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I loved princesses who let down their hair, got kissed awake by princes and fit into glass slippers. I dreamed of being saved from the dragon, the evil stepmother or the wicked witch by a dashing prince on the white horse. I planned the elaborate fairytale fantasy of marriage &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, but the reality was that I was not a princess, just a housewife and a mom and it is damn hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen if we taught our daughters that prince charming wasn't going to whisk them away to a fabulous castle filled with blue birds that sang and teapots that danced? Would we shatter their dreams, or would be we be teaching them facts that would prepare them for the realities of motherhood and marriage? Because, let's face it, life isn't a fairy tale and happily every after is harder to achieve as divorce becomes easier to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Do We Learn From Fairy Tales?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll admit that some fairy tales teach good morals, but other than that, what do we actually learn from them? That the stepmothers are all evil? Seriously? We all know that is a bunch of bull, and not only that, but it is a stigma that all stepmothers have had to fight since the onset of Cinderella. Thank you to Charles Perrault for starting that lovely rumor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything we learn from fairy tales is bad. For instance Snow White taught us not to eat apples at Halloween because they might be poisoned or have razor blades stuck in them. On the other hand, Snow White did go off with seven strangers and live with them, and I don't think that is something we would want our children to emulate when we tell them daily about "stranger danger".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Princess Myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know any little girls that haven't gone through  the "princess" phase, where they pull out the Disney costume of their favorite princess and wear it all day, every day and even sleep in it. No matter what you do, you can't get them to take it off. Does it damage them to wear it? No. Is it irritating? Yes. Does it teach them anything? No. Do we want them to grow up thinking that they will be princesses? No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of life is that unless you are born into royalty or marry into royalty, you will not be a princess, and even princesses' lives aren't like those in the fairy tales -- except for maybe the castle part. But the myth of the princess wedding with the big dress, tons of flowers, bridesmaids, flower girls and the prince waiting at the end of the aisle prevails, and is what many girls perceive to be the American dream. When the wedding is over, the dream becomes the white picket fence with a perfect house and two gorgeous kids and the best dog that is perfectly trained -- utter bliss every single day. Those of us that have been there know that this is not reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demystifying the Myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we demystify the myth without tainting our children or leaving them feeling bereft, with no hope for a future filled with love? It seems to me that putting more emphasis on the marriage and less emphasis on the wedding is a perfect place to start. The wedding is a couple of hours and the marriage is a lifetime. Isn't it more productive to spend more time planning the marriage than the wedding? It seems so obvious, yet so few people -- if any -- actually do it. Perhaps this may explain high divorce rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, would we be doing our daughters a disservice by demystifying the myth of the fairy tale by letting them in on the real secret to a happy ending -- which is that marriage is not all rainbows and flowers but hard work and compromise? Or should we continue to allow them to figure it out for themselves? How do we think that has been working for us? Or better yet, how has that worked for you? It didn't work for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There's a new power couple in the sports world. On Monday, Tiger Woods &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152697837415121.1073741826.164825930120&amp;type=1" target="_hplink"&gt;announced on Facebook &lt;/a&gt; that he was &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/tiger-woods-lindsey-vonn-dating-announcement_n_2901686.html?utm_hp_ref=sports" target="_hplink"&gt;dating newly single skier Lindsey Vonn. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vonn, who &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/lindsey-vonn-and-thomas-v_n_2443308.html" target="_hplink"&gt;finalized her divorce&lt;/a&gt; from husband Thomas Vonn in January 2012, took to her &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151508174969728&amp;set=a.10150905357679728.428648.89975379727&amp;type=1" target="_hplink"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; to share the same news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I guess it wasn't a well-kept secret but yes, I am dating Tiger Woods," the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151508174969728&amp;set=a.10150905357679728.428648.89975379727&amp;type=1" target="_hplink"&gt;Olympic gold medalist wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "Our relationship evolved from a friendship into something more over these past few months and it has made me very happy."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can we expect the sports stars' romance to go the distance? Only time will tell, but in the meantime, click through the slideshow below for five other athletes who dated -- and in some cases, married -- fellow sports stars after divorce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I guess it wasn't a well-kept secret but yes, I am dating Tiger Woods. Our relationship evolved from a friendship into something more over these past few months and it has made me very happy," Vonn posted on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/LindseyVonnUSA" target="_hplink"&gt;her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; on Monday. "I don't plan on addressing this further as I would like to keep that part of my life between us, my family and close friends. Thank you for understanding and your continued support!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woods, 37, posted a very similar statement on &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/Tiger" target="_hplink"&gt;his Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and the couple shared a four photos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when Woods' marriage to Elin Nordegren was very publicly coming undone and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/tiger-woods-mistress/" target="_hplink"&gt;alleged mistresses&lt;/a&gt; were coming forward in shocking numbers, Vonn couldn't help but joke about her future boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As chronicled in an article by Time magazine from February 2010, Vonn mocked Woods' sex scandal and subsequent &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/19/tiger-woods-press-confere_n_468722.html" target="_hplink"&gt;confessional press conference&lt;/a&gt; during her downtime at the Vancouver Olympics. The decorated ski champion even outlined her idea for a "Saturday Night Live" sketch that would make light of Woods' apology and admission of infidelity. In the idea she described for Time magazine, to the reported delight of her entourage, Vonn would appear at a podium quite like Woods had in that same month and say "There's something you don't know about me. Tiger, you're like my idol, and I too have a sex problem."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY CONTINUES BELOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;HH--236SLIDEEXPAND--287003--HH&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described by Time as coming "across as ingratiatingly anti-Woods," Vonn was also asked how she dealt with the pressures of being a celebrity athlete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Well, I'm married, so I don't have that problem," Vonn, who was married to her coach at the time, responded. "But, um, I guess [Woods] is married too."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1963484_1963490_1966894,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt; to read full Time article. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Both &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/23/tiger-woods-divorce-final_n_691486.html#s81031" target="_hplink"&gt;Woods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/lindsey-vonn-and-thomas-v_n_2443308.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Vonn have divorced&lt;/a&gt; since his press conference and her wisecracks. Rumors that &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/25/tiger-woods-lindsey-vonn-dating_n_2551604.html" target="_hplink"&gt;they were dating&lt;/a&gt; began late in 2012 and continued until Woods and Vonn confirmed their relationship status this week. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Remember the tragic news last year that &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/12/mike-ike-divorce_n_1421498.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Mike and Ike were heading for divorce&lt;/a&gt;? Fear not, candy fans -- The Huffington Post has learned from Mike and Ike themselves that things are on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is the duo getting back together, its namesake candy brand is getting reformulated. That means new flavors, new packaging and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital campaign on their divorce has been ongoing for about a year now -- with Ike working on his art while Mike spent time on his music. The divorce schtick included everything from peeks at &lt;a href="http://mikeandikebrand.tumblr.com/tagged/art" target="_hplink"&gt;Ike's art&lt;/a&gt;, to actually involving a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s8JOqP18ns" target="_hplink"&gt;negotiator throughout the "divorce" proceedings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We've been having a lot of fun," Donald Houston, senior category manager for the candy's parent company, Just Born, said about the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fans of the candy didn't seem to grow tired of hearing about the failing relationship, following updates on the Mike and Ike &lt;a href="http://mikeandikebrand.tumblr.com/" target="_hplink"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/mikeandike" target="_hplink"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages. "It's actually been pretty impressive how engaged people have been," Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the divorce campaign, the company has had its highest sales in 10 years -- sales of the original fruit flavor are up 9.3 percent from the previous fiscal year, Houston said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those following closely may have noticed that in the past few weeks there have been reported sightings of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NbMvajM1AuE" target="_hplink"&gt;Mike &amp; Ike together&lt;/a&gt;. Love is in the air, people!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In honor of Mike and Ike getting back together, Just Born is launching a new flavor called Strawberry Reunion, which will roll out in stores starting next week. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-18-Screenshot20130318at4.05.44PM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-03-18-Screenshot20130318at4.05.44PM.png" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-18-Screenshot20130318at4.05.44PM-thumb.png" width="570" height="316" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new flavor, all of the Mike and Ike boxes underwent a redesign -- especially important considering the versions in stores for the past year had either "Mike" or "Ike" crossed out (no one said divorce was pretty!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-18-mikeandike.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2013-03-18-mikeandike.jpg" src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-03-18-mikeandike-thumb.jpg" width="570" height="380" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really push the new incarnation of Mike and Ike, there will be billboard ads, radio spots, in-store displays, a relaunched website and more. But the biggest part of the launch is the Mike and Ike movie trailer that will air on national television starting in early June. It's...dramatic. Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var src_url="https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=517716998&amp;height=411&amp;width=570&amp;sid=577&amp;origin=undefined&amp;relatedMode=2&amp;relatedBottomHeight=60&amp;companionPos=&amp;hasCompanion=false&amp;autoStart=false&amp;colorPallet=%23FFEB00&amp;videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&amp;shuffle=0&amp;isAP=1"; src_url += "&amp;onVideoDataLoaded=HPTrack.Vid.DL&amp;onTimeUpdate=HPTrack.Vid.TC"; if (typeof(commercial_video) == "object") { src_url += "&amp;siteSection="+commercial_video.site_and_category; if (commercial_video.package) { src_url += "&amp;sponsorship="+commercial_video.package;  } } document.write('&lt;scr' + 'ipt type="text/javascript" src="'+src_url+'"&gt;&lt;/scr' + 'ipt&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hearty congratulations to Mike and Ike -- we wish them many more years of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thenewswire/">
        &lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Fla. &amp;mdash; Tiger Woods figured it was worth going public about his relationship with Olympic ski champion Lindsey Vonn rather than having paparazzi make money off them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star athletes simultaneously posted messages on their Facebook pages this week to confirm they are dating. The 14-time major champion  included four studio photos of himself and Vonn, both smiling in a casual setting &amp;ndash; he, in blue jeans and a white golf shirt; she, in a light blue warm-up jacket. Vonn posted one of the photos on her page.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Woods is fiercely private when it comes to his personal life, even before his downfall in November 2009 over multiple extramarital affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Well, it's very simple," Woods said Wednesday at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. "We're very happy where we're at, but also we wanted to limit the `stalkarazzi' and all those sleazy websites that are out there following us. I've had situations where it's been very dangerous for my kids and the extent they'll go to. We basically devalued the first photos. Unfortunately, that's just the way it is in our society right now, and we felt like it was the best thing to do. I'm very happy about it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite his worldwide fame, Woods has never liked anyone making money off him. He once sued a painter for a series of numbered prints that included Woods winning the Masters in 1997. He had an island to himself when he got married in 2004 and brought along a golf photographer he knew to take pictures.  After his two children were born, their pictures were released through a photo agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woods is no stranger to paparazzi. Photographers hounded him and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, for weeks after he crashed his SUV into a fire hydrant and his serial infidelity came to light in 2009. No one saw Woods for nearly three months after the accident, though the paparazzi managed to get photos of Elin without a wedding ring &amp;ndash; something industry experts said was worth about $20,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after Woods spoke publicly for the first time, from the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse, his managers released photos of Woods jogging through the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the first time Woods has confirmed he was dating anyone since his divorce in August 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This season has been great so far and I'm happy with my wins at Torrey and Doral," Woods said in his Facebook message. "Something nice that's happened off the course was meeting Lindsey Vonn. Lindsey and I have been friends for some time, but over the last few months we have become very close and are now dating."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Kelsey and Camille Grammer &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/21/kelsey-grammer-camille-grammer_n_2346942.html" target="_hplink"&gt;finally settled their divorce in December 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the fighting still continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former "Frasier" star and his new wife Kayte moved back to &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/kelsey-grammer-camille-grammer-fighting-home_n_2200456.html" target="_hplink"&gt;the 10,000-square-foot Holmby Hills mansion&lt;/a&gt; he once shared with his ex-wife, after being unable to sell it for the $16 million asking price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Page Six, the couple's move has made things very tense between the two exes, and &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/kelsey_battles_over_ex_bed_EfGH9ROpyVYTA3xo6lKNXI" target="_hplink"&gt;Camille recently sent movers to get her bed back&lt;/a&gt; so that Kelsey and Kayte wouldn't be able to sleep in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper reports that the movers were accompanied by the "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star's assistant, who was armed with a list from the couple's divorce settlement, which stated the reality star was entitled to the furniture, including the king-size bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was in the settlement that I got the bed. He got everything he wanted, the whole book collection. But he was living somewhere else. He didn’t want the bedroom furniture. He never liked the bed. He gave it up. It was really his oversight," Camille told Page Six, adding that she thought Kelsey's new wife would want her own furniture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it might have been in the settlement, a source told Page Six that Kelsey freaked out and was yelling at the movers not to take the bed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/kelsey-grammer-camille-grammer-fighting-home_n_2200456.html" target="_hplink"&gt;house itself was just one of the many things the former couple fought tooth-and-nail over &lt;/a&gt;in their divorce, but they finally came to an agreement over their &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2012/12/21/kelsey-camille-grammer-settle-divorce-property-settlement-house/" target="_hplink"&gt;three homes and nearly $60 million in assets.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

        <name>M. Gary Neuman</name>

    </author>
    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;As adults who were children of divorce know, healing does not occur through time alone. In fact, my recent study of 379 adults -- the subject of my just released book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Way-Home-Powerful/dp/0470409223" target="_hplink"&gt;The Long Way Home&lt;/a&gt; -- found that only 46 percent of those surveyed said they had a positive relationship with their fathers as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means most children of divorce have felt isolated from at least one parent, and very often from both parents. It is the ongoing dream of the child of divorce, even as an adult, that their parent someday will finally understand and love them the way they've always hoped. Now that you're an adult, you might have a relationship with a parent that is still strained. Perhaps you've considered expressing genuine feelings to your parent just to feel finally heard but don't know how to go about it. Too often, these conversations end in acrimony, and you may regret that you even tried to have the talk in the first place. In deciding to speak to your parent(s), make sure to ask yourself this crucial question: &lt;em&gt;What is my goal?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are realistic and unrealistic expectations that go hand in hand with "finally getting it off your chest." More often than not, our instincts and emotions take us on the wrong approach. Perhaps you're angry and are just going to vent. This will end in a screaming match and likely not help you at all. Others are hoping their parents will say something that will provide instant healing and then come to realize that there is no magic potion. Maybe you want to blame your parent and make him or her feel bad for the pain you were caused. Sadly, you're likely to feel no better after that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Right Goal: Being Heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to have a conversation about the hurt of your childhood is to approach your parents with the goal of being heard. It's the most you can realistically hope for, but it's a goal that can be immensely satisfying. You want that one moment in time when your parent can listen and begin to feel what it was like to be you as a child. Here's how to set up this meeting for success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Tell your parent that you want to talk about something serious.&lt;/strong&gt; Don't sneak in this conversation at the holidays or some unplanned moment. If you want to get the best response from your parent, let him or her know you want to have a conversation about something important to you. Express your need for undivided attention and set up a time and place that will allow both of you to talk privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Set up a place and time that works .&lt;/strong&gt; Just because your parent says he or she can have the conversation right now, even though the grandkids are running around the house and Thanksgiving dinner will soon be ready, doesn't mean you have to concur. You don't want to feel rushed, hungry, or tired while having this conversation. Plan a time when all of you are as clear headed and calm as possible. You also need a time limit. Keep the conversation to 30 minutes, then bring it to closure. If you spend more time talking, the conversation is likely to meander and that can lead to other touchy topics that aren't purposeful to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take control of the conversation.&lt;/strong&gt; You made the request and you should be running the show. If you'd like, be prepared with written notes on the points you want to make. You want this conversation to be heartfelt, but you also don't want to walk away feeling that you forgot to say something important. Begin talking from the start, so that it's clear that you have an agenda and a purpose for getting together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Set the agenda on what you want from your parent.&lt;/strong&gt; When you request the meeting, your parent likely will be unsure of what it is you want to talk about. Start off the meeting by making your agenda known. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider something like: "Dad/Mom, I have some difficult things to share and I want you to listen. It may make you feel bad, but please understand I'm not looking for you to do anything about it right now. I'm not looking for an apology. That'll be up to you, but you don't have to apologize. I don't want you to even speak at all until I'm completely finished with what I have to say. All I want is that you listen to me carefully and know that I want you to understand how I feel. I'm not looking to make you feel bad. I'm not looking to turn this into anything about you. It would just be so meaningful and such a gift from you if, for this moment, you can really hear what I'm sharing so that I feel you truly understand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarify what you want and don't want from your parent during this meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Stay on task; don't stray.&lt;/strong&gt; If you're feeling good about the conversation, there's a tendency to begin sharing or discussing things that you had never intended. This meandering can lead to other touchy topics that aren't purposeful to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's danger in this, because you'll move away from your original agenda and get into a topic where the conversation may not go well. This moment of being heard is too important to be muddied with any other issue. Keep the conversation to about 30 minutes, then bring it to closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, you can end by asking to do this again and have further discussion. Remember that much of the healing after divorce will be on your own. However, it can be so helpful to hear an understanding, sympathetic word from your parents, often for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
