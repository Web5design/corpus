        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: Do not read on if you have not yet seen Season 8, Episode 3 of Bravo's "Real Housewives of Orange County," titled "Making Up Is Hard To Do."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the true measure of a "Housewife"? Is she merely the sum of her fame-gulping, idiom-murdering, Dysport-plumped parts, or is there something deeper -- a profound pathos in her fruitless struggle to stay rich, thin, and most of all, young? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As any reluctant follower of this series may attest, the heartbreak of bankruptcies, divorces and foreclosures pales in comparison to that of the clammy specter of aging. Beneath the upbeat Bravo sound bed, one hears the thin whine of hysteria as our ladies rage against the ravages of time and the intransience of beauty. Can they ever achieve contentment in this plastic hedge maze of diminishing returns? Crush a halfie of your preferred controlled substance into your Moscato and let's find out ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=517745898&amp;height=400&amp;width=600&amp;sid=577&amp;origin=undefined&amp;videoGroupID=138596&amp;relatedNumOfResults=100&amp;relatedMode=2&amp;relatedBottomHeight=60&amp;hasCompanion=true&amp;cbCustomID=videoCompAdDiv&amp;autoStart=false&amp;colorPallet=%23FF0000&amp;videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&amp;shuffle=0&amp;isAP=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big news: Alexis is the first "OC Housewife" to behold Vicki's grandson Troy. I truly hate to baby-shame, but sometimes newborns are a bit scary, and alas, Troy is in the dead-eyed-alien stage of babyhood. Vicki announces it's been six weeks since she's seen her controversial cap-toothed man-friend Brooks. Beleaguered daughter Brianna continues her crusade against all things Brooks, blackballing the Southern gentleman of "poor character" from the Gunvalson estate. Mother/daughter roles are thus upended as Vicki blinks into the middle distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Heather visits husband Terry at his place of business -- The Newport Happy Time Elective Surgery Factory -- where he has thoughtfully placed a three-tiered serving tray of breast implants on his desk. Heather foreshadows new cast member Lydia McLaughlin, owner of Beverly Hills Lifestyle Magazine, a storied literary publication renown for progressive postmodern thought. Apparently, Lydia wants to feature Heather and Terry in the next issue, although as far as I know they don't live in Beverly Hills. A wily jeremiad indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the local upscale baby boutique, Gretchen and Tamra further their suspicious alliance as Gretchen muses about when she should start "popping out" a brood of Slade Juniors before she gets "too old." Then she runs around the store pushing a stroller while flashing her red-soled Louboutins, which is playful and fun and not gauche or calculating in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we sojourn back to Heather's manse where we finally meet rich-niche-magazine magnate Lydia McLaughlin, who -- in addition to being the heiress of a Canadian media mogul -- is also a serial hugger. Lydia drolly divulges her publication's brand identity: "Beverly Hills Lifestyle Magazine is supposed to represent that everybody wants a Beverly Hills lifestyle." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heather goes in for the kill, demanding that her home deserves not just a feature story, but also the coveted cover. Lydia deflects, claiming that her husband calls the shots when it comes to cover stories. Lydia then naively drops the bomb that she's friends with Alexis, which disgusts Heather even more than an uninvited onion ring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tamra prowls the vacant square footage of her new fitness studio (note: CUT Fitness stands for "Cardio Unique Training"), a vast industrial space with a few black-trim mirrors. Her arch-nemesis Vicki's business, "Coto Insurance" is right across the depressing office park. Vicki drives her Mercedes the 50 paces across the lot to visit Tamra and everybody dies a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stave off existential dread, we then hop on over to Lydia's house, which is more tasteful than one should reasonably expect. Her husband Doug is, to be blunt, a hot piece. She explains they met at a "Christian volunteer meeting." Praise the Lord. We are treated to a few leering closeup shots of Jesus Abs doing shirtless pull ups in his walk-in closet before they get dressed for a night out on their fancy speedboat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a proximate neon detailed banquette establishment, Vicki and Tamra have a Let's Bee Friends meal, and I honestly feel bad for the innocent waitress as these two stare each other down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You were not just an Alexis to me," Tamra expounds. ("Alexis" is now shorthand for crumpled pile of used facial blotting pads.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vicki brings it back around to Vicki by accusing Tamra of not caring about Vicki. Tamra admits to past wrongs. Vick admits she feels ostracized for loving Bad Boy Brooks. She explains how hard it is to be in love with someone whom everyone else unilaterally hates. Vicki then promises to not say mean things, which is like a coastal bird promising it won't peck at tangles of beached kelp. But still -- a new hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back with the Dubrows, it's Yom Kippur and Terry promises to atone for all the irritating jokes he makes. The Dubrow brood run rampant in temple. Terry takes little Collette in the back while suggesting to the ether that he should break the fast with a cocktail. Dubrow tensions are now at Threat Level Magenta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left hanging on a predictable cliff as Vicki says she wants to invite Alexis to Tamra's gym opening. CUT FITNESS DRAMZ!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, we revisit the scandal surrounding Alexis' fake diamond engagement ring. We attend the opening party at CUT Fitness where Alexis utters an eloquent "butt out." Don't worry, all, it's going to be OK. I think! Till next week, lovelies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Real Housewives Of Orange County" airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;I looked around the family room for things to break -- a crystal vase, a porcelain figurine, a framed picture of my husband. He told me had been having an affair and it had been going on for nearly two years. After nineteen years of marriage, I knew I had to ditch the cheat. I married him when I was nineteen. He was all I knew and I had carefully crafted a life that looked perfect on the outside -- two incomes, two kids, two cars, a dog, a cat, a comfortable life -- and in the blink of an eye it all fell apart. I felt crushed, broken, and kicked to the curb as if I was yesterday's garbage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember beating myself up. Maybe I should have known better after his first affair nine years prior. Maybe I should have left him then, but as a child of divorce, I couldn't fathom putting my children through that. My parents have had nine marriages combined. I wanted mine to last 'til death do us part -- for better or worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My oldest daughter knew about her father's affair. She found emails between him and the other woman detailing an afternoon rendezvous. My daughter was adamant that she didn't want her father back in our home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember waffling. My entire life was wrapped up in him. Who would I be without him defining who I was? How could I keep a marriage going that no longer had trust, no longer had commitment, and no longer had love? When it came down to it, he and I had grown so far apart that we no longer even liked each other. But how would I disentangle myself from him? Could I? I realized that my self-respect and the respect of my daughters was far more important then trying to keep a hollow marriage together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our divorce wasn't pleasant or amicable. The attorneys received more money then they were worth but sixteen weeks after I filed, we came to an agreement. I desperately wanted it over but I wanted it over my way. Fortunately, our children were 16 and 19 -- there were no custody issues, no child support disputes, and no arguments around two of the most precious people in our lives. We did, however, fight over financial assets. In the end, I negotiated and received the agreement I proposed when we first filed for divorce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divorce is the death of a marriage. I went through the stages of grief: I bargained, I got angry. In fact, I'm sure I broke a vase and burned his picture. I suffered depression and anxiety. For many weeks I only ate oatmeal breakfast bars. I lost 30 pounds. I went from a size 10 to a size 2. I don't recommend the divorce diet. I didn't sleep. I barely functioned on automatic pilot. How I kept my job is beyond me. But then one day the fog inside my head lifted. The anxiety left. I felt good and whole. I put myself out into the world again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took charge of my life. I discovered who I was without being defined by a man. I focused on my daughters and my career. I sold the unhappy home and moved one town over. At almost 40 years old, I discovered that I still had it -- whatever "it" is. I started dating. Just as I was getting used to my new life as a single mom with a fast-paced career, I heard the words no woman ever wants to hear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five months after my divorce was final and six weeks after my 40th birthday, I went in for my baseline mammogram. Extra images were taken of my left breast. The next morning the nurse called. She told me I needed to see a breast specialist. The mammogram detected a large microcalcification cluster of cells. A few days later I had a biopsy. Four days later, on a dark and moonless night in early January 2004, my doctor called with the results. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of driving home, I drove to my dad's. It didn't feel real. Cancer? Me? No way! At my dad's house, I huddled in the basement with him and my stepmom. We cried together, but only for a moment. We needed a game plan but we only got as far as my next appointment. Without knowing what was going on in my body I could only take the next known step. The rest was the twilight zone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't know what to tell my girls so I decided to tell them what I knew without speculating on the unknowns. Scared? We were all scared. I was scared to die without seeing my girls try on wedding dresses and walk down the aisle. I was scared to die without ever meeting my grand babies. I was scared to die without ever knowing what it felt like to have someone truly, madly, deeply love me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day I had my left breast and 26 lymph nodes removed was surreal. I remember handing the registration clerk my DNR paperwork and living will. At that very moment, I felt completely at peace. I felt a sense of warmth and a soulful knowing that my life had just begun. After surgery, my breast surgeon told me that she got clean margins. My plastic surgeon promised me an almost matching set of breasts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen weeks of chemotherapy and twenty-eight rounds of radiation therapy, followed by my final reconstruction surgery, capped off a year of death and rebirth. It's been ten years since my divorce and nine years since my mastectomy. Since then, I've married the love of my life (who just happened to be my first boyfriend in high school), I've been wedding dress shopping, I've been the &lt;a href="http://thestepmomstoolbox.com" target="_hplink"&gt;stepmother&lt;/a&gt; of the bride twice, and I'm very much in love with my grandchildren. Every day my life is truly, madly, deeply.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jeremy's out of town two days before their wedding in Myrtle Beach, but Leah doesn't mind 'cause she's got a new man around -- her biological dad! He's so excited to finally see his estranged daughter that he's decided to wear his best "Tap Out' red t-shirt and some sort of male-Victoria's Secret sweatpants. "My baby girl got two baby girls ... cookin' breakfast," he exclaims over the frying pan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hasn't seen Leah since she was 13, but can you blame him? He's been incredibly busy trying to find the last ball bearing necklace at the last Hot Topic in town. &lt;em&gt;Plus&lt;/em&gt;, do you even know how long it takes to perfectly fit your sunglasses over your Nascar hat? Like, at least five years of parenting, that's for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://spshared.5min.com/Scripts/PlayerSeed.js?playList=517745921&amp;height=400&amp;width=600&amp;sid=577&amp;origin=undefined&amp;videoGroupID=138596&amp;relatedNumOfResults=100&amp;relatedMode=2&amp;relatedBottomHeight=60&amp;hasCompanion=true&amp;cbCustomID=videoCompAdDiv&amp;autoStart=false&amp;colorPallet=%23FF0000&amp;videoControlDisplayColor=%23191919&amp;shuffle=0&amp;isAP=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, Leah, the girls, her mom and her mom's inappropriately low top get ready for their eight-hour drive to the MB. Nothing says "this wedding was rushed" like a bride without a plane ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of the wedding, Leah (whose hair is magically 40 shades lighter) and Jeremy flout the rules and hang out. She must be super sure of their relationship now 'cause she's plucked her eyebrows like a woman with nothing to lose. "This is DEFINITELY my last wedding, and it means the world to me," she says reassuringly. A clap of thunder punctuates her romantic statement, and she looks pained. "That is NOT thunder. I gotta get my jeweeerry!" The only thing harder than pronouncing "jewelry" is finding attractive pieces, and you know Leah's going to screw that up, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leah heads over to Exclusively You, a day spa that sounds like a line of female sex toys. She gets slapped with a ton of makeup that truly bring out the sparkle in her eyes ... and braces. All in all, she looks decent. I especially like how every curl is a mix of black and blonde hair, as if paying follicular tribute to the varied sides of her personalities. Or maybe she just has black and blonde hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her ceremony-by-the-pond idea is cute, in a discount-backyard-sets-advertised-on-KMart-flyers way. The white chairs that may or may not be plastic (not that there's anything wrong with that for people with low standards) are draped with turquoise tulle, and the trellis is wrapped with a vine and festive streamers. All in all, it's got a cheap Spring Break resort vibe, with a shared "about to make a rash decision" theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridal party (clad in the most unforgiving silk dresses) dances up the sand while Leah aggressively screams "BREAK IT DOWN" from inside her disco limo. As the lights flash inside the vehicle, her closest friends gyrate to the jungle rhythms in their hearts. The chains on their fancy Gaga-inspired sunglasses whip them in the faces as they go down to whatever city is about 15 miles from funky town. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Since it's raining (God cries when reminded of humans that didn't come out quite right), everyone's also juggling big umbrellas. I give them all props for not complaining, as I likely would have in the face of so much soaking wet ugliness. &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
As Leah exits the limo, her dads accompany her and a spray of flowers down the aisle. Her bio dad has chosen to wear his &lt;em&gt;fancy&lt;/em&gt; cowboy hat, while her step-father wears the outfit he stole after eating the busboy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Leah and Jeremy finally meet at the end of the aisle, they're all smiles. "Your journey has brought you here," the officiant says. Apparently "here" is beneath a black-and-white striped umbrella in the pouring rain, but they don't seem to mind. Leah actually cuts the poor woman off and says "I do" a little too fast, but it's endearing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decide to do the "unity sand ceremony," which is a fancy way for saying "dump two containers of sand into one heart-shaped container." The twins get VERY excited, and one of them eats some. Hey, who are any of us to say when cocktail hour officially starts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenelle &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Though things are pretty good with Jenelle and Kieffer, life isn't exactly a bed of roses. Her roomie Alison is moving out, and she's making less money with her mysterious "online job." Also, she's dropped out of school because she doesn't need "more added to her plate." It's worth noting that her plate is currently full of the "surgery with my boobs" and the Gary debacle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if she had the strength to pull on the world's tightest top at court last week, she can probably sit a desk and use a pen ... but hey, what do my A cups and I know? Perhaps once you go beyond a C, it's hard to look over them at your community college paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bahhbrahh, like Jenelle's new big-girl bras, is very supportive. She doesn't say a peep when Jenelle brings up Kieffer, and even says she'll help Jenelle go back to school some day. Also, with Jace's third birthday just around the corner, she's gone out of her way to plan him a special gymnastics pahhty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, Jenelle's "Someone Near Me Is Being Kind" meter goes off, and she lashes out like a poisonous (but stacked) snake. Instead of being grateful, she's horrified that her mom didn't give her advanced notice to "invite more people" to little Jace's pahhty. "Jenelle, I'm busy. I work," Bahhbrahh stutters. "It's his birthday. You know when his birthday is ... you could have taken initiative!" If there's one day Jenelle shouldn't forget, it was the time when she was actually given some really incredible drugs and not sent to jail for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day of the party, Jenelle reminisces about Jace's first three years. Since she barely knows him, it doesn't take long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the gymnasium, everyone has a blast. It's got some creepy old trampolines and a foam pit that Bahhbrahh gloriously gets stuck in. Oddly enough, there's only one other child there. Either the other parents didn't want their kids on camera, or Jenelle was right about Bahhbrahh rushing the party plans. Either way, Jace seems happy as a clam and doesn't realize his mom has augmented pearls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the exercise, they break out a super cool spider dessert made entirely of cupcakes. Jenelle is sooo hot from the workout that she takes her shoes off and rolls up her top, 'cause nothing says motherhood like flaunting your stretch marks at the table. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it hurts Jenelle to focus on anyone else for too long, she immediately starts to obsess about her financials. "I was running out of money because I was spending too much on marijuana," she says openly. She seems pretty nonplussed that she's $600 in the hole and late with her rent. It's times like these that I wish the teen moms would acknowledge that they're on a TV show. It's hard to feel empathy for Jenelle when I know she's getting paid a pretty decent penny to be our guilty pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Bahhbrahh loves going into the lion's den, she heads over to Jenelle's house to talk about her fiscal situation. Apparently, things are looking up since Kieffer's selling wooden pipes on the internet. It's important to note that they are MOST DEFINITELY NOT FOR SMOKING THE WEED. They are for smoking WHATEVER YOU WANT, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SAY THEY ARE FOR THE WEED ON THE INTERNET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Because of where you are, it's going to be hard to get back custody of Jace or have him stay at your house," Bahhbrahh says. She also reminds Jenelle that she barely sees him, but Jenelle's got a rebuttal: She has no money for gas. Bahhbrahh tells her that she'll happily shuttle Jace back and forth, but Jenelle's already chartered a jet to crazy town. She screams that she's only ever allowed to see him on Saturdays and Sunday and then retires to her room. She didn't put up as much of a fight as she normally does, and I wonder if it's because she knows she's finally run out of excuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She grabs Jace's face for a kiss, but he squirms and runs away. To Jace, Jenelle's nothing more than a loud lady who gives rock-hard hugs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chelsea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During her month-long leave from school, Chelsea's not sitting on her plus-sized laurels; she's been busy getting and moving into a new place. Though she's not actually at Black Plague Beauty School anymore, little Aubs still gets shipped off to day care. I'm not going to judge her for this, because I personally see myself relying on day care right after I have a baby and undergo massive amounts of plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over at her mom's house, Chelsea wants to chat about her birthday party. (Unfortunately, nobody mentions how dear Chelsea's mom looks with her fab new bangs and midlife-crisis ponytail.) Chels is going to be 21, so now she can legally blame any bad decisions on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol, instead of the a-a-a-a-a-Adam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before her big day, Chelsea and her only friend celebrate by getting fake nails to match their fake everything else. Chelsea actually looks nice ... I think she's drawn in her eyebrows differently this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she's not sure about the drunk antics and debauchery that lay ahead, Chelsea drops Aubree off with her mom. Then, her pals come over to "get sexual looking," which entails making their hair look like attractive nesting places for migratory birds, and dressing like ladies who got a Groupon to Atlantic City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the restaurant, Chelsea and her pals pray: "Dear God, we hate you for this birthday." Then, because God is forgiving and kind, he sends over a sexy bartender with green shots. After a while, things get blurry and they head to a club, where they run into Adam's friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone must have let Adam know that Chels was out getting wild because he starts to text her. "Jeez, how many people can you make out with in one night," he said, among other jealous-sounding things. Chelsea's understandably confused. Adam kicked her to the curb and has a gal pal -- why does he care who she swaps spit with? I'm super proud of Chelsea, actually. She could have let Adam's texts ruin her night or give her the wrong impression, but at this point, she's just exasperated. Perhaps she has gotten a little bit wiser with age ... or maybe it's just her plastic, no-lens glasses. I'm practically expecting her to blurt out something brilliant, like a two-syllable word! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kailyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kailyn thinks Javi is out running errands with Isaac, but he's got a trick up his Express for Men sleeves. He's dressed Isaac in an adorable (and matching) little vest, and they get all set up in front of the water. They're holding hands and flowers, and even though I know the ring he's got in his pocket is probably from a Cracker Jacks box, I'm getting all melt-y inside. Javi is really a very lovely fellow, and though I know most of my readers dislike Kailyn, I feel glad for her. She hasn't had it easy, and it's nice that life has finally dealt her a nice card (albeit from the half-off section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kailyn was instructed to go to a very specific restaurant in her hometown, and Javi texted her to pick up a note from the hostess. It has directions for where her one-and-a-half men are ... and upon arriving, Kailyn knows something really exciting is up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You were raised here, and I felt like this was a part of your life I wasn't a part of. I figured if I came out here, I'd be a part of it forever 'cause you're my present now, so what I really want to know is ... if you'll marry me?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that adorable Hallmark speech, he gets down on one knee and hands her the ring. "I'm in shock!" Kailyn says before showing Isaac her bling. I really like that she includes Isaac in everything, although I'm not sure how safe it is so take your eyes off a little kid on a boat dock. Either way, he's more interested in his doll and the flowers anyway, like any kid who hasn't yet been forced into selecting a gender identity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the special moment, they pop into the restaurant for a meal in a booth. Between their plastic cups and french fries, I'd say Javi Googled "no star eateries" when making his reservation. It's the thought that counts ... except when the thought takes you to a glorified diner. "It's kinda like Britney Spears'," Javi says happily as he checks out her rock (and hopefully not her mental state).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, Kailyn celebrates getting her marriage license by scaring the living daylights out of Isaac at a hibachi restaurant. Over the meal, she tells her friend Gigi about her future: Since she wants to move to wherever Javi is based, she wants to get married in less than a year -- and she wants to bring Isaac. She hasn't told Jo, which is starting to get pretty ridiculous. If the tables were turned, you know she'd lose her mind. Still, there's fear underneath her bravado, and you know she's not feeling good about the whole mess. In her heart of hearts, Kailyn wants to be with Jo ... and though she seems wild about Javi, he'll probably always, in some secret part of her, be her second choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Teen Mom 2" airs Mondays at 10 p.m. ET on MTV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Facebook's mission may be to "connect the world," but when it comes to divorce, connecting with your ex is probably the last thing you want to do. Social media adds a whole new dimension to already-painful breakups, and can complicate and potentially hinder the healing process. After calling it quits in real life, you'll also have to break up with your significant other online -- and with his or her entire social network. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that social media can make breaking up harder to do -- but by following some basic post-split guidelines, you can minimize the amount of anxiety that Facebook adds to your divorce. Click through the slideshow below for six things you need to know about surviving your split with minimal added social media stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell us: How did you deal with social media during your divorce? Share your thoughts in the comments or tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HuffPostDivorce" target="_hplink"&gt;@HuffPostDivorce&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All hail &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1555340/" target="_hplink"&gt;Trudy Campbell&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday night's "Mad Men," Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser) cheating finally caught up with him when his latest mistress Brenda (Collette Wolfe) showed up at his doorstep after her husband beat her upon finding out about their tryst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though &lt;a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/cast/trudy-campbell" target="_hplink"&gt;Trudy (Alison Brie)&lt;/a&gt; couldn't have been kinder to Brenda, her attitude towards Pete was understandably a different story. She read him the riot act like a scorned wife on "Mad Men" never has before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trudy:&lt;/strong&gt; "We're done, Peter. This is over."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pete: &lt;/strong&gt;"You want a divorce?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trudy:&lt;/strong&gt; "I refuse to be a failure. I don't care what you want any more. This is how it's going to work -- you will be here only when I tell you to be here. I'm drawing a 50 mile radius around this house and if you so much as open your fly to urinate, I will destroy you."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch &lt;a href="http://madmen.wikia.com/wiki/Trudy_Campbell" target="_hplink"&gt;Trudy&lt;/a&gt; explain the new rules of the Campbell house to Pete in the video above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We find out from Trudy that she had given him this apartment and she knew that the dalliances would be be there, but this woman is in the neighborhood," "Mad Men" creator Matt Weiner said in the behind-the-scenes video from AMC below. "He broke the rules. He did not observe the spirit of the law and he has embarrassed her. And now, there's going to be a new set of rules."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Are Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/15/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-split/" target="_hplink"&gt;headed for divorce&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were surprised when reports emerged over the weekend that the rocker and his wife &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-divorce-split_n_3084195.html" target="_hplink"&gt;were calling it quits&lt;/a&gt; after more than 30 years of marriage and three kids together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are living at different addresses and not spending any time together," &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4886856/sharon-and-ozzy-osbourne-living-apart.html" target="_hplink"&gt;a source told The Sun&lt;/a&gt;. "They row a lot. They aren't acting like husband and wife." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the couple's split was news to their son, Jack Osbourne, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrJackO/status/323509090150125568" target="_hplink"&gt;who took to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to dismiss the claims: "It's all b*llshit," &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MrJackO/status/323509090150125568" target="_hplink"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. "Last time I check a lot of British newspapers weren't amazing sources of accurate information. Moving on."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharon's representatives have yet to respond to the Huffington Post's request for comment, so we'll continue to take the rumors with a grain of salt. In the meantime, click through the slideshow below for scenes from the couple's three-decade-long marriage. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;"Twilight" actor Peter Facinelli stopped by HuffPost Live on Monday to reflect on his acting career. Also on the agenda? What it's like to co-parent his three daughters with ex Jennie Garth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Co-parenting has been great. I'm able to have the kids every other week and in some ways -- a lot of ways -- it makes me an even better father," Facinelli said. "I get to get up and make them breakfast, make them lunches, take them to school and I have the full responsibility of all three girls for the whole entire week, and I bond a lot with them that way."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facinelli &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20582221,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;filed for divorce&lt;/a&gt; from Garth in March 2012 after 11 years of marriage. In November 2012, he &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20652384,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;took his relationship public&lt;/a&gt; with "Nurse Jackie" co-star Jaimie Alexander. &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/jennie-garth-dating-jeremy-salken_n_2503434.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Garth has been linked to&lt;/a&gt; Jeremy Salken, the drummer for the electronica duo Big Gigantic, since the split.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Your social media habits could be hurting your marriage, &lt;a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130411_1.html" target="_hplink"&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt; out of the &lt;a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/" target="_hplink"&gt;University of Oxford's Internet Institute. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at &lt;a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130411_1.html" target="_hplink"&gt;24,000 married people &lt;/a&gt;and how they used &lt;a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130411_1.html" target="_hplink"&gt;10 different media channels&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307224/Does-Facebook-strain-marriages-Couples-communicate-site-satisfying-relationships.html#ixzz2QYvgafbm" target="_hplink"&gt;Facebook, emails, texts and instant messages&lt;/a&gt;. They found that those who communicated with their partner over more channels did not experience greater levels of &lt;a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130411_1.html" target="_hplink"&gt;relationship satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;, and some even reported decreased levels of satisfaction. In fact, couples using more than five channels reported a 14 percent drop in marriage satisfaction, &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2307224/Does-Facebook-strain-marriages-Couples-communicate-site-satisfying-relationships.html#ixzz2QYFnCXRa" target="_hplink"&gt;according to the Daily Mail. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This work suggests that media, which now includes online social media, still operates as a signal of ties of strength in relationships," Hogan said &lt;a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2013/130411_1.html" target="_hplink"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "However there may be a cut-off point after which the increasing complexity of maintaining so many separate communications threads starts to undermine relationship ties."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: Do not read on if you have not yet seen Season 6, Episode 3 of AMC's "Mad Men," titled "The Collaborators."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pete Campbell's (Vincent Kartheiser) latest affair with his neighbor Brenda (Collette Wolfe) caused a lot of problems at home with his wife Trudy (Alison Brie), who was not too happy with when Brenda showed up at the Campbell household after her husband beat her up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides being appalled by Pete (and impressed by Trudy, who showed Pete who's boss), viewers may have been wondering why Brenda looked so familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to appearing in the Charlize Theron hit "Young Adult," Wolfe's TV credits include "The Office" and many ill-fated TV shows including "100 Questions," "Traffic Light" and "Friends With Benefits." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, the actress starred opposite Dane Cook in NBC's "Next Caller." &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/12/dane-cook-next-caller-canceled-nbc_n_1962947.html" target="_hplink"&gt;The show was well into production on its first season and was set to make a midseason debut, but the network unceremoniously halted production and canceled it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="next caller" src="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1087919/thumbs/o-NEXT-CALLER-570.jpg?6" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfe nonchalantly tweeted about her "Mad Men" role on Sunday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;HH--TWEET--323625562914566145--HH&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;GIRARD, Pa. -- Police have cited a 42-year-old Pennsylvania woman for disorderly conduct after she called 911 requesting a divorce and police assistance to make her husband leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troopers say the woman called just after 1 a.m. Saturday asking that officers be sent to her home in Girard Township in northwestern Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Police say they explained to the woman, whom they are not identifying, that a divorce is a civil matter and that they could not make her husband leave the residence because no crime had been committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, police have cited the woman for disorderly conduct and misusing the Erie County 911 system.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Jada Pinkett Smith surprised many of her fans when &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/jada-pinkett-will-smith-open-relationship-rumor_n_3007718.html" target="_hplink"&gt;she candidly addressed rumors of an open marriage&lt;/a&gt; between her and husband Will Smith on HuffPost Live."I've always told Will, 'You can do whatever you want as long as you can look at yourself in the mirror and be okay,'" the 41-year-old actress and mother of two &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/03/jada-pinkett-will-smith-open-relationship-rumor_n_3007718.html" target="_hplink"&gt;told HuffPost Live's Marc Lamont Hill&lt;/a&gt; on April 3. "Because at the end of the day, Will is his own man. I'm here as his partner, but he is his own man." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Pinkett Smith is clarifying those comments about her 16-year-marriage to the movie star. In a&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jada/posts/10151624226366320" target="_hplink"&gt; Facebook post &lt;/a&gt;published Sunday, Pinkett Smith said that she was amending her statement to say that their relationship was "a grown one" and that it did "NOT mean we have an open relationship."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An excerpt of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/jada/posts/10151624226366320" target="_hplink"&gt;Pinkett Smith's post&lt;/a&gt; is below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Open marriage?

&lt;p&gt;Let me first say this, there are far more important things to talk about in regards to what is happening in the world than whether I have an open marriage or not. I am addressing this issue because a very important subject has been born from discussions about my statement that may be worthy of addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement I made in regard to, "Will can do whatever he wants," has illuminated the need to discuss the relationship between trust and love and how they co-exist … &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how I will change my statement...Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship...this means we have a GROWN one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think, readers? Do you think Pinkett Smith has a point, or do you think it's time to lay this subject to rest?

    <summary>Stepmoms, do you find yourself up against a mental block when it comes to cleaning up after your stepchild or nurturing her?</summary>
    <author>
        <name>Jenna Korf</name>

    <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/">
        &lt;p&gt;Stepmoms, do you find yourself up against a mental block when it comes to cleaning up after your stepchild or nurturing her? Many stepmoms will gladly make their husband an afternoon snack or pick up his socks, but when they see their stepchild's dirty dishes stacking up, or when they're asked to make them a special snack, they experience a triggered reaction that feels something like "&lt;em&gt;What am I, her maid?&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like you, then you might also feel shame about this automatic resistance, thinking &lt;em&gt;"How can I be so nurturing with my husband but then feel a complete block with my stepchild?"&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may all come down to reciprocity -- or a lack of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One definition of reciprocity is, "The practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you catch the phrase&lt;strong&gt; mutual benefit&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're in a happy, healthy relationship, then you know that reciprocity is vital. You're happy nurturing your husband because he may support you emotionally, provide a good home, make you laugh, fix things, etc. Maybe he's the one staying home with the kids while you're working. Whatever the situation may be, reciprocity is at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is often missing from the relationship between stepmom and stepchild, simply because that's the nature of a child-adult relationship. Even though we know intellectually that we can't expect a "mutually beneficial" relationship with a child, that knowledge doesn't make it any easier for stepmoms to feel like we're giving our all and receiving nothing in return. Many stepmoms don't even receive a "please" or "thank you" from their stepchild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a parent might say, "&lt;em&gt;So what? As parents we don't receive a please or thank you either.&lt;/em&gt;" The difference is that the child is an extension of his or her parent, thereby making it easier for a parent to give selflessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And although it's often said that parenting is a thankless job, I would argue that parents do receive something -- love. Unconditional love and a biological bond that can't be broken.  Granted, they don't receive these things because they do things for their children, but they still receive them. It's sort of like an unintentional reciprocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why basic manners, such as a "please and thank you", from a stepchild can mean the world to a stepmom. It can make the difference between feeling resentful and feeling good about helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let your husband and your stepchild (if age appropriate) know how far the words "please" and "thank you" would go. Request to incorporate these manners into your house rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjust your expectations: don't always expect appreciation from your stepchild, but do expect it from your partner. Let him know that you need him to acknowledge your efforts with his child -- frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have compassion for yourself. You're not evil and there's nothing wrong with you. This is just one of those challenges that come with being a stepmom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to look at nurturing as an investment. Even if your stepchild has two involved parents, your influence will still help shape the person he or she will become. And when he is an adult, he will likely look back and be thankful that you treated him with such kindness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask your partner to step up in the parenting department so you can step back. The best parenting books all say, "don't do for kids what they can do for themselves." Wouldn't it be nice if the parents took that advice to heart, so every once in a while you got to spoil your stepchild without feeling like she's missing out on some life lesson or that you're going to ruin her chances of becoming a responsible adult?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne have been married for more than 30 years, but reports recently surfaced claiming their three-decade union is crumbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun first reported &lt;a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4886856/sharon-and-ozzy-osbourne-living-apart.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Sharon and Ozzy are leading separate lives&lt;/a&gt;. He is allegedly living in a rented mansion and she in a hotel while their Beverly Hills mansion is renovated. Both were also spotted without their wedding rings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They are living at different addresses and not spending any time together," a source told The Sun. "They row a lot. They aren't acting like husband and wife. It is unusual to not even have dinner together when both of them are five minutes apart."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="http://www.gossipcop.com/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-living-apart-splitting-divorce-marriage-problems-divorced/" target="_hplink"&gt;Jack dismissed the gossip&lt;/a&gt; about his parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;HH--TWEET--323509090150125568--HH&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7466336/Sharon-Osbourne-My-love-for-Ozzy-and-what-I-really-think-of-Susan-Boyle.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Sharon and Ozzy married&lt;/a&gt; back in 1982 after three years of dating. She helped rehabilitate the rocker from substance abuse and helped manage his solo career. Their relationship and familial life was documented in the MTV reality series "The Osbournes," and showed the world a more intimate side of the heavy metal couple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We’ve always been in it for the long haul," &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2011/03/sharon-osbourne-the-nsfw-interview" target="_hplink"&gt;Sharon told Vanity Fair in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. "I never wanted to be a divorced woman ever. I mean, what were my options? Even before I met Ozzy, there weren’t any other men out there that I liked at all. They were always very boring. So to find somebody that I actually loved and wanted to be with, well, why ruin a good thing? Ozzy is a very complex person, and very layered. People use that term a lot, but it’s true with him. He has so many different layers to him. I’m discovering something new about him every day."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the rumors of a split are true it only adds to a difficult year for the 60-year-old former "X Factor" judge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, &lt;a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20645070,00.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Sharon revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy&lt;/a&gt; after discovering she was at risk for breast cancer. Her family's Beverly Hills &lt;a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/17/sharon-osbourne-fire-house-beverly-hills/" target="_hplink"&gt;home caught fire in January&lt;/a&gt;. And in March her daughter, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/07/kelly-osbourne-seizure-fashion-star_n_2831255.html" target="_hplink"&gt;Kelly, suffered a seizure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Huffington Post has reached out to Sharon's representatives for comment, but has not heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
