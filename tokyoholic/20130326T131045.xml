			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karuizawa is the place I have always wanted to visit ever since I learned about it from a cheesy Japanese TV drama that I used to watch to study the language. It is the famous retreat area for Tokyoites with lush greens and mild climate although when we got there, there was nothing mild about the scorching sun and humidity in the air. However, once you hide in the shadows of the forest, you can at last taste the delicious coolness Karuizawa is so famous for in summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200442.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3674" title="Drive to Karuizawa" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200442.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>The main street of the city was lined with various cafes, boutiques, bakeries and souvenir shops mostly selling tasty produce like jam and honey and the art works of local craftsmen. None of the stuff was cheap. The average lunch price at a restaurant or cafe was around 1500 yen.. More, if a restaurant was visited by someone famous like John Lennon. ^-^ Although if you don&#8217;t need to sit at a terrace or inside an air-conditioned room, there are plenty of choices of street food like German sausages, Russian piroshki, ice cream and amazing french bread.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200158.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3675" title="Symbol of Karuizawa" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200158.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="413" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200191.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3676" title="Karuizawa bus" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200191.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="432" /></a></p>
<p>There was a huge Ghibli animation souvenir shop on the main street. I spent half an hour browsing through different toys and character goods and ended up buying absolutely nothing&#8230; Always happens to me when I am given too much choice &#8211; I get lost!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200161.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3677" title="Totoro and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200161.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200159.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3678" title="Totoro fans" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200159.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>On the way from Karuizawa to Kusatsu onsen, we visited beautiful Shiraito waterfalls (White thread waterfalls). The water was so cold I couldn&#8217;t bear to keep my feet in it for more than a minute. Such contrast in temperatures is really astonishing!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200285.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3679" title="Shiraito waterfalls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200285.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200226.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3680" title="Shiraito waterfalls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200226.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200213.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3704" title="Shiraito waterfalls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200213.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="447" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200257.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3681" title="Shiraito waterfalls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200257.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>The smell of wet forest is really something special. I love it so much because it brings back so many memories from my childhood. It was just so peaceful to sit on a fallen tree, watch the dance of water falling down, enjoy the coolness of the air and smell the incredible aroma of wet soil and leaves&#8230;. I want to go back to that place so badly..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200238.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3682" title="Shiraito waterfalls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200238.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>When we arrived to Kusatsu onsen it was already getting dark so we took a quick tour around the area visiting a small Kusatsu shrine at the top of the hill and trying delicious rice cakes with hot green tea at various &#8220;omiyage&#8221; shops along the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200288.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3711" title="Kusatsu onsen shrine" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200288.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200289.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3712" title="Kusatsu onsen shrine" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200289.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200350.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3683" title="Kusatsu onsen" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200350.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="413" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200327.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3705" title="Kusatsu onsen" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200327.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>The main street of Kusatsu village had a huge reservoir of volcanic onsen water. The smell was excruciating &#8211; something in between a rotten egg and cat&#8217;s pee. But knowing that this horrible smell was just minerals that are so good for the body, it was kind of OK to bear it at least for a while.</p>
<p>People around were walking in their yukata which really gave a whimsical feel to the whole scene. I could easily imagine myself in the last century watching a small town scene unravel in front of my eyes. If you are fluent in Japanese, you can also enjoy a &#8220;rakugo&#8221; performance &#8211; traditional Japanese stand-up comedy that takes place in onsen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200355.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3706" title="Ashinoki" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200355.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="421" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200363.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3707" title="Kusatsu onsen" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200363.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="460" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200379.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3708" title="Kusatsu onsen water" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200379.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>At the main village square, there was a big pool of scorching hot onsen water for feet. Kusatsu is really famous for the hotness of its onsen water. It was so funny to watch Japanese tourists sitting by the pool, trying to ease their feet into the water and screaming &#8220;Atsui! Atsui!&#8221; &#8211; Hot! Hot! every second or so. My husband tried some Zen techniques he learned earlier which helped him keep his feet in the water for several minutes. ^-^ I could only do several seconds. ^-^</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200407.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3709" title="Ashinoba" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200407.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="424" /></a></p>
<p>This was our ryokan &#8211; a very nice place with amazing personnel and rooms overlooking the hills.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3710" title="Ryokan" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200417.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3713" title="Washitsu" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02598.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3714" title="Doll in the hallway" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200419.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p>We rented a private rustic rotemburo but the water was too hot. I guess I would really appreciate it in winter. In summer, it was unbearable. So instead I just sprinkled the onsen water on me and enjoyed a good massage. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3715" title="Private rotemburo" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02620.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3716" title="Private rotemburo" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02607.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>The dinner was of course amazing. I just love onsen food &#8211; all vegetables and fish and everything is so fresh and delicious.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3717" title="Dinner" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dinner.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="485" /></p>
<p>I visited the public rotemburo after hours so there was noone inside &#8211; yay! I liked it more than the private rotemburo because it had different baths with different temperatures and minerals. Also it was bigger and in the night the air was cooler so I could finally enjoy a little soaking in the water.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3718" title="Onsen" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02644.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="423" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02646.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3719" title="Onsen rotemburo" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC02646.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>The next day, we decided to drive towards Nagano and see the famous Yugana volcanic lake high in the Shirano mountains. The road to that place was tough &#8211; not only it was a mountain serpentine road, it also was poisonous at times. Here and there, there were danger signs that advised drivers to drive fast and close all windows because the smell from natural onsen reservoirs in the mountains had too much chemicals in it to make you dizzy and lose control of the steering wheel. Plus, the smell itself was just pure evil. I have no idea how people on mountain bikes were passing through that area..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3720" title="On the way to Nagano" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200523.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3721" title="Poisonous swamps" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200435.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="392" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3722" title="Start of the hike" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200450.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3723" title="Mountains on the way to Nagano" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200451.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3724" title="Landscape on the way to Nagano" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200461.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p>The volcanic lake was beautiful, same color as the mountain lakes in Patagonia. I saw a couple of deers on the peaks of the mountains near the lake. It was amazing being there and watching all that grandeur beauty in its untouched form.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3725" title="Secluded volcanic lake" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200475.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3726" title="Hike" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200515.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p>After volcanic lake, we drove to a little town called Obuse to check the works of famous Ukiyo-e artist Hokusai.</p>
<p>In the Edo era, Obuse was a center of local commerce with trade routes to the Kanto area and West part of Japan. In response to the growth of economic activities some influential literary men and artists came all the way from Kyoto and Edo bringing high culture to the little town. Katsushika Hokusai &#8211; famous master of Ukiyo-e was one of them.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3727" title="Obuse" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200536.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="432" /></p>
<p>The area is also famous for its kuri &#8211; chestnuts. We tried everything &#8211; chestnut cakes, chestnut ice cream, chestnut wine.. We also bought lots of chestnut souvenirs for our families. ^-^ The town itself was pretty. It reminded me a little of Kanazawa &#8211; old commercial buildings preserved in pristine condition and still operating. I really admire Japanese for cherishing their traditions and finding the perfect balance between old and new.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3728" title="Obuse" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200542.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="398" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3729" title="Obuse shops" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200544.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="433" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3730" title="Obuse shops" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200545.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="423" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3731" title="Wooden brick road" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200534.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="419" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3732" title="Obuse winery" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200546.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="422" /></p>
<p>Amazing Italian restaurant on the main street where we enjoyed lunch before heading back to Tokyo. ^-^ I love the places that are touristy but not crowded. I can&#8217;t really imagine a nice restaurant in Tokyo with 20 empty seats on terrace. That would be pure miracle. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3733" title="Italian restaurant" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200553.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="453" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised, I took my new Sony camera for a test shoot in the evening. I decided to go around Tokyo taking photos of Christmas illumination. These are my most favorite spots.</p>
<p>Christmas tree at Villa Fontaine hotel in Shiodome</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3984" title="Christmas tree at Villa Fontaine hotel" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC029451.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>Roppongi Hills Christmas bazaar</p>

<p>They are selling delicious German food all through December so if you want to try some pretzels with beer or white cheese sauce pasta, head to the bazaar in front of Toho Cinema.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3989" title="Roppongi Hills Christmas bazaar" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03152.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="420" /></p>

<p>This is Christmas village decorations at Shiodome</p>

<p>Keyakizaka street illumination at Roppongi Hills. This one is right in front of entrance to the TV Asahi. When I was passing it, the familiar smell of the lobby hit me. I used to go there for three and a half years every Saturday evening for live broadcast of Sma-Station. That were super fun times because I got to hang out with my best friends and get paid for it. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3996" title="Keyakizaka street illumination" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03168.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>
<p>Keyakizaka street, in front of new Michael Kors shop. A strong earthquake hit at the moment I was taking this picture. It felt like the train was passing underground only there is no train there so I was very puzzled at first. Then, a minute later I got all these Facebook messages with people screaming &#8220;Earthquake&#8221; and that&#8217;s how I realized what it was. When you are outside, you can&#8217;t really comprehend if it&#8217;s a strong one or not. Apparently it was the strongest and longest one since 3/11 earthquake last year. Luckily, the trains didn&#8217;t stop for too long. I was able to get home without any trouble.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3998" title="Keyakizaka street illumination" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03172.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>I discovered this great &#8220;star&#8221; effect while playing with blur function on my Sony. If I make it really sharp and hold the camera still, it creates these beautiful stars out of light.</p>

<p>So I am extremely happy with my new camera. It takes amazing night pictures that are sharp and bright. I think I made the right choice although I still feel quite sentimental about parting with my old Lumix GF1&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year has been extremely busy for me and that is why I haven&#8217;t been updating my blog as often as I would have wanted. But now that I have a little bit more time on my hands I can finally sort out through hundreds of photos that I took at various events and post some of them here. This one is about birthday parties that took place this year.</p>
<p>First, there was Shelly&#8217;s birthday right after Golden week. It was a beautiful party at an upscale private dining place in Nishi Azabu organized by her agency. There were a DJ and champagne tower and funny games and lots and lots of guests. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3931" title="Shelly's birthday cake" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190952.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3932" title="Blowing on candles" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190954.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="574" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3933" title="Champagne tower" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190977.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3934" title="Shelly" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1200010.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></p>
<p>One of the guests was <a href="http://ameblo.jp/rolarola/" target="_blank">Rola</a> &#8211; the current IT model/talent. She was very bubbly and funny and at times silly but that&#8217;s what sells in Japan so she was doing a great job.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3935" title="Barby, Rola, Shelly and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1200015.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3936" title="Girls" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190945.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="617" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3937" title="Barby and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190941.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="800" /></p>
<p>I took this photo when girls were playing the game &#8220;Who knows Shelly the best!&#8221; They were getting Shelly dollar every time they answered a question correctly.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3938" title="Playing games" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190926.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>This guy won the main prize &#8211; a pair of tickets to Disneyland. Nice!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3939" title="The winner" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190933.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3940" title="Shelly's money" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1190916.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="511" /></p>

<p>Then, there was Gow&#8217;s birthday party/live performance at Ginza Roots. It was also amazing, very posh and so so crowded. Gow has a lot of friends. Whenever we go out together, somebody always stops us on the street to say Hello to her.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3942" title="Gow's birthday flowers" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02730.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="408" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3943" title="Birthday cake" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02708.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="421" /></p>
<p>Many of her talented friends performed for her that night including Girls&#8217; talk, David, Mathew from Fox TV, beatboxer Kazu and a band of musicians.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3944" title="Girls' talk" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02695.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="463" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3945" title="David singing" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02677.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="430" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3946" title="Mathew singing" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02679.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="419" /></p>
<p>Gow sang too &#8211; of course she was the best of them all.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3947" title="Gow singing" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02721.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="401" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3948" title="Tanya, Shelly, Gow and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02715.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="417" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3950" title="Birthday girl" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC_9496.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="445" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3951" title="Vincent and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02713.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="605" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3952" title="David and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02688.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="407" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3953" title="Minami, Chieko and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02685.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="463" /></p>
<p>At parties like this I meet a lot of people that I don&#8217;t normally see like Natalie and Clara. We used to work together on various TV shows and modeling jobs..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3954" title="Natalie, Clara, Vanessa and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02687.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="436" /></p>
<p>For my birthday this year I didn&#8217;t have any party. I hate throwing parties for myself and I hate asking my friends to do it for me. Instead, I had a romantic date with my husband and it was all I could wish for. It was one of the biggest storms that day with all the TV stations advising people to stay indoors. Instead of taking the advice, we rented a car and drove to the ocean. Crazy I know but it was so damn romantic. The stormy ocean is beautiful, rain is beautiful plus it always rains on my birthday so it was nothing new. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3956" title="My birthday flowers" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220702.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="425" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3957" title="Stormy ocean" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220733.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="414" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3958" title="Rainy storm" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220713.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="414" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3959" title="Raining" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220716.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="414" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3960" title="Rainbow bridge in the storm" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220807.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="339" /></p>
<p>After spending half a day at the beach, we drove back to the city to Odaiba to watch &#8220;Bourne legacy&#8221; coz this movie series has a special place in our hearts. We both love it because it takes place in Europe and it is real with old-fashioned phones and logistics and operations &#8211; no sci-fi bullshit like virtual screens and immediate satelite access and people who just happen to conveniently know stuff &#8220;just because&#8221; like in other Hollywood movies. Of course I didn&#8217;t like it that much without Matt Damon in it but I enjoyed it anyway.</p>
<p>After the movie, we got back into our car and drove home. Only instead of heading towards the rainbow bridge, my husband stopped in front of Tokyo Nikko hotel where he secretly booked a room with the view to the bay as a surprise to me. I always wanted to stay at that hotel because it has this huge windows overlooking the best of Tokyo&#8217;s skyline and my favorite park is right in front of it. I was so happy to finally realize that dream.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3961" title="Storm in Odaiba" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220811.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="403" /></p>
<p>The room was amazing. From our balcony I could watch the storm unraveling in the bay. It was breathtaking.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3962" title="Nikko hotel" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220822.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="389" /></p>
<p>We had champagne and chocolate cake and I got yet another flower bouquet. It was amazing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3963" title="My birthday cake" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220835.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="466" /></p>
<p>In the morning, the bay looked so peaceful after the storm. I woke up early and just sat on the balcony half naked watching the sunset and eating my chocolate cake. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3964" title="Morning after storm" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220858.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="398" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3966" title="Statue of liberty in the early morning" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220888.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="674" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3967" title="Tokyo Nikko hotel" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220889.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="414" /></p>
<p>We had breakfast in my favorite park in front of hotel and then headed home. It was the perfect birthday date.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3968" title="Breakfast" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/P1220899.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="397" /></p>
<p>Last week it was Laura&#8217;s birthday. Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t be at her birthday party but I met her a couple of days ago for a private birthday date in Odaiba. I am so happy she loved the dress I gave her. I was having my doubts especially after all the friends I sought advice from confirmed that it wasn&#8217;t her style.. A little black dress won&#8217;t hurt anyone&#8217;s wardrobe even if one prefers to wear color most of the time. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3925" title="Laura and me at Odaiba Starbucks" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03089.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="434" /></p>

<p>By the way, these are the pics I took with my new Sony. I absolutely love how sharp they are. I didn&#8217;t even use any surface to station my camera on when taking these photos. These are just snaps I took while walking &#8211; simply amazing. ^-^</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to one of my favorite parks in Tokyo &#8211; Mizumoto park. It is really big and amazingly beautiful in every season. Me and my husband had a picnic there and then took a long stroll in the forest along the pond. These are the last photos I took with my Lumix GF1 before selling it. I decided to try new Sony Nex-5R instead. ^-^</p>

<p>This little creature kept jumping on my husband. He either took liking in him or considered him to be hostile. I couldn&#8217;t find its exact name but I am thinking it is some kind of cricket? It made similar sounds. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3911" title="Green cricket" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03032.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="408" /></p>
<p>From here are the pictures I took with my new Sony Nex-5R. I went to Shinjuku Gyoen park the other day to test it.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3915" title="Sony Nex-5R" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/sony.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="425" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3884" title="Shinjuku park sky" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02982.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>The display can turn 180 degrees so now I can see myself when taking pictures. My friend Laura is really good at such self-portraits. Me? I look like a tourist no matter what&#8230; I seriously can&#8217;t figure out my good angles even when I look at myself&#8230; ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3888" title="Momiji and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02997.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="448" /></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3886" title="Red and green leaves" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC02993.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>With Sony I can control the level of  blur on the background which is good because I sometimes want both myself and the background to look sharp. Here I tried to take a closeup of leaves and it blurred the background behind them beautifully. I am very happy about this particular function.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3893" title="Closeup" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03014.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="586" /></p>
<p>Ginkgo tree is considered to be the symbol of Tokyo. It is literally everywhere and the smell from it&#8217;s seeds is sometimes overwhelming but I so got used to associate it with autumn in Japan that I don&#8217;t really mind anymore.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3894" title="Ginkgo tree leaves" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03027.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>The weather has been quite warm this autumn so the leaves are just turning yellow and red. Some of the trees are still as green as they were in summer. I just love the contrast.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3901" title="Tree sky" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03063.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>It was the first time for me to visit Shinjuku Gyoen&#8217;s green house. I usually just go straight to my usual spot by the water to read book or have a picnic. I almost never explore the rest of the park. The other day I had a lot of spare time so I decided to finally check the green house.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3900" title="Green house" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03049.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="400" /></p>
<p>Little tip for those who suddenly gets cold in the park &#8211; green house is an ideal refuge from freezing weather. It was so warm and moist and it smelled like orchids. A great place to warm up and enjoy exotic flowers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3898" title="Orchids" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC03045.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="412" /></p>

<p>Overall I think I am happy with my new camera. I obviously need  to practice taking more than mediocre pictures but the quick snaps are quite stunning as well. I am hoping to go take evening pictures today. This camera is advertised as the one being particularly good at it. Let&#8217;s see!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mitropolit Kirill, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia came to Japan with a visit to celebrate 100 years since the death of Saint Nikolay of Japan, the first Russian orthodox missionary in Japan. Our church in Ochanomizu is named after him.</p>
<p>Ever since he took the title of Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, Kirill has become a very public figure with a lot of judgmental eyes on him, watching his every move and interpreting everything he does in a way that would amuse the masses. I guess, when one is forced to shift one&#8217;s attention from spiritual guidance to being the &#8220;CEO&#8221; of church,  one gains a lot of hatred by default. I do not agree with the church&#8217;s teaching on some subjects like homosexuality, women rights and science but I understand that for church and its leaders it is really hard to change their doctrines. One little change can shutter the formation of the whole religion. Russian orthodox church is proud of having never changed a single thing about its teachings so I reckon they are not about to start now even though I am sure they do understand that some of their established beliefs regarding the aforementioned topics are very controversial to say the least. Kirill is trying to bring faith back into the masses but it is really hard to do especially with the young generation that is raised on new values brought to them by modern media. How do you teach kids humility and kindness when it is purely not cool anymore&#8230;</p>
<p>We all wish for church to be focusing on more important messages like love to the neighbor and not judging anyone before judging ourselves. Instead, partly because of lack of flexibility and partly because human values have changed a lot in the past decades, church is all about war rather than peace.. There are also a lot of situations where church and Christian religion as a whole is widely misrepresented by blind fanatics or people who abuse their religious statuses for personal gain. Religion will always suffer from that. But we all hold high standards for church, expect it to be pure good and criticize it when it fails to meet our expectations. Yet, we never fail to lower any kind of standard for ourselves, creating all sorts of excuses for our own actions..  So it is my opinion that we should focus on the good and filter the rest. After all, our relationship with God is a very personal experience. If I don&#8217;t agree with something, I let it be. I focus on my relationship with God rather than my relationship with church. I go there to join in the public prayer for the well-being of human kind and not to give any kind of statement. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3819" title="Nikolay-Do church" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02886.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="417" /></p>
<p>Kirill came to Nikolay-Do for Sunday service with a big entourage of priests bringing his own camera crew and bodyguards. It was quite a spectacle. I really enjoyed the atmosphere around. People were joyful and full of excitement. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3820" title="Jenya and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02795.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>Jenya and me before the service. We were all waiting for Patriarch to arrive inside the church rather than outside which was a mistake. By the time he came, it was already so hot and humid, I was grasping for air.. Although really, we were in no position to complain wearing nothing by light summer dresses while all the clergy including Kirill were wearing 3-4 layers of ceremonial robes, heavy and uncomfortable.. Poor priests spent 3 hours performing the service without any ability to take a break and go outside in the fresh air like we did from time to time. I know I am not supposed to do that but otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive long..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3821" title="Patriarch Kirill" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02828.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>This is the official dressing of Kirill into the ceremonial robe at the beginning of the service.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3822" title="Sunday service" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02832.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="375" /></p>
<p>Kirill is giving blessing to the crowd.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3823" title="Service" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02837.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3824" title="Service" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02845.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="667" /></p>
<p>Kirill is leading the service with Daniil politely stepping down and standing beside him. He was promoted into the higher rank today so I am thinking he is not complaining. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3826" title="Service" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02851.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>Julia and me outside the church, taking a break. Julia was wearing her Armani Sunday best. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3827" title="Julia and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02875.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>Every visitor today got an icon of Saint Nikolay of Japan as a commemorative present. Unfortunately, the entrance was only open to those registered in advance like we did. Many of my friends couldn&#8217;t join in because the news of registration never reached them.. I feel very guilty of not spreading the news when it was still possible to get in.. Hopefully, the situation was different at Podvorye &#8211; another Tokyo church he visited after Nikolay-Do..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3828" title="Nikolay icon" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02887.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vogue Fashion&#8217;s night out in Tokyo is getting better every year. Of course nothing can top off the last year when 17 Vogue editors came and brought along designers, celebrities and bloggers from all over the world but it was a special one time event to show support to Japan after what happened in March. This year, nobody major came but nevertheless the shops went out of their way to organize fun events, stamp rallies, contests all the while offering free drinks and food to its visitors. Many also offered limited edition merchandise &#8211; FNO-related novelty goods (Roberto Cavalli, Michael Kors, Marc by Marc Jacobs) as well as one of  a kind items you could buy only then and there (Gucci). Japanese girls absolutely love &#8220;gentei&#8221; &#8211; limited time thingies so those were selling out pretty fast.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3767 alignnone" title="Moncler display" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/DSC02737.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="446" /></p>

<p>This year, I stayed mainly to the South-East of Omotesando area visiting Issey Miyake, Prada, Marc Jacobs, Theory and Roberto Cavalli. I skipped opening ceremony at Omotesando hills because it is the same every year with the same hosts and the same celebrities but here are a couple of pictures taken by my friend&#8217;s fiance. ^-^</p>

<p>New Bao Bao bag at Issey Miyake store. I am in love with this bag. I have it in white and absolutely love it. It gives such an edge to whatever outfit I choose to wear. I have been using this bag every day this summer and never ever did it not go with what I was wearing. I am seriously considering getting the pink one too now. ^-^ By the way, Bao Bao bags are only available in Japan for now but if any of you guys want it, I can help you get it. Contact me at tokyoholic@yahoo.com.</p>

<p>Yayoi Kusama window display at Louis Vuitton. The wax figure is really freaky. It is so detailed, you can see oily pores on her skin and facial hair.. She is one strange lady but I don&#8217;t question her artistic sense. However unusual her designs are, they do make an amazing impact. Nobody went past Luis Vuitton without peaking inside. ^-^</p>

<p>In front of Gucci I ran into <a href="http://jennechrisville.com/" target="_blank">Gervin</a> &#8211; my stylish friend from Philippines. He was as always full of positive energy.</p>

<p>Beautiful MJ bags that we could take photos with. Marc Jacobs store offered a free photo session with Keiichi Nitta as part of their FNO celebration.</p>

<p>On the second floor, <a href="http://tokyodandy.com" target="_blank">Tokyo Dandy</a> organized a creative workshop. Everyone had an opportunity to customize US Vogue&#8217;s September issue cover with Lady Gaga on it wearing gorgeous Marc Jacobs gown. Me and Sergey immediately decided to go with a Russian theme. He made a really corky matryoshka out of Lady Gaga and I did this. Mine is not very creative but it was just for fun. ^-^</p>

<p>Then, I run into Marni, my New York friend who works at Marc Jacobs. She was wearing the cutest and most original skirt I have ever seen. I just wanted to keep touching it. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3784" title="Marni and me at Marc Jacobs" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/P1220641.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="672" /></p>

<p>In front of MJ I also met Anna &#8211; Russian jewelry designer and model. She is amazing. I so wished to be wearing heels though when I was taking this picture with her. ^-^</p>

<p>Thanks to FNO my wish list doubled in length. ^-^ Now in addition to everything I need to buy at <a href="http://rstyle.me/ad/bjbspf46" target="_blank">shopbop.com</a> I also have to get Bao Bao bag in pink, purple Theory sweater and new MJ wallet because my present one is literally falling into pieces.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, me and Laura went to the movies to see Avengers in 3D. Usually, I don&#8217;t enjoy 3D movies because of the heavy 3D glasses that give me headache and leave red marks on my nose. However, I recently discovered really cute 3D glasses on the Internet that are not only fashionable but also light and can be worn as normal glasses. They don&#8217;t seem to be having that annoying film on the lenses that the normal 3D glasses have so you can&#8217;t really tell they are 3D but they totally work.</p>
<p><img title="Avengers movie" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200975.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="674" /></p>
<p>To see if there was any difference, Laura wore the usual 3D glasses provided by the theater and I wore mine and then we exchanged them several times during the movie. The result was the same!! Amazing! I quickly spread the word among my friends in Japan and Russia but was surprised to learn that fashionable 3D glasses were not a novelty at all in Saint Petersburg. My Russian friends were using their own original 3D glasses for some time now.. In Japan, there is no such thing which is sad because not only Japanese 3D glasses look hideous, the movie theater charges you for renting them.. I hope they will change their policy soon and offer cheaper tickets for those who bring their own glasses..</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3742" title="Popcorn" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1220056.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p>Anyway, the 3D glasses that I got on the internet are <a href="http://www.ingridahl.com/" target="_blank">INGRI:DAHL</a> and they come in several styles and colors. There are even clip-ons that you can use on your prescription glasses to turn them into 3D. At first, I was thinking of getting one of those because I do wear prescription glasses when watching movies with subtitles but then, those brainy movies that my husband makes me watch are never in 3D so I went for the frame ones that are super cute. ^-^ The INGRI:DAHL online shop offers international delivery and it only took 1 week to get them which is not bad at all.</p>
<p>The movie itself was OK. It wasn&#8217;t anything special but it was exactly what I needed after a long and stressful day at work &#8211; predictable plot with really hot actors and lots and lots of effects and pyrotechnics. That Thor guy is really yummy. I don&#8217;t like him on stills but in action he is amazing!!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3759" title="Laura and me" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200994.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></p>
<p>Speaking of movies.. ^-^ Every year, Ridley Scott is challenging the public with a different project. Last year, it was a short movie competition that Laura participated in. You can watch her entry <a title="Parallel lines Philips cinema competition" href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/2010/08/25/parallel-lines-philips-cinema-competition/">here</a>. Even though her work wasn&#8217;t chosen, I think it is brilliant and much more original than those that won something. This year, Ridley Scott was looking for private videos from Japan that were taken on March 11th, 2012 &#8211; exactly one year since the Big Tohoku earthquake and Laura had plenty of those. In fact, he used tons of her footage of the disaster area in his new documentary &#8220;Japan in a day&#8221;. She went on a volunteer trip to Fukushima that day carrying food and other necessities to the refuge camps and shot a lot of unique scenes that were used in the movie. The documentary also used some of the scenes with Laura herself, even for the trailer that you can watch <a href="http://japan-in-a-day.gaga.ne.jp/" target="_blank">here</a>. You can see it in Japan, in theaters from November 3rd and worldwide sometime later this year.</p>
<p><img title="Japan in a day project" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Untitled-3.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="328" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3744" title="Adeyto shot in a movie" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Untitled-6.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="343" /></p>
<p>My other friend Dima who used to co-host <a title="До новых встреч.." href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/2010/03/18/%d0%b4%d0%be-%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%85-%d0%b2%d1%81%d1%82%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%87/" target="_blank">NHK&#8217;s &#8220;Russian on TV&#8221;</a> with me a couple of years ago has since moved to Hollywood to study cinematography. He is currently working on a project called &#8220;Sector&#8221;. The story is similar to &#8220;28 weeks later&#8221; but the project focuses on human emotions and interactions rather than bunch of messy bloody scenes and 3D effects. I am not a huge fan of such movies but I know him and I know that no matter what he decides to make, it will be brilliant.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3746" title="Sector, the movie" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/dima.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="406" /></p>
<p>At the moment, it is an indies project and they need a lot of support. If any of you guys are interested in donating to his project, you can do it <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/189702" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, a friend of mine invited me over to Odaiba to watch Tokyo bay fireworks from the roof of her apartment building. Fireworks are held every week in mid-summer as part of long lasting tradition along with joining Matsuri (local festival) and wearing yukata (summer kimono). There are several major areas in Tokyo that produce beautiful fireworks shows but Tokyo bay is the most famous one because it is held against the breathtaking backdrop of Tokyo skyline with Rainbow bridge and Tokyo tower.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200580.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3690" title="Eating watermelon" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200580.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="415" /></a></p>
<p>In Japan, every time you gather to view something, whether it is cherry blossoms, full moon, red leaves or fireworks, you throw a big party with food and drinks and then quickly forget the main reason for gathering after your second chu-hai (Japanese fruity alcohol drink). ^-^ Me and the girls decided to postpone the drinks till after the fireworks and focus on getting beautiful for the occasion.</p>
<p>I wanted to rent yukata in Shibuya&#8217;s famous &#8220;Aki&#8221; shop but apparently so did many others so the dresser was completely out of any by the time I called them. Fortunately, Hitomi found yukata for each of us and I got the prettiest one with yellow obi. ^-^ Gow took lessons in &#8220;kitsuke&#8221; &#8211; kimono dressing and has a license to perform it on other people (yeah, it is not that easy to dress someone in kimono, a lot of skill is required). She quickly wrapped all of us in yukata and arranged our &#8220;obi&#8221; &#8211; sashes in pretty bows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200581.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3691" title="Choosing yukata" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200581.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>Last year, the biggest fireworks event in Tokyo was canceled due to Fukushima crisis in efforts to save energy. This year, they went ballistic with 90 minutes non-stop procession of one blast after another. It was absolutely amazing. Each time the volley exploded in the air, the whole city turned either purple red or ghostly green. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t capture the best moments with my camera, but here are some.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200643.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3701" title="Tokyo bay fireworks" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200643.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="410" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200789.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3687" title="Fireworks over Tokyo bay" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200789.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200819.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3688" title="Fireworks over Tokyo bay" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200819.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>We were watching fireworks from the 33rd floor of tower building. It was guarded with fences and there were people in front of us who got their spots in the morning so I couldn&#8217;t get close enough to exclude the fence from my pictures but it didn&#8217;t bother us to watch fireworks. Some volleys went so high in the sky, they were half covered by the clouds. ^-^ The effect was amazing, like an alien ship appearing suddenly out of nowhere.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200847.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3689" title="Girls in yukata watching fireworks" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200847.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>Our friend Lille got engaged last week so we were celebrating her engagement as well. The proposal was so romantic, there were a lot of Awwwwwws in the air. ^-^</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200690.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" title="Watching fireworks on the roof" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/P1200690.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="407" /></a></p>
<p>It took place at Marina Bay hotel&#8217;s poolside in Singapore, that&#8217;s why our bubbly was blue. ^-^ Congratulations Lille for getting engaged to a really cool guy at the most trendiest spot in South-East Asia. ^-^</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two months ago (!!!), I rented my first electric Nissan Leaf (more about it later) and drove to Chiba to the famous strawberry road &#8211; a place with 20 or so strawberry farms where you can pick strawberries &#8220;tabehodai&#8221; &#8211; all-you-can-eat style.</p>
<p>Picking produce in Japan is one of the popular entertainment that people enjoy throughout the year. In winter, they pick strawberries that grow in green houses.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3633" title="Srawberry paradise" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/p1180866.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>What you basically do is pay for half an hour or an hour of green house time. There, you can pick and eat as much as you wish. Usually, it costs around 1500 &#8211; 2000 yen per person. The more you eat, the cheaper it gets. ^-^ My husband is a bad eater. For his share of 1500 yen, he only ate like 15 berries. So, I am always the one who makes it a &#8220;profitable&#8221; affair. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3634" title="Me and strawberry" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/p1180844.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>Two years ago, I had a record of eating <a href="http://tokyoholic.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/strawberry-fields-forever/" target="_blank">102 strawberries</a> in 30 minutes. This year, I only managed to eat 86 which roughly estimates to 5 baskets of strawberry that is usually sold at a supermarket. I was also trying to leave some space for lunch as we had big plans for the rest of the day.. Unfortunately, those plans went south thanks to the lovely Nissan Leaf.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3635" title="Strawberry closeup" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/p1180853.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>At first, I was excited to drive an ecological electric car but my joy was short-lived. Although the car is easy to drive, fast and very very quiet (the engine doesn&#8217;t roar), it runs out of battery very quickly. Rental offices don&#8217;t have their own charges so when you rent an electric car from them, you rent it with whatever battery is left in it. The first thing you do is look for a place where you can charge it. Normal charging takes 8 hours but there are places where you can do a &#8220;speed&#8221; charging of about 80% of the battery capacity. It takes 30 minutes. The only problem is 80% of battery roughly equals to 160 km and if you are using vipers, air conditioning and light, it is even less, sometimes as much less as only 80-90km. Plus, the charging places &#8211; mostly Nissan dealerships have only 1 or 2 charges that are often already occupied so you either have to wait for your turn and then wait some more till the car charges or look for another place. During the 6 hours we were on the road, we spend 3 hours looking for dealerships with &#8220;speed&#8221; chargers and then waiting for the car to charge.. On top of that, we punctured our tire so had to wait another two hours for the rental representative to come and change our car.. By the time we got a normal non-electric car and could drive anywhere, it was too late to go on with our plans to have lunch at an amazing local restaurant and then visit various museums&#8230; I ended up eating &#8220;nikuman&#8221; from a convenient store and watching rain from the damn Nissan&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3641" title="Electric car" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1180914.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="419" /></p>
<p>But before our misfortunes with Nissan began, we managed to make one stop at a local farm. I was drawn to the beautiful colors of blossoming plum and these orange bushes. The weather was horrible, the sky and landscape were grey so these trees immediately popped.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3636" title="Early blossoms" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1180916.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3637" title="Plum" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/1180933.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>
<p>I usually enjoy winter landscape even if it is drained from colors. I love countryside and walking around in the middle of nowhere under rain calms me down tremendously. ^-^ But of course if I knew that that walk was be the highlight of my day I wouldn&#8217;t have been quite so positive about it. ^-^</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3638" title="On a farm" src="http://www.tokyoholic.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/p1180962.jpg" alt="" width="610" height="458" /></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning, the whole Japan stopped for a few minutes to watch the Solar Eclipse. You know how in the movies, when there is an alien invasion or a deadly comet approaching the Earth, all people suddenly stop whatever they were doing and point at the sky? Well, it was exactly like that. Very creepy and beautiful.</p>

<p>I watched it from my balcony for a few seconds. I didn&#8217;t have glasses and my husband was particularly against me looking at it without protection so instead, I turned to the TV. It was on all the 12 channels. ^-^</p>

<p>Last eclipse took place 173 years ago in Japan so it was a very big deal to witness it. Some speculate that today at exactly 6PM the sky will turn red due to some sort of alignment with the Sun. I don&#8217;t know how accurate this prediction is, let&#8217;s see! ^-^</p>
