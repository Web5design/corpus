				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goody, goody gumdrops. Today&#8217;s episode slice is nothing short of fantastic. Why, you ask? American <a href="http://www.gretchenbergbooks.com/" target="_blank">Gretchen Berg</a>, the author of the hilarious yet informative book titled, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007MCWIPY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B007MCWIPY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=atlaslic-20">I Have Iraq in My Shoe: Misadventures of a Soldier of Fashion</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=atlaslic-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B007MCWIPY" width="1" height="1" border="0" />, is on the show. If you haven&#8217;t read the book, read it. You will laugh. A lot. And, she&#8217;s talking to me from her closet! What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Gretchen was in a lot of debt, and her shoe-obsession didn&#8217;t help. She ended up teaching English in northern Iraq (Kurdistan) and paying off all her debt. Then, she wrote a book about it. In this interview, you&#8217;ll get a little taste of what life was like for her there.</p>

<li>Safety as an American female</li>
<li>Benefits of teaching in Iraq</li>
<li>Major cultural differences between genders and the inequalities she witnessed between men and women</li>
<li>What a typical day was like for her</li>
<li>The students she taught (many of them had family members who had spent time in Saddam Hussein&#8217;s prisons)</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s episode slice is a long one. It&#8217;s long for a good reason of course. My guest Carol Crehan was so interesting that I just couldn&#8217;t stop talking to her! She has lived and worked abroad in the international education field for the past umpteen years, mainly in Asia and the Middle East. She&#8217;s on the show to talk mostly about her time teaching English and living as an expat in Qatar.</p>
<p><span id="more-1905"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We cover a ton of ground. Here is just some of what we discuss!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>How her life overseas began with the Peace Corps in Sri Lanka and the profound impact that it had on her</li>
<li>How her awkward or worst moments abroad turned into some of her best stories over time</li>
<li>A hilarious story about an ant-covered pink pudding her Sri Lankan host family gave her (You WILL laugh out loud.)</li>
<li>What her teaching job entailed in Qatar (her students, the curriculum, benefits, what a typical day was like at work, her accommodation, financial ease)</li>
<li>The fascinating dynamics of teaching mixed group university students (males and females in a classroom for the first time) who were preparing to study in an English-speaking country</li>
<li>Why reading and writing levels are emphasized much less in Qatar than speaking and listening</li>
<li>Why rapport and personal relationships are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">crucial</span> to communication and help build trust</li>
<li>Why teaching English in the Middle East is considered the &#8220;cash cow&#8221;</li>
<li>How she didn&#8217;t need to know Arabic to get around in the Gulf</li>

		<itunes:summary>Today&#039;s episode slice is a long one. It&#039;s long for a good reason of course. My guest Carol Crehan was so interesting that I just couldn&#039;t stop talking to her! She has lived and worked abroad in the international education field for the past umpteen years, mainly in Asia and the Middle East. She&#039;s on the show to talk mostly about her time teaching English and living as an expat in Qatar.



We cover a ton of ground. Here is just some of what we discuss!

	How her life overseas began with the Peace Corps in Sri Lanka and the profound impact that it had on her
	How her awkward or worst moments abroad turned into some of her best stories over time
	A hilarious story about an ant-covered pink pudding her Sri Lankan host family gave her (You WILL laugh out loud.)
	What her teaching job entailed in Qatar (her students, the curriculum, benefits, what a typical day was like at work, her accommodation, financial ease)
	The fascinating dynamics of teaching mixed group university students (males and females in a classroom for the first time) who were preparing to study in an English-speaking country
	Why reading and writing levels are emphasized much less in Qatar than speaking and listening
	Why rapport and personal relationships are crucial to communication and help build trust
	Why teaching English in the Middle East is considered the &quot;cash cow&quot;
	How she didn&#039;t need to know Arabic to get around in the Gulf
	Driving in the Middle East and the craziness that ensues on the road
	What life was like for her in general and her thoughts on transportation, safety, crime, the weather, respect toward women, the culture, and expat life
	Her recommendations for entering the international education field as a teacher overseas, especially in the Middle East
	How she worked at the State Department as an English language fellow
	The prevalence of plagiarism and  grade inflation in the schools
	Why she is deciding to work abroad again

... and so much more!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My guests on today&#8217;s episode slice are two awesome (and hilarious) location-independent friends who are already semi-retired, and they’re in their twenties! Well, I think they&#8217;re in their twenties. If not, then they are aging well. I tracked them down in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, as they are making their way from Canada all the way down to Antarctica. Funny story &#8211; They had to borrow shirts to wear for this interview! It&#8217;s a tough life&#8230;</p>
<p>So, who are these online entrepreneurs? Amar runs <a href="http://gapyearescape.com/" target="_blank">Gap Year Escape</a>, and Andreas runs <a href="http://www.londoncyclist.co.uk/" target="_blank">London Cyclist</a>. They&#8217;re on the show to talk  mainly about the online businesses that they created, and how they&#8217;re making passive income as they travel and live a semi-retired life. I&#8217;d say this episode slice is the perfect &#8220;edutainment&#8221; episode, so get ready to watch, learn, and laugh.</p>
<p><span id="more-1892"></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here&#8217;s some more goodness that we cover:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue buckets &#8211; affiliates, iphone apps, ebooks, advertising</li>
<li>How Andreas&#8217; iphone app made about $10,000 in revenue its first month</li>
<li>Why Amar is phasing out advertising as a source of revenue and will be focusing on making his money through affiliate advertising</li>
<li>How building trust with your audience and having a solid base of followers can be more important than having a huge subscriber base with poor engagement</li>
<li>How long it took them to build  a list of followers</li>
<li>Best advice for people just starting out as an online entrepreneur (great insight)</li>
<li>Why Amar uses virtual assistants to prevent him from getting in his own way and doing the &#8220;boring&#8221; tasks that he knows he won&#8217;t do</li>
<li>Where Amar hires assistants</li>
<li>Top tips for hiring VAs and why not to hire them by the hour</li>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>One word to describe today&#8217;s episode slice: Fascinating. If you&#8217;re interesting in living and/or teaching in Jordan as an expat, you are going to love this interview. American Morgan Byrne-Diakun is my guest. He originally came over to Jordan to work as an administrator for a study abroad program (CET).
