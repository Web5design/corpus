<p>I bought a ticket on the Tokyo airport bus leaving from near the Google office and
thought my 
fun with the <a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">new

<p>I guess I should conclude this series with some more reportage on the
camera, but hey, the most important thing isn’t that, because they’re all
pretty good these days.  What matters is finding something worth pointing it
at. Most times, all you really need is for the camera to get out of the
way.</p> 
<p>I didn’t feel there was anything between me and the water.
And that’s it for this series.</p>

<p>My turn in the carpool schedule. Girl and Boy in the back seat, my first-grade daughter
and her classmate who’s expecting a little sister any day now.
Girl: “Daddy, how do they know whether it’s a boy or a girl before it’s
born?” Me: <i>[Tries to explain about ultrasound (as if I understood it) and
how they can see a not-very-good picture of the baby, still in Mummy’s

<p>Ah, the camera and the motorized vehicle; both blossomed last century
but are going strong. Let’s apply the first to the second and do it with a
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">new camera</a> in
Tokyo. What’s not to like? Shameless plug: Includes my personal favorite
picture in this series.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is a random lucky capture in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya,_Tokyo">Shibuya</a>, which has
come to inhabit its own mythology. I don’t make a point of going there any
more when I visit Tokyo but somehow I always do anyhow, and then I smile because for
a place featuring vertical concrete and a trillion or so watts of synthetic
illumination, it’s awfully human.</p>
<p>(Warning: If you click on this to see the full-size it may cost a couple
extra minutes out of your life while you check this detail or that.)</p>
<img src="DSCF2527.png" alt="The lights turn green behind Shibuya station" />
<p>I was standing on the bridge and realized the light was about to turn
green; it was obvious I’d have to motion-freeze and it wasn’t <em>that</em>
dark what with all the lights, so I dialed in 1/500 on the shutter speed and
let the camera do its best.  It did OK, d’ya think? And I gotta
bow deeply in the direction of the
<a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujinon_lens_xf35mmf14_r/">Fujinon XF35mm F1.4</a>
lens, which 
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006UL00R6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006UL00R6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">Amazon
link</a>) ain’t cheap but I don’t regret a penny in this case.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Scooters are generally a low-cost pretty-green way to get around town.  And
some of the little Vespas and so on are just drop-dead cute. But then there’s
this. Can anyone identify it? Because I want one. Expand the picture and check out the handlebars.</p>
<img src="DSCF2562.png" alt="White scooter parked near Shibuya" />
<p>Another F1.4 and there was enough light to dial that back and I should have,
because a little more depth-of-field would have helped.  But hey, I screwed up
and the camera (mostly) saved me.</p>
<p>Here’s another look.</p>

<p>I’m a color guy; but some pictures cry out for B&amp;W.  These are both

<p>(This is another in a series provoked by a Tokyo visit with a new camera;
for more on that see
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">Fujifilm X-E1</a>.)</p>
<hr/>
<p>This first picture in among the trees at the center of 
<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ll=35.691282,139.748833&amp;spn=0.007459,0.012274&amp;sll=49.257735,-123.123904&amp;sspn=0.191806,0.392761&amp;t=w&amp;hq=Kitanomaru+park&amp;radius=15000&amp;z=17">this
map</a>,
and while it’s not quite as magical as the picture looks, it’s a pretty nice
bit of greenery, a rare thing in the heart of Tokyo.</p>
<img src="DSCF2426.png" alt="Stairs in Kitanomaru Park, Tokyo" />
<p>I have to say the color version was pretty nice too; but this wins. 
Yes, it’s somewhat overprocessed; in particular, the ghostly effect is the
awesome power of
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2010/03/03/Clarity-Slider">negative Lightroom
clarity</a>.  But this sort of trickery won’t come off unless you have a
high-quality, 
data-dense file coming out of your camera. More testimony to the X-E1’s
excellent handling of complexity.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is just a shadow on some gravel. I felt bad because none of the
worth-keeping Tokyo pictures were of trees. That’s partly because they’re not
one of the city’s strong points; but at least I have evidence that they
exist.</p>
<img src="DSCF2428.png" alt="Treeshadow on gravel in Kitanomaru park" />
<p>Frankly, this doesn’t belong in a camera review; it could probably have been
captured nearly as well on a cellphone.</p>

<p>The event that took me to Tokyo with a
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">new camera</a>
was in Chiyoda, which is to say right next

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Imperial_Palace#East_Garden">East
Garden</a> itself. Pictures today from the latter.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The history of Japan is full of wars, mostly in a feudal flavor; all these
walls and battlements and fortifications weren’t built for decoration. Doesn’t mean
they don’t look good.  These are the East gates.</p>
<img src="DSCF2465.png" alt="East gates of the garden of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo" />
<p>I confess, this photo had to be fixed up a little. The spring sun on the
trees other side of the gate was overpowering, brilliant.  Lightroom gives you
the tools to fix that, but they’re no good if the file coming out of the
camera doesn’t have the raw material.  Which in this case was no problem.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I got up close to those doors and discovered that some parts are a
lot newer than others.</p>
<img src="DSCF2506.png" alt="Imperial Palace gates close-up" />
<p>I actually had to dial back the blue tint in the new ironwork to make it
look like I saw it, and I feel a little guilty about that because I think maybe the
camera was right and my memory is wrong.</p>
<p>I kept zooming in to admire the textures of the wood and iron and thought
maybe the color was getting in the way.</p>
<img src="DSCF2505.png" alt="Imperial Palace gates close-up, monochrome" />
<p>I think I might blow that up real big and hang it on a wall somewhere.</p>

<p>On Day Two of the
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">new-camera</a>-in-Tokyo trail
let’s move gradually from people to geometry.  Because any city has lots of
that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is from the 20th floor, at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitotsubashi_University">Hitotsubashi
University</a> looking down over the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainichi_Shimbun">Mainichi</a> building;
in the background are some of the Imperial Palace gardens (more to come from
there).  I said “gradually” and yep, if you blow this up you will in fact spot
a few people.</p>
<p>I wonder what the guys on the rooftop
are up to; on a really big screen with the full-rez photo, it’s clear that
they’re pretty well-dressed, i.e. probably not maintenance folk.  Maybe
they just stepped outside for a smoke.</p>
<img src="DSCF2386.png" alt="View over Mainichi into the Imperial Palace gardens" />
<p>There’s this thing I keep saying about the X-E1 and how nicely it handles
pictures of big objects with lots of details. See?</p>
<p>I had to do a bit of photoprocessing because at the top of the photo, the
pollution had really bleached out the buildings and trees. So Lightroom’s
brush tool came in very handy in applying some contrast-and-blacks boost.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is a grungy canal in the same neighborhood; I liked the reflections
and light rays. I wonder what, if anything, lives in these central-city canals?
Given Tokyo’s pervasive drinking problem I bet citizens fall in
regularly. My skin crawls at the thought.</p>
<img src="DSCF2460.png" alt="Canal in Chiyoda" />
<p>I wanted to freeze the ripples so I twisted the shutter-speed dial but
didn’t look closely enough so ended up with 1/500.  To compensate, the
camera picked F1.4 and ISO 400. I would probably boosted the ISO for more DoF
but, well anyhow, the other thing I’ve said a few times now that this is a
forgiving little handful of metal and glass.</p>

<p>So, I took the
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/03/06/Fuji-X-E1-in-Tokyo">new camera</a> to
Tokyo and came back with pictures, which will inhabit this space for the next
few days.
For most, I’m not gonna claim they’re
“typical”; but these are. If you’re going to show the truth about 東京, it
has to be people. Because its buildings and cars and streets and so on
are mostly nothing special, but the people who live among them are.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Not far from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimbashi_Station">Shimbashi
station</a> and it’s 10PM or so.  
I won’t claim this is a good picture, but I will argue that it’s
what Tokyo street-life is really, really like; do me a favor and enlarge
it. 
For the full effect add an extreme 
soundtrack: two or three lo-fi music channels crosscutting the machine
racket.  Mobile talk/walk, <i>check</i>. Construction,
<i>check</i>. Overstaffing, <i>check</i>. Capricious display English,
<em>check</em>. Massive clutter, <em>check</em>. Not dark at night, <i>check</i>.</p>
<img src="DSCF2578.png" alt="Tokyo streetcorner" />
<p>I claimed that somehow this camera does well with
pictures that are overcrowded, and the above would be more evidence. I have no
coherent theory as to why, and anyhow the claim is æsthetic not quantitative.
All three pictures here at F1.4 via the

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>We’re pushing the notion that sites should do “Federated Identity”; 
that those “Sign in with Facebook/Google/Twitter/whoever” badges you see
everywhere are A Good Thing.  And indeed they are.  But it’s exposing a subtle
problem.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Background</h2>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking to people who are (in the jargon) “RPs”,
where the initials stand for “Relying Party” and mean someone who relies on an
Identity Provider (“IDP” in the jargon) to take care of login/logout.</p>
<p>It’s increasingly easy to set up Federated Login
with an IDP, and as
<a href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> stabilizes, 
there’ll be room for a real standards-based RP/IDP
ecosystem. OpenID Connect is easy to implement for an RP; I know this because
I’ve done it.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>One thing I hear over and over, when I’m talking to RPs, is “How do I force
re-authentication?”  A bit of background is in order. The way being an RP works
is that you do a browser redirect over to the IDP, in effect asking “Is this
the person they say they are?”
If you do this with Facebook or Google or whoever, and if
the person is already logged in via that browser, most times the IDP will just
come back and say “Yep, they’re authenticated” without pestering the user.</p>
<p>But some RPs want to make the IDP re-authenticate, that is to say make the
person at the browser type in a password and maybe do the 2-factor thing too.
Because they’re about to do something really meaningful, involving money or
privacy or whatever.
For example, I was recently talking to some people from a well-known newspaper
that wanted to force re-auth when their journalists accessed the internal
publishing system from outside the firewall.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Why Is That a Problem?</h2>
<p>Well, one of the key advantages Federated Identity is cutting down the
number of times people have to type in passwords. There are a bunch of good
reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every time it happens, that’s another chance for password
theft.</p></li>
<li><p>We don’t want to get people into the habit of typing IDP passwords in
here and there; that habit is a great big red target sign saying “Phish
me!”</p></li>
<li><p>Typing passwords all the time is a painful user experience,
particularly on mobile devices.</p></li>
<li><p>The easiest way to reduce that pain is to use a short, simple,
password, probably the same one you’re using everywhere
including on your easily-hacked kid’s-Little-League site.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So yeah, I suppose the RP might be (slightly) increasing the security
locally by forcing re-auth in some situation or another.  But they’re globally
reducing the security of the whole password ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>What To Do?</h2>
<p>Well, an IDP can just say “No, you can’t do that.”  But that doesn’t really
make me happy either.  If you’re providing a service, and someone using it
says “I want to do X”, and you find yourself about to say “But you shouldn’t
want to do X” for any value of X, you should be nervous.</p>
<p>And then there’s the elephant in the room: Policy and Regulation. Quite
possibly it’s not the people running the RP system, it’s the lawyers saying
“Let’s be safe and make them re-authenticate.”  Because how could it be wrong
to be more careful?</p>
<p>And worse, maybe it’s the lawyers saying “The law says we <em>have to</em>
force re-authentication.”  Because when your lawyer says that, the argument is
usually pretty well over.</p>
<p>When I hear about this happening, more than once
the law in question has been
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>.
But it’s not alone. It’s really easy to pass a law forcing people to prove who
they are when they undertake certain transactions. Because how could it be
wrong to be more careful?</p>
<p>Arrgh.</p>

<p>What happened was, this month includes trips to Tokyo and the Big Island.
And lately I’ve been reading about 
cameras full of shiny new ideas.  So I decided to indulge myself; here are
way too many words about the state of cameras in general and in particular the
one I bought.</p>
<p>I suppose this is partly a review of the X-E1, but if you want to know the
most important thing (what kind of pictures it takes) just follow the blog for
the next week or two.  I’ll do a pictures-from-Tokyo series that covers a lot
of different photographic styles.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Once We Called EVIL</h2>
<p>For a while there, everything was either a point-&amp;-shoot (meh) or an SLR
(good); SLRs compete in a nice linear
way around megapixels and sensitivity and ergonomics and
lenses.</p>
<img src="DSCF2350.png" alt="Aerial shot of mountains not far from Anchorage, Alaska" />
<div class='caption'><p>Near Anchorage, Alaska.  
The X-E1 seems to
like taking<br/>pictures of big things. A jpg with the 18-55mm zoom. The
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">image resizer</a> introduced odd color artifacts;
click to see the real thing.</p></div>
<p>SLRs are fat-bodied because you need
a big glass prism to bend the light from the lens to
the viewfinder.  If you lose the prism, you free camera designers from a bunch
of constraints. Most obviously, you can have smaller thinner bodies
that are friendlier to hand and handbag.</p>
<p>Of course, you still need to see what you’re shooting. One
approach is the traditional optical rangefinder, as in the
<a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/photography/m_system/m_new/">Leica
M</a>; a little window through the camera that looks out beside,
not through, the main lens.</p> 
<p>Or you can take what the sensor is seeing and route it
electronically to a
screen on the back of the camera, or to a viewfinder
you hold up to your eye, or both.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, serious cameras which have managed to
lose the prism are now called “compact format”.
For a while, it looked like we’d say “EVIL”, for
Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens, but that didn’t quite catch on; a
pity.</p> 
<img src="DSCF2455.png" alt="Tokyo subway corridor" />
<div class='caption'><p>Duncan Davidson
<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/blog/2013/01/converge/">used the London underground</a> to
showcase the RX1, so here’s a little Tokyo tube.  Raw/35mm,
as are all the rest from here on in; once I put the prime on, I had no urge to
go back.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-5'>Sidebar: Presbyopia</h2>
<p>This is the condition lots of us get in middle age, where you can see fine
at a distance but hardly at all up close; so you wear reading glasses. With
the glasses on, it’s hard to use a viewfinder.  With them off, it’s
hard to use the screen on the back of the camera.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Compact Options</h2>
<p>The Leica M is for those willing to spend $5K and way up
on a camera that doesn’t work with telephotos, doesn’t
autofocus, and doesn’t have very good low-light performance.  But which,
everyone agrees, can take wonderful pictures.</p>
<p>The next big run at the format was 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system">Micro Four
Thirds</a>,
which has produced a bunch of sanely-priced 
well-reviewed compacts and an interesting selection of lenses.</p>
<p>In the last year or so, things have gone nuts.  Sony is expanding the
boundaries of the camera-with-a-zoom-that-fits-in-your-pocket with its
<a href="http://store.sony.com/p/Sony-Cyber-shot-DSC-RX100-Camera/en/p/DSCRX100/B">RX100</a>. And at the same time shipping the much-ballyhooed
<a href="http://store.sony.com/p/Sony-Cyber-shot-RX1-Full-Frame-35mm-Digital-Camera/en/p/DSCRX1/B">RX1</a>, with a monster
sensor and fixed lens in a smaller-than-SLR body.</p>
<p>Olympus and Panasonic keep muscling forward with µ4/3-ware, recently
including the
<a href="http://olympusomd.com/">OM-D</a>, which made several camera reviewers
unreasonably happy.</p>
<p>And Fuji has launched the X line, combining retro design flavors with an
interesting new sensor layout and really tasty lens offerings.</p>
<p>So I decided to get Something New and take it
along to Tokyo and Hawai’i.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Camera Shopping</h2>
<p>Like everyone else, I admire the beauty of the Leicas and the astounding
lenses you can get for them, but the prices are absurd and they’re a poor fit
for my love of shooting at night.</p>
<img src="DSCF2462.png" alt="Outside the Imperial Palace East garden" />
<div class='caption'><p>This is on the footbridge
over the moat to the East Garden of the<br/>Imperial Palace, which is often
open to the public.  I love the textures and cracks in the wooden base.</p></div>
<p>The RX100 seems excellent, but my Canon S100 has a generally similar lens
and performance curve. The RX100 has a lot more pixels but I’m not sure I need
them; the Canon has enough to 
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2012/09/06/The-Big-Picture">print 40 inches
tall</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are all those interesting new µ4/3 products, and I’ve been
particularly tempted by the nifty Olympuses. But I didn’t like the way an
OM-D E-M5 felt in my hand, and its low-light performance isn’t quite up there
with the best. </p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Sony RX1?</h2>
<p>The whole camera world has been a-quiver about this puppy;
an unbelievably-huge sensor in a beautifully-built little body with a
remarkable lens.</p>
<p>Tempting, and the notion of a fixed lens is appealing; my K-5 has sort of
turned into one of those, with the remarkable
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?as_q=sigma+30mm&amp;as_sitesearch=tbray.org">Sigma 30mm F1.4</a> more or less permanently
mounted.  Which is a nice combo, but not lightweight at all; that Sigma
is a great big honking chunk of metal and glass.  And all my other nice Pentax
lenses are languishing.</p>
<img src="DSCF2493.png" alt="Spring blossoms" />
<div class='caption'><p>The macro mode is really very competent, and the bokeh
does a pretty good job of getting a busy background out of the way here.
These are the first tree-blossoms of spring in the garden of the Imperial
Palace, which is to say powerful cultural signifiers.  There were a lot of
dudes with seriously heavyweight camera gear hovering around them.</p></div>
<p>But when I got my hands on an RX1, it didn’t quite work for me.  It’s not
actually that small, by no means a pocket camera. My hands didn’t particularly
like it.  And since it doesn’t come with a viewfinder (see
<a href="#p-5">presbyopia</a>), I’d need my glasses on.
Unless I splash out for the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009UOI9QY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009UOI9QY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">absurdly expensive add-on viewfinder</a>, which
sticks up awkwardly atop the camera.  And speaking of absurdly-expensive,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CXFCC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0097CXFCC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">so’s the camera</a>.</p>
<p>Also my heart sank at the thought of waiting for Lightroom to grind
through 24MP raw files.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Fujifilm</h2>
<p>The
<a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/">X series</a> 
was launched a year ago; they please the eye, have clever viewfinders, and the
<a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/xf_lens/roadmap/">XF 
lens lineup</a> looks tasty.</p>
<p>Also they’re using a 
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x-e1/3">novel sensor
implementation</a> that lets them drop the anti-aliasing filter, which should,
all else being equal, buy some extra sharpness.</p>
<p>So I dropped by
<a href="http://www.leoscamera.com/">Leo’s Camera Supply</a> and ended up
leaving with an X-E1, the 35mm F1.4 prime, and the 18-55mm zoom, not terribly
fast but image-stabilized.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Nice Things About the X-E1</h2>
<p>The viewfinder is just brilliant.  If I have my glasses on I can compose
on the back of the camera.  If I don’t, I put the viewfinder to my eye; it’s
got a proximity sensor and lights up automatically.  The visual
readout in the viewfinder is very good, and it’s got a diopter
adjustment for less-than-perfect eyes.</p>
<p>The ergonomics are nifty; there’s no mode dial! The aperture and
shutter speed are visible at a glance and on manual dials, looking down at the
camera top. If both are 
on “A”, you’re in full-auto mode. If you set the shutter speed you’re in 
shutter-priority, if you set the F-stop, you’re in Aperture priority, if you
set both, you’re in manual.  Which makes the mode dials on most SLRs feel kind
of superfluous and stupid.</p>
<img src="IMG_1685.png" alt="Fujifilm X-E1 controls" />
<p>The menus aren’t that great but you’ll never need to use them.  There’s a
button marked “Q” that brings up a grid of the most commonly-used settings.
It’s stupidly quick and easy to twiddle what you need to.</p>
<p>It’s a bit lighter than my K-5, and both the prime &amp; zoom are a
<em>lot</em> lighter than their counterparts.  In particular, the X-E1/35mm
combo is really a treat to hold in your hand, or to sling over your shoulder
for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Below from left to right: Canon S100, X-E1 (with the 35mm F1.4), and K-5 (with that Sigma). The Pentax and Fuji are
about the same width, but the Fuji (and its lens) are smaller along every
other dimension.</p>
<img src="IMG_1677.png" alt="Canon S100, Fujifilm X-E1, Pentax K-5" />
<p>And that 35mm F1.4 lens is a peach.</p>
<p>The camera makes outstanding JPGs, creamy-smooth and with great
white-balance guessing. I shoot raw anyhow because I <em>like</em> fiddling
with pictures in Lightroom (had to install the 4.4 beta), but you probably
don’t really need to, and in some low-light shots the camera might do a better
job at noise reduction than Lightroom.</p> 
<img src="DSCF2509.png" alt="Tokyo canal still life" />
<div class='caption'><p>This decidedly unglamorous canal is near Hitotsubashi
and I bet the sun doesn’t get in like this very often.  I hate to go all
abstract and hand-wavey, but it seems like the X-E1 excels at making sense of
scenes that have <em>a lot of stuff</em> in them.</p></div>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problems</h2>
<p>Some of those manual controls need to be quite a bit stiffer; I kept
turning macro-mode on by accident, and also once or twice knocked the aperture
dial from auto to F16, which you really don’t want.</p>
<p>There’s more noise at ISO6400 than my K-5 produces. Having said that, you
can fix that in the mix these days in Lightroom.</p>
<p>I see a bit of a tendency for the image highlights to be a little too
out-of-proportion bright. But never overloaded, you can pull ’em back just
fine while raw-processing.</p>
<img src="DSCF2520.png" alt="Tokyo towers in Shiodome" />
<div class='caption'><p>This is in the Shiodome neighborhood, taken from my
hotel room.  Once again, big things.</p></div>
<p>The viewfinder is a little laggy if you’re moving the camera fast, it’s
jarring the first few times that happens and would be a real problem if you
were trying to shoot sports.</p>
<p>The shutter is not significantly quieter than my 3-year-old K-5, which I
find disappointing. And the autofocus isn’t any faster either.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Image Quality</h2>
<p>Watch the blog, there are more coming.  Also, I’ve starting making the big
versions of photos (what you see when you click on the image here) much
larger. Which may itself say something about this camera.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Smiles</h2>
<p>There’s nothing like being on the road with a new camera in a visually rich
place for making you want to shoot.  I came home from Tokyo with
sixty-odd pictures worth keeping, and since my hit/miss ratio isn’t any
better than anyone else’s, that’s a lot of pictures I took in only three
days.</p>
<p>This camera, it’s fun.</p>

<p>Here’s an odd sentence made of special words:
<i>The Web can do big things for little people and little things for big; 
we think it’s really pretty good right now.</i>
In related news, this blog is ten years old today.</p>
<p>On
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/27/">February 27, 2003</a>, I told the
world about this project.  (Some readers might be entertained by
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/02/28/Watching">Is This Thing
On?</a> — written the next day, about bringing up a new blog back then.)</p>
<p>That odd sentence includes only words from among the one hundred
most commonly used in <span class='o'>ongoing</span> since 2003; including almost all that aren’t just
grammatical auxiliaries.</p>
<p>The words found here to date total somewhat
over 1,555,000.  Monocasing and sorting yields 
just over 39,000 unique items; stemming and omitting proper nouns
would cut that by a factor of two or more. It’s nice to be a citizen
of the big, messy, vigorous, English language.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Thank You</h2>
<p>I mean <em>you</em>, the person reading this.  Not in the mass, collectively,
abstractly; but you right now, you who are spending your time to read 
what I, right now, am writing.</p>
<p>The evidence above shows I have plenty of words, 
but not enough to express my debt.  This blog here has found me jobs,
made me friends, taken me places I wouldn’t have gone, shown me things I
wouldn’t have seen, and
taught me loads of things I wouldn’t have learned. Because when you talk
to the world it talks back; listening is a higher privilege than talking.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Patterns</h2>
<p>The
<a href="/ongoing/When/">date grid</a> doesn’t lie; I blog less often now.
Some reasons are obvious (Twitter, G+) but
then there’s history.  When I started this thing I’d already had a couple of
careers spanning a couple of decades, so I could coast along mining the
findings and the war stories.  Those stories have been told now,
mostly, so anything I place here has to be actually <em>new</em>, from life
as it happens.</p> 
<p>Fortunately lots happens, Google and Google and Google and the family and
the house and the cabin and the boat and the cameras. </p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Technology</h2>
<p>The
<a href="/ongoing/misc/Colophon">stuff that holds this Web ranch</a> together,
I mean. Glue and string and ad-hockery, multilingual and messy.</p>
<p>And so very educational, writing it and keeping it running.
I’m not proud of it because I know it too well; feels as much a part of me
as my knees or opinions.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Advice</h2>
<p>Hahaha, this is a podium so I get to preach sometimes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write about things while you’re learning them; by the time you’re an
expert it’s too late to start.</p></li>
<li><p>Write long phrases then shorten them.</p></li>
<li><p>Long sentences are OK though.</p></li>
<li><p>Sweat the typography.</p></li>
<li><p>Use fewer commas.</p></li>
<li><p>Use semicolons.</p></li>
<li><p>Be intense.</p></li>
<li><p>Be brief.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And most important of all, ignore everything social-media hacks
say about building your audience. It’s not that they’re wrong, but as
soon as your goal is “building your audience” it’s over;  You’re corrupted and
you’ve lost.</p>

<p>You know that
<a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/">Android
Versions dashboard</a>? It matters less and less for developers.
And it’s been
irritating me for months now that the mobile-device commentariat apparently
hasn’t 
noticed. I’m hoping
<a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/">today’s news</a> will help make my point.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some recent history.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>September 2012</h2>
<p>The debut of
<a href="http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html">Google Play services</a> brought
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/09/google-play-services-and-oauth-identity.html">OAuth 2.0 capabilities</a> to apps running on <em>all compatible devices back to
release 2.2</em> (Froyo).</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>December 2012</h2>
<p>Google Play services release 2 brought 
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/12/new-google-maps-android-api-now-part-of.html">major
Maps-API improvements</a>
to apps on <em>all compatible devices back to
2.2</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>February 26, 2013</h2>
<p>Release 3 of Google Play services brought a 
<a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2013/02/google-sign-in-now-part-of-google-play.html">major revamp of the Google+ API</a> to apps on <em>all
compatible devices back to 2.2</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>How It Works</h2>
<p>Google Play services is an APK, an Android app that can be released several
times a year (look at that history) and be pushed to all those compatible
devices via Play.  To an immensely huge number of handsets and tablets in a
remarkably short period of time.</p>
<p>Inside that APK are all the new goodies: So far, OAuth, Maps, and
Google+. To use them, 
Android developers fetch a little library from the
<a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/sdk-manager.html">SDK
Manager</a> and make calls through it to the code in the Play services
APK.</p>
<p>And their code will run on
<em>all compatible devices back to 2.2</em>.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>That Rhythm</h2>
<p>New software goodies for Android no longer have to be packaged in
blasts named after desserts that take
years to build market share.  They’ve been coming out in regular releases 
of Google Play services, (pardon me, I’m going to say it again) 
available on  
<em>all compatible devices back to
2.2</em>.</p>
<p>And this happens without needing any support effort from telephone
companies or device makers.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>Dear Mobile-Industry Experts</h2>
<p>Yeah, if what you care about is new smoother glass and slicker chips and
faster broadband, you’re still on the dessert schedule.  But if what matters is
what apps can do, you can pretty well ignore that Versions dashboard.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>When ordinary non-geek people find out I’m in the biz, I often hear “I’m
going to dump
the dumbphone and get something slick. Should I get an Apple or an Android?”</p><p>This question is getting harder and harder to answer.
Here are some things I used to say.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>“Movies, Music, Media? Apple”</h2>
<p>This remains a little bit true; the world’s still playing catch-up with
Apple’s media ecosystem.  But it is catching up; Amazon and Google are both
investing hugely in providing low-friction soup-to-nuts offerings, and really
want to be your books/music/movie store.</p>
<p>And I don’t see how Apple has a moat here, some special secret sauce that
the competition won’t be able to match.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>“Live in Gmail &amp; Calendar &amp; Docs? Android”</h2>
<p>Yeah, but becoming less true. The Googlers who build iOS apps are damn
talented; 
Gmail is pretty great on iDevices and I assume those guys have their eyes on
all the other pieces of that puzzle.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>“Love Games? Apple”</h2>
<p>Not any more, I don’t think.  I guess a few games ship
on iOS first, but for most people’s purposes, there’s rough platform parity.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>“Use Maps a Lot? Android”</h2>
<p>Well, that <em>used</em> to be true.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>“Industrial-design junkie?  Apple”</h2>
<p>I suppose, and clearly the last couple of generations of iPhone are among
the most beautiful pieces of electronics anyone’s ever built.  But, um, I’m
sort of bored; I want Mr Ive to surprise the world again.</p>
<p>And some of the recent HTC handsets are to die for.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>“Stingy? Android”</h2>
<p>True in the tablet space, for sure. But if you’re cash-challenged and still
want an iPhone, you can get the previous generation for not very much at all,
and there’s a big used-iPhone ecosystem too.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>“Image-conscious? Apple”</h2>
<p>Fair enough: a high proportion of the world’s hippest people still
carry iPhones.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>“Want more space? Android”</h2>
<p>Yep. When I’ve handled an iPhone 5, I’ve been wowed by the manufacturing
quality and the extreme responsiveness.  But if you’re used to a recent
top-end Android, the screen is just too small.</p>
<h2 id='p-9'>And Your Point Is?</h2>
<p>The ecosystem is leveling out. It’s hard to find a slam-dunk argument, for
any particular person, why they should go for A rather than A.
Which is to say, handset competition is
maybe becoming (dare I say it) sort of boring.</p>
<h2 id='p-10'>“Want to Play Ingress?”</h2>
<p>Android.</p>

 <summary type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>I just learned (maybe everyone else already knew) that it&#x2019;s legal to have duplicate keys in JSON text.  But please don&#x2019;t.</div></summary>
<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>I just learned (maybe everyone else already knew) that it’s legal
to have duplicate keys in JSON text.  But please don’t.</p>
<p>There are three definitions of JSON.  The lovely graphical one at
<a href="http://www.json.org/">json.org</a>,
the less lovely monospaced ASCII in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC 4627</a>, and
<a href="http://es5.github.com/x15.12.html">Section 15.12</a> of ECMAScript
5.1.</p>
<p>json.org says nothing about duplicate keys. RFC 4627 (section 2.2), says
“The names within an object SHOULD be unique.”  ECMAScript (15.12.2) says
“<b>NOTE</b> In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an
object, lexically preceding values for the same key shall be overwritten.”</p>
<p>So I guess this is legal:</p>
<pre><code>{ "key":"a345", "key":"b678" }</code></pre>
<p>Gag. Blecch. Puke.
It seems that different software implementations do different things; I
guess the last-dupe-wins ECMAScript behavior is the most common, but one hears
of JSON parsers that blow up when encountering dupes.</p>
<p>Like many others, I’ve been using JSON for nearly all my new
Net-protocol work for years. I haven’t been bitten by this, but I gather
some have.</p> 
<p>Anyhow, I think most reasonable people will agree: <em>Encountering
duplicate keys in incoming JSON is evidence of insanity on the other end of
the line.</em> There’s
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/json/current/maillist.html">serious consideration</a>, 
over in the IETF, of maybe redoing the RFC to say this in a stern voice (plus
a few other little clean-ups).  I’m not sure whether that’s worth doing, but
probably more people need to be aware of this little duplicate-keys gotcha.</p>
