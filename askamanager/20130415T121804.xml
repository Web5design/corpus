				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. I just found out my coworker will be taking over my job in a year</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently accepted a one-year grant funded position at a university. The position requires a lot of irregular hours, travel, relationship building, and use of my personal network. I was told it was a one-year position because there was no guarantee the grant would be renewed.</em></p>
<p><em>When reading through the documents about the grant, I discovered that it actually ends in 2017. I inquired about this, and my manager, who turned red, said that after one year my position will be taken over by my current coworker &#8212; the one who actually applied for the grant. The grant she currently works under ends this year and thus she can secure employment by taking over the grant I was hired under &#8212; leaving me out of a job. I feel deceived. Everytime I do well on the job, this coworker looked jealous &#8212; well, now I understand why ! I certainly don&#8217;t feel like throwing all my resources into this program just to have it transferred to my coworker next year. Plus, how do I explain this to new employers? I can&#8217;t exactly say that the grant ends in a year because it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Wow. It would certainly be reasonable to go back to your manager and tell her that you&#8217;re disappointed that she wasn&#8217;t honest with you about the plans for the grant. What a horrible lack of integrity on her side.</p>
<p>But as for what to do tell prospective employers, you can simply say that it&#8217;s always been intended as a one-year position &#8230; since apparently it has been.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is this line okay in a cover letter?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve seen plenty of sample cover letters in which the author says, &#8220;I&#8217;m writing to apply for the position of __. I am confident that my training and experience in math, fast food, and child rearing will enable me to contribute significantly in this position.&#8221; To me, the second sentence offers a reason why anyone should read my cover letter and provides something of an outline of what is coming. However, at least one hiring person (in an academic context anyway) said that he does not like such statements. He will decide for himself if I would contribute to his department. Is this initial &#8220;sales&#8221; line good or bad?</em></p>
<p>Yep, I agree with your source &#8212; those sorts of lines are bad. They&#8217;re too much telling me that you&#8217;ll be good and not enough SHOWING me that you&#8217;ll be good. And plus, when I don&#8217;t know you or have any idea how reliable your self-assessments are, I put exactly zero weight on your belief that you&#8217;ll do well in the position, so it&#8217;s just a line taking up space, and doing so in a kind of cheesy, mildly annoying way.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can I suggest I take on two jobs at my current company for more money?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am salaried and work in customer service at a small company (15 people). My company just put out a job ad for a different department. They want to hire a part-timer who would work 10-20 hours a week. With a bit of shuffling of my daily routine, I could devote enough time to fill the needs of that position without taking away from my current duties. With the hourly pay they listed in the ad, they would be paying the part-timer somewhere around $10k per year. Would it be acceptable to set up a meeting with the owner (my manager) explaining that I would like to adopt the part-time job and would be willing to work early or late to finish the tasks for something like a $7k raise in salary?</em></p>
<p>If they want someone who will work up to 20 hours a week, they&#8217;re unlikely to think that you can do that on top of your current job without compromising one or both of the positions. In other words, you might be able to do both, but it&#8217;s unlikely that you, as one person, can do both jobs as well as two people would be able to.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> potentially propose that you could do a smaller portion of what&#8217;s currently planned for the part-time job, plus an abbreviated portion of your current position, but you won&#8217;t look realistic if you suggest doing both as they&#8217;re currently envisioned.</p>
<p><strong>4. Explaining why I&#8217;m leaving nonprofits</strong></p>
<p><em>I would like your opinion about communicating a desire to leave the nonprofit sector. I began my career at what I thought were high-stress jobs and desperately wanted a low-key job. I have had that at a nonprofit now for more than three years, but the problem is &#8220;low key&#8221; means no one is motivated or held accountable! I have a tremendous amount of self-motivation and see that I need a work environment with slightly more competition and room for professional growth. I also am much better at managing my stress, so that would not be a problem for me anymore and I can focus on developing a career at one company.</em></p>
<p><em>Another factor is the cause I work on. It has become important to me, but I want to distance myself from it because it&#8217;s weighing on me more personally the longer I work here. I also cannot see myself making local nonprofits my career like the people I meet at conferences.</em></p>
<p><em>I know many people would love to work at a nonprofit, which makes me wonder how it looks to a hiring manager to see someone looking to leave a locally well-known nonprofit agency for a higher-stress job that is far less philanthropic. It was easy for me to say I wanted to &#8220;do good&#8221; and work at a nonprofit, but how do I say I want to do good as a donor or volunteer and not an employee anymore?</em></p>
<p>Well, first of all, not all nonprofits are low-key, so let&#8217;s not tar them all with that brush. You can absolutely find nonprofits that are fast-paced, rigorous, and hold people to a high bar. (Just like you can also find slow-paced, poorly managed organizations in any sector.)</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as how to explain this to future employers, it&#8217;s not like you built a career in nonprofits that you&#8217;re now leaving; you worked at one job in the sector. You&#8217;re unlikely to face demands about why you don&#8217;t want to do good anymore, but if you&#8217;re questioned about it, you can simply say, &#8220;I really enjoyed working at ABC, but I&#8217;m ready for something new, and the position with you excites me because ____.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like you would if you were leaving any job in any sector. And you&#8217;re better off looking at it that way yourself too, rather than writing off the entire nonprofit sector on the basis of one bad organization.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I disclose freelance work to a new employer, and a new job to my freelance clients?</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m a freelancer and am interviewing for full-time jobs. I have one or two freelance projects that I have to see through to the end, which will take 2-3 months. If I do take a full-time job, should I tell the employer about the projects I’m finishing up and/or the freelance client that I’m taking a full-time job? If yes, what should I say to either party?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no need to tell the new employer that you&#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks finishing up freelance projects, unless they have a conflict of interest or other policy that would require you to disclose it. I would, however, let your clients know that you&#8217;re taking a full-time job so that they know that you won&#8217;t be available for further work after their current projects are wrapped up (and so they understand that you&#8217;ll have a new schedule for the remainder of these projects).</p>
<p><strong>6. Finding jobs working from home</strong></p>
<p><em>Abbreviated version of my story for you- I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1996 when I was 24 years old. I had just graduated from college with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. I went through many rough years but am doing pretty good health wise now with one caveat &#8212; I can not drive.</em></p>
<p><em>I have been active in volunteer work, kept up to date on technology, got a certification in Religious Studies, and currently teach one night a week at a local parish. Here is my conundrum &#8212; I am bored. I have been working part-time jobs from home and close to my home for the past 6 years that are below my capabilities. Obviously I understand I am limited but it is hard to work at minimum wage jobs and I feel like I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;career.&#8221; I am currently expanding my knowledge in blogging, writing, looking for other at-home opportunities &#8212; anything I can do from home to supplement or replace what I am doing now . Have you any advice for work-at-homers/disabled to expand from the call center trap? I don&#8217;t want to seem unappreciative, I know I am lucky in my situation. There just seem to be other options!</em></p>
<p>In my experience, it&#8217;s hard to get legitimate work-from-home jobs unless you&#8217;ve already been working for the employer previously, but maybe that&#8217;s changing. I&#8217;ll throw this out to readers to see if anyone has good suggestions for you.</p>
<p><strong>7. I don&#8217;t think my new job is the right fit</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you do if you are a few weeks into a new job and concerned that it may be a bad fit? Among the issues I&#8217;m concerned about are: (1) I seem to be spending way more time than I would like on a certain part of my job when I was told that my duties would be more spread-out, (2) commute is wearing heavily on me, and (3) company culture is not what I was hoping for.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it better to cut my losses now and leave (potentially omitting this job from my resume altogether)? Or should I stick it out and maybe move on a year if I&#8217;m still not happy? Does your answer change if I say that my last few jobs have had relatively short tenures due to family moves and companies going out of business?</em></p>
<p>It depends on (a) how miserable you are, and (b) how long it&#8217;s likely to take you to get another offer (which you hopefully know based on how long it took you to get this one). But yes, the fact that your last few jobs have been short-term is a point in favor of staying &#8212; but not for a year; you&#8217;d need to stay for a few years to counteract the perception of job-hopping. Which might be a deal-breaker in a job you already don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>But jobs do often get better if you give them a chance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Sunday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. I told someone to get out of my spot during a break at work</strong></p>
<p><em>During coffee breaks at work, my coworkers and I all sit in a conference room if no one is using it. We all have our certain places where we sit and have sat for years. And there are certain people that you don&#8217;t mess with and you don&#8217;t sit in their spot.</em></p>
<p><em>A person who has been working in our office for a year sat in my spot and I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s my spot&#8221; and the person said that they had seniority because they were older and not because they had worked there longer. The chair had wheels on it, so I wheeled the person over one space and put a new chair in my spot and sat down. Later, the person came to my cubicle and said that they were embarrassed and thought that what I did was really rude. So I apologized and they left.</em></p>
<p><em>Now I wonder how bad was this really? I didn&#8217;t think it was big deal at the time, but I have been obsessing all day about this and wondering if what I did was really out of line and horrible. Should I be expecting anything else in the form of reprimand? Should I talk to this person again or just let it go? Should I not go back to coffee or will that make a mountain out of a mole hill?</em></p>
<p>Yes, that was rude. But you apologized and you don&#8217;t need to stop going to coffee over it, and you probably don&#8217;t need to apologize a second time. But all of you should chill out about owning your spots, because, come on, really?</p>
<p><strong>2. Can you mention that you&#8217;re excited about a job because it&#8217;s close to your house and family-friendly?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied for a position where the ad did not mention the name of the firm or location, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out it&#8217;s only 5 minutes drive away from my home &#8212; walking distance! I got an interview, and the manager emphasized how family-oriented they were and while they didn&#8217;t offer great benefits, they were flexible if you needed to leave early to bring kids to a doctor occasionally, etc. (they know I have kids as I mention it in my cover letter to explain a gap in my work history). In my thank-you note after the interview, I thanked them for the interview, mentioned a few business reasons why I think I would be great for the job, and then as a last sentence, how happy I would be to work for a family-oriented business that is so close to my home. My friend says I should not have mentioned it, as it sounds like I want the position for convenience&#8230; is she right? I would take the job even if it was further away, but the location is definitely a bonus.</em></p>
<p>Your friend is right. They want to hire someone who&#8217;s excited about the job for the job&#8217;s sake, not because of the commute or benefits. (And after all, what happens if they move to a different location?) In general, you want to stick to focusing on the job.</p>
<p><strong>3. Listing achievements at unrelated positions on your resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about listing older work positions I have held that do not contribute to the requirements of jobs I am presently applying for. Do I need to put bulleted accomplishments for those jobs or can I simply list the position and use the extra space for those positions that have much more relevant accomplishments? The positions I am applying for are early career level and I do not think it would benefit me to go beyond a one-page resume.</em></p>
<p>Focus on the jobs that are most relevant to the work you&#8217;re applying for. That doesn&#8217;t mean that other accomplishments aren&#8217;t relevant, though. If you can show a track record of achievement and getting things done, that&#8217;s always going to be a good thing, even if it&#8217;s in a different field.</p>
<p><strong>4. Working more hours than I&#8217;ve been authorized to work</strong></p>
<p><em>I just started working as temporary part-time job. I work 28 hours a week for four days a week. On my first day of work, I was told that I can&#8217;t have work more than 28 hours because then, they would have to do extra work in filing the needed papers to get paid. The bottom line is, it&#8217;s going to be more work for my supervisor, and she doesn&#8217;t want to deal with it.</em></p>
<p><em>In the two weeks that I have worked there, the amount of work that they want me to accomplish often exceeds 28 hours. So I tend to stay after hours to complete the tasks (it has happened about 3 days so far). I have been logging in my hours for all the hours I have worked, despite working over 28 hours. Seeing the upcoming projects as well as events that I am helping to manage, I will be staying a lot longer than 28 hours for the remaining time at this company. Moreover, I have had them contact me over the phone and email on the weekend and my day off to give me tasks. I want to do my job well, but I don&#8217;t want to compromise my time off to accomplish those tasks. How do I manage this situation? Should I only work during the time that I am paid for or do I work during my time to get those tasks done to show to my supervisors that I can do a good job?</em></p>
<p>First, stop working more than 28 hours/week, because you were explicitly told not to do that, so doing it anyway is a big deal. Second, talk to your manager and explain that the amount of work you&#8217;re being given would take more than 28 hours a week, and ask how she wants you to handle it. She may tell you to push certain projects back, or she may assign some work to someone else, or she may approve you to work more hours. But you cannot work more hours than you&#8217;ve been authorized without potentially getting into trouble when it&#8217;s caught. (And I can&#8217;t tell from your letter whether you&#8217;re reporting the hours or not; if you&#8217;re not, and you&#8217;re non-exempt, you could get the company into legal trouble because they&#8217;re legally required to pay you for all hours worked.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Resigning when my boss is out on medical leave</strong></p>
<p><em>My boss is on FMLA. He was out most of first quarter, came back for a couple weeks, and is out again. During this second leave, his surgery has been delayed, and now I realistically do not see him back until the end of Q2.</em></p>
<p><em>I have accepted an offer that starts in 6 weeks. Before the surgery delay, my plan had been to give my boss 2 weeks notice. I&#8217;ve seen him show people the door, but I haven&#8217;t seen anyone at my level resign. We&#8217;ve worked closely together, and it&#8217;s going to be a big surprise to him. I would say he&#8217;s been a mentor. I did not sign a non-compete, and I will be working for a privately held portion of the same company. My ongoing relationship is very important.</em></p>
<p><em>My new plan is to resign to the CEO, with more notice. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll show me the door. But my question is how to break this news to my current boss? And when? I don&#8217;t want to stress him out during a medical procedure, but this will be a big shock. Also, I&#8217;m not staying local &#8212; I&#8217;m moving cross country, so I can&#8217;t just wait and tell him when he gets back.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re almost certainly overestimating the impact this is going to have on your boss. It&#8217;s very, very unlikely that this is going to cause him stress during his medical procedure. People leave jobs all the time; it&#8217;s normal. He might be disappointed, but he&#8217;ll get over it. Just call him and tell him, and offer to do whatever you can to make the transition easy (although obviously be sensitive to his situation and don&#8217;t call him on the day of his surgery or while he&#8217;s on heavy painkillers afterwards &#8212; just like you presumably wouldn&#8217;t call him about any other work thing on those days).</p>
<p><strong>6. Relatives endorsing you on LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p><em>I have over 300 LinkedIn contacts, and am actively engaged in a job search. A small percentage of my contacts are my relatives, including my parents. Every now and then, my mother or one of her many cousins will endorse me for some skill or another. Does this make me look as bad as I think it does? On a related note, sometimes colleagues endorse me for skills, in what I believe is an attempt to have me return the favor. However, I rarely feel comfortable returning the favor. Is it better to keep the peace and endorse someone I don&#8217;t believe in, or maintain some level of integrity?</em></p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t think anyone is paying much attention to LinkedIn endorsements, since they lack all credibility. Anyone can endorse you for anything, whether they know you and have worked with you or not. I wouldn&#8217;t spend your time endorsing people because it&#8217;s so worthless, but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about the source of your endorsements either. (For anyone unclear, we&#8217;re talking about skill endorsements here, not recommendations. Frankly, LinkedIn recommendations don&#8217;t carry a ton of weight either &#8212; as is true of any recommendation that the recommendee sees &#8212; but they&#8217;re not as ridiculous as skill endorsements.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Applying for a job after starting to volunteer</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently accepted a volunteer position at a company, but I have not actually started yet because of red tape. I am set to work in a department the company does not usually allow volunteers to work in, but the Volunteers Director obtained a special volunteer spot for me there because I have the qualifications that a typical employee there would have.</em></p>
<p><em>To be honest, I applied to be a volunteer because there were no openings for the job I am interested in at this company. However, the company recently posted a job listing for a position I have been coveting and has highly similar responsibilities as the volunteer position.</em></p>
<p><em>I am torn because with the job, I could be getting paid to do the same work I would be doing as an unpaid volunteer. But at the same time, I feel that if I apply for the job and get accepted, I would be making a really bad impression, not to mention betraying the director who made the special arrangements to get me into the department in the first place as a volunteer. Would it be considered &#8220;jumping ship&#8221; and inappropriate if I apply for the job instead of volunteering?</em></p>
<p>Go ahead and apply. If you&#8217;re the best person for the job, they&#8217;d almost certainly rather have you in that role than volunteering (for presumably far less hours and with less responsibility).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Asking for a far-off start date</strong></p>
<p><em>I have an interview coming up soon for a job that is a little over two hours away from where I currently live. The job site is in a popular beach location notorious for horrific traffic in the summer and there is no public transit on weekdays. So, I will have to move to take this job if offered.</em></p>
<p><em>I am anticipating they might ask me in the interview how quickly I could be ready to start and the truth is, the ideal time for me would probably be about 4-6 weeks from receiving the offer. This will give me time to find an affordable place to live, pack up my current place, and wrap up some volunteer work I am doing, as well as receive my tax refund to help pay the moving costs. However, if it&#8217;s going to make the difference between them hiring me or someone else, I *can* start earlier and just pay through the nose for a hotel until I find a cheap place. I can leave most of my belongings with a friend and live out of a suitcase. This would be a real hardship for me but one I&#8217;m willing to suffer if necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts on how I should answer the question if asked, and whether 4-6 weeks is a reasonable time to ask them to wait in these circumstances? Also, is there an appropriate way to say, &#8220;hey, if you guys want to give me an advance of $1,000 or so I can start in 3 days!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Say, &#8220;Because I&#8217;m moving, ideally I&#8217;d love to start 4-6 weeks from receiving an offer, but I do have some flexibility if you need someone more quickly than that. What kind of timeline are you hoping for?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t say that you can start within days if they give you an advance; most places do not do payroll advances for employees who haven&#8217;t even started working there yet (since you may not show up or work that full period).</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I take a lower salary when changing fields?</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to change careers from a science background to HR. I am currently in school for my Associates in Business Administration, but am chomping at the bit to get a job that will develop my business skills.</em></p>
<p><em>I have the opportunity to work for a staffing firm performing administrative tasks that really interest me and will add much needed experience to my resume. The problem is, the salary is much lower than my current salary. The wage is what the position is budgeted for; they didn&#8217;t drop the pay scale just because I&#8217;m a newbie to the industry. </em><em>My question is: when changing careers, should I expect to take a lower salary because I&#8217;m essentially starting fresh? I&#8217;ve put many resumes out there with no bites, and I know it&#8217;s because I need some serious experience. My current position offers few transferable skills.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you should expect to take a lower salary when changing careers and starting at the bottom. They&#8217;re not going to significantly raise the pay range for a junior position just because you have experience in an unrelated field.</p>
<p><strong>3. Addressing staff problems when you&#8217;re friends with your employees</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a manager of a small satellite office of six employees. I know that as manager I should not be friends with my coworkers, but our office is so small it is unavoidable. Also, I personally like to work in a fun, irreverent office so I foster that kind of culture. Typically it works out really well. Everyone has fun and works well together. But occasionally I have encountered incidents where my coworkers have crossed the line with me. For example, they feel like they can be curt or rude to me when they&#8217;re angry, which is something I would never do to my manager, no matter how close we are. How would you recommend handling that kind of situation, when I am walking the line between being a manager and a friend?</em></p>
<p><em>Is there any way other than directly addressing the problem with the coworker, which in the past has not worked particularly well? For some reason, when I&#8217;ve actually addressed behavior, it seems to cement the resentment.</em></p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re basically saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have an appropriate manager-managee relationship with my staff, except on some occasions when I want the benefits of it without the work.&#8221; If you <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/2011/10/28/hiring-managing-a-friend-proceed-with-caution/  ">blur the boundaries</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise that your staff thinks the boundaries have been blurred. And I can&#8217;t really let you get away with saying that this is &#8220;unavoidable&#8221; because it&#8217;s not, and plenty of other managers in small offices do manage to avoid it.</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re addressing issues head-on and &#8220;it&#8217;s not worked particularly well,&#8221; then you need to be firmer in your approach and you need to set and <em>enforce</em> consequences. And if you have people acting resentfully toward you, you need to address that too. You&#8217;re their manager &#8212; you need to act like it. Every day, not just when there&#8217;s something you want to address. And honestly, this isn&#8217;t really optional or something you get to decide not to do just because you prefer to run things differently. Unless you&#8217;re the owner of this business, you have an obligation to act like a manager, because that&#8217;s the job you&#8217;re being paid to do.</p>
<p><strong>4. Using a .edu email address when you didn&#8217;t graduate</strong></p>
<p><em>I am no longer a college student, but my school still lets me forward my .edu mail to my own email account. Now, I did not graduate. Is it okay to use this .edu address for job search/business? Also, I have a habit of changing email addresses and forgetting my passwords/security Q&amp;As. But I never forget my .edu login information. So, using this .edu address would be convenient. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s fine to use a .edu address in job-searching, and there&#8217;s no reason that you can&#8217;t use it just because you didn&#8217;t graduate. But find a better way to track your other passwords.</p>
<p><strong>5. Telling non-local employers I can only fly out once for interviews</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in the process of relocating, and I have had several phone interviews and a couple of face-to-face interviews. I come to town once I have at least four interviews set up. My last trip, the guy who was to interview me couldn&#8217;t make it, but I did get to interview with the HR rep. Now they are asking me to come back in a month once I get settled (I was looking to move in a month). My problem is that I can&#8217;t move without a job and I can&#8217;t continue to fly back and forth at $250-$350 each trip. I feel like these companies are acting like I just drove from 15 minutes way. How do I convey to potential employers that I need to interview all at once and that coming back and forth is too costly? I am not working now due to a recent layoff so I&#8217;m available but it&#8217;s not cheap.</em></p>
<p>You can certainly say, &#8220;Would it be possible to meet with everyone I&#8217;d need to meet with on this trip since I&#8217;m flying in from out of town?&#8221; But it might simply not be possible. Employers have different stages of interviews, and they might not decide until after round 1 who they&#8217;d like to meet with in round 2. Plus, keep in mind that many employers <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/08/22/how-to-conduct-a-long-distance-job-search  ">don&#8217;t interview non-local candidates</a> at all precisely because they don&#8217;t want to deal with this kind of inconvenience (hence the &#8220;call us once you&#8217;ve moved here&#8221;), so you&#8217;re not really in an optimal position if you want a long-distance job offer. It&#8217;s much, much easier to get a job when you&#8217;re already living in the location, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>6. Mentioning client names in a cover letter or resume</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it bad practice to mention the name of a client company in a cover letter or resume? For example, I used to work at a consulting group (Teapot Consulting, Inc.) that conducted research for client organizations in a specific sector. I worked on projects for Tiny Teapots, Teapot University, Teapots Unlimited, and Organic Teapots. Now I am applying for an in-house research role at Inflatable Teapots. Should I mention the names of the companies I did work for? Or would a more general statement about experience in the teapot industry &#8212; without mentioning company names &#8212; be more appropriate (while still highlighting my successes of course)?</em></p>
<p>How impressive will it be to mention them? If it will be impressive, and if it doesn&#8217;t violate any written or unofficial policy of your current employer, then yes, mention them. Otherwise, a more general statement is fine.</p>
<p><strong>7. Explaining why I&#8217;m job-searching during a restructure</strong></p>
<p><em>For the past three years, I&#8217;ve worked in a regional office for a nationally known not-for-profit organization. We have a new president who is conducting a reorganization of the company. He has already eliminated one department, and nobody feels their job is safe. Rumors are flying everywhere, and a lot of us are job hunting. There is no direct indication that my department is in jeopardy, but I don&#8217;t want to be caught unprepared. When interviewing for jobs, how can I best answer the question of why I&#8217;m looking to leave my current position?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;My organization recently brought in a new president who is doing a lot of restructuring, and it&#8217;s causing some upheaval.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work for a small company where all of our junior-level employees (all in our early 20s) are encouraged to act as a unit &#8212; e.g. we communicate among ourselves to split work, address administrative things, and fix issues before going to more senior staff. We also manage a number of semi-mundane, ongoing tasks that are often not fun at all but part of the job.</em></p>
<p><em>Two employees recently joined at this junior level, one starting a couple of months after the other. This is relevant because the newer employee was referred by the first after they worked together as interns elsewhere and they obviously have a friendly rapport. The issue: They have both been complaining, LOUDLY, about those mundane tasks I mentioned. We have an open office environment and people as far away as two or three desks down &#8212; including more senior employees &#8212; can hear their complaints.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s obviously unprofessional and needs to be addressed, but do I address this with them as a fellow junior employee? Do I pull them aside and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve overheard some of your comments recently about the work, about not enjoying it or being frustrated with it. I understand that some of the work is not as interesting as other work, but people senior to you can hear those complaints and it doesn&#8217;t come off well.&#8221; Or, do I tell their managers (one of whom is also mine)?</em></p>
<p>Either or both.</p>
<p>It would be perfectly appropriate to talk to them and say something along the lines of what you suggested. (I want to tell you to also add that it&#8217;s unpleasant to hear and doesn&#8217;t come across well to the rest of you either &#8212; it&#8217;s not just the senior people they should be concerned about &#8212; but you&#8217;ll probably maintain better relations with them, and maybe have more of an impact, if you stick to the framing you suggested.)</p>
<p>But it would also be completely appropriate to talk to your/their manager about it, framed as something like, &#8220;I feel awkward about this, but I keep hearing loud and regular complaints from Jill and Jane about their work. Since they&#8217;re still new, I thought it might be something you&#8217;d want to know is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people will tell you to mind your own business and not mention this to your manager unless it&#8217;s impacting your own work, but honestly, this is the type of thing that a good manager would want to get a discreet heads-up about, as long as it&#8217;s delivered professionally &#8230; especially because it&#8217;s something that she might not be able to observe on her own unless she happens to walk by at exactly the right time. You wouldn&#8217;t keep pushing the issue after that, of course; her take on it might differ from yours, but as long as you&#8217;re okay with that, most good managers will be grateful to be filled in discreetly on something that might be a problem, and then left to decide how and whether to handle it on their own.</p>
<p>By the way, if you feel like it, you could consider trying to get to know these employees separately from each other (ask them to grab coffee with you occasion, or something like that &#8212; but do it separately, not with both of them together) and see if you can&#8217;t model better behavior for them when they&#8217;re away from each other. They&#8217;re probably each reinforcing each other&#8217;s negative viewpoint and behavior, and getting regular exposure to someone who makes a point of reinforcing more positive, professional behavior might be helpful too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I currently work for a very small family business where there is basically one man in charge &#8212; the CEO. He has just decided to start requiring his staff to participate in a &#8220;life coaching&#8221; practice every week that he will be leading. He said he wanted us to share our personal goals for our life so that &#8220;he&#8221; can help us achieve them. He also said that if we wanted to throw in business ideas as well, that would be ok too. We are a service related company, he has no professional training or skill set to be a life coach, and the majority of his staff feels uncomfortable with this request.</em></p>
<p><em>Personally, I am a very private person. I do not feel comfortable sharing my personal life with him or even my coworkers. I feel very frustrated as I was hired to do a job which I do very well. I never was told that life coaching was a requirement for my position when I was hired 2 years ago. My feelings are shared as most of my coworkers also feel very vulnerable and exposed. His desires for my personal growth may be genuine but he is crossing a line for me.</em></p>
<p><em>When I approached him with my concerns about this, he said he apologizes that I feel uncomfortable but this is a requirement and I need to come up with something about my personal life as this shows team spirit and unity. I have always been a very private person and would like to maintain that. Can he require my participation in his &#8220;life coaching&#8221; exercise? Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!</em></p>
<p>What on earth is wrong with your boss? Why the hell would he decide that it&#8217;s a good idea to even offer this, let alone to require that you participate as a condition of employment? It&#8217;s ridiculous, and it&#8217;s a huge overstepping of boundaries.</p>
<p>As for whether he has the legal right to fire people who don&#8217;t participate &#8212; yes, he does. Just as he could fire people who refuse to participate in a book club or a potluck lunch or Friday night karaoke. It would be ridiculous to do that, but there&#8217;s no law against it.</p>
<p>Of course, just because he&#8217;s telling you that it&#8217;s a requirement doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;d actually fire you if you don&#8217;t participate. I&#8217;d be interested to know, in fact, what he&#8217;d really do when faced with a refusal to share personal information &#8212; although you probably don&#8217;t want to volunteer yourself as an experiment to find out.</p>
<p>I think you have three options for responding to this:</p>
<p>1. Attend these sessions but only volunteer work-related goals. If he presses you for personal ones, say, &#8220;My goals right now are work-related.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. Attend these sessions but only volunteer work-related goals. If he presses you for personal ones, say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in sharing personal information in this context, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s appropriate to be pressured to.&#8221; Consider adding, &#8220;Others I&#8217;ve talked with say they feel the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. Talk to your coworkers about this and protest as a group. If you all say you find this inappropriate and aren&#8217;t interested in participating, it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;s going to fire all of you. (Possible, but unlikely.) You can frame it as, &#8220;We like working here and want to focus on our jobs. We&#8217;re uncomfortable being asked to share personal issues in the office, and we want you to stop asking us to do it. We like having you as our manager, but we do not want you as a life coach. Please respect that and let us focus on doing our jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to do #3, I think it&#8217;s the right option to take. If you&#8217;re not comfortable with it, though, then either #1 or #2 should minimize the impact on you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Former boss is aggressively mining my contacts on LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a former boss who recruited me for a job from my profile on LinkedIn. (I believe he found me through another employee&#8217;s contact list.) Since hiring me, he connected with 40 (!!!) people from my LinkedIn list, most of whom he would never need for his business. He reached out to many of my contacts for interviews with no intention of hiring them. He even offered friends of mine opportunities to report to me on my team &#8212; without asking me &#8212; many of who would not be qualified for the job.</em></p>
<p><em>I stayed with his company for 6 months before leaving (for a great new role). My now ex-manager is connecting with even more of my contacts at a rapid pace and has been checking my page almost daily (I assume to see where I am going). What should I do? Should I unlink with him? I am concerned that if I do so, he can still see my updates from all my contacts and I do not want him reaching out to them for information on me. I also don&#8217;t want him to do anything spiteful. Help!</em></p>
<p>This is weird. Why is he mining your contacts so aggressively? And why is he interviewing people he has no intention of hiring?</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s completely fine to disconnect from him. You can&#8217;t stop him from reaching out to others for information about you, but does it really matter if he does?</p>
<p><strong>2. How to follow up with a contact now that I&#8217;m job-searching</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ll be finishing a master&#8217;s in August and have started job hunting now. I met an academic library dean last November who was interested enough in me to give me his business card and ask if I was able to relocate. I did the requisite email afterwards, and briefly exchanged a few messages, but now I haven&#8217;t spoken with him in a few months. How do I go about contacting him now that I&#8217;m actively looking? Can I just send him a resume? What do I say?</em></p>
<p>Email him, including your resume, and tell him that you&#8217;re now beginning a job search in earnest and that you&#8217;d love any advice he has, and would love to be considered if he has any openings coming up.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I tell my boss I have an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been planning to leave my current position for quite some time. I work in admissions at a small school and, based on my level of responsibility, thought a month&#8217;s notice would be fair, but wanted to give six weeks in the interest of staying on good terms with my supervisor.</em></p>
<p><em>Today I was called out of the blue for a position I applied for quite some time ago. The job is by no means a sure thing, but I had a very positive conversation over the phone and am well qualified. It also means about a 30% raise for me. The catch? The interview is in a week, and the hiring manager told me over the phone that he could give me two weeks to start the job (that&#8217;s what he expects from his employees, after all), bringing the total to 2 weeks, 6 days if I tell my boss tomorrow. Should I tell my boss about the interview so that she is prepared for my eventual leave, even though I may not be hired?</em></p>
<p>No. First of all, it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;d receive an offer the day you interview &#8212; hiring processes generally take some time. But secondly, and more importantly, generally people don&#8217;t give notice until they&#8217;re actually giving notice (i.e., leaving). Otherwise, you risk being pushed out before you&#8217;re ready to leave &#8212; bad under any circumstances, but especially bad when you don&#8217;t even have a job offer. (The only exception to this is if you have an unusually great relationship with your manager and she has a track record of welcoming long notice periods, even those with indefinite exit dates. Without both those things, this is not a risk you should take.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Employer wants to talk to a client as a reference</strong></p>
<p><em>I just got word that I am getting a job offer contingent on references from one former supervisor (totally expected and ok, I have 2 on my list of regular references) and one client. The client is throwing me for a bit of a loop&#8211;I have never heard of this as a requirement.</em></p>
<p><em>I have been working with most of my current clients for a long time and have great relationships with them, but I don&#8217;t want to use one of them as a reference for the same reasons I wouldn&#8217;t want to use my current manager as a reference. I&#8217;m having trouble coming up with a former client who would be able to serve as a competent reference for the work I do now. Any thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Be candid with the prospective employer: &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable asking a current client to serve as a reference for the same reason that I wouldn&#8217;t offer my current manager; my employer doesn&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m looking, and I don&#8217;t want to risk a client mentioning it.&#8221; However, do you have former clients who you could use, or a current client who you trust to be discreet?</p>
<p><strong>5. Is it a bad idea to accept an offer without negotiating?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it ever a bad idea to accept the salary offered without negotiating? I am in the running for a position that listed on the job description a salary between $60k-$70k. This is quite a bit above my previous salary, which was closer to $54k, and with better benefits. Also, this position is in a different field than the one I was working in, although some of the general skills are transferable. So if I were offered somewhere in the low $60s, I would be pretty happy. Would it reflect badly upon me if I just took their first offer without negotiating, or should I be negotiating just to show that I can negotiate? How would I justify asking for more when they can find out that I used to make so much less, and I&#8217;m not bringing in any industry-specific knowledge?</em></p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t negotiate just to show that you can negotiate. But it&#8217;s reasonable to try to ask for more, because sometimes simply asking will get you more &#8212; why leave money lying on the table when you could have it by just uttering a couple of sentences?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine if you decide not to; it&#8217;s not going to reflect badly on you to simply accept their first offer. But unless they offer you the highest end of their posted range (or more), there&#8217;s no reason not to try to ask for more. You can always accept the first offer if they don&#8217;t go up. (But on the other hand, if you&#8217;d truly be thrilled with their offer, then do what you will.)</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I quit my job without looking like a job hopper?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m 27 and finished my GRE at 23 while working full-time and writing a book. After grad school, I moved to a different state, where I worked in different jobs within the same company (got promoted) for about 4 years. After 4 years, I decided that I wanted more room for career growth, and moved to a giant &#8212; GIANT &#8212; city. The idea was to find a job in my field with room for growth where I could stay for several years.</em></p>
<p><em>I found a good job that I&#8217;ve been at now for about 4 months, but I hate living in the city where I am now. It&#8217;s miserable, to the point where if I&#8217;m away on the weekends, I literally cry at the thought of going back.</em></p>
<p><em>I work hard and I think I have some impressive accomplishments, but I feel like I can&#8217;t leave my job, because I&#8217;ll look like a job hopper and potential employers will ignore all the good stuff about me because of that. I really do want a job where I can stay a long time, but I&#8217;m miserable where I am. Do I stay here for risk of looking like a job hopper, or leave, and possibly have everyone think I&#8217;m a giant flight risk? And how do I tell my current boss I&#8217;m leaving because I hate the city? Do I acknowledge this issue in a cover letter for potential new jobs?</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to look like a job hopper just because of one short-term stay. Job hopping is about a pattern, and you don&#8217;t have a pattern.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t talk about hating the city in your cover letter. Instead, briefly mention a reason why you&#8217;re moving back to the city you&#8217;ll be applying for jobs in and leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>7. Taking vacation before maternity leave</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m stumped on the right thing to do here. I just found out that I am pregnant (YAY!), but I am equally in need of taking some vacation time this summer. I won&#8217;t be telling my boss until the beginning of June, and I will be out for 12 weeks starting early December. Would it be a bad decision to take the week vacation this summer, after the cat is out of the bag? Is it better to take the time before I fess up?</em></p>
<p>Take your vacation, and don&#8217;t worry about whether it&#8217;s before or after you&#8217;ve told your boss about your pregnancy. It&#8217;s far enough away from your maternity leave that it shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, and you&#8217;re entitled to to use the vacation time you&#8217;ve accrued.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Remember the reader who <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/how-to-fire-someone-for-mediocre-work-when-theyre-trying-hard.html">needed to fire a low performer who was trying hard</a>? Here&#8217;s her update.</p>
<p><em>I told the employee a few weeks ago that we needed to let her go because the position required skills and experience she doesn&#8217;t possess. I asked her for a few weeks transition period. I offered that if she completed certain deliverables in the transition, she would get a bonus.</em></p>
<p><em>She agreed to a transition but was very cranky. I realize now this was because I made a mistake: initially I did not provide much explanation. I was guarded because I feared if I told her the truth, it would create liability for the company.</em></p>
<p><em>In a later conversation, I was more open and honest. I reminded her of several incidents where she demonstrated a failure to perform her job. I also reminded her of the many times I had warned her (verbally and in her performance reviews).</em></p>
<p><em>Within a couple days, her whole attitude changed. She told me she could see how hard I had worked to support her over the last several months, and expressed gratitude that I tried to help her. She admitted that she struggled in the position and even said she was a little relieved (she was constantly in fear of being fired). She saw how generous the offer was, and thanked me.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been rough, but she completed the assignment, and we&#8217;ve hired a replacement who is starting on Monday.</em></p>
<p>Good for you for tackling this, even though it was tough on both sides, and for helping your employee with the transition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good reminder that being transparent about the reason with an employee who you&#8217;re firing is usually in everyone&#8217;s best interests. When you don&#8217;t share your reasons, that&#8217;s when people tend to assume something unfair is happening &#8212; and it&#8217;s also when people tend to be more likely to sue (because if they don&#8217;t hear a reason that makes sense, they&#8217;ll often go looking for one, and sometimes land upon the idea that it&#8217;s because of their race/religion/disability/age/other protected class).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I applied for a job that I thought I&#8217;d be a good fit for. It turned out that I was applying to a recruiter, and he phoned me the next day and wanted to meet. We had a coffee meeting at one of the outlets the company I was applying to is running. I clicked with him immediately, and he said he wanted to introduce me to the client, which would involve a meeting with a recruiter who was working for the company and charged with recruiting for this position.</em></p>
<p><em>When I met the second guy, he said he would definitely like to introduce me to the owner/director of the business.</em></p>
<p><em>I met with the owner/director, who was really cool. We talked for over an hour, and half an hour after I left, the original recruiter was in touch saying how much she liked me and wanted to meet up again.</em></p>
<p><em>An email heads-up from Recruiter 1 said that she would like to hear me explain what I can offer the company and how my skills can help move it forward. I decided to compile notes on all areas&#8230; sales, communication, people, costs, then round off with talking through the words people have used to describe me in feedback i&#8217;ve had throughout my career. I thought we had covered this already and in detail.</em></p>
<p><em>I got to the interview this morning and there was another man there, who the owner had worked with before with huge success. When I sat down, they said, &#8220;So, talk&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>This threw me completely and I started talking with a voice I&#8217;ve never heard myself using before, just pure nerves. I talked through everything I had prepared and they both said I had covered everything. They did comment on my nerves at the end, and I tried to explain that I am not always like this in business meetings, but this being about all me and at such a late stage&#8230; yeah, I was nervous.</em></p>
<p><em>The reason my head is on fire just now is that at the end they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get back to you on Monday, we think&#8230; we might need candidates at this stage to complete a personality test. We&#8217;ve hired badly in the past and we don&#8217;t want to make mistakes again.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Christ, this is the fourth interview I&#8217;ve had regarding this&#8230; I&#8217;ve been very open and honest and I think I&#8217;ve given a full picture of who I am and what I can do.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>They kept talking about avoiding a bad fit, but as far as I was concerned I had decided I really wanted to work for them after interview #3 and told them that. So I guess my quandary is&#8230; getting a second interview is a signal that they&#8217;re really interested, getting a third one should be even more positive, right? But a fourth or a fifth? I just do not know what to make of this; my head is buzzing.</em></p>
<p>Getting the right fit <em>is</em> important &#8212; and while you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;d like to work for them, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re sure that the fit is right on <em>their</em> side.</p>
<p>And sometimes it does take multiple interviews to be sure that the fit is right. And after all, it&#8217;s better for both of you to invest time at this stage than for you to end up struggling in the job and quitting or getting fired later.</p>
<p>But when an employer is doing this many interviews and asking for a lot of a candidate&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s really important for them to ensure that they&#8217;re organized and strategic about it &#8212; so that they&#8217;re not using someone&#8217;s time irresponsibly. And that&#8217;s what worries me about this company. They had you do two separate interviews with recruiters before you actually talked with a hiring manager, and when you finally did talk with a hiring manager, they apparently didn&#8217;t bother to ask you how your skills could help them (since they needed to ask for a later meeting for that), and then they had you return for a fourth meeting without explaining why that was necessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, in that fourth meeting, it sounds like they weren&#8217;t especially warm or collegial (&#8220;So, talk&#8230;&#8221;), which is concerning at any stage, but especially in this context.</p>
<p>What we can conclude is that, at a minimum, this is a company that doesn&#8217;t quite know how to hire well and isn&#8217;t especially concerned about being considerate of you.</p>
<p>So, what can you do? You can certainly say, &#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in working with you, but before we go any further, can you tell me what the rest of the process is likely to look like and your timeline for filling the job?&#8221; That might get you some useful information, or it might not. It also might nudge them into thinking about how this is all coming across to you, or it might not. But it&#8217;s worth asking.</p>
<p>You should also do some serious probing into their culture, and how they make decisions, and how they operate in general &#8212; because those are things that will have a major impact on your quality of life while working there, as well as your ability to succeed in your work for them &#8230; and right now there are some red flags going up around that stuff, so you should really do some due diligence there.</p>
<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s not the number of interviews that concerns me on its own &#8212; sometimes that really <em>is</em> warranted, for some jobs (although I don&#8217;t know if this is one of them or not). What concerns me is their haphazard approach to it, and you want to see if that approach is typical for them in other areas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I hate taking phone calls. I find them intrusive &#8212; they require 100% of your attention (it&#8217;s almost impossible to multitask while on the phone), immediate responses to questions, and I for one find it awkward and difficult to talk in real-time to someone whom I can&#8217;t see face-to-face. Phone conversations also aren&#8217;t very private &#8212; unless you have a closed office, everyone around you can hear your end of it.</em></p>
<p><em>I vastly prefer email, instant messaging, or texting for any long-distance communication &#8212; with those media, I can take time to re-read and think before replying, I can multitask around them much more effectively, and there&#8217;s much less chance that someone walking by will accidentally catch a snatch of a private conversation. I sometimes think I should just stop picking up incoming phone calls &#8212; I could record a voicemail greeting something like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t answer phone calls, but leave me a voicemail and I&#8217;ll get back to you, or even better, send me an email &#8211; in general, that&#8217;s the best way to reach me.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a reasonable position to take, or do I need to just get over it and accept that phone calls are part of the way business gets done? Am I alone in feeling this way, or do others hate phone calls as much as I do? Are there &#8220;phone people&#8221; and &#8220;email people,&#8221; like cat and dog people?</em></p>
<p><em>(This has been on my mind lately because I&#8217;m in the final stages of the hiring process with a new company, and have been dealing with some HR folks there who insist on calling me about every little thing, rather than emailing. It&#8217;s getting on my nerves, especially since I cannot take these calls at work due to the risk of a coworker overhearing. I&#8217;ve taken to leaving the office and walking down the street to a park to take/make these calls, which is of course inconvenient. If they emailed, I could respond from the office with no concerns about privacy.)</em></p>
<p>I hate the phone too &#8212; hate it, hate it, <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/i-hate-talking-on-phone.html">hate it</a>. Unless something is urgent and needs to be attended to immediately, or is so complicated that an email would be inefficient, I don&#8217;t see why people default to the phone. If you email me instead of calling me, I can concentrate on other things without interruption and answer you when I’m at a good stopping point. And lots of conversations take far longer on the phone than they would in email.</p>
<p>However, that said &#8230; yes, you do need to accept that phone calls are part of the way business gets done.</p>
<p>And there are indeed phone people and email people. Some people are like us and despise the phone, and others can&#8217;t imagine why we&#8217;d write an email instead of jumping on a five-minute call and dealing with whatever&#8217;s at hand right there and then. They are wrong, of course, and we are right &#8230; but they are plentiful, and it&#8217;s not reasonable to think you can avoid them in your professional life.</p>
<p>That means that you really should not leave an outgoing message on your voicemail telling people that you don&#8217;t answer phone calls. It will come across as odd, kind of rude, and a bit prima donna-ish. You can, however, have a voicemail message that <em>suggests</em> that people can get a faster response by emailing you. For instance: &#8220;You&#8217;ve reached Fitzwilliam Darcy. While you can leave a message here, I&#8217;m often able to respond more quickly by email, so feel free to email me at ___ instead. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll return your call as soon as I&#8217;m able.&#8221; (Keep in mind, though, that this might not be cool to do in some offices, so make sure you know your culture first.)</p>
<p>As for those HR people who keep calling you &#8230; You can certainly say, &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to for me to talk from work during the day, so it&#8217;s often easier to reach me over email.&#8221; However, ultimately this may be about who wants who more. If they want you more than you want them, feel free to take a strong stand on your communication preferences. If that&#8217;s not the case, though, then I wouldn&#8217;t take a hard-line here; they&#8217;re communicating with you in the way that works best for them &#8230; just like you prefer to do yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. How can I reach out to a great candidate who I had to reject?</strong></p>
<p><em>I conducted an interview screen recently that resulted in a no-hire decision for the candidate. It was, however, an extremely difficult decision, and the candidate, while not the right fit for what our team is looking for, would be a clear good fit for several other jobs in our office. In addition, the candidate and I share similar (very unusual and on-the-surface not very &#8220;marketable&#8221;) educational and work experiences&#8211;I really feel for how hard it is to find a position coming from that background!</em></p>
<p><em>I did pass the resume on to the hiring manager for the other positions in our office, with a good word about &#8220;not right for our job, but perhaps for yours.&#8221; The candidate sent me a &#8220;I understand I&#8217;m out of the running, thanks for your consideration&#8221; follow-up email today, and I would really like to reply with some sort of&#8230; encouragement? Links to other job posts? That if they&#8217;re looking for advice on what to do with our sort of weird background, I&#8217;d be happy to chat? I&#8217;m not sure what (if any) the appropriate thing to do here is!</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d really be happy to chat, that would be a really kind thing to offer. Most candidates would love to get feedback and personalized help from an employer, so if you&#8217;re willing to take the time to do that, definitely offer it!</p>
<p><strong>2. Will declaring bankruptcy affect my job search?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about jobs and bankruptcy. I am considering filing for bankruptcy to get some help with my student loans. Unfortunately, I bought into the hype during high school that I would be able to make a lot of money after attending college. Other than my student loans, I only have one medical bill that is past due, but that is because my student loan bills are so high. I took out student loans to go to a great school and to obtain an in-demand major, but things did not work out in my favor. Since employers now are requiring background checks, do you think that it will hurt my job prospects in the future? I have never mismanaged any money from the jobs where I was required to handle money. Will employers ask me why I had to file for bankruptcy and consider my circumstances?</em></p>
<p>Well, first, this might not even be an option, because most student loans aren&#8217;t dischargeable in bankruptcy. So you&#8217;d want to look into that first. But if for some reason yours are, then whether it will impact your job prospects will depend on what type of field you&#8217;re in and what types of companies you&#8217;re applying with. Loads of companies, particularly smaller ones, don&#8217;t check credit records at all. And many others only do for jobs that involve handling money or having authority over money. Some employers are now starting to use them more frequently — but certainly not all or even most.</p>
<p><strong>3. My manager will fire me if I don&#8217;t get a car</strong></p>
<p><em>I have recently been told by my boss that if I do not purchase my own vehicle for the purposes of the business, that he will be looking to replace me. When I applied for the position, I was asked if I have access to my own vehicle, I said that I do not but am able to use my parents&#8217; car. In email correspondence and in my contract, it was mentioned that he would reimburse me should I use my own vehicle for business. There was no mention of it being a necessity. I have since been unable to use my parents&#8217; car as it is their only asset and they are trying their best not to run too many miles on it.</em></p>
<p><em>I have told him that purchasing a car for his business is an expense that I cannot possibly afford right now. I had also moved closer to work in order to walk. He says that if I do not have a car by the end of next week, he will fins someone else to replae me. I am currently on &#8220;short time&#8221; which I believe he is counting as the first of my 2 week&#8217;s notice. Can he do this?</em></p>
<p>Yes. As a condition of the job, he can require you to have a car, or a suit, or a passport, or a charming smile, or anything else that doesn&#8217;t discriminate based on race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected classes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Next-day interview, and employer wants to fill the job in less than a week</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying for entry-level nonprofit communications roles, with plenty of communications internship experience and a year as an administrative assistant under my belt. Today I got a phone call from an organization I applied to work for, and they wanted to schedule me for an interview. Great! But when I told them my availability for the end of this week and beginning of next week, the response was, &#8220;What about tomorrow?&#8221; This in the mid-afternoon. I ended up taking an interview slot for tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.! It seems more than a little crazy to me that they want to interview me with less than 24 hours notice.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, it got weirder. The person I was on the phone with said that they want someone to start by Monday. Like, the coming Monday. I don&#8217;t know how they can possibly do due diligence in their hiring process in that short a time period. Even if they were to offer me this job, I can&#8217;t start on Monday &#8212; I&#8217;m in the middle of the interview process for two other organizations, and I would need at least a couple days to think things through and see if I get one of the other offers. I really want to ask these people &#8220;What&#8217;s the rush?&#8221; when they ask me if I have any questions for them, but I have a feeling that&#8217;s too terse. Any suggestions for how to ask about the crazy time table at my interview?</em></p>
<p>Hey, sometimes positions need to be filled on short timelines. If that&#8217;s the case here, and it&#8217;s a job that has a ton of well-qualified applicants, they probably don&#8217;t see any reason not to fill it that quickly. And since it&#8217;s entry-level, they might not be planning on extensive reference checks. It&#8217;s not the way people would ideally hire, but it&#8217;s not unheard of either. If it makes you uncomfortable, though, you&#8217;re certainly not under any obligation to accept an offer with them, or even interview.</p>
<p>As for how to ask about it though, you can say, &#8220;It sounds like you&#8217;re on a very tight timeline for filling the position. What&#8217;s driving that?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Handling an interviewer who talks a lot</strong></p>
<p><em>How do you handle an interview where the interviewer talks a lot and you feel as if you can&#8217;t get a word in unless she actually stops to ask something? I went on my first full-time interview yesterday and my interviewer talked a lot. I&#8217;m a shy person so it was hard enough for me to even be in the interview, let alone try to get a word about why I want the job. In the end, I felt like I didn&#8217;t even get a chance to talk about myself and all we did was talk about the company and the position.</em></p>
<p>If it happens again, try steering the conversation back to the job opening and your qualifications. Say something like, “Would it be okay to take a minute and lead you through my professional background? I think it’ll tie in with what you were just saying about the job.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that someone who hires this way likely is making hiring mistakes along the way, so you&#8217;ll have some not-so-great coworkers unless the person is quick to fix their hiring mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I ask for a raise even though I just got a small one?</strong></p>
<p><em>I work as an office administrator at a tech company. My day-to-day consists of all of the basics &#8212; I answer phones, order snacks and supplies, greet guests, and basically run the office (we have about 350 onsite on any given day). In addition to this workload, I feel that I do many things that go above and beyond the typical office admin role. My managers, as well as other employees, frequently praise my work ethic and ability to get things done (I am the go-to person when someone needs something to happen).</em></p>
<p><em>That said, I have been at the job for less than a year. My time with the organization (about 9 months) happened to coincide with yearly reviews, and so I was given one despite being around less than a calendar level. I received excellent scores in all criteria and received a scheduled raise. However, because of the way that increased are calculated, I received half of what I would have, had I been working at the company for one month longer. This comes out to a 1.3% increase. This review happened in February, and it&#8217;s been weighing on my mind ever since &#8212; with inflation and increased payroll taxes, I essentially received a pay cut even after being given very high praise.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you think it is too late to bring up the issue of compensation with our HR department? I love my job and wouldn&#8217;t want to do anything to jeopardize my status at the company, but I felt a little slighted by the increase. If you do think I would benefit from a conversation with my superiors, do you think I should include my thoughts on the relative scale of the actual increase (i.e. that it&#8217;s essentially a pay cut) or should I dwell solely on positives &#8212; things like a repair I did on an item that saved the company $700.</em></p>
<p>Wait until you&#8217;ve been there a full year, since generally it&#8217;s not reasonable to expect any raise before that anyway. At that point, go to your manager (not HR; this is an issue for your manager) and advocate for a higher raise. You can point out that because of the raise cycle, you weren&#8217;t eligible for a full raise when salaries were last assessed, but don&#8217;t dwell on that &#8212; the main thrust of your argument should be <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/04/11/10-tips-for-negotiating-a-raise  ">why your performance warrants more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Can I cite my expected raise when employers ask how much I make?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m in a bit of a conundrum. I am expecting a promotion and salary increase, but I do not know the new salary or title (not a work scope change). I do know it is imminent. As I am interviewing for a few positions elsewhere, I wanted to ask what you would recommend if I am asked about salary history and recommendations in the meantime. Do I base estimates on what I&#8217;d expect or what I&#8217;m currently receiving?</em></p>
<p>You can say that you&#8217;re expecting a raise of around $X, but really, you want to focus on what your contributions to the new company are worth, not on your salary history. Allowing employers to peg your salary to what you&#8217;ve earned in the past is a good way to avoid getting a large jump when you change jobs, so you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I need to have a conversation with my manager about why I continue to get excluded from strategic conversations when my teammates are included.</em></p>
<p><em>My colleague, who is just a bit senior than me, has mentioned on more than one occasion conversations she has had with our manager about overall strategic goals for the team or for the organization. Every time, I am left wondering: Wait&#8230; when did this conversation happen? Why wasn&#8217;t I invited?</em></p>
<p><em>I am starting to worry that there is something larger at play here. Last year, I was brand-new to the team, so in some sense I did not expect to get staffed on projects/conversations about the long-term vision for our work. This year, however, I have been here just as long as one person who participated in these conversations last year. (I hope that makes sense. That person has moved on from the role.)</em></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a concrete example: I developed a tool this year for one client that has since been adapted for several other clients. Word got out in the community we served, and now other non-clients want us to come and give a talk about this tool. My colleague was asked to go give this talk, and I only heard about it from her in passing. Given that I created it, I imagine I should have the opportunity to be at this talk, and even help lead it.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, a lot has run through my head about this. Does my boss not like me or think I do good work? I think she likes me quite a bit. I&#8217;ve independently led several projects that have generated so much positive publicity for the organization and for her, as my supervisor. When I needed a recommendation letter, she told me she would be thrilled to and only has glowing things to say about my work. Likewise, when I had my mid-year performance review, it was truly the best I&#8217;d had. (That has not always been the case. The one a year prior was lukewarm, as a result of a messy project I hadn&#8217;t managed well.)</em></p>
<p><em>I *do* find that she sometimes leads me down dead-ends &#8212; especially on a major project that she had me lead over a year ago that, to this day, has not materialized into anything substantial. I created the product, yes, but testing and implementing it has been incredibly stressful. She has refused to make a decision about it (she is incredibly indecisive and risk-averse), and I have given up trying to get buy-in for something I was *asked* to do in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond how I feel about her management style, I would like to approach her about my feeling that I am not getting invited to important conversations. I want to know why that is, so that if it is an impression *I* am giving, that I can stop it immediately. Your thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Talk to her! Say something like this: &#8220;Jane often mentions to me that she&#8217;s been talking with you about our team&#8217;s strategic goals or the organization&#8217;s long-term vision, and I&#8217;d love to be included in conversations like that. I know those conversations often happen spontaneously, but when there are advance opportunities to be included and you think it makes sense, I&#8217;d really like to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if it fits in with the conversation, you can also ask, &#8220;Are there things I could do differently in my own performance that would lead me to being more involved in those types of discussions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Which that leads me to this: This might be less about something you&#8217;re doing wrong and more about something that your <em>coworker</em> is doing right. If she&#8217;s initiating strategic conversations with your manager and volunteering for projects, she might be simply making herself visible in a way that you&#8217;re not. In other words, it might not be that your manager is deliberately leaving you out, but rather than your coworker is putting herself in. And if so, you might look for ways that you can do that as well.</p>
<p>In fact, if you have a good relationship with your coworker, you could ask her about this too &#8212; not in a resentful way, of course, but something like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you and Emma often talk about things like this. I&#8217;d love to have those types of conversations with her too but for some reason I don&#8217;t seem to. Do you have any insight into how you&#8217;ve been able to make that happen, so that I can figure out what I can do on my end too?&#8221;</p>
<p>You might hear something in response that&#8217;s as simple as, &#8220;Oh, I just ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also worth noting that that lukewarm performance evaluation from two years ago might still be lingering in your manager&#8217;s head &#8212; or more accurately, the performance that caused it. Performance problems can have a long shelf-life in managers&#8217; memories, and even though you feel it&#8217;s behind you, it&#8217;s possible that she still looks at you as less skilled or reliable or less of a strategic thinker than your coworker. There might be something to that, or it might be wrong, but if none of the above works, you might consider that the echo of whatever happened that year could still be coloring the way she sees you. If that&#8217;s the case, and if tackling it head-on doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s useful information to factor in as you ponder the next steps in your career.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been told by some professionals in my field that in order for me to get hired in this tight job market I would have to take a position that I don’t want. My field is environmental science, and they have suggested that I try similar fields such as environmental health, public health, and other similar fields.</em></p>
<p><em>Although I am qualified for these positions, I don’t have that great of an interest to actually work in these fields. I was advised to apply for positions and then work my way into what I really want to do once I get my foot in the door.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t know if this is the best advice because I don’t want to be stuck doing something I don’t like for a year or two, but I do desperately need to get a job in my field even if it is not what I want to study. Am I just being a prima donna? Should I suck it up and branch out more, or is this a terrible idea? What do you think?</em></p>
<p>I get versions of this question a lot, and the answer always comes down to two factors:</p>
<p><strong>1. Realistically, what are your job prospects?</strong> What signals are you getting about your prospects for getting the jobs you want? Are you getting lots of interviews and second interviews and hearing that the decision was close but they ultimately went with someone else? If so, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to think that you&#8217;re a strong candidate with a good chance of getting an offer reasonably soon. But if you&#8217;re not &#8212; if you&#8217;re not getting very far in employers&#8217; hiring processes, or even getting many interviews at all, then those are signals that you &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; aren&#8217;t viewed as an especially strong candidate for those jobs. If that&#8217;s the case, it makes sense to be realistic and look at what other options you have.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&#8217;s your financial situation?</strong> How quickly do you need to take a job? Are you in a financial position that allows you to wait many months more? Or is your situation becoming increasingly dire? If the former, you obviously have more flexibility (although you should also factor in that the longer you&#8217;re unemployed, the weaker your candidacy might become). If the latter, then your finances might dictate that you be willing to work outside your field, whether that appeals to you or not (since paying your bills trumps job satisfaction).</p>
<p>And assuming you&#8217;re not in a position to wait <em>indefinitely</em>, when will things become more urgent? It&#8217;s helpful to figure out things like, &#8220;I can wait and see what happens for the next four months, but if I&#8217;m not getting multiple serious bites by July, I&#8217;m going to be more flexible about what positions I&#8217;ll apply for because I don&#8217;t want to eat into my savings much beyond November.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, you can&#8217;t make these decisions based strictly on what type of work does and doesn&#8217;t interest you, and how far outside your field you are and aren&#8217;t willing to go. You need to make them based on a realistic &#8212; brutally realistic, I&#8217;d say &#8212; assessment of what your prospects are in the current market, how many options you have, and how long those options will support you.</p>

Many of the people whose help you’d most like are busy and often get more email than they can respond to. And since emails from strangers often go to the bottom of the list, it’s important to craft an email that that they won’t be inclined to ignore.</p>
<p>Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about how to write a networking email that gets a response – including being specific about what you want, being concise, and being at least somewhat flattering. You can <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/04/10/how-to-send-a-networking-email-that-wont-be-ignored">read it here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should I stop by in person to see why an employer called me?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied for a summer job in February, interviewed at the beginning of March, and have been anxiously waiting for early April when they said they would be done with interviews. I finally got a call from my interviewer, but due to some phone malfunctions on my end did not get her message until two days later. All the message said was to give her a call back, which I did immediately. I got her voicemail so I apologized for not getting back to her right away, briefly explained the issue with my phone, and left her my number again. That was Friday. On Monday, I tried her again and got her voicemail again. She hasn&#8217;t called me back.</em></p>
<p><em>I volunteer in the building where she works tomorrow, and my parents suggested if she hasn&#8217;t called me back yet that I should stop by her office. Is that appropriate? Also I&#8217;m assuming she was calling to offer me the job, otherwise she could have just emailed. But is there a chance I could be putting her on the spot to give some news in person she would rather give over the phone?</em></p>
<p>No, don&#8217;t do that. You&#8217;ve called her and left her messages, and she knows how to get in touch if she wants to. Stopping by in person without an appointment will put her on the spot and come across as overly pushy and inappropriate. At this point, I&#8217;d simply move on and trust that she&#8217;ll get in touch with you if she wants to. You could send one final email (as opposed to a call), but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finding out the hiring manager&#8217;s name</strong></p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the best way to find out exactly who is hiring for a position? I&#8217;ve been told to never address a cover letter to &#8220;whom it may concern&#8221; or &#8220;HR dept,&#8221; and I agree, but sometimes it can be quite difficult to find out who a hiring manager is. You can simply call and ask for smaller companies, but large companies that use automated voice response can make it impossible to even talk to anybody at all!</em></p>
<p><em>I recently reached out to a company&#8217;s recruiter through LinkedIn, and I never got a response from them either. What is the best way to reach out to a recruiter to get my question answered? Or is a recruiter the best person to go through? And if, in the end, I&#8217;ve exhausted all of these attempts, should I still send the cover letter without a name on it?</em></p>
<p>Stop thinking about this at all. Seriously, no sane hiring manager cares whether you address the letter to her or to &#8220;dear hiring manager.&#8221; They care about your candidacy. Write &#8220;dear hiring manager&#8221; and be done with it.</p>
<p>This is not worth any expenditure of stress or energy, particularly when there are so many more important things to spend your time on, like writing a great cover letter. And if your cover letter and resume don&#8217;t need more attention, then read a book or watch a movie &#8212; there&#8217;s no reason to spend time on something like this. <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2011/06/is-it-worth-calling-to-find-out-the-hiring-managers-name.html">More here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fitting my resume on one page</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve followed the philosophy that resumes should be one page only. I am starting my third job in my career, and due to the amount of responsibilities, can only fit my last two jobs on one page. If I leave out my first entry-level job, will it look like I have a 2-year gap between my college graduation and my actual second job?</em></p>
<p>You can go to two pages if you&#8217;re more than a few years out of school. If you&#8217;re not, then you&#8217;re including too much detail and you need to edit. Resumes should include the most impressive highlights of what you&#8217;ve achieved; they don&#8217;t need to list every responsibility you had at each job.</p>
<p><strong>4. My resume shows I left soon after a promotion</strong></p>
<p><em>I was &#8220;promoted&#8221; to a different position within my last company in my last 6 months on the job. I would like to show both positions on my resume so companies can I see I have experience in both areas, but would it look bad to have a position last only 6 months before moving on to another company? I had already known I wanted to leave when I was promoted, but I accepted the position so that I could show better/more experience on my resume. I&#8217;m worried that companies may think I was let go or something equally negative.</em></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s not the same as leaving a brand-new job (at a new company) after only six months; it&#8217;s different when it&#8217;s internal and you have a longer history with the company.</p>
<p><strong>5. Negotiating salary when my company might have pulled someone&#8217;s offer over it</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to apply for an internal position, and I believe I&#8217;m likely to get it&#8211;I&#8217;ve been told so by the hiring manager, plus I helped <em>develop the job description. I hope to negotiate the salary offer for the first time in my life. As I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, since previously I&#8217;ve always just taken what I was offered, my current pay is on the low end. I&#8217;m excited for the chance to boost it up to a professional level.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that I&#8217;ve heard nasty rumors about how management handled salary negotiations with a recent potential hire. What I know for sure is that the hiring process got to the point of making one candidate an offer, and then the job was suddenly reposted. What I heard from the hiring manager was that the candidate was &#8220;crazy&#8221; during the negotiation and that the offer was rescinded. What I heard through the rumor mill was that the candidate tried to negotiate salary and management was so taken aback and insulted that they rescinded the offer, even after the candidate tried to back down.</em></p>
<p><em>This is obviously concerning to me. If it matters, my organization is a nonprofit, and there&#8217;s definitely a culture of considering it an honor to work here and help advance the mission, so&#8230; maybe that&#8217;s part of what happened? Of course I don&#8217;t know what really happened, but the management of my organization has been just screwy enough in the past that it seems possible that the rumor mill is correct. If it is true, how can I handle a salary negotiation without running into a minefield? I don&#8217;t want to push too hard on the off chance that management will react really poorly, but I also don&#8217;t want to just take what I&#8217;m offered and sabotage my own payscale yet again.</em></p>
<p>Ask your coworkers what their experience has been in trying to negotiate raises. It&#8217;s possible that the story you heard wasn&#8217;t accurate, or that at least key details weren&#8217;t accurate. And even if it was, it&#8217;s possible that your company handles internal raise requests differently from salary negotiations with job candidates.</p>
<p>It would obviously be ridiculous for them to function this way, but ask the people who are going to be most likely to know: your coworkers who have been there for a while.</p>
<p><strong>6. Coworker loudly slurps liquids</strong></p>
<p><em>We have a well educated, middle-aged man in our office who slurps any liquid and loudly! Whether in his cube (his is next to mine), in office meetings or in the lunch room, he slurps! It is not a cultural thing, as I think his family came over on the Mayflower. We’ve tried to say things like, “Gee, that coffee must be really hot” to draw attention to the fact that his slurping is distracting (disgusting, really). He always responds in a hurt voice, like “I wasn’t aware that I was doing that” or “in my house, slurping and burping are signs of good food.&#8221; Sorry, it’s really an excuse.</em></p>
<p><em>What can I/we do to tell him it’s offensive? Should we take him aside and do it one by one or as a group or &#8230;.? What should we say?</em></p>
<p>Stop hinting and be direct &#8212; as is always the answer when you want someone to stop doing something but haven&#8217;t yet told them that! The next time it happens, say, &#8220;Bob, could you please not slurp your drink? I can hear it over here and it&#8217;s very distracting.&#8221; If it continues, say, &#8220;Bob, I understand that you have different conventions around this, but it bothers me when I&#8217;m working and I&#8217;d appreciate you reining it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it continues after that, well, you work with an annoying slurper and will have to live with it. You can&#8217;t fix every annoying behavior in the workplace &#8212; but you can certainly start by directly asking for what you want.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do I need in-state residency to apply for jobs?</strong></p>
<p><em>My husband and I are thinking about moving from Michigan to Florida for a couple of years in order for him to attend seminary. We&#8217;d both need jobs &#8212; part-time for him, full-time for me. My snowbird grandma is adamantly insistent that my husband and I would both need Florida residency &#8212; drivers&#8217; licenses, plates for the car, etc. &#8212; before we could even interview for jobs. Is this true?</em></p>
<p><em>For reasons of convenience and expense, we&#8217;d like to maintain our Michigan residency while in Florida, which I&#8217;ve always assumed is standard for out-of-state students (and their spouses). Would doing so really impact our ability to find jobs, or (as my grandma insists) our legal employment status? My grandma&#8217;s known for her sometimes bizarre opinions, but she was so absolutely dogmatic about this it&#8217;s got me wondering.</em></p>
<p>Your grandmother is wrong. There are certainly some jobs that require in-state residency or an in-state driver&#8217;s license (some government jobs, for example), but they&#8217;re not the majority, and they&#8217;ll make it clear if they require that. In general, you can assume you don&#8217;t need it.</p>

As a matter of fact, we are expected to buy our bosses dinner one of the nights. When you are hired, you are told to sign a form that states if you commit to the trip and then quit the job or cannot make the trip, you are to reimburse the company for their costs.</em></p>
<p><em>This year, several of us have opted out of the trip for financial reasons (I spent over $350 on food last year) so we did not commit to this year&#8217;s trip. Now they are saying that it is a mandatory trip. Can they do that, force us to do someone we cannot afford to do?</em></p>
<p>I wrote back and asked what the purpose of the trip is. The response:</p>
<p><em>They want to create a feeling of team spirit.</em></p>
<p>Hahahahahahahaha!</p>
<p>There is nothing like creating a feeling of team spirit by forcing your employees to go on a trip that costs them hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>Please pause and enjoy a hearty laugh at this, as I have.</p>
<p>Okay, now &#8230; Yes, your company can indeed make this trip mandatory. Whether or not they <em>should</em> is a different issue (hint: they should not), but as for whether they can legally require it as part of your job? Yep, they sure can.</p>
<p>But of course it&#8217;s a terrible idea for them to do so. First, in general, companies should cover work-related travel expenses, because it&#8217;s not fair to ask employees to bear what should be business costs. And second, the alleged purpose of this trip &#8212; to build team spirit &#8212; provides extra cause for them to cover the expenses, because even people who are inclined to be filled with team spirit tend to get a bit deflated when told that they&#8217;re going to be out $350 for the privilege, and that they&#8217;ll be fired if they don&#8217;t agree.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s certainly your employer&#8217;s prerogative to decide that this trip is a key part of their culture-building (and they&#8217;re at least doing the right thing by being up-front about that with people when they start working there; it would be worse if they were springing it on you afterwards). They&#8217;re allowed to decide that the culture they want includes an annual trip, even an expensive one &#8212; just as they&#8217;re allowed to decide that their culture means that everyone dresses up like clowns on Fridays or that you can&#8217;t wear red or that you all have to speak in tongues after lunch. If they think that stuff contributes to the culture they want, it&#8217;s their call &#8212; and as long as they&#8217;re really clear with prospective employees before anyone accepts a job there, so be it. I don&#8217;t want to work there, but some people will. (Just like I don&#8217;t want to work in Southwest Airlines&#8217; really effusive, bubbly culture either, but they&#8217;re entitled to decide they want that culture, and it works for them to screen me out and hire people who are aligned with their vision of a workplace.)</p>
<p>And in this case, your company has decided that they want people who will be excited to go on this trip every year, and will see enough value in it (and probably see it as sufficiently like a vacation) that they won&#8217;t mind covering their own food expenses. And that really is their prerogative.</p>
<p>As for what you can do though &#8230; I&#8217;d go to your manager and first get clarity on exactly what the situation is. Start by saying something like, &#8220;It was my understanding when I was hired that it was fine to decline the trip as long as the company knew far enough in advance that our tickets hadn&#8217;t been purchased. Is it now mandatory regardless?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re told yes, it&#8217;s now mandatory, then you can say something like this: &#8220;I understand the company intends this as a team-building trip, and I&#8217;d be glad to go. But last year my food costs were around $350, and that&#8217;s not an expense I can fit into my budget. I&#8217;d like to be able to go on the trip, but I can&#8217;t afford those costs. Is that something the company can include, or would it make more sense for me to stay here?&#8221;</p>
<p>If your manager says that neither of those options are possible &#8230;. well, then these are apparently the new terms of your employment, and you&#8217;ll have to decide if you want the job under these conditions. I think it&#8217;s BS to do that to you, but at that point, that&#8217;ll be the choice you&#8217;re looking at.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I am a job applicant and recent MBA grad. I have gotten a lot of resume feedback from various sources, one of whom advised me to make my resume a narrative. My contact is an angel investor for high-tech start-ups and would presumably know what he&#8217;s talking about. Basically his point was that that format would help convey passion and excitement between the lines &#8212; if not explicitly written out.</em></p>
<p><em>He suggested the narrative resume to tell my story in full sentences, including everything from the degrees I have to the experiences I have had. I wrote one on his suggestion, and here&#8217;s an excerpt:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Parallel to the MBA program, I engaged with a number of exciting companies. As a start-up consultant analyst for Swift Expo (July 2012 – December 2012) I performed a market assessment through pricing analysis, conjoint hedonic analysis, and value-based pricing concepts such as lower-valued use of assets, marginal analysis, price ceilings, floors and controls.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I am very hesitant to use this version in job applications since it feels like what I wrote was simply a very long cover letter (he suggests also sending a separate cover letter). I&#8217;d very much appreciate to know what your take is.</em></p>
<p>What?! No. That is not the way you should word things on a resume.</p>
<p>A resume needs to be able to be quickly scanned, and it needs the information most employers are looking for to be easily accessible in that quick scan &#8212; which is initially only about 20 seconds, if not less. It shouldn&#8217;t be in narrative, it shouldn&#8217;t be in the first person, and it shouldn&#8217;t be in full sentences. It should be bullet points.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that: Bullet points. I beg you. Otherwise, employers&#8217; eyes are going to <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/03/large-paragraphs-of-text-are-a-resume-killer.html">glaze over</a> reading those blocks of text, and you are going to be overlooked in favor of candidates who wrote easier-to-skim, punchier resumes that provide information quickly and in the format most hiring managers want it in.</p>
<p>Your resume also shouldn&#8217;t characterize your employers as &#8220;exciting&#8221; or anything else subjective. Subjective stuff is for your cover letter. Your resume is for what you achieved, not how you felt about it.</p>
<p>The guy who gave you this advice might be a fantastic angel investor, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that he knows what most hiring managers are looking for on resumes. You can always find people with random/minority opinions about what makes a good resume &#8212; including people in positions of power and authority &#8212; but they don&#8217;t always speak for what&#8217;s effective with the majority.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s told you how to write an effective resume for a job with him, perhaps. But it&#8217;s not the most effective way to do it more broadly.</p>

<p><em>What do you do if a job candidate&#8217;s sister writes you an email saying, &#8220;Please keep this as a secret&#8221; and says that she will help her very talented brother with the job and that this job would be perfect for him &#8212; on and on for a whole page.</em></p>
<p><em>Do I answer her? Do I tell the candidate? Do I ignore her?</em></p>
<p><em>How would you handle this? He is in the top three, but this makes me wonder.</em></p>
<p>Ignore it, on the assumption that even the best candidates can have crazy siblings. I&#8217;d  pay some extra attention to ensuring that <em>he</em> seems to understand normal business conventions, but aside from that, make your decision independent of this. And if you end up hiring him, tip him off that his sister is sending emails that aren&#8217;t doing him any favor with employers.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s one part of this that I&#8217;d want more information about: Do you mean that the sister wrote that she would help him with the job, or just that she wants to help him <em>get</em> the job? Because if she&#8217;s saying she&#8217;ll help him with the job itself, that&#8217;s additionally weird and something that you probably do need to address with him before offering him a job. I&#8217;d say something like, &#8220;I received an email from your sister that I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how to interpret. She said that she&#8217;d help you with the job if you were to be in the role. I didn&#8217;t respond to her, but I&#8217;m wondering if you can shed any light.&#8221;</p>
<p>And meanwhile, siblings, spouses, parents, children, significant others, and friends of job candidates: This is a very, very bad thing to do. Do not do this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Applying for a job at a company whose customer service I&#8217;ve complained about in the past</strong></p>
<p><em>A job I&#8217;m interested in just opened up at a large telecom company based where I live that shall remain nameless. We&#8217;ll call them BT&amp;T. I&#8217;m well qualified, the salary is quite a bit higher than my current salary, and I have an in at the company &#8212; one of my good friends is a manager. Seems perfect, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Well&#8230;the only hold-up is that in the past I have had HORRIBLE relations with customer service at this company. I&#8217;d like to blame it all on BT&amp;T &#8211; and to the best of my knowledge all of my past troubles have originated with them &#8212; but I can admit I&#8217;ve lost my cool with the service reps multiple times somewhere during the 85th minute of being on hold or being transferred around. So, is it possible that these conversations would affect my chances being hired here? Do they keep files on this kind of stuff? I know they record conversations &#8212; so I just wondered if that meant I was in some sort of database of &#8220;angry BT&amp;T customers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty unlikely. I mean, I&#8217;ve never worked for a telecom company so it&#8217;s possible that something like this goes on, but generally speaking, it would be very unlikely. Hiring is a separate function from customer service. Unless you were a truly notorious customer, you&#8217;re probably in the clear. Anyone know otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>2. How do I know if I&#8217;m being paid off the books or not?</strong></p>
<p><em>I started working for a company in January and was hired for Sales/Marketing with a salary and commission. I get paid on time, I get a check, but no pay stub. He gives us a check and a handwritten break down of the taxes. I know he has two people employed off the books and I don&#8217;t want to be taken for a fool. How do I know for a fact that I am on the books?</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s entirely possible that he&#8217;s handling this all correctly but not using a payroll service and doing the calculations himself, but of course you don&#8217;t know that based on what you&#8217;re receiving. I&#8217;d imagine, though, that you could contact the IRS and your state tax agency to confirm that they&#8217;re receiving taxes on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should non-exempt employees be paid for time at non-mandatory work dinners?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recently our entire department was invited to a dinner with staff members from an outside vendor. I believe the purpose of the dinner is to thank us for our business, as my company is their biggest client, and we do work with them almost daily. Our department head hasn&#8217;t said the dinner is mandatory but he cleared the date with us all ahead of time. As a non-exempt employee, am I entitled to be paid for my time spent attending this dinner? If so, how do I go about asking whether I&#8217;ll be paid if I attend? I&#8217;m an introvert and will likely find the dinner stressful so I don&#8217;t want to commit to attending if I&#8217;m donating my time. I do worry, though, about the impression it will give if I decline the invitation.</em></p>
<p>Say this: &#8220;As a non-exempt worker, how should I handle my time for this dinner?&#8221; It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask. If you&#8217;re told, &#8220;Oh, since it&#8217;s voluntary, you won&#8217;t be paid for the time,&#8221; then it&#8217;s fine to decline to attend.</p>
<p><strong>4. What to say at the end of an interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m a recent graduate who has been trying to find a job in this tough market. Since December. I&#8217;ve applied to about 18 entry-level positions in my field, and have only had two interviews. Most recently, my dream job has come up (it&#8217;s a year-long internship in the cultural sector; I could care less about the &#8220;intern&#8221; title because frankly I&#8217;d love to work in the local arts and cultural scene for the rest of my career) and I&#8217;m worried that I&#8217;m a bit rusty in my interviews.</em></p>
<p><em>With that being said, here&#8217;s my question: as long as I don&#8217;t come across as desperate or begging&#8211;just using a firm voice with a confident smile&#8211;is it not too forward to mention at the end of an interview, &#8220;I want you to know that I really want this position, and I know I&#8217;d be a great fit here, if you&#8217;d give me the chance&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>Eh, it&#8217;s not a disaster or anything, but it&#8217;s a little cheesy. And you don&#8217;t really know if you&#8217;d be a great fit somewhere until you have much, much more insider information than you can get from an interview. Why not just say, &#8220;I want you to know that I really want this position, and I&#8217;d be hugely excited to be offered it&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>5. Letting an employer know I turned down another offer</strong></p>
<p><em>Last week, I had two follow-up interviews at two different organizations. On Tuesday, it was a second interview, and a few hours later they called to offer me the job. On Thursday, it was a third interview for a job I really want. As we were discussing timing at the end of Thursday&#8217;s interview, I did let them know that I had received another job offer and so it would be helpful for me to know as soon as they could. The interviewer (who I know and have a good professional relationship with) said that she really appreciated my telling her and that she would be do her best to update me by the middle of this week.</em></p>
<p><em>Since Thursday, I have been in communication with organization A about their job offer and have decided to decline it. My question is&#8230;should I reach out to organization B to let them know that I did this? Ordinarily, I wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to over-share with a job prospect on this, but I did get the feeling that she might twist her schedule/go out of her way to expedite a decision on my behalf. I am completely over thinking and going back and forth on which decision would give me more of a competitive advantage. But in the end, my inclination in general is to err on the side of transparency and tell her. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Yes, transparency is generally good, and there&#8217;s no reason not to use it here. Particularly since she might feel pressured to get you a quicker answer than she otherwise would, and that can lead to the answer being &#8220;no&#8221; if she&#8217;s not 100% ready for it to be &#8220;yes&#8221; yet. Send her an email and let her know.</p>
<p><strong>6. Is this a good sign?</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to move back to my small hometown (10k) and was shocked when I found a company that does work in my niche industry. I sent a cold inquiry email with my resume on Friday night. I got a quick response early Saturday morning saying he was very interested in speaking, but couldn&#8217;t talk until after tax season ends, and would call me April 17.</em></p>
<p><em>Would you take &#8220;very interested&#8221; to mean he has a real opportunity and potential to hire, or possibly just willing to network for future?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way of knowing. But regardless, you&#8217;re better off taking it as &#8220;future networking&#8221; so that you don&#8217;t start counting on it in your head &#8212; since even if he means &#8220;I have an open position,&#8221; there&#8217;s no guarantee that it will stay open or that he&#8217;ll hire you for it.</p>
<p><strong>7. I think my cousin is cheating his employees</strong></p>
<p><em>My cousin owns a construction and assorted services (lawn care, snow plowing, etc.) business. I am not close with him; he lives several states away from me and I haven&#8217;t seen him in years.</em></p>
<p><em>I recently heard from another family member (who does know him well, spends a lot of time with him, etc.) about a number of problems he&#8217;s been having with his business lately, stemming from his poor treatment of clients and employees. One of the things she described was that, in retaliation for some employees &#8220;slacking off,&#8221; he retroactively cut their pay. I don&#8217;t know any more details (or even if it&#8217;s true, since I heard it secondhand), but it makes me so angry. His employees (who include other members of my family) are in no position to advocate for themselves. It feels like someone should do something, but I&#8217;m not sure what.</em></p>
<p><em>There are obviously plenty of family relationship issues here that are outside your scope. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on whether I should get involved &#8212; and if so, what can actually do. I&#8217;ll say up front that my bias is that, ethically, I (or anyone in this situation) should do something (e..g, call the state Dept. of Labor, or whatever). I&#8217;m open to hearing that I shouldn&#8217;t, but I wanted to put that out there.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really see what you can do. You don&#8217;t have any way to verify the information, and you don&#8217;t have a relationship with your cousin where it would make sense to talk to him about this &#8212; you don&#8217;t have the standing to raise it with him the way you would if you were closer or in more contact. I think this falls under the &#8220;not your business&#8221; category, unless one of those factors changes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have a coworker who I&#8217;ve been friendly with for over two years. I took her under my wing when she got here because I saw that she was having a tough time. I had a tough time also when I first started and for the first two years I hated the office. I was bored, I didn&#8217;t have any work to do, and my supervisor was super moody. Things have since changed for me, so when I saw the new person having a a tough time, I took her under my wing and explained the ins and outs of the office personalities, the history of the office, and how I initially felt when I started.</em></p>
<p><em>My other coworkers and I did our best to make her feel welcome in the office. We all have a good rapport with each other, and some of us have even hung out socially. However, she is still refering to the office as a miserable place to work. She complains about not having enough meaningful work to do in our office but hasn&#8217;t spoken to the supervisor or anyone else about taking on other responsibilities.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I be offended by the negative remarks she makes about the office when my other coworkers and I have done so much to make her feel welcomed? We celebrate birthdays in the office and I do festive things and decorate during the holidays, and we laugh, joke and have great conversations during the day. Granted, we still have the same moody supervisor, but the rest of us have learned to accept and deal with the fact that our supervisor is moody. I really feel slighted but I don&#8217;t know if maybe I&#8217;m just being hypersensitive! I also should point out that she also splits her time between two different offices and often makes it seem like the other office is so much fun and is a much better place to work.</em></p>
<p>If she doesn&#8217;t like it, she doesn&#8217;t like it, and there&#8217;s no reason for you to be offended by that. Different people have different perspectives on the same work environment, and you can&#8217;t take that personally.</p>
<p>However, her complaining and negativity is legitimately frustrating, and you have every right to ask her to tone it down, and to stop venting it to you. The next time she does it, why not ask her to cut it out? Tell her that it makes work less pleasant for you, that you&#8217;re pretty happy there, and that you&#8217;d appreciate her not trashing an environment that you&#8217;re pretty happy in.</p>
<p>And frankly, in response to her frequent complaints, you could also try asking, &#8220;So what do you plan to do about it?&#8221; She seems to not realize that she has any agency here (she could talk to your manager, she could try to transfer to the other office full-time, she could apply for other jobs, etc.). It might be useful to point out that her complaints ring pretty hollow when she&#8217;s not taking any action to try to change her situation.</p>
<p>But overall, should you be offended? No. Just annoyed. Very, very annoyed. And well within your rights to tell her to cut it out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have been at my position for over a year and a half. I work in a college administrative office. We offer small business counseling for free twice a month. And twice a month, the woman in charge of the program tells me how to process the clients needing counseling. It&#8217;s simple things &#8212; copy this, check off the list, etc. I feel like she is insulting my intelligence by constantly telling me how to do these simple tasks.</em></p>
<p><em>She is an older woman (60&#8242;s/70&#8242;s) and I&#8217;m young (25). How do I kindly say to her &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m doing&#8221;? I feel like I&#8217;m being treated like a child.</em></p>
<p>Say this: &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you go over this with me each time we do this, and it makes me wonder &#8212; am I making mistakes or otherwise not doing this correctly?&#8221; Don&#8217;t say this in a snotty tone &#8212; say it in a tone of genuine concern.</p>
<p>This might be enough to make the point to her that you&#8217;ve got it and don&#8217;t need it repeated each time. (Or alternately, you might find out that she has some concern that you didn&#8217;t realize and that she&#8217;s not addressing head-on.)</p>
<p>And in general, that&#8217;s always the right pose to take with this kind of thing &#8212; if someone is treating you in a way that seems condescending or untrusting or inappropriately micromanagey, express genuine concern about what might be causing it. It&#8217;s a reasonably direct but non-aggressive way into a conversation about what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>But if that doesn&#8217;t work with her, then you can try, &#8220;I really do know the process well at this point, and I hate to have you spend your time reviewing it with me so often. Could I take it from here and check in with you if I run into questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if <em>that</em> doesn&#8217;t work &#8230; well, at that point you accept that she&#8217;s oddly neurotic about this program and you&#8217;re going to be receiving very basic instructions about it twice a month.</p>

But with most employers, being too aggressive will backfire and lead to more rejections than interviews.</p>
<p>You might wonder why – after all, employers like persistence and enthusiasm, right? But when those things cross the line into annoying employers, making you seem desperate, or making you appear not to understand and follow normal business conventions, you’ll harm your chances.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be too aggressive? Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about some of the most common overly aggressive tactics that employers see that can torpedo your chances.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Explaining why other companies didn&#8217;t hire me</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been unemployed for over a year now, but I keep sending out applications and sometimes manage to get a interview. And a question I&#8217;ve been asked several times is, &#8220;Do you know why you weren&#8217;t hired by those other companies?&#8221; It usually starts when they ask, &#8220;Where else have you been applying?&#8221; and I say hospitals, universities, and biotech companies. Then I get asked, &#8220;Do you know why you weren&#8217;t hired by Other Place?&#8221; or &#8220;Did you get any feedback from Other Place as to why they didn&#8217;t hire you?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The truth is that I usually hear nothing back, but once in a while I get a personal rejection letter that goes along the lines of &#8220;You were a great candidate but unfortunately another candidate had more experience.&#8221; So I say lack of experience, although it could of course be any reason. But am I supposed to do a little soul-searching to answer that question? Are my interviewers wondering if I showed some red flag that is preventing me from getting hired for over a year? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m any weirder than the next person, but do interviewers think there must be something wrong with me, otherwise someplace would have hired me by now? Or is there is really something wrong with me?</em></p>
<p>This is really odd. It&#8217;s an odd question for any interviewer to ask, and so it&#8217;s really odd that you&#8217;re being asked it by multiple different interviewers. And it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going to tell them anything useful, like &#8220;Oh yeah, Company X said that I showed up drunk, and Company Y thought my degree was BS.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any case, I wouldn&#8217;t let it worry you too much. Just smile and say something like, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s just a tough job market right now and there are lots of good candidates.&#8221; Frankly, you could also add, &#8220;But if you have any feedback, I&#8217;d love it!&#8221; Because if they&#8217;re asking such an odd question, you&#8217;re entitled to ask them that back.</p>
<p><strong>2. Employer isn&#8217;t being clear about paid holidays</strong></p>
<p><em>Upon receiving an offer letter, I noticed nothing was noted about paid holidays. This is a full time salaried position directly under the HR supervisor. I emailed the HR supervisor asking her about this, and she quickly sent back an email quoting the company&#8217;s vacation day policy. I wrote back explaining that I was actually asking if there were any paid holidays, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc. that the office would be closed for. Four hours later, no response, so I called and she told me that she was asking the owner to answer my question. I told her I understood but asked if it would be safe to assume something like Christmas day. She told me she wouldn&#8217;t comment.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like this is a huge red flag, not only because of the possible lack of holiday pay with only five vacation days per year, but because I would be working in the HR department and the HR director doesn&#8217;t seem to have a concrete answer to what I think is a pretty basic question.</em></p>
<p><em>The office is small, but the company is not. It&#8217;s a restaurant group that owns two large bars and one restaurant. This position is being created to help the woman running HR with her overflowing work load. She&#8217;s been there for a few years, so I thought she would at least tell me if they were closed for Christmas. I don&#8217;t know if that means they weren&#8217;t planning on paying me for holidays, or what. I still haven&#8217;t heard back.</em></p>
<p>The uncertainty might be because bars and restaurants are often open on holidays, so it&#8217;s possible that this company is too, even though you&#8217;d be working in their administrative office. But honestly, the whole exchange feels a bit adversarial to me (on both sides &#8212; you calling her after only four hours of not hearing back, her refusing &#8220;to comment,&#8221; etc.), and that&#8217;s the bigger red flag to me than whatever their holiday policy is.</p>
<p><strong>3. Employer was interested in me for a job but I didn&#8217;t pass their electronic &#8220;values&#8221; screening</strong></p>
<p><em>I was recommended for a role by a freelancer who works with me and for the company which was creating the role. The manager was given my CV and was really impressed and forwarded it on to their recruitment person, who called me. We had a good talk and she said my experience and qualifications were a perfect fit for the role and that at the end of our conversation she felt I was what they were looking for. However, they had to advertise the role to satisfy their HR policy and so she asked me to officially apply online, which would go to their outsourced recruitment provider and she&#8217;d look out for my name when the candidate list came through.</em></p>
<p><em>So I filled out the 8-page application form (lots of competanc- based questions needing lots of examples), which I submitted, and this then led me to a values questionnaire. Of the 20 questions, I struggled with at least 5 because I felt they were hard to answer without knowing the company&#8217;s policy on certain areas (refunds, etc.) where you may want to take bold actions but until you know if you have the support of your employer in those decisions, you wouldn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>I have since received a computer-generated email saying I have been rejected because I don&#8217;t share enough of their values. Should I call the recruitment person and talk to her again? I&#8217;m disappointed that because of 20 questions, a computer has decided I don&#8217;t even get an interview despite already being told I have the qualities they&#8217;re looking for. Or should I just accept the rejection and move on?</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can contact her and see if she&#8217;d be willing to interview you anyway. It&#8217;ll depend on how rigid they are about their computer screening (which I agree sounds dumb).</p>
<p><strong>4. Listing volunteer work that includes multiple roles</strong></p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;ve volunteered for a while with the same organization but in different positions, how would you recommend putting the experience on your resume without taking up too much space by listing each role? In my case, I&#8217;ve been volunteering for an organization that provides adult English as a Second Language classes, and I&#8217;ve done individual tutoring, teaching a small class (once a week), and soon I&#8217;m planning to be a substitute teacher, as other responsibilities have become more demanding.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d list it all as one volunteer role, explaining briefly (in a single line) what the specifics are. For instance:</p>
<p>Volunteer Teacher, XYZ Organization: teach weekly ESL class, provide one-on-one tutoring to three students, fill in as substitute teacher for advanced classes</p>
<p><strong>5. What to ask when considering working internationally</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve applied for a job that is right in line with my experience and qualifications. The interesting thing is that it is an international position, where I would work about half-time from home and about half-time at international client sites. The position would be quite interesting, but it is the international travel that I&#8217;m wondering about. I&#8217;m excited about the potential opportunity, but I&#8217;m not even sure what I should be asking when considering a position in which I would be working in other countries significantly, as I&#8217;ve only had brief work-related experiences before. Any advice you (or your esteemed readers) might have would be much appreciated.</em></p>
<p>Readers, what advice do you have?</p>
<p><strong>6. Pursuing more education to change careers</strong></p>
<p><em>Nearly 5 years ago, I graduated with a Master&#8217;s in English. I pursued a Master&#8217;s in part because so many of my undergrad mentors/advisors/professors said that many more job opportunities would be open to me. Unfortunately, that has not been the case, and I&#8217;ve been stuck as an adjunct since I graduated. It&#8217;s become clear that I will probably never get a full-time teaching job. And the MA seems to make me appear overqualified for most other jobs (and lack of experience outside of academia makes me under-qualified).</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of returning to school for an AA or AS, perhaps in something like HR, just so I can get my foot in the door in another profession. But I know BA to MA to AA would look strange. Ultimately, I don&#8217;t know what to do: take on a little more debt in order to hopefully find a full-time job or take on no more debt (I still owe for my BA and MA) but perhaps work part-time forever.</em></p>
<p>Ugh, I&#8217;m sorry &#8212; this sucks. And yeah, BA to MA to AA is going to look strange, and there&#8217;s no point in taking on more debt. I wonder if a better path is to network your ass off and convince someone that you&#8217;re passionate about HR (or whatever you settle on) and to take a chance on you. Consider interning or volunteering in whatever field you want to move into too &#8212; that will help you get experience and also make contacts who you can then lobby to let you try your hand at more. (Also, the people who told you a MA in English would make you more marketable need their licenses to advise revoked.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Making a presentation in a job interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying for a marketing manager position. I passed the first round and now have the personal meeting with my potential director. Do you think it would be fine to make a short presentation (4 or 5 slides of powerpoint) of how my skills and experience can attend his/company&#8217;s needs? Although it hasn&#8217;t been required, the development of presentations is part of the job description.</em></p>
<p>If you mean something like your resume in presentation form, no. That&#8217;s going to be overkill and annoying. But if you mean a presentation about ideas you have for excelling in the role you&#8217;re interviewing for, then potentially yes &#8230; but the only way this works is if it&#8217;s incredibly compelling. If it&#8217;s not, it can actually hurt you. So the answer depends on what the content is and how truly awesome it&#8217;s going to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Sunday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should I intervene when one assistant is rude to another?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about tolerating rudeness. I am on a team of about 14 people, three of whom are assistants. I am a supervisor and have one associate director and two directors who I report to. My issue is that one of my assistants is being very mean to another (she is very nice to the third assistant, as well as everyone else), and I am not sure how (or if) I should handle it. The mean assistant will giggle and roll her eyes in a meeting after her counterpart says something (sometimes silly questions but she is clearly junior and still learning), will ask her personal questions in a disdainful tone, and is just generally not inclusive or nice to her. The non-mean assistant is generally a good worker and good at her job, very eager and well liked by members of other teams. She has not said anything to me about her mean counterpart and it seems to kind of roll off her back. As supervisor though, I hate to condone such outright mean-ness because it is done in front of me.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts? Should I make sure it&#8217;s mentioned in her review? (Someone else is reviewing her, but my manager is reviewing that review, so I can talk to her.) I feel like it shouldn&#8217;t be tolerated but am conflicted because it is affecting no one&#8217;s work.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you should absolutely say something to her, and don&#8217;t wait for her review. You should be giving her feedback all along, and this is absolutely an appropriate topic for you to talk to her about. Tell her that she needs to be pleasant and professional to everyone she works with, that it&#8217;s not acceptable to roll her eyes at coworkers or otherwise be rude to them, and that you expect her to immediately begin treating the other assistant pleasantly. And if you notice any more of it continuing after that, have a more serious conversation with her, as you would for any performance issue that wasn&#8217;t getting resolved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about whether something is affecting the work; it&#8217;s that she needs to act in accordance with the culture and values that you want reflected on your team, and that includes not making it an unpleasant environment for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>2. No room at the office lunch table</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a grad student who is interning full-time at a small company as part of my program. From noon until 1, the office closes for lunch. My supervisor is always trying to get me to come to the workplace lunchroom for lunch. However, every time I go, there is no room for me. I have been able to get a seat there three times in the last seven weeks. The room is very small (it is actually a meeting room) and there no available chairs to borrow so that I can join everyone. I have tried showing up 10 minutes early or 30 minute late to no avail.</em></p>
<p><em>I end up eating at my desk or going to the large conference room where there is room for everyone to sit. However, I am always alone in that big room! The office had a lunch meeting in there last week, and several people mentioned that they should move lunch to the big room. However, nothing changed. I do not want to miss out on opportunities for socializing and networking, so I attend all work events and going away parties, etc., but my supervisor is convinced that sitting in the lunch room is a good way to network at this company. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Since your supervisor is always trying to get you to join them for lunch, next time she mentions it, tell her why you can&#8217;t! &#8220;I&#8217;d love to, but when I&#8217;ve tried, there aren&#8217;t any chairs! What&#8217;s the secret to getting one?&#8221; You can also ask other coworkers the same thing &#8212; especially the next time you walk in to find the room full. I bet someone will make room for you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I get an MBA?</strong></p>
<p><em>For the last year or so, I have been struggling to identify what I want to do with my career. I finished my Ph.D. last May while working in a very high-profile job in the government. I loved my job, but a new director who did not have the same vision for my work left me feeling anxious and depressed. I ended up leaving that job for a position doing the same type of work at a small nonprofit. I still enjoy what I do and make a bit more money, but I&#8217;m finding that I thrive with a faster pace and higher visibility. I&#8217;ve been reading Lean In on my commutes lately and am realizing my goal is to get into more senior leadership at bigger organizations or government and have a more powerful and visible role. My Ph.D. gives me expertise in an albeit narrow field but I&#8217;m wondering if I should go pursue an MBA at night to help me achieve my goal. What else can I do to help get myself on that path? If it helps, I am 28 and about to get married with no kids.</em></p>
<p>Personally, a PhD and an MBA seems like overkill to me, but maybe there&#8217;s some justification for it. But I&#8217;d want to really know what that justification is &#8212; is an MBA truly necessary for what you want to do? I can&#8217;t tell from what&#8217;s here, but that&#8217;s the question to ask yourself. If it&#8217;s not required, then you&#8217;re better off getting the right work experience instead.</p>
<p><strong>4. Going from a research specialist to a research generalist</strong></p>
<p><em>My job is going to be eliminated in about a year and a half, and I am starting to look for a new position. I work in politics as a research analyst, but for the past 5 years I&#8217;ve focused on very specific issue areas that aren&#8217;t very marketable. I probably won&#8217;t be able to find a position doing the same issues I do now. That&#8217;s fine &#8212; in fact, I have become an expert on these issues mostly because my bosses needed someone to do them. They weren&#8217;t things I had prior knowledge or experience doing. My question is how to approach job opportunities that are in different issues, or how to market myself as someone who isn&#8217;t pigeonholed into a couple very obscure areas. I&#8217;m still looking to do policy analysis, but most of the jobs I&#8217;m seeing are either a lot more general than what I&#8217;m working on now, or are for different issues. I&#8217;m qualified for the analysis part, but I&#8217;m concerned with how to appeal to managers when I won&#8217;t necessarily have the particular issue expertise other candidates will probably have. I know for a lot of jobs this will be a sticking point and there&#8217;s not much I can do, but I&#8217;d love your advice on the best way to market myself for different areas.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re thinking this is more of a problem than it actually is. Unless you&#8217;re looking at job postings that specifically require experience in Issue X, generally policy research in one area makes you a fine candidate for policy research in another area. You know how to find information, judge what is and isn&#8217;t important, present it concisely, and become an expert in issues you previously knew nothing about. That&#8217;s the part you focus on when applying.</p>
<p><strong>5. Asking for a title bump</strong></p>
<p><em>I landed a fantastic short-term paid internship earlier this year. Thanks to your blog and commenters (I don&#8217;t comment, just read what others say), I&#8217;ve really been excelling at my position &#8212; so much so that my manager wants to keep me on after the internship ends! Long story short, the plan is to hire me on contract.</em></p>
<p><em>Currently, my title is intern. Would it be bad form to ask for a title bump &#8212; say, to assistant, so an entry-level title and nothing crazy? I&#8217;d really like to show some progression on my resume and somehow indicate that it wasn&#8217;t just a long internship. I&#8217;m not getting a raise (fine by me as it&#8217;s a nonprofit and I&#8217;m lucky for the contract when there are layoffs happening), so I&#8217;m not sure when or how I could ask as there aren&#8217;t going to be negotiations.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s completely reasonable to ask for. They may be planning something like that since you won&#8217;t be an intern anymore, but it&#8217;s totally fine to ask about now.</p>
<p><strong>6. My manager and I are applying for the same jobs</strong></p>
<p><em>One of my immediate supervisors and I are applying for many of the same jobs (and just, f.y.i., I&#8217;m really not applying for jobs that are over my head; it&#8217;s in academia where academic background is really important and I have a good work background, too). He is one of my references and an extremely strong one. There is at least one other person who I&#8217;m pretty sure would be willing to serve as a reference but it would be less strong because of knowing that person for a much shorter length of time and not having as close a relationship.</em></p>
<p><em>Basically, I&#8217;m wondering just how important references are. I think if my current reference and I apply to the same jobs, I&#8217;m not going to get a chance to interview because it would put the interviewer in an awkward position. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to use a weaker reference if that&#8217;s not the case. The supervisor and I have been discussing job searching, but I&#8217;m not about to ask him to tell me which jobs he&#8217;s applying for so that I know not to use him as a reference for those! It&#8217;s awkward either way, but I&#8217;m probably over-thinking this.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even worry about this. You don&#8217;t need to preemptively save hiring managers from the awkwardness of asking one candidate for a reference for the other; if you and your manager are both finalists for the same position, they&#8217;ll just ask you for other references if they want them. So it will be good to be prepared to supply others if asked, but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about it proactively.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Applying for jobs that require advanced degrees when I don&#8217;t have one</strong></p>
<p><em>I did not go to grad school for the <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2011/12/thinking-about-grad-school-think-again.html">kinds of reasons you cite</a> in your writing. Is it appropriate to apply for a job that lists an advanced degree as a requirement if I think my job experience qualifies me for the position? If so, is that something I should address directly in a cover letter?</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can absolutely do that, as long as it&#8217;s not a job that absolutely requires a graduate degree (as some do, like some teaching jobs, for instance, or practicing law). Some employers will consider you and some won&#8217;t, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with trying, particularly if you&#8217;re highly qualified aside from the degree.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I stay or should I go?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been working in a large nonprofit university for the past two years. I came on as an assistant and have been working here, heart and soul. I&#8217;m going to be finishing my Master&#8217;s degree this May and have a lot of technical experience as well. My problem is, I want to stay at my organization and can&#8217;t seem to find growth opportunities. Because of recent restructuring, I now have three supervisors in this department and this means three times the responsibility. They don&#8217;t need to manage me because I work independently and they know Ill get the job done.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been looking for other jobs at the company (the benefits are amazing, its prestigious, and other locations have excellent cohesive departments-so it seems) but can&#8217;t seem to find any. Should I start looking elsewhere? The growth I was promised when I started isn&#8217;t coming and it&#8217;s kind of a &#8220;boys club&#8221; department so I doubt they&#8217;ll try hard to make it happen, no matter how much they compliment my work (reluctantly I might add). I worry I may have to start over again and I don&#8217;t want to do that. I want to grow in college administration but I fear I&#8217;ll be stuck here as an admin forever. I&#8217;ve followed your amazing blog, presented really thought out projects with business proposals, attend networking events, etc. Should I stay or should I go?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d work from the assumption that nothing there is going to change since so far all signals point that way, and decide what you want to do with that knowledge. Are you willing to stay there for the next few years, without any promotion? If not, then yes, start looking around at other places.</p>
<p><strong>3. Asking about what a post-service-year job offer might look like, without committing to taking it</strong></p>
<p><em>The job I have now is not actually a job, but a “service year”, which means that I have a specific period of time that I am working with my organization (very tiny nonprofit). When my term of service ends in August my position is turning into a full-time staff position, and I have all but been offered the job. My supervisor has said “I hope you’re considering staying on” directly to me. So, it seems like they will offer me the position, but there has been no “official” offer.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not actually sure that I want to take the job. Maybe I just have “grass is greener” syndrome, but I’ve been thinking of looking for other jobs when my service ends. I work with a bunch of really nice people, but I am the youngest person by 30 years. I also sometimes feel that this position isn’t really right for me. I’m in a very direct service role but what I’m really interested in is more indirect service. It’s not like I struggle to do the work, I just feel like I could really shine in a different role.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d like to have a frank discussion with my supervisor about pay, benefits, vacation time, etc. before it’s too late for me to start searching for other jobs. Ideally, if I’m going to leave at the end of my service year, I’d like to have another job lined up. I’m not worried about looking like a job-hopper, because people in the nonprofit industry would understand by looking at my full job title why I only stayed for a year. So, do you have any suggestions about how to approach my supervisor about this? She is a pretty understanding person, so I’m not afraid of her flying off the handle or of being prematurely terminated. I’m more concerned about coming across like I’m only interested in what they can offer me, or that I don’t like the job and won’t be as committed if I stay on for another year.</em></p>
<p>Say something like this: &#8220;I really appreciate your mention that I might be able to continue in a full-time position after August. I know there are no guarantees of that at this point, but since I&#8217;m starting to think about making plans for that time, I wonder if you can talk to me about what the offer would look like if you did make one, as far as what the job would look like, the likely salary range, etc.&#8221; And you can either ask her about benefits or ask any coworker, since benefits are usually the same across the board, at least for junior level jobs.</p>
<p>If during the course of this conversation, she basically makes you an offer, it&#8217;s fine to just thank her, explain that you&#8217;ve only just started to think about what you&#8217;d like to do in August, and ask if you can have some time to think about your options.</p>
<p><strong>4. Answering questions about when I could start a new job</strong></p>
<p><em>I am currently job searching while still working a job. As I fill out applications, I get the standard &#8220;When can you start?&#8221; question. My honest answer is &#8220;After I give my current job my two weeks notice.&#8221; I make it clear that I would leave my current job if offered a new job, so it seems &#8220;after two weeks notice&#8221; would be the obvious answer. But is that too vague an answer to put down on an application or is that acceptable?</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s totally fine and normal.</p>
<p><strong>5. Why was this interview so unthorough?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve come to expect a kind of grilling at interviews, but recently I&#8217;ve gone to interviews where I was asked almost no questions. At a recent interview, most of the time was spent with the interviewer talking about the position and then me taking him through my resume. He asked questions about particular parts of my resume (but they were fact-based questions about what I did and not behavioral). It was almost too casual for a formal interview.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying to entry-level positions, so part of me thinks they might just be trying to figure out if they like me personally, since my experience is pretty limited. What do you think of this interview style? Is it related to the fact that I&#8217;m interviewing for entry level positions? Am I right in thinking it was more about fit and personality than relevant experience? I&#8217;ve had these types of interviews when I knew the interviewer previously, but I had never met this man before.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;s probably just an unskilled interviewer. They are legion.</p>
<p><strong>6. Part 2 of question #5</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a different question relating to the same interview above. The interviewer spent a large part of the beginning talking about the position and company, and I asked questions throughout this time. Then we did the whole resume walk through and question period, and then at the end of the interview he asked if I had any questions. I said I had none because they were already addressed at the beginning. He gave me a bit of a weird look, so I&#8217;m wondering if I should have asked additional questions, but really, we spent such a large time talking about the position and company at the beginning that I was all out (although I probably could have made up a few about culture and whatnot).</em></p>
<p>If it was truly a conversational back-and-forth, then I can understand feeling like everything you were prepared to ask had already been answered &#8230; but I always wonder how it can really be when someone says they were left with no questions. This is, after all, a job that you&#8217;d be spending 40+ hours a week at for potentially years. When you think about the enormity of what you&#8217;re potentially signing up for, do you really have <em>no</em> other questions that you&#8217;re wondering about the work, the culture, the expectations, the management?</p>
<p><strong>7. Should I contact this employer again?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied to a job almost three and a half weeks ago. The day after I applied, they called me after 5:30 pm and left a voice mail. I called back the following day (after 5:00 pm because it’d be difficult to call earlier and I thought it’d be okay since they called me late) and left them a message. I called again (earlier) the next day after that, and they answered, but had to go to a meeting and said they’d call me back. They didn’t call me back. I then had a medical emergency that I didn’t recover from for three weeks, so I wasn’t able to call back again myself. Should I call them and explain I’m still interested but couldn’t call sooner because of a medical emergency? Should I just apply again if I see them posting a similar position? Am I too much of a nuisance at this point for them to want to deal with me?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason you need to explain not calling them back; you made the last contact, so the ball was in their court. You can certainly follow up again, but it sounds like at this point they&#8217;ve probably moved on with other candidates (which isn&#8217;t your fault for not calling them back, because you did). You can definitely apply again in the future though.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work for a large California-based software company but live in on the East Coast. I came to this company through an acquisition, and while they retained the small office we previously operated out of, my specific job is based in Los Angeles. Specifically, I travel to the West Coast for two to three weeks of the month, every month (fly out Sunday night, return on the red-eye Thursday).</em></p>
<p><em>The significant travel, as well as a general bad fit in the role, has led me to a serious job search. I have stayed with the acquiring company for over a year and they have been great to me. I have even discussed my concerns with my current boss and he is supportive and interested in finding me another role internally, but unless I move to California, any role will require the travel and being a remote employee is not for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, the question: do I have to resign in person? If I accept a job during a week that I&#8217;m actually at home, should I wait until I actually see my boss to have the conversation? Best case is obviously to accept a job while I&#8217;m already there, worst case is that there could be up to nine business days between accepting a job and seeing him. I&#8217;d like to transition out of my role as soon as possible, while still giving two weeks notice. I am also sensitive to the cost of the travel. Each week they spend ~$1400 on my airfare, hotel, rental car and expenses.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it rude to resign over the phone? Will they think it&#8217;s disrespectful to continue to spend company money when I know that I&#8217;m leaving? I want to be respectful of both my current employer and the potential new employer by giving two weeks, but also moving to the new role as quickly as possible.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely not rude to resign over the phone. This isn&#8217;t like a break-up, where you owe it to the other person to talk face-to-face. The vast, vast majority of managers just want to receive your notice as early as possible, so that they have as much time as possible to plan for the transition, and they don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s in person or not.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s still more professional to do it in person if you&#8217;re in the same location, so this isn&#8217;t license to send off a resignation email and hide in your office when your boss is right down the hall. But when you&#8217;re not in the same location, a phone call is absolutely fine &#8212; particularly when the alternative means waiting days or weeks.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re talking about methods of delivering resignations, here are two other things people don&#8217;t always realize:</p>
<p>* You tell your boss first. But if your boss is unreachable &#8212; out of the country on vacation for more than a couple of more days, for instance, or in the hospital with ebola &#8212; then you give your notice to your boss&#8217;s boss (or possibly HR if that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done in your company). You don&#8217;t need to sit around waiting for your boss to come back, if it&#8217;s going to be a while &#8212; or even if it&#8217;s not going to be that long, if it would mean eating in to an already short notice period. (In other words, if you&#8217;re giving six weeks notice, it&#8217;s fine to wait a couple of days until your manager&#8217;s ebola clears up. If you&#8217;re leaving two weeks from today, then you need to tell someone that today.)</p>
<p>* People often think they have to write a formal resignation letter. While you can certainly do this if you want to, lots of people don&#8217;t and many employers don&#8217;t ask for them. But when they do, the point is to simply document that you resigned and what date it will be effective (in case you later sue, or file for unemployment and claim you were laid off, for instance). It only needs to be about two sentences. It&#8217;s not supposed to be an explanation of why you&#8217;re leaving, and what could have made you stay, and the drama you&#8217;ve had with your boss. You can certainly cover that in the resignation <em>conversation</em>, if you feel like it &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t go in a letter.</p>
<p>This is your letter, if you need one at all: &#8220;This letter is to let you know that I&#8217;m resigning my position, effective May 1. I&#8217;ve enjoyed my time here and wish Chocolate Teapots Inc. the best of luck.&#8221; The end.</p>
<p>(And if you use a letter &#8212; which, again, you often don&#8217;t need to &#8212; you do <em>not</em> break the news this way. The letter comes after the conversation. Its purpose is documenting, not announcing.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m moving to a new city in a couple of months to follow my partner to his new academic job, so I&#8217;m beginning a job search. I don&#8217;t know anyone well in this city, though I have a few distant contacts, professional and personal, with ties to the area, i.e. a man I collaborated with briefly in a different city when I and I were both working for different organizations; a woman my grad school adviser went to grad school with and who still works in the dept. they both got their phDs from; a former colleague who grew up nearby, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, there are some people I can start networking with, and people I might be referred to by people I know pretty well, but no one I know very well directly or have a lot of personal experience with. My question is: What do I say to these people? I&#8217;ve read questions you&#8217;ve answered before about networking, and I know a lot of things NOT to do &#8212; don&#8217;t ask a lot of general questions, don&#8217;t take up too much time, don&#8217;t make vague inquiries, don&#8217;t ask for a job, and I get those. But where I&#8217;m struggling is in coming up with pithy, meaningful questions can I ask for help with in an introductory email or coffee meeting. If I was just out of college, I would ask for help understanding the field. But I&#8217;m mid-career, I understand my field(s) pretty well, and I want to come across as knowledgeable, not naive. All I can think of to ask is for other people to network with, but that just would seem to send me in a circle of content-less conversations.</em></p>
<p><em>Part of the problem may be that I hate networking just as much as you say that you do&#8230;and I want to make myself a general roadmap to guide me through these situations, rather than winging it.</em></p>
<p>Well, if you think about this as just a back-door way to make contacts, it&#8217;ll be hard to come up much to say, because you&#8217;ll be focused on the wrong thing: just adding a person to your list of people you know. You&#8217;ll be thinking about just wanting to check off a box instead of genuinely getting to know them, and that screams &#8220;networking for networking&#8217;s sake,&#8221; which makes people like you and me blanch.</p>
<p>So instead, think about what you&#8217;d genuinely like to know about your industry in your new city. When you imagine trying to find a new job in this city, what do you wish you knew? Do you have questions about firms there, people, trends, salary ranges? Are there good networking groups or do they suck? What&#8217;s the scoop on the top firms in your field there? Is Company X really family-friendly, or is that hype? What&#8217;s up with Company&#8217;s Y weird campaign from last year? And so forth.</p>
<p>If you had a magic genie who would tell you anything at all about your industry there, what would you ask? I bet you do have questions when you think of it like that. That&#8217;s the stuff to ask these people.</p>
<p>What other tips do people have?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Well, some of them are short. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Can you block off time on your calendar for your own projects?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it considered bad form to block off time on my calendar when I have a deadline? Two days a week, I&#8217;m tied up the whole afternoon because I have an evening deadline. (This isn&#8217;t procrastination; I get the handoff from others around noon and I have to be done with my part by the end of the day.) The people I regularly work with know this, but they often (understandably) forget which afternoons, and people I work with less frequently don&#8217;t know about my schedule. The result is that I have to continue to decline conference call invitations or remind people that I won&#8217;t have time to meet on Wednesday but Thursday works, creating more back-and-forth. Would it be frowned upon to create a recurring appointment on my Outlook calendar for those afternoons to mark that time as busy, considering it&#8217;s not really an appointment, it&#8217;s just regular work?</em></p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s <em>good</em> form. Getting your work done is at least important, generally more so, than most conference calls or meetings. Setting aside work blocks on your calendar is a good idea, both for conveying to others that that time is reserved and also for conveying it to yourself so you don&#8217;t schedule over it with less important things too. I&#8217;m a huge advocate of this &#8212; do it!</p>
<p><strong>2. Can I push back on this schedule change?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in a salaried full-time position. I work a 4/10 schedule (4 days a week, 10 hours a day), and commute an hour in each direction to make it to my job. Add on the branch mandatory lunch (which I never take), and that makes my work days 13 hours long.</em></p>
<p><em>My manager has proposed a schedule change which would not make my days longer on paper, but with changes in traffic patterns would effectively make my day over an hour longer—bringing me to 14 hours either spent at work or commuting. I will also be forced to miss necessary medical appointments. There is no room for negotiation, and my protests were met with how I should be happy because I have the best schedule, the easiest job (a job with one of the highest rates of burnout? I think not), and the fewest obligations because I’m single and don’t have children. Do I have any recourse?</em></p>
<p>Well, you can certainly make your case against the proposed schedule change. But ultimately it&#8217;s up to your manager. At that point you&#8217;d need to decide whether you want the job under these changed terms or not.</p>
<p>You could certainly point out, though, that citing your marital/parental status as part of the justification for your schedule change is problematic. (There&#8217;s no real legal issue there, both because few states protect against discrimination on those fronts and because that&#8217;s not the <em>reason</em> for the change, just part of his lame efforts to tell you why you shouldn&#8217;t care, but it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to point it out anyway.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Coworkers are pushing me to badmouth my predecessor, who I like</strong></p>
<p><em>I work as the director of my division in a large organization. My predecessor, who stepped down about a year ago, was my supervisor and was a great mentor to me. We still stay in touch and he has told me that he is willing to recommend me in the future (I am confident he would give me a great reference). However, the organization just wasn&#8217;t a fit for him and he was not well-liked by most of our colleagues.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that he has left and I have filled his position, on numerous occasions my colleagues (including people senior in the organization) have approached me to complain about his work and tell me how much better I am in the role than he was. Sometimes they will really push to try to get me to talk badly about him (&#8220;Can you believe so-and-so did that? What was he thinking?&#8221;). I obviously don&#8217;t want to engage in this because it&#8217;s so unprofessional. I would be horrified if it ever got back to him that I was involved in a conversation like this (in fact, it already worries me that it might, even though I haven&#8217;t said anything and am just on the receiving end). At the same time, if I say something in his defense (or even just say nothing), I&#8217;m pretty sure my colleagues will think I stand behind his work and will think less of me as a result. Any advice?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the kind words about my work &#8212; I appreciate it! I know the fit here wasn&#8217;t a great one for Bob, but he&#8217;s a good guy.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re still pressed to say something negative or listen to them badmouth him after that: &#8220;I have a good relationship with him,&#8221; said in a pleasant tone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;re going to think less of you for either of those statements, unless Bob molested puppies or something.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can&#8217;t work out my two weeks notice</strong></p>
<p><em>I gave my two weeks notice to my boss after finding out my family would be moving to another state because my fiance was offered a better job. But they need him to start immediately, meaning I can&#8217;t fulfill my entire two weeks left. This would deem me not eligible for re-hire. Is this going to make it impossible for me to find a new job if I just don&#8217;t show up for the rest of the schedule?</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;d just stop showing up, right? You&#8217;re planning to talk to your manager and <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/04/19/when-you-cant-give-two-weeks-notice">explain the situation</a>, apologize, and ask for leeway? If you do that, your manager will probably be understanding. But yeah, if you just stop showing up without doing that, that would be a huge bridge-burner and reputation killer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Explaining post-graduation work as a server</strong></p>
<p><em>I graduated last May and continued working for a high-end resort as a server in one of their restaurants. My degree is in hospitality and tourism management so it is related. I planned on doing it just for the summer because I made more than I could make at any entry level job in my field. My husband is in the military and we were told that we were moving in September so I stayed. Then it got pushed to November and I didn&#8217;t want to apply, be accepted and then leave 2 months later. This continued until we finally moved in January.</em></p>
<p><em>How do I explain this in interviews when I&#8217;m asked why I didn&#8217;t go after a higher position in interviews? Being a server taught me many things and I know I can use these skills to sell myself in an interview, but I&#8217;m stumped on how to answer the question of why I stayed on as a server instead of going after a higher job. I&#8217;m hesitant to mention the husband in the military thing since I don&#8217;t want it to seem as if we will be moving again soon.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I&#8217;d be relocating soon, and I didn&#8217;t want to commit to a new job and have to leave it a few months later. But the work taught me (fill in the blank).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6. Can recruiter stop me from applying to a company directly?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m working with a legal recruiting firm. I am a paralegal/legal assistant. My recruiter tells me this scenario: They submit my resume for position XYZ at a very large law firm (100-plus attorneys). That same law firm advertises on Craigslist and any other form of recruiting they can. The recruiter has told me that if position ABC comes available in that firm, I cannot contact that firm directly, that I need to work through the recruiter because previously they submitted me for position XYZ. I&#8217;m told this is the policy for 12 months. This language is nowhere in their placement agreement with me. Can they prevent me from working directly with this firm on other positions?</em></p>
<p>They can&#8217;t stop you from applying directly if you&#8217;d like to, but that company has a contract with this recruiter stating that the recruiter &#8220;owns&#8221; any candidates they submit for 12 months &#8212; meaning that even if you apply with the company directly during that period, the recruiter will still be owed a fee on your candidacy. Because of that, the company itself is going to want you to go through the recruiter, since that&#8217;s the contract they have with that agency. (This is typical of how most recruiters work. And while the contact is with the company, not with you, the company is going to abide by it where you&#8217;re concerned.)</p>
<p><strong>7. How does my daughter explain a cruise ship firing?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m asking this question on behalf of my daughter, who has just graduated college with a degree in recreation and hopes to be hired for her dream job as a youth counselor for a cruise line. She did a two-week cruise internship over Christmas break 2011, and last summer worked for the same company on their Alaska cruises, working on three different ships in the fleet. She loved her job, loved the company, loved the kids, and was having the best summer. There was a very busy day when she was working alone with a group of kids (usually there are two counselors), and a child in her care slipped away unnoticed before being picked up by his parents. The checkout sheet was unsigned at the end of the session, but because she had seen the parents come by the kids club several times that morning she thought they had picked him up, and she didn&#8217;t report it to her supervisor. The parents noted the situation in their comment card at the end of the cruise, and without verbal or written warning she was terminated, confined to her cabin until the next port and put ashore in Juneau. The cruise line did provide a plane ticket home. It was traumatic, embarrassing, scary and demoralizing.</em></p>
<p><em>She still dreams of working for a cruise line. Cruise jobs are very competitive, so she needs her previous cruise experience to even be considered for an interview. Her supervisor from one of the ships has offered to be a reference for her. She is preparing responses for an interview, but the application is somewhat of an obstacle, especially the question &#8220;why did you leave your last job?&#8221; The Alaska cruises were a summer job, as she was returning to college full-time in September, so would it be acceptable to respond that this was &#8220;seasonal work&#8221;? Or should she give an ambiguous explanation such as &#8220;job ended&#8221;? One person suggested writing &#8220;willing to discuss at interview.&#8221; We have been advised that the cruise line HR office will provide confirmation of job title and dates of employment, and will state that she is not suitable for rehire. They may or may not refer inquiries to the hiring officer who has her personnel file for further information. </em><em>So how does she fill out her application? How does she balance being truthful while making herself an attractive candidate?</em></p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing: Letting a child disappear while under her care is a Big Deal. You and she realize that, right? While it might have been &#8220;demoralizing&#8221; for her to be fired without warning, it was terrifying for those parents and could have ended much worse than it did. And it was utterly reasonable to fire her without warning. It sounds like you don&#8217;t realize that, which worries me.</p>
<p>And this an especially big deal when she&#8217;s applying for jobs that would have her supervising kids again. It&#8217;s likely going to be prohibitive. While I understand that she wants to include the cruise experience to help her get a future cruise job, it&#8217;s not going to help her. Imagine if it happens again and something happens to the child, and it comes out the the company hired her knowing that it had happened before.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s probably better off getting other job experience for a while, and then trying again. But it&#8217;s not ever going to help her to include this job on her resume, because it will probably be disqualifying &#8230; and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be misleading about why she left it; they will verify, and discovering that she was disingenuous will only make things worse.</p>

<p><em>Shortly before I retired a few months ago, the company I worked for declined my offer to come back and work for them on contract, as needed. Now a coworker is calling me, from time to time, for professional advice.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not &#8220;where&#8217;s the X file&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s the password&#8221; kind of advice. It&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8217;ve tried X, X, X, and X, and it still isn&#8217;t in spec. What would you do?&#8221; It took me 7 years of college in a math and science field, and over 30 years of highly specialized training and experience become an expert, and be able to answer such questions.</em></p>
<p><em>The days of corporate paternalism toward loyal, hard-working employees are long past, and after experiencing the change in corporate culture the last ten or so years, I do not feel especially generous to my old employer. I do value the friendship of the coworker making the call, however. The company downsized recently and there is too much work for too few workers. Getting him in hot water is the last thing I want to do.</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps time to again offer the company my contract services, without telling them they&#8217;ve already been getting them?</em></p>
<p>Since they already turned down the idea, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll have more luck offering the company consulting this services this time, particularly if you don&#8217;t tell them that you&#8217;ve already been advising your former coworker. But I wouldn&#8217;t approach them and explain that you have been doing that, either, because you risk making the former coworker look a little bad in the process &#8212; the subtext being, &#8220;Joe can&#8217;t do his job without my help.&#8221; And if he&#8217;s just been asking you informally because he finds your perspective helpful, without thinking of it as consulting per se &#8212; which is likely &#8212; then you risk causing weirdness for him and tension in your relationship.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;d say something directly to him. For instance: &#8220;You know, I&#8217;d be glad to set up a consulting arrangement to answer some of this stuff. Is that worth talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>If your coworker has any ability to pick up on cues, he&#8217;s going to understand that this means that without such an arrangement, he can&#8217;t keep coming to you for help. And if he doesn&#8217;t pick up on cues and he continues to ask, then you say directly, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to help, but at this point I think we probably need to set up a consulting contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll then either (a) stop bringing his questions to you or (b) make the case for a consulting contract to whoever would have to approve it. But prepared for the company not to go for that unless your former coworker really goes to bat for it and lays out a strong case for why it&#8217;s necessary. That&#8217;s because, while I&#8217;m sure you <em>are</em> making his job easier, businesses generally feel able to go on after someone leaves &#8212; while still being quite happy to accept their help for free if they&#8217;re offering it. In other words, be prepared for the fact that however helpful your former coworker finds talking to you, it still might not reach the level that would justify a consulting gig. Or it might &#8212; who knows.</p>
<p>But either way, you&#8217;ll have set up some boundaries and have made it clear that you aren&#8217;t going to be providing advice for free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I got a PhD in medieval studies. Not exactly the most practical field, but I learned a lot about abstract thinking, analytical skills, and data mining. Transcribing and translating medieval Latin isn&#8217;t exactly easy, after all.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it took me over a year and a half to find a job in the private field. And what happened? I&#8217;ve excelled so much that, since I was hired, my entire department had its budget doubled, and my manager has credited me with most of our success.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not trying to brag, but I want to make a point: nowadays, if you have a degree in making green widgets, hiring managers will throw your application in the trash if the job is making brown widgets. This is simply messed up and stupid. The fact is that there are a lot of very intelligent, well-educated people who could easily do great jobs if they were given a chance.</em></p>
<p><em>So my question: why can&#8217;t managers appreciate transferrable skills and hire more very qualified, intelligent people?</em></p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re unproven, and you&#8217;re competing against candidates who <em>are</em> proven.</p>
<p>In this job market, there are tons of well-qualified candidates for nearly every opening. Employers have no incentive to take a risk on someone without a track record in what they&#8217;re looking for when they have plenty of good candidates who do have that track record.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like asking why you&#8217;d hire the smart, warm nanny applicant who has a track record of doing a good job taking care of kids over the smart, warm nanny applicant who has only cared for animals in the past. There are some transferable skills there &#8212; but you&#8217;re probably going to go with the person with the track record actually doing the work you&#8217;re hiring for, unless there&#8217;s something about the other person that really impresses you, enough to trump the experience issue. The other candidate might have turned out to be fantastic at the job &#8212; but you&#8217;d rather not let your kids be her testing ground.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s a question of smart, capable people with no direct experience but transferable skills against not-so-smart-or-capable people with direct experience. There are smart, capable people in both groups, so of course the smart, capable people with direct experience are the most attractive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hiring is in part about managing risk. You might decide in some extenuating circumstances to take a risk on someone untested, but it&#8217;s certainly no way to hire as a matter of general routine. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the people you&#8217;re rejecting would all have performed poorly; it just means that you&#8217;re going with the more certain option.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means that hiring managers never take a chance on people who are less tested. They do &#8212; you&#8217;re a prime example of that. But surely you can understand why that&#8217;s more the exception than the rule when employers have plenty of options, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been at the same company for nearly 12 years, and during that time, the company has nearly tripled in sales and number of employees. I started as basically a clerk and as the company grew, I eventually worked my way into a manager’s position with 6 employees in my department. My level of responsibility has steadily increased and I’ve continued my education and have obtained specific certifications for my field, raising the sophistication in the operation of my department. I feel that within a few years, I may be ready to move on beyond what the company can provide in terms of challenge and opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>I have recently had some conversations with recruiters and other hiring types, and have been told that while longevity was once a good thing to have, these days potential employers could look at my length of time at the same company as a strike against me. They’re saying that someone could look at me and think that I’m either locked into my present company’s way of thinking and that could be hard to break, or that I’ve simply become stale, stuck in a rut, and will always be there. I think I’ve gotten to where I am in part because I’ve always challenged the current way of thinking, including my own sometimes, so this is definitely not the case with me. Is this a trend in hiring? If so, how would I address this when I do start searching?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a point where staying too long at one place can raise questions about how you’ll adapt to new environments. I can’t pinpoint exactly when that is — it’s somewhere more than 8 years but well before 20.</p>
<p>The worry is that you&#8217;ll be stuck in one company’s way of doing things, won’t have been exposed to a wider variety of practices and cultures, and thus won’t adapt easily. So anything you can do to demonstrate that’s not the case is helpful. Certainly being able to show a progression in responsibilities and job titles &#8212; as you can &#8212; is helpful, and you should think about what else you can use to demonstrate that you&#8217;re flexible, open to change, and don&#8217;t have an insular viewpoint.</p>
<p>And for anyone who&#8217;s now worrying about what this means for them, this isn&#8217;t necessarily a deal-breaker and it certainly doesn&#8217;t mean that you should leave a job you love before you want to &#8230; but you should be aware that it could be a potential concern for future employers, and balance it against other factors.</p>
<p>And this is <em>not</em> a license to engage in <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/02/06/are-you-a-job-hopper">job-hopping</a>, which is far, far more harmful to your ability to get the future jobs you want.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Can you submit mileage reimbursements for only a few dollars?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m filling out last month&#8217;s out of pocket expenses and find myself wanting to make several mileage reimbursement requests for a few dollars each. Normally I might have one or two requests a month for about $20 or $30, but last month I had to make several errand runs for work.</em></p>
<p><em>As a manager, would you see the low mileage reimbursement requests as petty? I hate to be seen as someone who nickels and dimes the company, but I&#8217;m short on money and get nickle and dimed a lot myself. I usually don&#8217;t request reimbursement for the 50 cents I stick into the parking meters when I have to park in the city. I also can&#8217;t request mileage reimbursement if I have to travel to our site that&#8217;s further away (because it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;normal&#8221; part of my job duties to work there several times a year.) That trip alone is 70 miles round trip extra than I normally commute and I didn&#8217;t understand that I wouldn&#8217;t get reimbursed when I took this job. I guess I feel like at least by requesting a few dollars here and there, I can make up some of the losses I take as part of work. But I don&#8217;t want to hurt my relationship with my boss or company to do so.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give it another thought. You spent the money on a work expense that they&#8217;ve told you they reimburse, so it&#8217;s fine to submit it. I wouldn&#8217;t question it at all if an employee submitted low mileage reimbursements like this.</p>
<p><strong>2. I regret making a counteroffer to an employee</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a manager of a team of four analysts in a small field office overseas. Recently, one of my staff received an outside offer at another company. I gave him a modest counteroffer, including an upgrade in title from analyst to senior analyst. While his work is decent, it is not outstanding, and I would have not promoted him under normal circumstances, although I would have considered it in the next 8-10 months. He does an equally OK job as to someone I would hire new, so I promoted him to retain him, not because of his performance.</em></p>
<p><em>So, I have read your posts on <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/09/why-you-shouldnt-use-counteroffers-to-prevent-employees-from-leaving.html">counteroffers</a>, and now have a related question. As predicted, the day after this person&#8217;s promotion, another staff came to me completely demotivated. She has worked at our organization in the same role for the same amount of time. While she does have some issues, when you get down to it, she does outperform the newly promoted staff. She came to me asking for clarity about how one actually gets promoted at our organization.</em></p>
<p><em>I regret making the counteroffer/promotion, and realize it was my mistake. However, now I am stuck with it. How do I deal? I am trying to manage the newly promoted person to perform better and live up to his new title. But, what messages do I give to the rightfully disgruntled staff? Obviously, I can&#8217;t take her aside and say, &#8220;Hey, I know your coworker is kind of crappy, but got another job offer and I didn&#8217;t want to hire somebody else, so tough luck!&#8221; How do I manage my way out of this one?</em></p>
<p>I wish I had an answer, but I don&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t really justify promoting someone whose work doesn&#8217;t merit it, or even justify trying to retain the person by other means if their work isn&#8217;t outstanding. And because there&#8217;s no justification, I can&#8217;t think of any way to explain this to the coworker or mollify her very understandable frustration. (And to make matters worse, you might end up losing the better employee because of the attempt to keep the worse employee.) This is a clusterfudge.</p>
<p><strong>3. Putting a school career day presentation on my resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I presented at a school career day as a representative of an organization that I volunteer with. Should I include this as an achievement on my resume? I don’t have any children that attend the school (I don’t have children at all) so this was not something that I had to do. I was honored to be asked to present (although I don’t feel I really have a career at the moment) and I think that I did a great job. What do you think? For background, I would like you to know that I didn’t just talk. I created an experiment and conducted it in front of the students. In one class, I had the students separated into groups and they did the experiments with the help of the teachers and my instructions.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s cool that you did it (and I am sort of obsessed with school career days), but it&#8217;s not really resume-worthy. It was a one-day (one hour, probably) thing without accompanying evaluation or accountability, so it doesn&#8217;t really meet the bar for a resume.</p>
<p><strong>4. Applying for a job when a friend works in the same department</strong></p>
<p><em>I am applying for a position for a company that I am totally excited about. I meet the qualifications for the position that I am applying for, and I feel like I would excel in the work environment that they project. A college friend whom I haven&#8217;t kept in much contact with (I&#8217;m only a few years out), has worked for the company for 3+ years in the department that I am applying for. What is the most appropriate way to request her help? Ideally, I would love her to put a word in for me. How do I approach this situation without being presumptuous that she would do so?</em></p>
<p>Email her and let her know that you applied for the position, and tell her that you&#8217;d love any advice that she has. You don&#8217;t need to ask her to put in a good word for you; most people will do that on their own if they think you&#8217;d be a good candidate, and asking for it directly can be awkward, since the subtext of &#8220;I&#8217;m applying for a job on your team&#8221; is generally going to be &#8220;and I&#8217;d like the job and would love your help.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Is it ever okay to call to follow up after an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m contemplating when and how to follow-up after a final interview I had with an organization on March 19. It was 2.5 hours of back-to-back interviews with 3 people, which I thought went quite well. Of course, I have debated that issue many times in my head since. The hiring manager said that she would get back to me by the that Friday, but didn&#8217;t seem 100% sure about that. I sent my thank-you&#8217;s, and one of the 3 people said that they had one more candidate to interview that week before making a decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Friday passed. The following Thursday I hadn&#8217;t heard anything yet, so (based on my findings on your site) I sent an email asking for a timeline update in the afternoon. Still no response. A friend told me that I should call &#8230; Is it ever ok to call? If I were to call, I think I should at least give them a week after I asked for the update.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a junior-level management position at a large non-profit. Technically it is a new position that they want to fill &#8220;immediately.&#8221; They are reorganizing the management to create a more effective team.</em></p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing: If they want to make you a job offer, they are going to contact you and do it. They&#8217;re not going to be dragging their feet and only remember when you call them. So calling is likely to result only in (a) another lack of response, (b) a vague response (&#8220;we&#8217;ll be in touch once we have a decision&#8221;), or (c) a rejection. And yes, a rejection would give you closure, but frankly, you&#8217;re better off giving yourself closure right now and mentally moving on, and letting it be a pleasant surprise if they do offer you the job. Trust that if they want to hire you, they&#8217;ll get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>6. Listing a childcare business on my resume when my field is accounting</strong></p>
<p><em>Several years ago, I had to quit a job because the child custody and child support legal battle got to be too much for me to handle as a professional accountant and mother. I took a 6-month break then to plan a childcare business, which thrived for about a 16 months. Although this is a break in my accounting experience, I proudly list it on my resume because (a) I need to account for the time and (b) it shows the entrepreneurship in me. A girlfriend says I should list the childcare business in a section captioned &#8220;Other Experience.&#8221; What is your advice?</em></p>
<p>I agree with her. I wouldn&#8217;t kick off your main experience section with it because it&#8217;s not what you want to most showcase, but an &#8220;other experience&#8221; section is perfect for it.</p>
<p><strong>7. Getting an MA while job-searching</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m getting conflicting advice about this from my friends, so wanted to get your opinion. I am in the process of job hunting, and I have been looking for about 3 months now and finally got my first phone interview coming up this week. I decided a few weeks ago to apply for my MA in intercultural and international communications, because I need a plan B. If finding a job is going to take me several months (perhaps even a year), I want to make good use of my time, and getting my MA has always been on my &#8220;don&#8217;t want to call it a bucket list-bucket list.&#8221; The university is in another province, but it is about 80% online. I would have to go to the campus for two weeks in September or October for the in-class portion of the program, and the following year I will be out of country for three weeks for the placement portion of the program. But other than that, I can do the coursework at home. Therefore, I can continue to do this even if I got a job, which is why this program works so well for me.</em></p>
<p><em>First, does studying for my MA help bridge the gap in my resume? I am currently unemployed and have been since the end of November. I recently moved back to the country which is the reason for my unemployment. I figure the longer it takes to find a job, the bigger the gap will be since my last job. Second, when in the interview process should I bring up the part about needing two weeks to attend university classes as part of my MA? Would this be a deal-breaker for most hiring managers? In my opinion, improving my education and skills will only benefit my employer, as this program compliments most of the positions I am applying for and matches well with my skill set.</em></p>
<p>Since the program is one that you&#8217;re arguing won&#8217;t interfere with full-time work, it&#8217;s not quite as good of a resume gap-filler as a traditional program would be &#8230; but it&#8217;s not nothing either, and you can certainly use it.</p>
<p>As for when to bring up the time you&#8217;ll need off, I&#8217;d wait until you have an offer and negotiate it then as part of your overall negotiations. The two weeks shouldn&#8217;t be a deal-breaker for most jobs (although you might need to take it unpaid if you don&#8217;t have enough vacation accrued by then). The three weeks next year will be more unusual for most jobs, so make sure that you include that as part of your negotiations too &#8212; you don&#8217;t want to find out next year that they won&#8217;t let you take three weeks at once.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m currently working for a company I&#8217;ve been with for nearly a decade. The positions I can promote to are very few and unlikely to be vacated anytime soon. I&#8217;ve been at my level now for 3+ years. It&#8217;s time to move on.</em></p>
<p><em>I interviewed with a promising young company (let&#8217;s call them PYC) this morning, and by lunchtime they reached out with an enthusiastic offer below my current base salary, which won&#8217;t work for me. I countered with a base salary match and indicated that if the upside was worth the risk (meaning a generous stack of options), we&#8217;d be a lot closer to a deal. PYC stressed that they&#8217;d get back to me by the end of the day with numbers so that I could proceed with giving two weeks notice right away, as they want someone to start ASAP.</em></p>
<p><em>To complicate things, I have more interviews with other companies this week &#8212; exciting, big time companies! &#8212; and while they&#8217;ll almost certainly come with higher pay, it&#8217;s doubtful they&#8217;ll match that critical risk/upside component. While both are important to me, this offer is putting me on the spot! If PYC offers a base salary match, the same amount of vacation, a title upgrade AND enough options to calm my nerves, is that a good offer, or am I jumping the gun? The rush is spooking me a little; it&#8217;s not the way I&#8217;m used to making decisions. Should I be rightfully spooked or is this just my decade of being off-market showing?</em></p>
<p><em>I think they&#8217;re going to be extremely successful. I want to be part of it, the folks I met today were great, and the ship appears to be in great shape.</em></p>
<p>There are really two separate questions here: Should you be spooked that they&#8217;re moving so quickly and pressuring you to as well, and can you slow them down?</p>
<p>First, should you be spooked? Maybe. There are certainly companies that move this quickly, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that people don&#8217;t end up happy there. But at a minimum, they&#8217;re probably not great at hiring if they&#8217;re offering people jobs only hours after interviewing them for the first time. (They&#8217;re almost certainly not checking references, for one thing, although maybe they had already talked informally with people who have worked with you.) And if they&#8217;re not great at hiring, that means that you&#8217;re probably going to have some less-than-great coworkers, unless they&#8217;re really good at cleaning up hiring mistakes quickly.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also assuming that <em>you</em> can and should make a decision as quickly as they have. But deciding where to work is a big, big decision, and they should want you to think it through and be absolutely sure that it&#8217;s right for you. The fact that they&#8217;re not thinking of it that way indicates that they&#8217;re either pretty inexperienced or not quite reasonable in their expectations. Those can both be bad, in different ways. If they&#8217;re inexperienced, what else haven&#8217;t they thought through or had experience dealing with yet, and how will that affect (a) their business and (b) your quality of life as an employee? (Are they experienced enough to make reliable revenue projections? Is your health insurance going to lapse because they&#8217;re clueless about what needs to be done to keep it current? And so forth.) Or, if they&#8217;re experienced enough but just not quite reasonable in what they expect of people, will their expectations be any more reasonable when it comes to things like time off, workload, etc.?</p>
<p>Now, despite what it might sound like, I&#8217;m not pre-judging this. This might be a great offer that you should be excited to take. But these are all things you want to think through without blinders on.</p>
<p>As for the second question &#8230; You should absolutely be able to slow them down. It&#8217;s entirely reasonable to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in joining you, and I&#8217;m excited about the position. However, I need some time to think over the offer and the position and make sure that it&#8217;s right for me. Can I give you my answer by Monday?&#8221; (And in the meantime, you should feel free to ask for an additional conversation if you have unanswered questions, which you probably do &#8212; or should &#8212; after only a single interview.)</p>
<p>They might be hesitant about waiting a full week, but they should at least give you a <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/06/how-long-should-employers-give-candidates-to-respond-to-a-job-offer.html">few days</a>. And if they push you for an answer faster than that, I&#8217;d consider that a much bigger red flag than the fast offer itself. They should want you to be sure about your decision &#8212; both for your own comfort and for theirs; people pressured to accept a job offer faster than they&#8217;re ready to are at high risk for reneging later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Many of my colleagues have an agreement with our boss that they can work from home on Fridays. All of them happen to be moms of young children. I am married but do not have children.</em></p>
<p><em>I am all for a flexible work environment, but I feel that they take advantage of the situation. They constantly post on Facebook that they are at karate tournaments, music class, etc. or tell team members they can&#8217;t participate in client calls because they have to pick up their kids at school. I realize I am not a parent so I don&#8217;t understand the balance or struggles of being a working mother, but I am expected to be in the office five days a week, while they essentially work four.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want to be the group tattle tale but it&#8217;s really starting to affect the morale of those who are childless when we see empty offices on Fridays. Thoughts on how to approach this, or do I just suck it up and deal with it?</em></p>
<p>Well, first, you want to make sure that you&#8217;re right that they&#8217;re not working much on their Fridays at home. It&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;re simply working flexible hours that day. For instance, if someone worked from 7-11, went to their kid&#8217;s karate tournament from 11-2, worked more from 2-4:30, and then put in another hour and half over the weekend, that would total eight hours of work.</p>
<p>And to some people, that&#8217;s the point of a flexible schedule and working from home: It allows you to fit life in, and schedule work around it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s entirely possible that that&#8217;s not how your coworkers are using the flexibility. Maybe they&#8217;re working 9-5 from home but taking tons of time off in the middle of the day that they never make up. But do you <em>know</em> that, or are you just assuming it?</p>
<p>And if you <em>do</em> know that they&#8217;re abusing it, then what you have is a management problem, because no good manager is going to neglect to notice that hmmm, the people who work from home on Fridays seem to produce less work than everyone else. That doesn&#8217;t make it any less frustrating &#8212; in fact, it makes it more frustrating &#8212; but it&#8217;s worth being clear that that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Of course, the one thing that you do know for sure is that these coworkers are at least sometimes missing client calls on those days, and that&#8217;s potentially a legitimate issue. But even there, the question is how much that matters. Are they missing these calls more than someone else might miss them for occasional dentist appointments or other conflicts? And what&#8217;s the impact on their work?</p>
<p>If there <em>is</em> an impact and you&#8217;re concerned about it, then you should handle that just like you would any other concern with a coworker&#8217;s work that impacts you: First talk to the coworker, and then to your manager if the problem remains. In this case, that might mean saying to the coworker, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you often can&#8217;t make client calls when we schedule them on Fridays, and I know that Client X really likes having you there. Is there a different time we can schedule them so you&#8217;re able to call in?&#8221; Or, depending on the situation, &#8220;I know there&#8217;s not much notice, but they&#8217;re usually in the afternoons. Is there a way for you to keep that time free?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you remain concerned, then you&#8217;d talk to your manager, just as you would about anything else that was affecting your work. For instance: &#8220;I love that we have schedule flexibility, but I&#8217;m having trouble getting what I need on Fridays from people who are working at home and often can&#8217;t get people on client calls when I need them. I wonder if we could give people clearer guidelines on how accessible they should be when they&#8217;re working out of the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>But overall, you want to (a) keep the focus on the impact on your work, and (b) assume that if these are otherwise good coworkers with a strong work ethic, you have no reason to think they aren&#8217;t putting in a full day&#8217;s work even if it&#8217;s spread out in an untraditional way &#8212; unless you really know for sure that that isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>And last, I&#8217;m assuming that this benefit isn&#8217;t just offered to parents in your workplace, so there&#8217;s no reason you couldn&#8217;t responsibly take advantage of the flexibility too, if you want to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Mentioning that I&#8217;d take a more junior position</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in an interview process. Tomorrow morning, I have a second interview for a middle management position. I do not know how things will evolve. Meanwhile, the company advertised a position that involves less responsibilities &#8212; assistant manager. If I receive a NO for the manager position or feel that things are not going in the right direction, I am tempted to mention that I would be open for the less senior position. Any idea how I should approach them on this, and still look professional?</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do this in the midst of an interview for the higher level position. If you don&#8217;t get that job, at that point you can mention that you&#8217;re interested in the more junior position &#8212; but if you mention while you&#8217;re being interviewed for the more senior role, you risk making yourself look like you&#8217;re not confident in your own skills. They&#8217;re giving you a second interview &#8212; they think you&#8217;re a viable candidate for this job, and so you should too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do different companies compare notes on their candidates?</strong></p>
<p><em>During my latest job search, I came across a situation that made me uncomfortable. I had interviews with three different companies: Company A, then B, and lastly C. Company B gave me an offer the day before my interview with Company C. Talking to HR in Company A and C afterwards, they both knew I had an offer from Company B.</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to look for a job in a different state and use a recruiting agency to help, but I am concerned with my current company finding out in the same way the other companies did last time. Is this kind of &#8220;comparing notes&#8221; between HRs of different companies normal?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not especially common, but it can happen in particularly close-knit industries where all the players know each other. Generally, though, I&#8217;d assume it&#8217;s not happening.</p>
<p><strong>3. Being paid as a contractor when I&#8217;m treated as an employee</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently came across the following information in one of your blog posts: &#8220;Your employer can&#8217;t pay you as a contractor while treating you like an employee. If your employer controls when, where, and how you work, the government says you&#8217;re an employee—and your company needs to pay your payroll taxes and offer you the same benefits it offers to regular employees.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a federal law? Or does it vary by state? Where can I find this information outlined so I can show it to my employer? My employer takes advantage of me and my pay requirements, and although I work as an employee he gave me a 1099 for my salary this year. I think he should pay whatever I owe.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a federal law, although it&#8217;s commonly broken, and you can read about it <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-(Self-Employed)-or-Employee%3F  ">here</a>.</p>
<p>For whatever it&#8217;s worth, you don&#8217;t need to wait to be issued a tax form to find out how your employer is paying you; if taxes aren&#8217;t being taken out of your checks each pay period, you&#8217;re being paid as an independent contractor (legally or illegally).</p>
<p><strong>4. I&#8217;ve been promoted but don&#8217;t know what to do</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m 23 and have been working since I left school at 16. I&#8217;ve never had a sick day off work, I&#8217;m always 30 minutes early and the last one to leave. Finally after many years of hard work, a new project has come up at work and my manager and his business manager think I&#8217;m the perfect guy to help run the show. My promotion is leading me to run a team of six people, letting agreements, and marketing. Only problem is I know little about these subjects, but they really do think I&#8217;m the perfect person for the job. This has lead me to quite a few sleepless nights! It got worse today when the business manager asked me to help her write the job descriptions for the new positions, and it seemed like she was getting annoyed that I wasn&#8217;t putting much input in. I&#8217;ve been working so hard since I left school to reach a promotion like this and it&#8217;s my ticket to a successful career. But I really don&#8217;t know what to do, and don&#8217;t want to show them my weakness.</em></p>
<p>They promoted you for a reason, and since you&#8217;ve worked with them before, they have a pretty good idea of your skills. But it&#8217;s fine to admit when you don&#8217;t know something &#8212; in fact, the most confident people are usually the ones most willing to admit that, because it doesn&#8217;t threaten them. Why not go to your manager and ask for guidance in what you can do to get up to speed? If there are specific things you&#8217;re wondering about, ask about those too. Ask for help, and ask for feedback. That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll learn the new role &#8212; don&#8217;t feel you need to walk in already having it mastered.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I ask for a raise now that I have new responsibilities?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been at my current positon for a year and recieved the standard 3% pay increase this week. Since I&#8217;ve been at this company, I&#8217;ve taken on new responsibilities. It&#8217;s been a great learning curve and I feel that I&#8217;ve grown a lot in this role. I&#8217;m also working at stepping up my skills in areas where my manager and I mutually agree I can improve. Recently, I was asked to be the main coordinator in an area where I&#8217;ve only had a supporting role before &#8212; that is, I&#8217;m responsible for tasks that I was only assisting with before. Right now I feel a bit shaky in this area as I&#8217;m learning the ropes, but I know I&#8217;m capable of doing an excellent job once I get the hang of it. I&#8217;m writing to ask, would you advise on asking for a higher raise at this point, or do you believe I would be in a better position to do so once I&#8217;ve demonstrated more value to the company through handling my new tasks?</em></p>
<p>You just got a raise. You need to demonstrate that you can excel at your new responsibilities &#8212; and that you&#8217;ve addressed the areas where you and your manager agreed you&#8217;d improve &#8212; before you ask for another one.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I reopen salary negotiations after starting work?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been doing some consulting work for a company a few hours a week from home. A couple months ago, they let me know about an opening for a different, but related position in their office. As we went through the hiring process there was talk about rolling my consulting duties into this new job, but nothing concrete was decided on. The new job doesn&#8217;t require an extra credential that I have, and that is reflected in the salary. I was still interested because of the potential to get full time employment and benefits with this company.</em></p>
<p><em>I figured that if I was offered the job, we would go over the details of how to handle my consulting work and I would negotiate a rate increase if they wanted to roll those duties into the new job. However, when I got the packet to look over, it was an acceptance packet with a start date and nothing to sign or negotiate. I missed my offer negotiation and went straight from interview to acceptance!</em></p>
<p><em>I started the job two weeks ago and while I haven&#8217;t been doing the duties from when I was consulting, last week my manager mentioned that I would be able to start doing those tasks again and that it&#8217;s no big deal because they could fall into &#8220;other duties as assigned.&#8221; I want to do the work that I had been doing as a consultant, but I want to be paid for that specialized skill. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say it&#8217;s part of &#8220;other duties&#8221; because if they had hired someone who didn&#8217;t have my background that person wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it. </em><em>Do I have any leverage to say that I won&#8217;t do it until we&#8217;ve agreed on a rate for adding those duties? Please help me fix this, I&#8217;ve neglected my growth opportunities for so long and just started reading your blog and want to get my career on track!</em></p>
<p>First, you guys need to stop accepting job offers without negotiating just because the employer doesn&#8217;t proactively offer you a chance to negotiate. You can still bring up salary yourself.</p>
<p>However, at this point, you&#8217;ve missed your window of opportunity; you&#8217;ve already accepted the job at the rate they offered. I also wouldn&#8217;t try to ask for more now based on the fact that the new job includes your consulting work. First, they&#8217;d already mentioned previously that they might roll that into the position so they&#8217;re not springing this on you out of nowhere &#8230; and second, the fact that you could do this stuff is probably part of the reason they hired you and not someone else. You don&#8217;t really have standing to go back and negotiate now. The time to do that was when the offer was made, and you can&#8217;t do it weeks later.</p>
<p><strong>7. Employer said a letter is in the mail</strong></p>
<p><em>I had an interview for a secretary position 12 days ago. I called yesterday to see if the position had been filled and was asked if I received a letter in the mail. When I said no, the interviewer said she couldn&#8217;t tell me anything until I get the letter in the mail. I&#8217;m assuming this means I didn&#8217;t get the job, but wanted to know what your thoughts were on this. Is there any chance it could be a good thing? The position was with the State of TN Dept of Human Services office. They interviewed several people and said we would be notified when the position was filled. I assumed it would be by email because that&#8217;s my preferred method of contact.</em></p>
<p>It probably means that you didn&#8217;t get the job, but with government hiring, who knows. It&#8217;s entirely possible that they deliver job offers by putting them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I just had a terrific second interview interview and was verbally offered a job yesterday, and I am over the moon about it. It&#8217;s a huge jump in title and salary. The CEO said, pending my reference checks, I will have the offer in writing on Friday. They are small and scrappy, and they need me to start as soon as I can, so I said I would give notice two weeks after I have the offer in writing.</em></p>
<p><em>However, the organization I work with now (another lovely nonprofit, but very large and resource-rich) is sending me to a three day conference on Sunday &#8212; flight, hotel, the whole nine yards. My boss will be at the conference too &#8212; and she&#8217;s not a very positive person to be around as it is. She has a mean vindictive streak, which is part of why I am so excited about moving on.</em></p>
<p><em>How should I handle this? I don&#8217;t want to ruin both of our conference experiences by giving notice on Friday and then enduring awkwardness, and I don&#8217;t want to look like a jerk who purposefully planned a free conference out of this and then gave notice on my first day back. (It was a total coincidence &#8212; this organization even recruited me, I wasn&#8217;t job hunting!) Should I back out of the conference altogether? The fees/hotel/airfare are all paid and non-refundable, nor are they transferable, so it&#8217;s not like I could send someone else in my stead.</em></p>
<p><em>I have great relationships with the whole team at my current organization, except my boss. I want to do the right thing here. What do you recommend?</em></p>
<p>Talk to her your manager and give your notice on Friday, after you have the written offer (and have accepted it). Tell her that you will do whatever she prefers regarding the conference &#8212; go or not go, whatever she thinks makes the most sense.</p>
<p>From there, it&#8217;s up to her. You&#8217;ll have been open and transparent and willing to do what the organization prefers. And some job offers just aren&#8217;t perfectly timed; reasonable people understand that.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;d really rather not attend the conference now and you don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any benefit to the organization for you attending since you&#8217;re leaving, it&#8217;s fine to push the scales a little in that direction, by saying something like, &#8220;I realize that it won&#8217;t be very useful to the organization to send me to the conference now, so I could stay home but see if I can negotiate refunds for us from the hotel and the conference.&#8221; (You have better chances of succeeding at refunds with those two, even if they&#8217;re allegedly non-refundable, than with the airline tickets.) And even if you can&#8217;t get any refunds, not going will still save the organization some money &#8212; your meals, cabs, etc. So it&#8217;s worth offering.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re back. Be transparent, give the organization as much notice as you can, and let them decide how they want to handle this.</p>

<p><em>I have a question regarding a coworker of mine. I realize it is technically none of my business, I am in a different department and it doesn&#8217;t affect me directly, but it really bothers me and wanted to get your opinion of how slimy this is. My coworker is fairly young, 23, very pretty, and has an outgoing personality. She is in the sales/member services department of our company and has only been here about 3 months. It is part of her job to attend conferences with the manager of that department (she is older) and they are supposed to talk to other companies about joining our company. At the last conference, several men had hit on her, and I guess her manager was annoyed by it and felt this was distracting from her &#8220;doing her job.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>This manager &#8220;requested&#8221; (more like insisted) she buy a fake wedding ring and wear it during this conference, and future conferences. She basically told her, &#8220;Either wear that or I am going to have to reconsider bringing you to these conferences.&#8221; I am not going to ask the &#8220;is that even legal&#8221; question &#8212; but on a scale of 1-10, how inappropriate is this? I would imagine if it was my coworker&#8217;s idea, I might feel differently about it, but she didn&#8217;t feel she was doing anything wrong at the conference. And as far as I am concerned, it is not likely that a wedding ring (fake OR real) is going to ward off men who are attracted to her and hitting on her in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel for her because of the fact that she is so young, and new, and feels she can&#8217;t say no, but is uncomfortable with the situation. I just feel it is wrong and violates her to some degree. This young coworker does have a boyfriend, and says she talks to everyone at the conferences (not just the men) and has no interest in seeing them, dating them, etc&#8230;she is just doing her job by talking to them and explaining our company to these people. She asked me for advice, and I am not sure what to tell her. I don&#8217;t want her to go against what her boss is telling her, but still don&#8217;t think it is right.</em></p>
<p>What the &#8230;.?!</p>
<p>This is totally inappropriate and not okay. If the manager has a problem with how your coworker is conducting herself, she should address that &#8212; but it sounds like that&#8217;s not the issue at all; she just doesn&#8217;t like the fact that men flirt with her.</p>
<p>It would be one thing to give her advice about how to quickly shut that down &#8212; and even to tell her that she needs to do so, although it&#8217;s pretty hard to insist on that when it&#8217;s in the context of talking to someone about your company&#8217;s products. Hell, it wouldn&#8217;t even be all that egregious for her to say, &#8220;You know, if you want to ward some of this off, one way is to wear a ring.&#8221; (I happen to think that&#8217;s a ridiculous solution, and I agree with you that it won&#8217;t stop the flirting, but simply mentioning it isn&#8217;t egregious.)</p>
<p>But telling her that she&#8217;ll reconsider taking her to conferences if she doesn&#8217;t do it is so far, far over the line of what&#8217;s okay that I cannot imagine how her manager thinks this is acceptable to do.</p>
<p>Moreover, there probably <em>are</em> legal issues in play here. The manager is telling your coworker that she will change her assignments at work (the conferences) and stop giving her this particular professional opportunity if your coworker doesn&#8217;t take steps to make herself less appealing to men, which gets into some pretty sticky discrimination issues. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a slam-dunk case, because it&#8217;s not, but it&#8217;s certainly something no responsible company would want to spend the legal fees to find out for sure.</p>
<p>In any case &#8230; ideally, your coworker would say to her manager, &#8220;I am not comfortable wearing a wedding ring when I&#8217;m not married. I am conducting myself professionally and not doing anything to invite inappropriate behavior. If there&#8217;s something specific you&#8217;d like me to do differently in the way I handle myself at these conferences, I&#8217;m very open to the feedback, but I&#8217;m not comfortable wearing a fake ring, and I certainly hope that won&#8217;t impact the opportunities you give me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you have an HR department, she should also get them in the loop on this, because they will probably shut her boss down pretty quickly &#8212; and she can also ask them to ensure there&#8217;s no retaliation against her for this.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s open retaliation and there&#8217;s more subtle retaliation, and the latter is a lot harder to police. The fact is, your coworker is working for a manager who has issues with the way men respond to her, so she&#8217;s going to need to be prepared to assert herself against future weirdness as well.</p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve been at my current job for two years and really enjoyed working here until the last six months. In a nutshell, I was given an account management position when the old acct manager quit, and was left doing a two-person job by myself until I finally announced I was not prepared for this and wanted to step down. It was decided I would still be doing most of the account manager duties, but that my supervisor would be the &#8220;face&#8221; of the company when dealing with clients. It&#8217;s still a lot more work than I was used to, but I find it manageable and even enjoyable most of the time. </em></p>
<p><em>At the time I stepped down, my boss was very sympathetic and supportive. Now, however, she seems to be going out of her way to make me feel like an idiot. Whenever I ask a question in a meeting or make some sort of comment, her reply is always impatient and often sarcastic. This is something I have much difficulty dealing with; I can take it once in a while, but not multiple times every single day, and I&#8217;m at the point where I just can&#8217;t keep my mouth shut. Whenever she makes some rude or sarcastic remark, I find myself firing right back at her, even in front of others (including my direct supervisor). I&#8217;m just not sure what I did to inspire her attitude toward me, or what I can do to make it better. I&#8217;m not sure what she expects of me. Any insight would be much appreciated.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I get a lot of requests to give people feedback on their resumes, but because it&#8217;s time-consuming to do it well, I usually turn them down unless they&#8217;re friends or family. But for a short time, I&#8217;m re-opening the resume review offer that I&#8217;ve run a couple of times before</p>
<p><strong>When I&#8217;ve offered this in the past, the response has been so overwhelming that I&#8217;ve had to close the offer after just a few days, so reserve this now if you&#8217;re interested!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The cost:</strong> $99</p>
<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll get:</strong> As you can probably tell by the price, I&#8217;m not going to entirely rewrite your resume for you. People who do that charge a lot more. What you&#8217;ll get for 99 bucks: I&#8217;ll read your resume, I&#8217;ll give you suggestions for improving it, I&#8217;ll tell you where I think it&#8217;s weak and where I think it&#8217;s strong. I&#8217;ll tell you if your design sucks. I&#8217;ll tell you if you&#8217;re coming across as generic and/or unimpressive and how to fix it if you are. I&#8217;ll tell you what you need to change to have a resume that will make a hiring manager excited to interview you.</p>
<p>(And because I obsessively edit things, I might not be able to stop myself from editing it too. Fair warning.)</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn&#8217;t multiple rounds of revisions, or a rewrite service, or anything like that. It&#8217;s really just a bunch of notes on what I&#8217;d like to see you doing differently &#8212; what a hiring manager might think when looking at your resume.</p>
<p><strong>Limited time:</strong> I don&#8217;t want to be a full-time resume reviewer, so this offer is only good for this week, not something I&#8217;ll be offering regularly. So if you want it, lock it in now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.askamanager.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/closed1.gif"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2379" alt="closed" src="http://www.askamanager.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/closed1.gif" width="126" height="83" /></a></p>
<p>(And because I know not everyone can afford that, I&#8217;m also offering a discount on my my ebook, <strong><em><a href="http://www.askamanager.org/how-to-get-job-e-book">How to Get a Job: Secrets of a Hiring Manager</a>, </em></strong>where you&#8217;ll find lots of resume advice &#8212; just not customized to your particular resume. You can get a 20% discount this week by using this code: <em>april2013 )</em></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>Due to the level of demand today, please be aware that for any reviews purchased after 6 p.m. on April 2, you might not receive your feedback until late April. (Although if you need it faster, email me and I&#8217;ll see what I can do.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <em>This offer is now closed. But it might come around again later this year! </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should freelancers bill as time is incurred or at the end of a project?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about freelance etiquette. Is it customary to bill for my time as it&#8217;s incurred &#8212; i.e., the hours I worked in the previous two weeks &#8212; or to bill when the final product is &#8220;delivered?&#8221; I have an new, ongoing freelance assignment to work 15 hours a week or so for a company, but my work is editorial, so there&#8217;s often some back-and-forth before projects are completed. So if I worked 12 hours on something one week that won&#8217;t be finalized for two more weeks, when&#8217;s the best time to send my invoice for that work? Maybe I&#8217;m overthinking this.</em></p>
<p>Different freelancers do it differently, but lots of people &#8212; including me &#8212; will tell you to bill as your time is incurred. Billing monthly is perfectly reasonable, and can minimize the trouble you might sometimes have collecting on a bill once a project is over. Good clients will always pay you without hassle, but not every client is a good one, and they have much more incentive to pay you when they still need you to do more work for them. Plus, if you&#8217;re going to have problems collecting, it&#8217;s better to find that out sooner rather than after you&#8217;ve put in hundreds of hours.</p>
<p>Generally, it&#8217;s a good idea to lay out your payment terms with a new client at the start of working with them, but if you didn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t send over an invoice now with a note that simply says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s my invoice for my work in March.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. Candidate cried when we asked whether her current employer would make a counteroffer</strong></p>
<p><em>We just interviewed a candidate for a managerial job at our company. The interview went rather well, particularly during the skill test exercises and the case studies problem resolution process. But when we asked her what would happen once we offer her the job &#8212; will her current employer try to retain her? &#8212; she reacted emotionally, started crying, and went to the washroom to wipe off her tears.</em></p>
<p><em>She said that she got emotional because she and her current employer had a discussion where her manager did not want to raise her salary. According to her, her current employer under-values her worth and had his opportunity to respond to her requests for more recognition (salary-wise), so she suggested that once we offer her a job, her current employer will not up the offer or revisit her request &#8212; he simply had his opportunity, according to her.</em></p>
<p><em>Nevertheless, why did she become so emotional regarding the question? How do you deal with this as a prospective employer? Do you not continue forward with an offer for employment?</em></p>
<p>Oooh, this is troubling. First of all, she&#8217;s basically telling you that if her current employer did counter-offer, she might take it (but that she believes they won&#8217;t). Second, while this reaction might be something you&#8217;d overlook for a junior or a non-managerial position, I&#8217;d be concerned about hiring her for a managerial job, where she&#8217;s going to need to have much tougher conversations with people and remain calm and unemotional. Yes, everyone has emotional moments, including great managers, but this would make me wary.</p>
<p><strong>3. Leaving a temp job earlier than planned</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been consulting part-time on the side for another organization, with the hopes that it would turn into something full-time eventually. It&#8217;s a new organization, and they&#8217;re still figuring out budgets, etc., and I was told several weeks ago that it would likely be a little while before they could hire anyone full-time. However, about 2 weeks later, their financial situation changed, and they are now more flexible with their hiring timeline. I had just agreed to a temp position running for several months, and reiterated my willingness to continue part-time for the new organization, with the hope that we could work out something full-time after the temp position was over.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve since started the temp position (last week), and it is just not a good fit &#8212; not enough work, definitely more basic than I had been led to believe &#8212; and I&#8217;d really like to approach the first organization and let them know that the temp position isn&#8217;t a good fit, and I&#8217;d like to give my two weeks notice, if they are still interested in hiring me full-time. (Wording it more eloquently than that, of course.)</em></p>
<p><em>Does initially telling the first organization that I had agreed to a temp position, and now backing out of it look really, really bad? And how bad is it/how many bridges does it burn for me to be leaving a temp position much sooner than expected? To be fair, I didn&#8217;t sign a contract or anything, and the position with the other organization is one I had been pursuing long before this temp position opened up. But I worry that it looks flaky/will ruin my reputation with the temp agency (although I would be giving the standard 2 weeks notice that the agency requests).</em></p>
<p>This stuff happens with temp jobs &#8212; few people will turn down full-time employment in favor of a short-term temp job. You agency may not be willing to send you out for other long-term jobs if you go back to them in the future, but it&#8217;s not a heinous crime.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;d word your message to the first organization a little differently &#8212; don&#8217;t talk about why it&#8217;s not a good fit. Just say something like, &#8220;Things have changed a bit on my side, and I could be available for full-time work within two weeks if you&#8217;d like me to.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4. When a hiring contact changes</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in the process of sending out last-minute applications for summer internships. I applied to my dream organization about a month ago, and the directions on the website originally told me to send my resume, cover letter, and writing sample to Contact A. I checked the company&#8217;s website again today, and noticed that the directions on the website now stipulate that I send my resume, cover letter, etc. to Contact B.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m trying to resist my panicked temptation to re-send my materials, but at the same time I don&#8217;t want to be disqualified from the applicant pool for not sending my materials to the new coordinator. Advice?</em></p>
<p>Just be straightforward. Email Contact B with a note that says, &#8220;I earlier submitted these materials to Contact A but just that the instructions now state they should go to you. I&#8217;d love to talk with you about the opening if you think I might be a strong fit.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Recovering after you bomb a skills test during a job interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m currently going through the hiring process for a communications and marketing position. As part of the process, the hiring company has asked me to complete a standardized test. This test was basically the SATs for business and, like the SATs, I completely bombed the math portion leaving quite a few questions blank and ultimately running out of time. In reality, I&#8217;m quite good at crunching numbers, running reports and overall sticking to budgets, but have never been great at taking timed tests. I feel as though my initial interview went really well and I had a great rapport, but now I&#8217;m a bit nervous that these results have potentially knocked me out of the running completely. What do employers hope to gain from the results of tests like this?</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of following up with the hiring manager, via email, to provide a bit more insight into my experience and also how I make adjustments in the real world. My experience to date has always been interpreting data related to charts/graphs that I&#8217;ve set up and I can provide insight on the fly, so this really has never been an issue professionally. Is there value in doing this, or would it just serve to annoy the hiring manager? If there is value, any suggestions on how to phrase it? This is definitely one of the better opportunities available in my area so I&#8217;d hate to be passed over because of a standardized test that I don&#8217;t feel accurately reflects my experience or capabilities.</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can do that. Say that you had the sense that you didn&#8217;t do well on the test, but that while timed tests have never been your strength, you&#8217;ve been very successful at using the skills being tested in real-world work situations. Then give concrete examples of how you&#8217;ve excelled using those skills. Be specific, and make sure that whatever you offer up speaks as directly as possible to what the hiring manager&#8217;s concern is likely to be: that you don&#8217;t possess the skills the test was assessing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Negotiating higher severance</strong></p>
<p><em>I was laid off two days ago. I worked for a major corporation that had financial issues and needed to downsize the workforce. The severance package offered is 2 months paid with full benefits, then a lump sum of cash. I get my tuition reimbursement issued and all of my PTO will be paid out. Two people have advised me to negotiate my severance. In addition to higher payout (or more months of employment), I&#8217;d like to ask for copies of my most recent performance reviews (is that weird?).</em></p>
<p><em>Also, as an aside, I&#8217;m not angry over the whole situation. The company is going through hard times and the decision was based solely off of business needs and nothing personal. I know I had great rapport with coworkers and management and my monthly and yearly reviews were stellar.</em></p>
<p>To get more severance, there usually needs to be some incentive for the employer to give you more &#8212; such as that they want you to agree to stay longer and train a replacement or transition operations, or that they&#8217;re concerned you might otherwise sue over a real or perceived legal issue like harassment or discrimination (because you sign a release relinquishing any legal claims in exchange for severance). If you don&#8217;t have anything like that to use as incentive, they&#8217;re not likely to give you more just because you ask &#8230; although you can certainly still ask, because you never know.</p>
<p>You can also certainly ask for copies of your performance evaluations; you may or may not get them, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with asking (and you should explain that you want them to document your performance for future prospective employers, since otherwise they may think you want to use them as ammunition to challenge the layoff decision in some way).</p>
<p><strong>7. Online applications that ask for &#8220;additional information to support your application&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><em>When filling out an application form and they ask for &#8220;additional information to support your application,&#8221; what are they expecting in that box? I&#8217;ve already filled in education and employment details, as well as a section on why I want/would be good for the job, and I&#8217;m drawing a blank. Am I missing something obvious?</em></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s anything you would include in a cover letter that you didn&#8217;t already include in the section on why you want and would be good at the job, include it here. Otherwise, it&#8217;s fine to ignore it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I just started a new job at a nonprofit organization, taking over for a beloved employee who was here for 20 years and is still a big part of our organization&#8217;s community.</em></p>
<p><em>He was very successful, but I am coming across a lot of pretty substantial errors he made. A good example is a grant proposal in which he basically ignored the guidelines, although we got the grant anyway. Now I am working on this year&#8217;s proposal for that grant; I have to follow the guidelines and I think I really ought to tell my boss about the discrepancies and about what I am doing differently this year. But I am hesitant to do so, because this would be about my 10th time alerting her to something I came across that he kind of messed up. I don&#8217;t want to seem as though we have a pattern of &#8220;now look at THIS thing Joe screwed up,&#8221; and really I don&#8217;t want to speak ill of him at all, especially when there never have been negative consequences (such as missing out on a grant). But she is the executive director and she should be aware of everything, especially when I am doing things very differently than he did. Any advice on how to navigate this?</em></p>
<p>Well, when you say he was &#8220;very successful,&#8221; what exactly does that mean? If it means that he achieved unusually good results, then it&#8217;s important to keep that mind when you&#8217;re assessing the mistakes you&#8217;re coming across. The grant application might be a good example of this &#8212; he didn&#8217;t follow the guidelines, but the organization got the grant anyway, so it seems like he did something right. Sure, it&#8217;s possible that that was a fluke, but if the outcome was successful, you&#8217;re probably going to have a hard time convincing people that it was a problem that he didn&#8217;t follow the guidelines. (And yes, of course it&#8217;s possible that if he had a habit of not following grant guidelines, there were other grants he applied for that the organization <em>didn&#8217;t</em> get &#8230; but it&#8217;s also possible that he was good enough at the job that he knew what could be ignored and what really mattered.)</p>
<p>Is it possible that the other mistakes you&#8217;re finding fit this profile? If something is technically a mistake or not a best practice but he got fantastic results anyway, it might be worth considering that he knew other, different ways of being effective.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe that&#8217;s not the case at all and the grant application example is just misleading me. If in fact you&#8217;re uncovering things that were genuinely messed up &#8212; things where the long-term results were not as good as they could have been because of his mistakes &#8212; then that&#8217;s different. But start by making sure that you&#8217;re really being objective about whether that&#8217;s the situation or not.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s not uncommon that you&#8217;d do things a bit different from your predecessor. So when you feel that you need to bring something to your manager&#8217;s attention &#8212; whether it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a problem he caused that she needs to know about or because you want her to understand why you&#8217;re handling something differently &#8212; approach it as simply keeping your manager in the loop. For example: &#8220;I wanted to let you know that I&#8217;m doing the grant proposal a little differently than it was done in the past, because I&#8217;ve found that they&#8217;ll sometimes reject you if you don&#8217;t follow their guidelines to a T.&#8221; You could even ask, &#8220;I noticed that Joe didn&#8217;t strictly follow them, and I wonder if that&#8217;s because we had a more informal relationship with this foundation or whether there&#8217;s any other context like that that I should know about?&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as you&#8217;re not presenting this stuff in a tone of &#8220;here&#8217;s <em>another</em> thing I&#8217;ve uncovered,&#8221; your manager isn&#8217;t likely to think you&#8217;re being unnecessarily hard on Joe.</p>
<p>But what you don&#8217;t want is to find yourself in a situation where your predecessor was successful precisely because he knew when he could and couldn&#8217;t break the rules and then end up coming across yourself as someone who doesn&#8217;t have that nuanced level of understanding. So be sure that you&#8217;re assessing what you&#8217;re finding not just as &#8220;is this done correctly?&#8221; but rather as &#8220;did this get good long-term results for the organization?&#8221;</p>

<p><em>I am now two months into my new job and I am really enjoying it. I am really excited about a huge conference that is coming up soon and my boss has registered both of us to go. Since this is my first professional job after college, I have never been to a conference, and really have no idea what to do at conferences. I know that there will be different sessions, discussions and networking events, but I am a little nervous because I will be mostly on my own and I am so new to the industry. What should I wear? (My industry is in philanthropy, if that helps.) What do people do at conferences? How do I use this opportunity to network?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. HR called to tell me they &#8220;couldn&#8217;t afford me,&#8221; then said that they could</strong></p>
<p><em>I am currently employed in a managerial position at a major corporation. It is a good job but I feel like I have outgrown it in the 3 years I have been there. Recently a contact reached out and told me about a great position at a smaller, action-oriented company. I applied and had one phone interview with the hiring manager and a second interview with the other managers in the department. Both went very well and I am scheduled for an on-site interview next week. Up until last Wednesday, I was very excited about the opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>Last week, after my second interview, I received a call from a member of the HR department. Before he even introduced himself, he bluntly asked what salary I currently made and what I was expecting. I gave my current salary and before I could get another word out, he stated, &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford you.&#8221; He then gave me a maximum salary of only about 70% of what I currently make. He said he thinks that the hiring manager was only interviewing me to please my influential contact and that even though they can&#8217;t afford me, he would be happy to give my resume to another larger company because &#8220;they would go nuts&#8221; for someone with my qualifications. I politely asserted my interest in this job and expressed my confusion because the hiring manager and I had discussed my salary requirements previously. He stated he would follow up with the hiring manager and would let me know ASAP if they could not afford me as he suspected.</em></p>
<p><em>A couple hours later, he calls me back and &#8220;good news,&#8221; they can afford me after all. But now I have this sinking feeling in my gut that by pursuing this opportunity I am stepping into a position with bad management. Am I being too sensitive to what seemed to be a very rude and confusing discussion? I had good experiences with everyone else in the company, but I can&#8217;t shake this interaction. Can you give me some perspective?</em></p>
<p>Ask your interviewer about it when you meet. Say, &#8220;Bob called me last week to tell me that he was sure you couldn&#8217;t afford me, but then called back a few hours later to say that it wouldn&#8217;t be a problem. I was confused by that, and wonder if you can shed any light on it for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. When do I tell an employer about my scheduling needs?</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m in the process of looking for a new job and I’ve run into a bit of an issue. My young son is disabled and requires a lot of doctor and therapy appointments. My husband and I split this up as much as possible and always try to keep our time scheduled in the most effective way, but it is still not unusual to have to leave work for 2-3 appointments a month. It is very important that I work for an employer with flexible time-off and/or flexible scheduling. But it is also very important for me to be in a company with a culture accepting of my sometimes-crazy schedule.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t want to set myself up for failure or find myself in a situation where – while everything looked great on paper – my coworker/boss is annoyed by my situation. What is the best way to deal with this? Is it appropriate to bring up my family situation in the later stages of the interview process? Is there a way to find out about this aspect of the company culture without scaring potential bosses away thinking I’m going to be chronically absent?</em></p>
<p>Wait until you have an offer, because at that point they&#8217;ve already decided that they want you (whereas if you bring it up earlier, you risk them being scared off). Talk in concrete specifics about the situation&#8217;s impact on your schedule (for instance, an average of X appointments per month, two of them without much notice, most requiring you to leave two hours early &#8212; or whatever it is). Then pay attention to the reaction. Do they sound hesitant? Worried? Annoyed? Supportive? They way they respond, as well as what they actually say, will tell you a lot.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I tell on my boss for working a side job from our office?</strong></p>
<p><em>I noticed that my boss, the CFO, always has a laptop on his desk in addition to his regular desktop computer. I wondered why he needed two computers but didn&#8217;t think much of it. Today I found out that he has a second job and that&#8217;s what the laptop is for. When I walk by his office he is more often working on the laptop than on his desktop. The worst part is that we are a struggling non-profit and we desperately need a competent CFO whose only focus is on fixing the financial problems in our organization. He has only been with the company for four months and I haven&#8217;t been impressed by his management style, nor have I seen any changes or improvements. There are hundreds of people employed by this agency and we run important programs that the community depends on. I work for a nonprofit because I care about our mission and I&#8217;m appalled that someone who is so high up in the company would take advantage like this.</em></p>
<p><em>The CFO told another employee about his second job, and that employee told me. Should I tell the Interim Executive Director about this? We get along great and I don&#8217;t think there would be any backlash on me for telling, but I&#8217;m just not sure if its my place to do so. If you would tell, how would you approach that conversation?</em></p>
<p>Yes, because in a nonprofit, you have a responsibility to the issue the organization works on or the people it serves to speak up in this kind of situation. Now, it&#8217;s possible that the organization&#8217;s management knows about what your boss is doing and has given permission for it &#8212; but it&#8217;s also possible that they have no idea. I&#8217;d say something like this: &#8220;I feel awkward mentioning this, but I feel more uncomfortable not saying anything. I realize this might be something you know about and are okay with, but in case you don&#8217;t, I felt obligated to talk to you about it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4. Denying an employee&#8217;s training request</strong></p>
<p><em>An employee has requested to attend an out-of-town training that I feel is beyond his scope of work, but I don&#8217;t want to discourage him by using this as an excuse in denying his request. This person has been a problem employee for years and will create a big incident if I refuse his request. I would appreciate your advice on how to deny this request gracefully.</em></p>
<p>Well, the bigger problem is why you&#8217;ve allowed a problem employee to stay a problem employee for years. You should be managing him out of the organization, not allowing him to stay on your staff and make you shy away from making responsible decisions.</p>
<p>As for the training, tell him that it&#8217;s not in the scope of his work, that you don&#8217;t have an unlimited budget for trainings, and that you need to save it for XYZ. And if he creates a &#8220;big incident,&#8221; use that as the starting point in tackling that problem &#8212; make your standards of behave clear, require him to adhere to them, and replace him if he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>5. Salary negotiations when your salary is public record</strong></p>
<p><em>I work for state government (Minnesota), and I am beginning to look for a new job. As I think about and plan salary negotiations, I have been reading your instructions to avoid telling prospective employers your current salary. The problem is that the state of Minnesota salaries for individual employees are very easily googleable, especially if you&#8217;re looking at my work history. How, if at all should I address this in salary negotiations? I have been saying &#8220;Because my salary is a public record, I&#8217;ll just tell you that the dollar amount is $X, not including any benefits or retirement.&#8221; Or should I just ignore it and let them find it if they know to find it?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason to bring it up proactively. If they ask what you&#8217;ve been making, you can say, &#8220;As a state employee, my salary is public record, but I&#8217;m seeking a salary of $X, because of ____ (fill in with why you deserve $X).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6. Including 360 comments on your resume</strong></p>
<p><em>My current employer, like many others, has a 360 review process that’s performed annually for employees and their managers to get anonymous performance feedback from others in the organization they work with. What are your thoughts on including those comments on a resume? I’m on the fence because on one hand, the testimonials are a pretty strong endorsement which the recruiter would not have access to. On the other hand 1) it adds to the length of the resume and 2) the hiring company may have a similar program and consider it a violation of trust to turn around and use that data to get a new job.</em></p>
<p>I dont think it&#8217;s a violation of trust, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be particularly effectively, because anonymous feedback rarely is &#8212; you need to know the source to know how much weight to put on it. If there&#8217;s something in there that&#8217;s particularly strong (like, <em>really</em> strong, not just pretty good), or if there&#8217;s a particularly theme to the commentary, you could briefly mention that in your cover letter, but I wouldn&#8217;t put it on a resume.</p>
