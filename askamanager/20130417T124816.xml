				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Reaching out to a long-ago boss about a job he might be interested in</strong></p>
<p><em>About 20 years ago, when I was an undergraduate, I had a part-time job on my college campus. For the sake of anonymity, let&#8217;s say I was a chocolate teapot maker. My boss was truly an incredible boss: he knew the work we did inside and out, was supportive as long as you were doing your job (he always, always had our backs when we were doing what we were supposed to), and addressed it when people weren&#8217;t doing their work.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t really keep in touch with Old Boss after leaving school, although I did randomly run into him when I was on the campus for other reasons some years ago, and he remembered me and we talked briefly. Where I work now, I&#8217;m not a chocolate teapot maker. But I&#8217;ve just seen a brand-new position open up that is a Director of Chocolate Teapot Making here, which made me think of Old Boss. I think he&#8217;d be incredible in this position, or he might know someone who would be interested if he&#8217;s not wanting to make a move himself.</em></p>
<p><em>I googled Old Boss and found an email address for him (yes, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s him). Would it be weird to email him out of the blue, remind him of who I am, and mention this position? Normally I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate, but it&#8217;s been quite a long time since I&#8217;ve been in touch with him, and I wondered if you thought that would make a difference.</em></p>
<p>Not weird at all. First of all, previous bosses nearly always appreciate hearing from past employees, as long as you say nice things, and second, nearly everyone appreciates being referred to jobs they might be interested in (unless the position is far below what he&#8217;s qualified for, in which case it can of course be insulting, but then you could ask if he knows anyone who&#8217;d be interested). Write to him right now.</p>
<p><strong>2. What to do when peers constantly miss scheduled meetings</strong></p>
<p><em>I work at a college in a service function (I direct our grant activity, but my question could apply to a number of service functions). I&#8217;ve written you before because management here is weak, indecisive, wasteful, uncommunicative, and focused more on touchy-feely crap than actual results. I&#8217;ve had five managers six years. In the last year, my department budget has been cut; my grantwriter quit in frustration, and I&#8217;ve not been allowed to fill his position. Yet administration insists that my work is a priority and that I MUST increase funding, or face further cuts. There are many, many cues that it&#8217;s really not a priority, but let&#8217;s start with a simple, concrete example.</em></p>
<p><em>How do I manage the immediate issues of peers missing meetings, when it&#8217;s an uphill battle to schedule them in the first place? I just came back a colleague&#8217;s office, where he did not show up for a scheduled meeting. Others in his division have missed meetings with me or showed up 20 or more minutes late, often with little or no advanced notice. I understand that things crop up, but this sort of cavalier behavior is chronic. Is there an effective way to manage other people&#8217;s behavior, or at least my own reaction, while still doing my best to do my job? I am looking for other jobs.</em></p>
<p>Given your first paragraph, this is sort of like asking, &#8220;A volcano is erupting all over me; how do I make sure the lava doesn&#8217;t stain my shoes?&#8221; But in any case, you can only control the pieces of this that you can control. If people aren&#8217;t showing up at meetings, you can (a) talk to them and ask them to start, (b) talk to their managers or yours about the issue, or (c) find some other way to get the information you need. In your case, I might try to do (c) if at all possible. Can you get what you need from someone/somewhere else? Can you call or email for it rather than trying for a meeting? Find some way to go around your lame coworkers, rather than relying on them.</p>
<p><strong>3. How to get feedback from a terminally hands-off manager</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m a post-doc in a research lab at a university, and have been working there for a little over a year. Professors are notorious for being extremely hands-off managers, and my boss is no exception. He never, ever addresses problematic work performance (even in the case of a graduate student who essentially did no work at all for months), and he&#8217;s very open about the fact that his management strategy is to let his students and post-docs go about their business, and watch the ones who succeed thrive and find professor positions, and let the ones who don&#8217;t fizzle out and eventually leave academia.</em></p>
<p><em>For the past few months, I&#8217;ve noticed that my boss has been more cold and stand-offish with me than with other members of the lab, which makes me worry that he has found my performance wanting in some way. I want to ask him to give me feedback on how I&#8217;ve been doing and if there are areas where he thinks I can improve, but, frankly, I have no idea how to go about doing it, especially given his clear distaste for this part of his job. Should I send him an email asking to set up a time to discuss this? Ask him about it when we&#8217;re meeting about something else? Just walk into his office and ask him if it&#8217;s a good time to talk? We don&#8217;t have regular meetings&#8211;I only set up a time to meet with him when I need his input/advice on a project, and those meetings rarely last more than 15 minutes. I know that if there is something he&#8217;s unhappy with, it will make him very uncomfortable to discuss it, and I&#8217;m concerned that he&#8217;ll resent being asked to do it and it will make our relationship even worse. Any advice on how to handle this situation?</em></p>
<p>If it would damage your relationship to<em> ask for feedback</em>, then yeah, I guess you have to give up on getting any from him. But are you sure it really will? Because that&#8217;s pretty insane. It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going to go to him and demand to know his deepest thoughts or scream &#8220;why do you hate me.&#8221; You&#8217;re going to ask your boss how you&#8217;re doing and what you could do better. While he might be inept enough not to be able to answer that, if it would really harm your relationship, that&#8217;s a whole new level of dysfunction that we rarely see, and it makes me want to put my head down and take a stress nap.</p>
<p><strong>4. Staffing agency is getting too much for my work</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m told that if a organization controls when, where, and how someone works, then that someone is not a contractor but an employee.</em></p>
<p><em>I work for an organization that takes 50 percent of what I&#8217;m paid hourly and I feel that this is too much. I understand that, for example, a staffing firm will make a certain percentage off their employees&#8217; hourly wage, but the 50 percent I believe is questionable. I do not work for a staffing firm but a organization that provides services to other organizations and pays me (taking taxes out of my check). And according to the law, I&#8217;m not a contract worker and don&#8217;t see why my employer should be getting 50 percent of what I&#8217;m paid hourly.</em></p>
<p>Since taxes are being taken out of your check, you&#8217;re not being treated as an independent contractor. You&#8217;re a regular W2 employee; you&#8217;re just an employee of the staffing agency, rather than the firm where you&#8217;ve been placed.</p>
<p>The staffing agency negotiated a wage directly with you, which you agreed to. It also negotiated a fee with the company you were placed at in exchange for its services to them (finding, screening, and placing employees and handling the administrative oversight of those employees). That&#8217;s a completely separate issue that the pay they negotiated with you. But if you don&#8217;t like it, you&#8217;re free to try to either negotiate for more or leave and strike out on your own.</p>
<p><strong>5. Asking for a different title</strong></p>
<p><em>An academic requirement of my Master&#8217;s program is a second-year field practicum to help students link theory and practice. I&#8217;ve secured my placement for next year and it&#8217;s a great fit with my academic and professional interests.</em></p>
<p><em>My practicum host organization is working on the terms of reference right now and have suggested &#8220;Intern&#8221; or &#8220;Program Assistant&#8221; as my official title. Before going back to school, I worked as a project manager with an international consultancy. Beyond ensuring that I&#8217;m actually doing substantive work and putting my degree to use, how should I broach a discussion about something as seemingly petty as a title? I want to show on my resume that that I&#8217;ve taken on more responsibility over the years rather than taking a step backward.</em></p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m not sure that it <em>will</em> be more responsibility than what you had as a project manager, so I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily frame the discussion as a desire for that &#8212; because that might be unrealistic (unless I&#8217;m misunderstanding what the practicum involves). But you can certainly be straightforward about your desire for a different title: &#8220;Would it be possible to call the position X? It would helpful to me in the future to be able to convey to prospective employees that the position involved A, B, and C.&#8221; Just make sure that whatever title you do suggest is realistic and reflects the work you&#8217;ll be doing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Did my typo make this HR manager stop responding to me?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m going through a hiring process with a great company and for a position that I dream about. The first interview with the HR manager happened 3 weeks ago, and the next interview (in-person with the director of the department) will be in the last week of this month. The HR manager and I have been in contact for about 1 month and it has been quite smooth with quick replies. However, in my last email I asked some questions about the company&#8217;s corporate structure in order to better understand how my position will play out and I didn&#8217;t receive any answer. Today, 2 weeks after sending that e-mail, I opened the message with the objective to send her a reminder of my questions and I realized that in this specific email I made a mistake when typing the HR manager&#8217;s name. Basically, I added one extra vowel in the middle of her short name (like from Victoria, I wrote Vicatoria). I checked all the other messages and I didn&#8217;t see the same happening, it was only on 1 email. Do you think that it will kill my chances to be hired? Do you think that this is the reason why she is not answering my emails? What should I do now, send a reminder for my questions or simply leave it? The interview though still scheduled!</em></p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s not answering. I think she didn&#8217;t answer because you sent her an email with a bunch of questions that would take a while to write out answers to and which are better saved for an interview. (And also possibly because it sounds like you&#8217;ve been sending her multiple emails before this too.) So actually, it&#8217;s good that you made the typo because spotting it saved you from sending her a &#8220;reminder&#8221; to answer your questions, which would have been a mistake.</p>
<p>Save substantive questions for actual conversations. Email questions only when it&#8217;s imperative to ask &#8212; like confirming a interview time or checking on a hiring timeline.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do I have a job offer or don&#8217;t I?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in the late stages of a job search in a different city than where I currently live. I had a few phone interviews with members of the Human Capital Team, plus a phone interview with the executive director. I was out in the new city on April 1st to meet with the ED and she offered me the position on the spot. When I returned home a few days later I received an email letting me know that they would like to check my references (which seems standard ) but also that they need me to speak to someone at their national office.</em></p>
<p><em>Scheduling with this person has been a little tricky and is leaving me in a lurch: the interview was supposed to be this week but is now moved to next week (which means we are approaching three and a half weeks since my conversation with the ED). I want to be understanding that things happen but it is making me question the position and my standing with the organization&#8211;was I really offered a position? Where do I stand with them? The ED made it clear that they want someone who can start soon, but understands that I want to give my current position as much notice as possible and also need to move across the country for the position. My question is, is there anyway to check in and see where they are with me, either with someone in Human Capital or the ED herself? Is there anything else I can do to be an advocate for myself in this process?</em></p>
<p>At this point, assume you do not have an official job offer. It would totally fine, though, to email the ED and say something like, &#8220;My conversation with Jane has been pushed back to next week. Meanwhile, I hoped you could clarify for me where we stand &#8212; I&#8217;m not entirely clear on whether things still stand as they did when you and I spoke.&#8221; Alternately, you can email HR to ask, but since the ED herself offered you the job, she might be more inclined to push things through when she hears that they&#8217;ve been delayed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>We recently offered a candidate a position and offered a salary that we know is fair for the experience and skill set she brings, as we know of 5-6 other similarly sized nonprofits in the same field and their pay scale. She came back saying she was excited, but that her current salary was $7,500 more than our offer. She said she can verify this.</em></p>
<p><em>I was very skeptical of the salary she gave, as it is way out of line with all my experience with this organization. I verified with a contact I have there, and she does in fact make only about $3,500 more than offer. It appears she inflated her salary by $4,000.</em></p>
<p><em>My initial inclination is to rescind the offer, but she claims she can verify her salary. Should I give her that opportunity? Be transparent about my hesitancy? We did an extensive interview process and I&#8217;m disappointed now because it&#8217;s such a bad sign if she did lie, but I&#8217;m not 100% certain she did.</em></p>
<p>Well, first, I want to note that, in general, basing salary offers on a candidate&#8217;s previous salary isn&#8217;t a great idea. You should determine for yourself what a candidate is worth to you, and that&#8217;s what you should offer. Is she suddenly worth $7,500 more to you just because you learned that&#8217;s what she&#8217;s currently making? Setting salaries this way is a recipe for paying people more (or less) than they&#8217;re worth to you, creating unwarranted salary disparities on your staff (will she be making more than others doing the same work just as well or better?), and relying on your competitors to set your salaries for you rather than figuring them out yourself.</p>
<p>That said, I get that this happens all the time &#8212; I&#8217;ve been there myself. You make someone an offer that you think is fair, discover that it&#8217;s less than they&#8217;re currently making, realize that you can&#8217;t expect them to accept a new job for less, and decide that you can find it in your budget to match or slightly top their current salary so that they&#8217;ll come on over. (And this is far more understandable with a sum like $7,500 than it would be with a sum like $20,000, of course.)</p>
<p>But I do want you to factor this into your thinking, because you don&#8217;t want to get so focused on getting her to accept the offer that you forget to ask yourself if you think it&#8217;s fair and reasonable to pay what she&#8217;s asking you for &#8212; whether she&#8217;s earning that now or not.</p>
<p>As for what to do now &#8230; <em>if</em> you&#8217;re willing to pay her that salary if she&#8217;s truly making it now, but you have suspicions about whether she really is, you&#8217;re in a sticky situation. If you accept her offer to verify it for you, you risk finding yourself in a situation where you don&#8217;t believe her &#8220;verification,&#8221; whatever it might be (documents that you don&#8217;t think are real, for example), and then what are you going to do? Alternately, you could tell her you&#8217;ll do your own verification and do a more formal verification &#8212; with her permission &#8212; with her employer (more formal than just reaching out to your contact there, like you already did) &#8230; but I don&#8217;t really like that solution, because I don&#8217;t actually think it&#8217;s appropriate for prospective employers to do that &#8230; although if you&#8217;re really going to base salary on what people made previously, that&#8217;s the position it sticks you in.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re probably left with just being transparent. Say something like, &#8220;My understanding is that your role pays $X. What accounts for the discrepancy?&#8221; You might find out that she&#8217;s lumping in a bonus or something like that into her overall salary figure. (You can ask, &#8220;Is this all base salary, or does it include bonuses or other compensation?&#8221; to find that out.) Or you might find out that she&#8217;s talking about a raise she&#8217;s been told she&#8217;ll get in three months if she stays. Or, yes, she might be lying.</p>
<p>If she&#8217;s lying, it should absolutely be a deal-breaker. But I don&#8217;t see how you&#8217;re going to find out without engaging in actions I really don&#8217;t like (getting formal verification from her current employer). So I think we&#8217;re back where we started &#8212; offer her a salary that you think is fair and reasonable for the position, independent of what she&#8217;s making now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have two direct reports with two very different working styles.</em></p>
<p><em>One is more independent and usually runs with the project &#8212; she asks me for help or advice if something comes up. When she shares various projects with me, there are usually a couple of minor items that need correcting, which I share with her for next time. The next time she shows me a project, I see the same items that need correcting. I started to wonder if it was my communication style, so I also shared the corrections via email so it&#8217;s in writing. But the same thing happens again, regardless if I talked to her about it or wrote it down.</em></p>
<p><em>My second direct report needs a little more hand holding so there is constant communication. There are two extremes to his working style &#8212; he either gets wrapped up in the details and forgets the project objective so I need to bring him back on track or he rushes to finish the project, but neglects the details so there are multiple revisions and drafts. As with my other employee, I have communicated the project details and objectives verbally and also through email so he can refer to his notes, but I find him making the same errors or not paying attention to the details when we work on the next project.</em></p>
<p><em>One of the things I have wanted to avoid since becoming a manager was to not micromanage my staff. I understand there needs to be some micromanaging to make sure the team is on track with company goals and to make sure their priorities are clearly understood so they don&#8217;t waste their day working on unnecessary items.</em></p>
<p><em>Without becoming an uber micromanager, how can I communicate to my two reports that they need to pay attention to the details because the same mistakes are constantly being made and it is noticed not only by me, but the clients if they don&#8217;t show me the drafts?</em></p>
<p><em>I do not know if they are not listening to me or they are working too fast and forget. When I share my thoughts and offer suggestions I try to explain the reasoning so they both know, it&#8217;s not because &#8220;I told you so!&#8221; but actually the reason why we &#8220;use this terminology&#8221; or why we &#8220;decided to go with this format,&#8221; etc. I&#8217;m at the point where I really want to say (but never will), &#8220;This has happened multiple times and it shows that you are not listening to me &#8212; you need to start showing me every project you are working on because I no longer can depend that you are learning from past mistakes and putting effort into your work.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It sounds like you&#8217;re so focused on not wanting to be a micromanager that you&#8217;re missing the fact that your employees have legitimate performance issues that you should be addressing.</p>
<p>It is not micromanaging to clearly explain what a work product or outcome should look like, or to ask that work be done correctly, or to expect people to incorporate your feedback into their work in the future. That&#8217;s managing.</p>
<p>And there are times when a good manager should manage more closely than that as well, such as when an employee isn&#8217;t moving work forward, or it&#8217;s not being done well, or results are disappointing. Of course, if your close involvement is needed for a long stretch, it might be a sign that you don&#8217;t have the right person in the job and you&#8217;ll need to address that &#8212; but the answer meanwhile isn&#8217;t to stay hands-off if the work isn&#8217;t being done correctly.</p>
<p>So it sounds like it&#8217;s time to have a conversation with each of these two employees about the <em>pattern</em> you&#8217;re seeing. This is the step that managers often miss when they have concerns about someone&#8217;s work &#8212; they continue addressing each instance of the problem, and they get increasingly frustrated and concerned about the pattern, but they don&#8217;t sit down with the person and say, &#8220;Hey, we have a pattern here.&#8221; They assume the person sees the pattern as clearly as they do, but they never spell it out.</p>
<p>But you need to spell it out, because your employee may not see it as a pattern or realize that it&#8217;s risen to the level of a serious concern.</p>
<p>So with the first employee, say something like this: &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked several times before about making sure that I don&#8217;t need to make corrections to X, Y, and Z, but work keeps coming to me with those same mistakes in it. It&#8217;s become a pattern. What can you do differently going forward to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t continue to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>With the second employee, you need to have a bigger conversation, because the problems are more serious. You should not need to have so much handholding that there&#8217;s &#8220;constant communication,&#8221; and it&#8217;s a real problem that he forgets project objectives and neglects details to the point that there are multiples revisions and drafts required. With him, I think you need to consider that he might not be the right person for the job &#8230; but the place to start is by being very clear with him about the bar for performance that you need in the role (someone who doesn&#8217;t rush and make mistakes, someone who keeps their eye on the big-picture objective but still pays attention to the details, and someone who produces high-enough quality work that it can be finalized without so many revisions). Tell him what a successful performance in the role would look like, tell him where he&#8217;s not meeting that bar, and tell him that you need to see real improvement from him.</p>
<p>(And if the problems continue, at that point you&#8217;ll need to consider whether you need someone else in the role.)</p>
<p>The point here, overall, is that your job as a manager is to make sure that you&#8217;re getting the results you need. Part of getting great results in the long-term is hiring great people and giving them room to do their jobs well. But if you&#8217;re not getting the type of results you want &#8212; or if it&#8217;s taking an unreasonable amount of time to get them &#8212; then you need to step in and get more involved.</p>
<p>In your case, I think you&#8217;ve swung so far in the &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be a micromanager! Eeeekk, it&#8217;s a dirty word!&#8221; direction that you&#8217;re hesitating to actually manage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader asks:<em> </em></p>
<p><em>I work at a relatively small organization (40-50 employees) that recently expanded from having two levels of management (executive director and department managers) to adding a third level of project managers.  Our project managers were all internal hires, but some of our employees who have more years with the organization were not promoted because they were not the right fit for these positions. The positions involved more people/project managing, and though these employees are very good at their jobs, they had never shown any interest nor strengths in more traditional management skills and thus those areas had not been developed with them.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, I have a few employees looking for &#8220;their promotions&#8221; because they feel they have been with the organization a long time and want to see opportunities for movement for themselves. We are not that big of an organization &#8212; there is only so much vertical movement that can occur and keep it healthy and well structured.  Frankly, I am dealing with problems from two directions.  From the staff, I am trying to figure out how to develop employees and maintain their job satisfaction when there are few opportunities for upward movement. But I also want to make sure they are developing in a way that they are ready to move up when and if opportunities arise as the organization continues to grow.  From above, I have pressure to retain employees at all costs, even if that would mean promoting them into some random position I would have to create.</em></p>
<p><em>I personally don&#8217;t have a problem with employees deciding they need to move on to meet their professional goals.  While I don&#8217;t want to lose them, I can completely understand that someone might need to make that decision.  I just (a) don&#8217;t want to end up having to destroy my department because of forced restructuring in order to retain employees and (b) don&#8217;t want people to move on because I wasn&#8217;t doing my job in trying to develop them as best I could within their current positions.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s tiny answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Sending work emails during a tragedy</strong></p>
<p>(Sent on Monday.) <em>I&#8217;m in Boston, but many of my colleagues work out of our Boston office. Can you think of a good way to handle work emails today? Our office was far away from the explosions, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that some people weren&#8217;t out there today, or that they don&#8217;t know someone there today.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a lot of business I need to address, and I don&#8217;t want to let it fall behind. That said, I also don&#8217;t want to come across as callous or insensitive, and I am genuinely concerned that people from my office (or somebody they love) might have been affected. Can you think of a good way to be empathetic but still professional? Or should I just wait until later to send these emails? For what it&#8217;s worth, everybody in the Boston office has probably left for the day and will not see any communication from me until tomorrow.</em></p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s entirely up to what you&#8217;re comfortable with. Different people respond differently in these situations. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with putting things on hold that can be put on hold, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with continuing with your normal work, either. That said, if you can wait a day to send those emails, it&#8217;s probably a good way to go.</p>
<p><strong>2. Employer requires internal interviews to be done on unpaid time</strong></p>
<p><em>I work for a large (1,000-2,000 employees) nonprofit in Texas. At our department&#8217;s staff meeting recently, we were informed that all internal interviews were going to be off-the-clock as a cost savings measure.</em></p>
<p><em>While I understand that an interview with an external candidate would be unpaid (though it sure would be nice!), these positions are almost always filled internally. Of the 30 positions filled in the past five years, only two were by outside candidates. So, is it legal?</em></p>
<p>You know, I have no idea; I&#8217;ve never seen this addressed before. My hunch is that it is indeed legal, but that&#8217;s nothing more than a hunch. Of course, if you&#8217;re exempt, they can&#8217;t dock your pay (but they can make you use PTO for the time). It&#8217;s a pretty silly policy though &#8212; it&#8217;s a good way to make people feel nickel-and-dimed while not saving the organization very much money at all.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I suggest to my boss that she work out her differences with my coworker?</strong></p>
<p><em>My boss (Jane) and coworker (John) have a terrible communication problem. They are both telling everybody, except each other, what the problem is. Since they haven’t talked, I sense a blow up coming. It is review time, and I have indications that this will be when Jane tells John everything she is unhappy with. Unfortunately at that point Jane will have already sent it to the big boss for approval which will make it very hard to take back. I know John has valid reasons for some of the actions that he will be graded harshly on but since they are both too proud to speak, John won’t get to discuss those reasons until its too late. They used to be coworkers, and Jane was recently promoted to now being John’s boss. We all keep hearing from Jane how John also applied for Jane’s job and that he might have hard feelings. They used to be friends.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I suggest to my boss that she and my coworker and a bottle of Reisling need to sit down together and talk before she does his review?</em></p>
<p>These are grown-ups and this has nothing to do with you (in fact, it&#8217;s hard to imagine something that has less to do with you), so you should stay out of it and leave them to resolve it on their own.</p>
<p><strong>4. Employee wants to work from home while caring for a baby</strong></p>
<p><em>I have an employee I supervise who is pregnant, and we are discussing her options for work after her child is born. Our company is very small, with only 6 employees (so FMLA doesn&#8217;t apply), and this is the first time we&#8217;ve had a pregnant employee. This will be her first child. One of the options is her working from home part or all of the time. I told her that we would expect her to still have childcare while she was working from home, and she&#8217;s being a bit resistant to this (probably because of the expense, not because she&#8217;s an unreasonable person or problem employee), and asked where I heard this was the norm. Do you have any links from additional sources I can point her to that shows this happens at other companies? I thought it was pretty obvious that you can&#8217;t do your job and look after a newborn and do both 100%, but since I am also not a mother, I can&#8217;t speak with authority on how difficult I believe trying to do that would be.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, I would appreciate any advice you/your readers have on balancing compassion/understanding for an employee who&#8217;s about to be a new mother with the fact that we are a really small company that will really feel the pinch of an employee being gone for awhile. Since FMLA doesn&#8217;t apply, we&#8217;re just trying to figure out what is most fair for everyone (including those of us who will have to pick up her work while she is gone), with regards to maternity leave (including length and pay), what happens when she returns, etc. I don&#8217;t think her and her husband can afford to not have her work at least part time, so her just leaving altogether isn&#8217;t a possibility.</em></p>
<p>I would be very, very worried that she thinks she can work from home without any child care for an infant. And you are absolutely right that most teleworking policies require that teleworking employees have separate arrangements for child care. You can find confirmation of this <a href="https://sescomgt.com/article.php?id=201">here</a> or <a href="http://www.dm.usda.gov/employ/worklife/telework/faq.htm">here</a>, or in any of the numerous policies from the many companies and government agencies that post their teleworking policies online, like <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/hr/telecommuting-policy">this</a>, <a href="http://pinalcountyaz.gov/Departments/AirQuality/Documents/Travel%20Reduction/Sample%20Telecommuting%20Policy-Program.pdf">this</a>, or <a href="http://www.teleworkarizona.com/training/files/Temporary%20Telework%20Agreement%20Fillable.pdf">this</a>. (Search for &#8220;child&#8221; in all of these.)</p>
<p>As for figuring out her leave, I&#8217;d come up with a policy that will apply to all parental leaves going forward, not just hers. Paid maternity leave in the U.S. is unusual, although some companies do offer it. Generally employees use any accrued PTO they have, which they can supplement with short-term disability insurance (which you should have; if you don&#8217;t, now&#8217;s the time to get it), and take the rest unpaid. As for the length of her leave, regardless of pay, figure out what you can reasonably offer without undue hardship to the business or other staff.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I start job searching if a jerk is hired to replace my manager?</strong></p>
<p><em>My boss recently left our team. She was fantastic. I&#8217;m learning more and more that good bosses are hard to come by and she really was a rare breed. Making the transition more difficult is knowing that of the final 2 candidates, one of them is a real jerk. This person would likely make my life at my current job (which I really like!) near hell. I&#8217;ve been at this place for 1.5 years after a really difficult 4 year stint at a job I hated. I interviewed for jobs for 3 years until I found this one finally. I like it, and I had intended to park myself here for a while. It&#8217;s a great organization with a ton to learn.</em></p>
<p><em>What can I expect from a new boss coming in to manage a team that&#8217;s already set in place? I&#8217;ve been warned that if this jerky person gets hired, I should not waste anytime and get the heck out of dodge. When do I know if I have to jump ship? I really did not want to be doing a job search yet. (By the way, I&#8217;m 30, 7 years of experience.)</em></p>
<p>Wait and see how things play out. Don&#8217;t make any decisions prematurely; if this person is hired, give her some time and see what happens. You might find that things are much more bearable than you thought, or you might not. But there&#8217;s no reason to leave until you know for sure that you want to.</p>
<p><strong>6. Employers ask to schedule interviews and then never get back to me</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been job-hunting for a while now, and on multiple occasions I&#8217;ve been contacted by a prospective employer I&#8217;d applied or sent an inquiry to, saying they liked my work/resume/etc., and would like to set up an interview/meeting/chat. If they don&#8217;t suggest a date or time and leave it to me, I try to respond back promptly and politely, generally saying something along the lines of: &#8220;Thank you for your reply, and I would be happy to meet with you. How does (I suggest a date and general time of day &#8212; usually 1-3 days away) work for you? Otherwise, I&#8217;ll be available any time (give them a time range, usually the whole next week or the remainder of the week) at your earliest convenience.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Then all of a sudden, I never get a response. Even if I responded to them 5-10 minutes following their email to me. This has happened to me two or three times now, and I&#8217;m starting to really worry that it&#8217;s more than a string of bad luck. Am I going about this all wrong, coming off too demanding or aggressive? Could this even be a sign that a reference or past employer is giving me a bad reference? Or is this a problem on their end? Either way, I&#8217;m unsure what I should do in a situation like this &#8212; should I try to follow up again after a few days or a week, or just move on?</em></p>
<p>This is actually pretty normal, believe it or not. You&#8217;re either dealing with people who are horribly unorganized, or they&#8217;ve already booked their desired number of phone interviews for the position before you get back to them. Either way, it&#8217;s really rude, but it&#8217;s also <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2010/06/employer-left-me-message-but-wouldnt.html">really, really common</a>.</p>
<p>You can certainly try following up after a couple of days, but then I&#8217;d move on.</p>
<p><strong>7. Asking an interviewer to put in a good word for me for another job</strong></p>
<p><em>I had a very successful couple interviews with a city government office for &#8220;Congressman Jim.&#8221; I was one of the final three candidates for the position (and the only one they were considering without a Master&#8217;s degree). The interviews were friendly and warm &#8212; we got along great! They didn&#8217;t wind up hiring anyone because their budget was downsized due to the sequestration, but they assured me they really liked me and hoped to be in touch when the budget is normalized. Now I see an almost identical position posted at another city government office, for &#8220;Assemblyman Steve.&#8221; Jim and Steve are close but not coworkers: Jim was a mentor to Steve, but now Jim works in national politics and Steve works very locally. Would it be appropriate to ask the director of Jim&#8217;s office, who managed the hiring process and interviewed me, to put in a good word for me at Steve&#8217;s office?</em></p>
<p>Yes. Normally I would say no, your interviewers don&#8217;t know you well enough to do that, but in this particular case, you built a great rapport with them and they want to keep in touch.</p>

<p><em>I have accepted a new position and am in the process of transitioning from one job to another. I know it is fairly customary to send &#8220;farewell&#8221; emails to coworkers, but I would also like to let colleagues outside of my organization that I am departing. I am, however, struggling with what to say to these external colleagues.</em></p>
<p><em>I work for a nonprofit on an issue within a fairly tight-knit, collaborative professional community, and although I&#8217;m sure word of my departure has already traveled quickly through the grapevine, I would like to let those who I&#8217;ve worked with most closely know personally. How much information (where I am going, personal contact information, etc.) is it appropriate to divulge in a situation like this?</em></p>
<p>Generally speaking, you want to say something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I want to let you know that after four years with Chocolate Teapots Inc., I&#8217;ve made the difficult decision to move on to a new role outside the company. After May 1, Skyler White will be your contact for anything related to teapot manufacture; she&#8217;s fantastic, and you&#8217;ll be in good hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After May 1, if you&#8217;d ever like to get in touch, you can reach me at (personal email address).&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously, modify as appropriate &#8212; making it more or less formal, etc. And you don&#8217;t need to say they&#8217;ll be in good hands if you don&#8217;t actually believe it, but it&#8217;s nice to include if you do. Same thing goes for calling the decision &#8220;difficult&#8221; &#8212; you can remove that if it&#8217;s not true and you can&#8217;t stomach saying it.</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s not included in the message above is where you&#8217;re going &#8212; and that&#8217;s because whether or not to include that depends on the practices (and maybe policies) of your current workplace. Some places really, really don&#8217;t like you promoting your next employer to their clients, particularly if it&#8217;s a competitor. (Of course, they can&#8217;t stop you from sharing that information after you leave, but if you&#8217;re sending the email while you&#8217;re still working there, you should take that into account.) Others don&#8217;t care at all, and in some fields it would be really odd <em>not</em> to include that info &#8212; so you just need to know how it&#8217;s typically done in your field and in your office.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re not sure, it&#8217;s fine to ask your manager. Speaking of which, ideally part of the discussion with your manager when you&#8217;re planning your transition should be a communications plan &#8212; who needs to be told you&#8217;re leaving, what additional information do they need to be given (such as &#8220;please see Skyler for X after I leave&#8221;), and are there any additional considerations to take into account (like whether you should wait to tell Jesse until you talk to Walter, because Walter would want to hear it first). And this fits perfectly into that discussion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Last May, I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor&#8217;s of Science in Telecommunications, Production with a minor in English. I&#8217;ve had just the most terrible time finding a job, in my field or outside of it. I&#8217;ve had several interviews over the last year of job searching, but not so much luck.</em></p>
<p><em>However, a few months after graduating, I came into contact with a company in my area hiring for positions in my field. By September, after having a phone interview and an in-person interview, I was offered an entry-level position with the company and I was ecstatic. It was great pay, eventual great benefits, the company was small but growing, the people all seemed super friendly&#8230;it was the perfect place to start my career.</em></p>
<p><em>My first day on the job rolls around and I was a nervous wreck. I was having stomach issues, nerves, and I tossed and turned all night. I made the hour drive to the workplace and went in with high hopes and a sense of accomplishment. All was going well and I was satisfied with the first day. I was scheduled from 9-5 that day to be able to work with the manager and learn the job before I started my real shifts and everything. It was around 4:30, I was sitting in the area with the manager, a coworker, and another associate. I guess in one way or another I dozed off in the chair, totally not intentional, just some horrible thing. And I know this is something you absolutely DO NOT do at work, and certainly not on your first day. But it happened.</em></p>
<p><em>Five rolls around, and I go home. I go in the next morning and my manager pulls me aside and says the whole thing about that&#8217;s unacceptable behavior and it won&#8217;t be tolerated and he let me go. I couldn&#8217;t explain or anything, his mind was made up. So one day and I get fired. And since then, I haven&#8217;t been able to get as far with a company&#8230;I can&#8217;t even seem to get close. This situation/experience has really killed my confidence in myself and I&#8217;m struggling to just get any kind of job now.</em></p>
<p><em>So, I guess I just would be super grateful for some advice and maybe some reassurance that this happens to people and I won&#8217;t be forever doomed and forever unemployed. I know I&#8217;ve just been a year out of college, but it&#8217;s still truly discouraging! But I truly need some help as to how to address this on applications and in interviews. I obviously wouldn&#8217;t bring this up if I wasn&#8217;t asked, nor would I put it on a resume because it&#8217;s definitely not something that would boost my value. However, if asked on an application if I&#8217;ve ever been fired/terminated/let go/asked to leave, is it lying if I say no or do I have to say yes&#8230;even though it was only ONE DAY with this company? I don&#8217;t know if that shows up on anything, but I definitely would want to be honest, but I&#8217;m just not sure how to go about it without making myself look super awful and pathetic.</em></p>
<p><em>Honestly, I just want to put this behind me and move on, I&#8217;m just having trouble doing so because I don&#8217;t know how to address it on an application or interview if it comes up, and because well&#8230;it has truly discouraged me and nicked my confidence down to just about nothing.</em></p>
<p>Ugh, that&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p>I remember starting one of my first jobs out of college and finding the first day absolutely exhausting, to the point that my eyelids felt heavy in an afternoon meeting that first day. There&#8217;s something about having to be &#8220;on&#8221; for eight straight hours when you&#8217;re not used to it yet that really can be exhausting. You get used to it pretty fast, but that first day when you&#8217;re just starting out can be brutal.</p>
<p>So while falling asleep on the job &#8212; let alone on your first day &#8212; is obviously Not Good, it doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re a horrible person or that you&#8217;ll never get a job again. And I also suspect this will be a great story to tell in 10 years.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not 10 years out yet, and you feel terrible right now, so let&#8217;s tackle that.</p>
<p>First, I do not think you need to put this on applications, just as you&#8217;re not putting it on your resume. It was one day, for crying out loud. It barely counts as a job. The chances of this being tracked down and hurting you in some way are close to zero. (And yes, some people will tell you that you have to put it on applications anyway, because they ask you to list every job you&#8217;ve ever had, blah blah blah, but practically speaking, it&#8217;s incredibly unlikely to ever come up again. And the risk that it will is far outweighed by the probable harm of including it.)</p>
<p>Second, you say this has destroyed your confidence, but it should not. After all, <em>you were not fired because of your work or your interpersonal skills or anything that&#8217;s really about you as a person</em>. Unless you are in the habit of going around sleeping when you should not be, or not taking important things seriously (but you sound pretty conscientious, so I doubt that&#8217;s the case), this was just terrible luck.</p>
<p>Of course, if I&#8217;m wrong and actually you <em>are</em> pretty laissez-faire in your approach to important things, then take this as a wake-up call that you need to stop that. (Wake-up call! Hahahahaha!)</p>
<p>But you know, you sound like you&#8217;re mortified and like you absolutely understand that falling asleep at work isn&#8217;t okay. You don&#8217;t sound like someone who needs to be lectured or shamed about it. You get it. So this is a much different response and a much different prognosis for you than if you&#8217;d sounded cavalier about it or indignant that you were fired. The fact that you get it means that you get to move on from it, as is the case with most big mistakes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry this happened to you. It sucks. But you <em>will</em> move on from it, I promise, and meanwhile you have my permission to wipe this dark day from your mind and function as if it did not happen (aside from any wake-up call that it signals you need, and aside from 10 years from now, when you will pull this story back out from the far recesses of your mind and regale people with it).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Employer hired me under false pretenses</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently accepted a one-year grant funded position at a university. The position requires a lot of irregular hours, travel, relationship building, and use of my personal network. I was told it was a one-year position because there was no guarantee the grant would be renewed.</em></p>
<p><em>When reading through the documents about the grant, I discovered that it actually ends in 2017. I inquired about this, and my manager, who turned red, said that after one year my position will be taken over by my current coworker &#8212; the one who actually applied for the grant. The grant she currently works under ends this year and thus she can secure employment by taking over the grant I was hired under &#8212; leaving me out of a job. I feel deceived. Everytime I do well on the job, this coworker looked jealous &#8212; well, now I understand why ! I certainly don&#8217;t feel like throwing all my resources into this program just to have it transferred to my coworker next year. Plus, how do I explain this to new employers? I can&#8217;t exactly say that the grant ends in a year because it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Wow. It would certainly be reasonable to go back to your manager and tell her that you&#8217;re disappointed that she wasn&#8217;t honest with you about the plans for the grant. What a horrible lack of integrity on her side.</p>
<p>But as for what to do tell prospective employers, you can simply say that it&#8217;s always been intended as a one-year position &#8230; since apparently it has been.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is this line okay in a cover letter?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve seen plenty of sample cover letters in which the author says, &#8220;I&#8217;m writing to apply for the position of __. I am confident that my training and experience in math, fast food, and child rearing will enable me to contribute significantly in this position.&#8221; To me, the second sentence offers a reason why anyone should read my cover letter and provides something of an outline of what is coming. However, at least one hiring person (in an academic context anyway) said that he does not like such statements. He will decide for himself if I would contribute to his department. Is this initial &#8220;sales&#8221; line good or bad?</em></p>
<p>Yep, I agree with your source &#8212; those sorts of lines are bad. They&#8217;re too much telling me that you&#8217;ll be good and not enough SHOWING me that you&#8217;ll be good. And plus, when I don&#8217;t know you or have any idea how reliable your self-assessments are, I put exactly zero weight on your belief that you&#8217;ll do well in the position, so it&#8217;s just a line taking up space, and doing so in a kind of cheesy, mildly annoying way.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can I suggest I take on two jobs at my current company for more money?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am salaried and work in customer service at a small company (15 people). My company just put out a job ad for a different department. They want to hire a part-timer who would work 10-20 hours a week. With a bit of shuffling of my daily routine, I could devote enough time to fill the needs of that position without taking away from my current duties. With the hourly pay they listed in the ad, they would be paying the part-timer somewhere around $10k per year. Would it be acceptable to set up a meeting with the owner (my manager) explaining that I would like to adopt the part-time job and would be willing to work early or late to finish the tasks for something like a $7k raise in salary?</em></p>
<p>If they want someone who will work up to 20 hours a week, they&#8217;re unlikely to think that you can do that on top of your current job without compromising one or both of the positions. In other words, you might be able to do both, but it&#8217;s unlikely that you, as one person, can do both jobs as well as two people would be able to.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> potentially propose that you could do a smaller portion of what&#8217;s currently planned for the part-time job, plus an abbreviated portion of your current position, but you won&#8217;t look realistic if you suggest doing both as they&#8217;re currently envisioned.</p>
<p><strong>4. Explaining why I&#8217;m leaving nonprofits</strong></p>
<p><em>I would like your opinion about communicating a desire to leave the nonprofit sector. I began my career at what I thought were high-stress jobs and desperately wanted a low-key job. I have had that at a nonprofit now for more than three years, but the problem is &#8220;low key&#8221; means no one is motivated or held accountable! I have a tremendous amount of self-motivation and see that I need a work environment with slightly more competition and room for professional growth. I also am much better at managing my stress, so that would not be a problem for me anymore and I can focus on developing a career at one company.</em></p>
<p><em>Another factor is the cause I work on. It has become important to me, but I want to distance myself from it because it&#8217;s weighing on me more personally the longer I work here. I also cannot see myself making local nonprofits my career like the people I meet at conferences.</em></p>
<p><em>I know many people would love to work at a nonprofit, which makes me wonder how it looks to a hiring manager to see someone looking to leave a locally well-known nonprofit agency for a higher-stress job that is far less philanthropic. It was easy for me to say I wanted to &#8220;do good&#8221; and work at a nonprofit, but how do I say I want to do good as a donor or volunteer and not an employee anymore?</em></p>
<p>Well, first of all, not all nonprofits are low-key, so let&#8217;s not tar them all with that brush. You can absolutely find nonprofits that are fast-paced, rigorous, and hold people to a high bar. (Just like you can also find slow-paced, poorly managed organizations in any sector.)</p>
<p>Anyway, as far as how to explain this to future employers, it&#8217;s not like you built a career in nonprofits that you&#8217;re now leaving; you worked at one job in the sector. You&#8217;re unlikely to face demands about why you don&#8217;t want to do good anymore, but if you&#8217;re questioned about it, you can simply say, &#8220;I really enjoyed working at ABC, but I&#8217;m ready for something new, and the position with you excites me because ____.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like you would if you were leaving any job in any sector. And you&#8217;re better off looking at it that way yourself too, rather than writing off the entire nonprofit sector on the basis of one bad organization.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I disclose freelance work to a new employer, and a new job to my freelance clients?</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m a freelancer and am interviewing for full-time jobs. I have one or two freelance projects that I have to see through to the end, which will take 2-3 months. If I do take a full-time job, should I tell the employer about the projects I’m finishing up and/or the freelance client that I’m taking a full-time job? If yes, what should I say to either party?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no need to tell the new employer that you&#8217;ll be spending the next few weeks finishing up freelance projects, unless they have a conflict of interest or other policy that would require you to disclose it. I would, however, let your clients know that you&#8217;re taking a full-time job so that they know that you won&#8217;t be available for further work after their current projects are wrapped up (and so they understand that you&#8217;ll have a new schedule for the remainder of these projects).</p>
<p><strong>6. Finding jobs working from home</strong></p>
<p><em>Abbreviated version of my story for you- I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 1996 when I was 24 years old. I had just graduated from college with a B.S. in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. I went through many rough years but am doing pretty good health wise now with one caveat &#8212; I can not drive.</em></p>
<p><em>I have been active in volunteer work, kept up to date on technology, got a certification in Religious Studies, and currently teach one night a week at a local parish. Here is my conundrum &#8212; I am bored. I have been working part-time jobs from home and close to my home for the past 6 years that are below my capabilities. Obviously I understand I am limited but it is hard to work at minimum wage jobs and I feel like I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;career.&#8221; I am currently expanding my knowledge in blogging, writing, looking for other at-home opportunities &#8212; anything I can do from home to supplement or replace what I am doing now . Have you any advice for work-at-homers/disabled to expand from the call center trap? I don&#8217;t want to seem unappreciative, I know I am lucky in my situation. There just seem to be other options!</em></p>
<p>In my experience, it&#8217;s hard to get legitimate work-from-home jobs unless you&#8217;ve already been working for the employer previously, but maybe that&#8217;s changing. I&#8217;ll throw this out to readers to see if anyone has good suggestions for you.</p>
<p><strong>7. I don&#8217;t think my new job is the right fit</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you do if you are a few weeks into a new job and concerned that it may be a bad fit? Among the issues I&#8217;m concerned about are: (1) I seem to be spending way more time than I would like on a certain part of my job when I was told that my duties would be more spread-out, (2) commute is wearing heavily on me, and (3) company culture is not what I was hoping for.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it better to cut my losses now and leave (potentially omitting this job from my resume altogether)? Or should I stick it out and maybe move on a year if I&#8217;m still not happy? Does your answer change if I say that my last few jobs have had relatively short tenures due to family moves and companies going out of business?</em></p>
<p>It depends on (a) how miserable you are, and (b) how long it&#8217;s likely to take you to get another offer (which you hopefully know based on how long it took you to get this one). But yes, the fact that your last few jobs have been short-term is a point in favor of staying &#8212; but not for a year; you&#8217;d need to stay for a few years to counteract the perception of job-hopping. Which might be a deal-breaker in a job you already don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>But jobs do often get better if you give them a chance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Sunday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. I told someone to get out of my spot during a break at work</strong></p>
<p><em>During coffee breaks at work, my coworkers and I all sit in a conference room if no one is using it. We all have our certain places where we sit and have sat for years. And there are certain people that you don&#8217;t mess with and you don&#8217;t sit in their spot.</em></p>
<p><em>A person who has been working in our office for a year sat in my spot and I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s my spot&#8221; and the person said that they had seniority because they were older and not because they had worked there longer. The chair had wheels on it, so I wheeled the person over one space and put a new chair in my spot and sat down. Later, the person came to my cubicle and said that they were embarrassed and thought that what I did was really rude. So I apologized and they left.</em></p>
<p><em>Now I wonder how bad was this really? I didn&#8217;t think it was big deal at the time, but I have been obsessing all day about this and wondering if what I did was really out of line and horrible. Should I be expecting anything else in the form of reprimand? Should I talk to this person again or just let it go? Should I not go back to coffee or will that make a mountain out of a mole hill?</em></p>
<p>Yes, that was rude. But you apologized and you don&#8217;t need to stop going to coffee over it, and you probably don&#8217;t need to apologize a second time. But all of you should chill out about owning your spots, because, come on, really?</p>
<p><strong>2. Can you mention that you&#8217;re excited about a job because it&#8217;s close to your house and family-friendly?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied for a position where the ad did not mention the name of the firm or location, so I was pleasantly surprised to find out it&#8217;s only 5 minutes drive away from my home &#8212; walking distance! I got an interview, and the manager emphasized how family-oriented they were and while they didn&#8217;t offer great benefits, they were flexible if you needed to leave early to bring kids to a doctor occasionally, etc. (they know I have kids as I mention it in my cover letter to explain a gap in my work history). In my thank-you note after the interview, I thanked them for the interview, mentioned a few business reasons why I think I would be great for the job, and then as a last sentence, how happy I would be to work for a family-oriented business that is so close to my home. My friend says I should not have mentioned it, as it sounds like I want the position for convenience&#8230; is she right? I would take the job even if it was further away, but the location is definitely a bonus.</em></p>
<p>Your friend is right. They want to hire someone who&#8217;s excited about the job for the job&#8217;s sake, not because of the commute or benefits. (And after all, what happens if they move to a different location?) In general, you want to stick to focusing on the job.</p>
<p><strong>3. Listing achievements at unrelated positions on your resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about listing older work positions I have held that do not contribute to the requirements of jobs I am presently applying for. Do I need to put bulleted accomplishments for those jobs or can I simply list the position and use the extra space for those positions that have much more relevant accomplishments? The positions I am applying for are early career level and I do not think it would benefit me to go beyond a one-page resume.</em></p>
<p>Focus on the jobs that are most relevant to the work you&#8217;re applying for. That doesn&#8217;t mean that other accomplishments aren&#8217;t relevant, though. If you can show a track record of achievement and getting things done, that&#8217;s always going to be a good thing, even if it&#8217;s in a different field.</p>
<p><strong>4. Working more hours than I&#8217;ve been authorized to work</strong></p>
<p><em>I just started working as temporary part-time job. I work 28 hours a week for four days a week. On my first day of work, I was told that I can&#8217;t have work more than 28 hours because then, they would have to do extra work in filing the needed papers to get paid. The bottom line is, it&#8217;s going to be more work for my supervisor, and she doesn&#8217;t want to deal with it.</em></p>
<p><em>In the two weeks that I have worked there, the amount of work that they want me to accomplish often exceeds 28 hours. So I tend to stay after hours to complete the tasks (it has happened about 3 days so far). I have been logging in my hours for all the hours I have worked, despite working over 28 hours. Seeing the upcoming projects as well as events that I am helping to manage, I will be staying a lot longer than 28 hours for the remaining time at this company. Moreover, I have had them contact me over the phone and email on the weekend and my day off to give me tasks. I want to do my job well, but I don&#8217;t want to compromise my time off to accomplish those tasks. How do I manage this situation? Should I only work during the time that I am paid for or do I work during my time to get those tasks done to show to my supervisors that I can do a good job?</em></p>
<p>First, stop working more than 28 hours/week, because you were explicitly told not to do that, so doing it anyway is a big deal. Second, talk to your manager and explain that the amount of work you&#8217;re being given would take more than 28 hours a week, and ask how she wants you to handle it. She may tell you to push certain projects back, or she may assign some work to someone else, or she may approve you to work more hours. But you cannot work more hours than you&#8217;ve been authorized without potentially getting into trouble when it&#8217;s caught. (And I can&#8217;t tell from your letter whether you&#8217;re reporting the hours or not; if you&#8217;re not, and you&#8217;re non-exempt, you could get the company into legal trouble because they&#8217;re legally required to pay you for all hours worked.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Resigning when my boss is out on medical leave</strong></p>
<p><em>My boss is on FMLA. He was out most of first quarter, came back for a couple weeks, and is out again. During this second leave, his surgery has been delayed, and now I realistically do not see him back until the end of Q2.</em></p>
<p><em>I have accepted an offer that starts in 6 weeks. Before the surgery delay, my plan had been to give my boss 2 weeks notice. I&#8217;ve seen him show people the door, but I haven&#8217;t seen anyone at my level resign. We&#8217;ve worked closely together, and it&#8217;s going to be a big surprise to him. I would say he&#8217;s been a mentor. I did not sign a non-compete, and I will be working for a privately held portion of the same company. My ongoing relationship is very important.</em></p>
<p><em>My new plan is to resign to the CEO, with more notice. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll show me the door. But my question is how to break this news to my current boss? And when? I don&#8217;t want to stress him out during a medical procedure, but this will be a big shock. Also, I&#8217;m not staying local &#8212; I&#8217;m moving cross country, so I can&#8217;t just wait and tell him when he gets back.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re almost certainly overestimating the impact this is going to have on your boss. It&#8217;s very, very unlikely that this is going to cause him stress during his medical procedure. People leave jobs all the time; it&#8217;s normal. He might be disappointed, but he&#8217;ll get over it. Just call him and tell him, and offer to do whatever you can to make the transition easy (although obviously be sensitive to his situation and don&#8217;t call him on the day of his surgery or while he&#8217;s on heavy painkillers afterwards &#8212; just like you presumably wouldn&#8217;t call him about any other work thing on those days).</p>
<p><strong>6. Relatives endorsing you on LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p><em>I have over 300 LinkedIn contacts, and am actively engaged in a job search. A small percentage of my contacts are my relatives, including my parents. Every now and then, my mother or one of her many cousins will endorse me for some skill or another. Does this make me look as bad as I think it does? On a related note, sometimes colleagues endorse me for skills, in what I believe is an attempt to have me return the favor. However, I rarely feel comfortable returning the favor. Is it better to keep the peace and endorse someone I don&#8217;t believe in, or maintain some level of integrity?</em></p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t think anyone is paying much attention to LinkedIn endorsements, since they lack all credibility. Anyone can endorse you for anything, whether they know you and have worked with you or not. I wouldn&#8217;t spend your time endorsing people because it&#8217;s so worthless, but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about the source of your endorsements either. (For anyone unclear, we&#8217;re talking about skill endorsements here, not recommendations. Frankly, LinkedIn recommendations don&#8217;t carry a ton of weight either &#8212; as is true of any recommendation that the recommendee sees &#8212; but they&#8217;re not as ridiculous as skill endorsements.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Applying for a job after starting to volunteer</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently accepted a volunteer position at a company, but I have not actually started yet because of red tape. I am set to work in a department the company does not usually allow volunteers to work in, but the Volunteers Director obtained a special volunteer spot for me there because I have the qualifications that a typical employee there would have.</em></p>
<p><em>To be honest, I applied to be a volunteer because there were no openings for the job I am interested in at this company. However, the company recently posted a job listing for a position I have been coveting and has highly similar responsibilities as the volunteer position.</em></p>
<p><em>I am torn because with the job, I could be getting paid to do the same work I would be doing as an unpaid volunteer. But at the same time, I feel that if I apply for the job and get accepted, I would be making a really bad impression, not to mention betraying the director who made the special arrangements to get me into the department in the first place as a volunteer. Would it be considered &#8220;jumping ship&#8221; and inappropriate if I apply for the job instead of volunteering?</em></p>
<p>Go ahead and apply. If you&#8217;re the best person for the job, they&#8217;d almost certainly rather have you in that role than volunteering (for presumably far less hours and with less responsibility).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Asking for a far-off start date</strong></p>
<p><em>I have an interview coming up soon for a job that is a little over two hours away from where I currently live. The job site is in a popular beach location notorious for horrific traffic in the summer and there is no public transit on weekdays. So, I will have to move to take this job if offered.</em></p>
<p><em>I am anticipating they might ask me in the interview how quickly I could be ready to start and the truth is, the ideal time for me would probably be about 4-6 weeks from receiving the offer. This will give me time to find an affordable place to live, pack up my current place, and wrap up some volunteer work I am doing, as well as receive my tax refund to help pay the moving costs. However, if it&#8217;s going to make the difference between them hiring me or someone else, I *can* start earlier and just pay through the nose for a hotel until I find a cheap place. I can leave most of my belongings with a friend and live out of a suitcase. This would be a real hardship for me but one I&#8217;m willing to suffer if necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts on how I should answer the question if asked, and whether 4-6 weeks is a reasonable time to ask them to wait in these circumstances? Also, is there an appropriate way to say, &#8220;hey, if you guys want to give me an advance of $1,000 or so I can start in 3 days!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Say, &#8220;Because I&#8217;m moving, ideally I&#8217;d love to start 4-6 weeks from receiving an offer, but I do have some flexibility if you need someone more quickly than that. What kind of timeline are you hoping for?&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t say that you can start within days if they give you an advance; most places do not do payroll advances for employees who haven&#8217;t even started working there yet (since you may not show up or work that full period).</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I take a lower salary when changing fields?</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to change careers from a science background to HR. I am currently in school for my Associates in Business Administration, but am chomping at the bit to get a job that will develop my business skills.</em></p>
<p><em>I have the opportunity to work for a staffing firm performing administrative tasks that really interest me and will add much needed experience to my resume. The problem is, the salary is much lower than my current salary. The wage is what the position is budgeted for; they didn&#8217;t drop the pay scale just because I&#8217;m a newbie to the industry. </em><em>My question is: when changing careers, should I expect to take a lower salary because I&#8217;m essentially starting fresh? I&#8217;ve put many resumes out there with no bites, and I know it&#8217;s because I need some serious experience. My current position offers few transferable skills.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you should expect to take a lower salary when changing careers and starting at the bottom. They&#8217;re not going to significantly raise the pay range for a junior position just because you have experience in an unrelated field.</p>
<p><strong>3. Addressing staff problems when you&#8217;re friends with your employees</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a manager of a small satellite office of six employees. I know that as manager I should not be friends with my coworkers, but our office is so small it is unavoidable. Also, I personally like to work in a fun, irreverent office so I foster that kind of culture. Typically it works out really well. Everyone has fun and works well together. But occasionally I have encountered incidents where my coworkers have crossed the line with me. For example, they feel like they can be curt or rude to me when they&#8217;re angry, which is something I would never do to my manager, no matter how close we are. How would you recommend handling that kind of situation, when I am walking the line between being a manager and a friend?</em></p>
<p><em>Is there any way other than directly addressing the problem with the coworker, which in the past has not worked particularly well? For some reason, when I&#8217;ve actually addressed behavior, it seems to cement the resentment.</em></p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re basically saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have an appropriate manager-managee relationship with my staff, except on some occasions when I want the benefits of it without the work.&#8221; If you <a href="http://quickbase.intuit.com/blog/2011/10/28/hiring-managing-a-friend-proceed-with-caution/  ">blur the boundaries</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise that your staff thinks the boundaries have been blurred. And I can&#8217;t really let you get away with saying that this is &#8220;unavoidable&#8221; because it&#8217;s not, and plenty of other managers in small offices do manage to avoid it.</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re addressing issues head-on and &#8220;it&#8217;s not worked particularly well,&#8221; then you need to be firmer in your approach and you need to set and <em>enforce</em> consequences. And if you have people acting resentfully toward you, you need to address that too. You&#8217;re their manager &#8212; you need to act like it. Every day, not just when there&#8217;s something you want to address. And honestly, this isn&#8217;t really optional or something you get to decide not to do just because you prefer to run things differently. Unless you&#8217;re the owner of this business, you have an obligation to act like a manager, because that&#8217;s the job you&#8217;re being paid to do.</p>
<p><strong>4. Using a .edu email address when you didn&#8217;t graduate</strong></p>
<p><em>I am no longer a college student, but my school still lets me forward my .edu mail to my own email account. Now, I did not graduate. Is it okay to use this .edu address for job search/business? Also, I have a habit of changing email addresses and forgetting my passwords/security Q&amp;As. But I never forget my .edu login information. So, using this .edu address would be convenient. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s fine to use a .edu address in job-searching, and there&#8217;s no reason that you can&#8217;t use it just because you didn&#8217;t graduate. But find a better way to track your other passwords.</p>
<p><strong>5. Telling non-local employers I can only fly out once for interviews</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in the process of relocating, and I have had several phone interviews and a couple of face-to-face interviews. I come to town once I have at least four interviews set up. My last trip, the guy who was to interview me couldn&#8217;t make it, but I did get to interview with the HR rep. Now they are asking me to come back in a month once I get settled (I was looking to move in a month). My problem is that I can&#8217;t move without a job and I can&#8217;t continue to fly back and forth at $250-$350 each trip. I feel like these companies are acting like I just drove from 15 minutes way. How do I convey to potential employers that I need to interview all at once and that coming back and forth is too costly? I am not working now due to a recent layoff so I&#8217;m available but it&#8217;s not cheap.</em></p>
<p>You can certainly say, &#8220;Would it be possible to meet with everyone I&#8217;d need to meet with on this trip since I&#8217;m flying in from out of town?&#8221; But it might simply not be possible. Employers have different stages of interviews, and they might not decide until after round 1 who they&#8217;d like to meet with in round 2. Plus, keep in mind that many employers <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/08/22/how-to-conduct-a-long-distance-job-search  ">don&#8217;t interview non-local candidates</a> at all precisely because they don&#8217;t want to deal with this kind of inconvenience (hence the &#8220;call us once you&#8217;ve moved here&#8221;), so you&#8217;re not really in an optimal position if you want a long-distance job offer. It&#8217;s much, much easier to get a job when you&#8217;re already living in the location, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>6. Mentioning client names in a cover letter or resume</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it bad practice to mention the name of a client company in a cover letter or resume? For example, I used to work at a consulting group (Teapot Consulting, Inc.) that conducted research for client organizations in a specific sector. I worked on projects for Tiny Teapots, Teapot University, Teapots Unlimited, and Organic Teapots. Now I am applying for an in-house research role at Inflatable Teapots. Should I mention the names of the companies I did work for? Or would a more general statement about experience in the teapot industry &#8212; without mentioning company names &#8212; be more appropriate (while still highlighting my successes of course)?</em></p>
<p>How impressive will it be to mention them? If it will be impressive, and if it doesn&#8217;t violate any written or unofficial policy of your current employer, then yes, mention them. Otherwise, a more general statement is fine.</p>
<p><strong>7. Explaining why I&#8217;m job-searching during a restructure</strong></p>
<p><em>For the past three years, I&#8217;ve worked in a regional office for a nationally known not-for-profit organization. We have a new president who is conducting a reorganization of the company. He has already eliminated one department, and nobody feels their job is safe. Rumors are flying everywhere, and a lot of us are job hunting. There is no direct indication that my department is in jeopardy, but I don&#8217;t want to be caught unprepared. When interviewing for jobs, how can I best answer the question of why I&#8217;m looking to leave my current position?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;My organization recently brought in a new president who is doing a lot of restructuring, and it&#8217;s causing some upheaval.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work for a small company where all of our junior-level employees (all in our early 20s) are encouraged to act as a unit &#8212; e.g. we communicate among ourselves to split work, address administrative things, and fix issues before going to more senior staff. We also manage a number of semi-mundane, ongoing tasks that are often not fun at all but part of the job.</em></p>
<p><em>Two employees recently joined at this junior level, one starting a couple of months after the other. This is relevant because the newer employee was referred by the first after they worked together as interns elsewhere and they obviously have a friendly rapport. The issue: They have both been complaining, LOUDLY, about those mundane tasks I mentioned. We have an open office environment and people as far away as two or three desks down &#8212; including more senior employees &#8212; can hear their complaints.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s obviously unprofessional and needs to be addressed, but do I address this with them as a fellow junior employee? Do I pull them aside and say, &#8220;I&#8217;ve overheard some of your comments recently about the work, about not enjoying it or being frustrated with it. I understand that some of the work is not as interesting as other work, but people senior to you can hear those complaints and it doesn&#8217;t come off well.&#8221; Or, do I tell their managers (one of whom is also mine)?</em></p>
<p>Either or both.</p>
<p>It would be perfectly appropriate to talk to them and say something along the lines of what you suggested. (I want to tell you to also add that it&#8217;s unpleasant to hear and doesn&#8217;t come across well to the rest of you either &#8212; it&#8217;s not just the senior people they should be concerned about &#8212; but you&#8217;ll probably maintain better relations with them, and maybe have more of an impact, if you stick to the framing you suggested.)</p>
<p>But it would also be completely appropriate to talk to your/their manager about it, framed as something like, &#8220;I feel awkward about this, but I keep hearing loud and regular complaints from Jill and Jane about their work. Since they&#8217;re still new, I thought it might be something you&#8217;d want to know is happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people will tell you to mind your own business and not mention this to your manager unless it&#8217;s impacting your own work, but honestly, this is the type of thing that a good manager would want to get a discreet heads-up about, as long as it&#8217;s delivered professionally &#8230; especially because it&#8217;s something that she might not be able to observe on her own unless she happens to walk by at exactly the right time. You wouldn&#8217;t keep pushing the issue after that, of course; her take on it might differ from yours, but as long as you&#8217;re okay with that, most good managers will be grateful to be filled in discreetly on something that might be a problem, and then left to decide how and whether to handle it on their own.</p>
<p>By the way, if you feel like it, you could consider trying to get to know these employees separately from each other (ask them to grab coffee with you occasion, or something like that &#8212; but do it separately, not with both of them together) and see if you can&#8217;t model better behavior for them when they&#8217;re away from each other. They&#8217;re probably each reinforcing each other&#8217;s negative viewpoint and behavior, and getting regular exposure to someone who makes a point of reinforcing more positive, professional behavior might be helpful too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I currently work for a very small family business where there is basically one man in charge &#8212; the CEO. He has just decided to start requiring his staff to participate in a &#8220;life coaching&#8221; practice every week that he will be leading. He said he wanted us to share our personal goals for our life so that &#8220;he&#8221; can help us achieve them. He also said that if we wanted to throw in business ideas as well, that would be ok too. We are a service related company, he has no professional training or skill set to be a life coach, and the majority of his staff feels uncomfortable with this request.</em></p>
<p><em>Personally, I am a very private person. I do not feel comfortable sharing my personal life with him or even my coworkers. I feel very frustrated as I was hired to do a job which I do very well. I never was told that life coaching was a requirement for my position when I was hired 2 years ago. My feelings are shared as most of my coworkers also feel very vulnerable and exposed. His desires for my personal growth may be genuine but he is crossing a line for me.</em></p>
<p><em>When I approached him with my concerns about this, he said he apologizes that I feel uncomfortable but this is a requirement and I need to come up with something about my personal life as this shows team spirit and unity. I have always been a very private person and would like to maintain that. Can he require my participation in his &#8220;life coaching&#8221; exercise? Any help you can give will be greatly appreciated!</em></p>
<p>What on earth is wrong with your boss? Why the hell would he decide that it&#8217;s a good idea to even offer this, let alone to require that you participate as a condition of employment? It&#8217;s ridiculous, and it&#8217;s a huge overstepping of boundaries.</p>
<p>As for whether he has the legal right to fire people who don&#8217;t participate &#8212; yes, he does. Just as he could fire people who refuse to participate in a book club or a potluck lunch or Friday night karaoke. It would be ridiculous to do that, but there&#8217;s no law against it.</p>
<p>Of course, just because he&#8217;s telling you that it&#8217;s a requirement doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;d actually fire you if you don&#8217;t participate. I&#8217;d be interested to know, in fact, what he&#8217;d really do when faced with a refusal to share personal information &#8212; although you probably don&#8217;t want to volunteer yourself as an experiment to find out.</p>
<p>I think you have three options for responding to this:</p>
<p>1. Attend these sessions but only volunteer work-related goals. If he presses you for personal ones, say, &#8220;My goals right now are work-related.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. Attend these sessions but only volunteer work-related goals. If he presses you for personal ones, say, &#8220;I&#8217;m not interested in sharing personal information in this context, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s appropriate to be pressured to.&#8221; Consider adding, &#8220;Others I&#8217;ve talked with say they feel the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. Talk to your coworkers about this and protest as a group. If you all say you find this inappropriate and aren&#8217;t interested in participating, it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;s going to fire all of you. (Possible, but unlikely.) You can frame it as, &#8220;We like working here and want to focus on our jobs. We&#8217;re uncomfortable being asked to share personal issues in the office, and we want you to stop asking us to do it. We like having you as our manager, but we do not want you as a life coach. Please respect that and let us focus on doing our jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re willing to do #3, I think it&#8217;s the right option to take. If you&#8217;re not comfortable with it, though, then either #1 or #2 should minimize the impact on you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Former boss is aggressively mining my contacts on LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a former boss who recruited me for a job from my profile on LinkedIn. (I believe he found me through another employee&#8217;s contact list.) Since hiring me, he connected with 40 (!!!) people from my LinkedIn list, most of whom he would never need for his business. He reached out to many of my contacts for interviews with no intention of hiring them. He even offered friends of mine opportunities to report to me on my team &#8212; without asking me &#8212; many of who would not be qualified for the job.</em></p>
<p><em>I stayed with his company for 6 months before leaving (for a great new role). My now ex-manager is connecting with even more of my contacts at a rapid pace and has been checking my page almost daily (I assume to see where I am going). What should I do? Should I unlink with him? I am concerned that if I do so, he can still see my updates from all my contacts and I do not want him reaching out to them for information on me. I also don&#8217;t want him to do anything spiteful. Help!</em></p>
<p>This is weird. Why is he mining your contacts so aggressively? And why is he interviewing people he has no intention of hiring?</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s completely fine to disconnect from him. You can&#8217;t stop him from reaching out to others for information about you, but does it really matter if he does?</p>
<p><strong>2. How to follow up with a contact now that I&#8217;m job-searching</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ll be finishing a master&#8217;s in August and have started job hunting now. I met an academic library dean last November who was interested enough in me to give me his business card and ask if I was able to relocate. I did the requisite email afterwards, and briefly exchanged a few messages, but now I haven&#8217;t spoken with him in a few months. How do I go about contacting him now that I&#8217;m actively looking? Can I just send him a resume? What do I say?</em></p>
<p>Email him, including your resume, and tell him that you&#8217;re now beginning a job search in earnest and that you&#8217;d love any advice he has, and would love to be considered if he has any openings coming up.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I tell my boss I have an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been planning to leave my current position for quite some time. I work in admissions at a small school and, based on my level of responsibility, thought a month&#8217;s notice would be fair, but wanted to give six weeks in the interest of staying on good terms with my supervisor.</em></p>
<p><em>Today I was called out of the blue for a position I applied for quite some time ago. The job is by no means a sure thing, but I had a very positive conversation over the phone and am well qualified. It also means about a 30% raise for me. The catch? The interview is in a week, and the hiring manager told me over the phone that he could give me two weeks to start the job (that&#8217;s what he expects from his employees, after all), bringing the total to 2 weeks, 6 days if I tell my boss tomorrow. Should I tell my boss about the interview so that she is prepared for my eventual leave, even though I may not be hired?</em></p>
<p>No. First of all, it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;d receive an offer the day you interview &#8212; hiring processes generally take some time. But secondly, and more importantly, generally people don&#8217;t give notice until they&#8217;re actually giving notice (i.e., leaving). Otherwise, you risk being pushed out before you&#8217;re ready to leave &#8212; bad under any circumstances, but especially bad when you don&#8217;t even have a job offer. (The only exception to this is if you have an unusually great relationship with your manager and she has a track record of welcoming long notice periods, even those with indefinite exit dates. Without both those things, this is not a risk you should take.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Employer wants to talk to a client as a reference</strong></p>
<p><em>I just got word that I am getting a job offer contingent on references from one former supervisor (totally expected and ok, I have 2 on my list of regular references) and one client. The client is throwing me for a bit of a loop&#8211;I have never heard of this as a requirement.</em></p>
<p><em>I have been working with most of my current clients for a long time and have great relationships with them, but I don&#8217;t want to use one of them as a reference for the same reasons I wouldn&#8217;t want to use my current manager as a reference. I&#8217;m having trouble coming up with a former client who would be able to serve as a competent reference for the work I do now. Any thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Be candid with the prospective employer: &#8220;I&#8217;m not comfortable asking a current client to serve as a reference for the same reason that I wouldn&#8217;t offer my current manager; my employer doesn&#8217;t know that I&#8217;m looking, and I don&#8217;t want to risk a client mentioning it.&#8221; However, do you have former clients who you could use, or a current client who you trust to be discreet?</p>
<p><strong>5. Is it a bad idea to accept an offer without negotiating?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it ever a bad idea to accept the salary offered without negotiating? I am in the running for a position that listed on the job description a salary between $60k-$70k. This is quite a bit above my previous salary, which was closer to $54k, and with better benefits. Also, this position is in a different field than the one I was working in, although some of the general skills are transferable. So if I were offered somewhere in the low $60s, I would be pretty happy. Would it reflect badly upon me if I just took their first offer without negotiating, or should I be negotiating just to show that I can negotiate? How would I justify asking for more when they can find out that I used to make so much less, and I&#8217;m not bringing in any industry-specific knowledge?</em></p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t negotiate just to show that you can negotiate. But it&#8217;s reasonable to try to ask for more, because sometimes simply asking will get you more &#8212; why leave money lying on the table when you could have it by just uttering a couple of sentences?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine if you decide not to; it&#8217;s not going to reflect badly on you to simply accept their first offer. But unless they offer you the highest end of their posted range (or more), there&#8217;s no reason not to try to ask for more. You can always accept the first offer if they don&#8217;t go up. (But on the other hand, if you&#8217;d truly be thrilled with their offer, then do what you will.)</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I quit my job without looking like a job hopper?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m 27 and finished my GRE at 23 while working full-time and writing a book. After grad school, I moved to a different state, where I worked in different jobs within the same company (got promoted) for about 4 years. After 4 years, I decided that I wanted more room for career growth, and moved to a giant &#8212; GIANT &#8212; city. The idea was to find a job in my field with room for growth where I could stay for several years.</em></p>
<p><em>I found a good job that I&#8217;ve been at now for about 4 months, but I hate living in the city where I am now. It&#8217;s miserable, to the point where if I&#8217;m away on the weekends, I literally cry at the thought of going back.</em></p>
<p><em>I work hard and I think I have some impressive accomplishments, but I feel like I can&#8217;t leave my job, because I&#8217;ll look like a job hopper and potential employers will ignore all the good stuff about me because of that. I really do want a job where I can stay a long time, but I&#8217;m miserable where I am. Do I stay here for risk of looking like a job hopper, or leave, and possibly have everyone think I&#8217;m a giant flight risk? And how do I tell my current boss I&#8217;m leaving because I hate the city? Do I acknowledge this issue in a cover letter for potential new jobs?</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to look like a job hopper just because of one short-term stay. Job hopping is about a pattern, and you don&#8217;t have a pattern.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t talk about hating the city in your cover letter. Instead, briefly mention a reason why you&#8217;re moving back to the city you&#8217;ll be applying for jobs in and leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong>7. Taking vacation before maternity leave</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m stumped on the right thing to do here. I just found out that I am pregnant (YAY!), but I am equally in need of taking some vacation time this summer. I won&#8217;t be telling my boss until the beginning of June, and I will be out for 12 weeks starting early December. Would it be a bad decision to take the week vacation this summer, after the cat is out of the bag? Is it better to take the time before I fess up?</em></p>
<p>Take your vacation, and don&#8217;t worry about whether it&#8217;s before or after you&#8217;ve told your boss about your pregnancy. It&#8217;s far enough away from your maternity leave that it shouldn&#8217;t be an issue, and you&#8217;re entitled to to use the vacation time you&#8217;ve accrued.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Remember the reader who <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/how-to-fire-someone-for-mediocre-work-when-theyre-trying-hard.html">needed to fire a low performer who was trying hard</a>? Here&#8217;s her update.</p>
<p><em>I told the employee a few weeks ago that we needed to let her go because the position required skills and experience she doesn&#8217;t possess. I asked her for a few weeks transition period. I offered that if she completed certain deliverables in the transition, she would get a bonus.</em></p>
<p><em>She agreed to a transition but was very cranky. I realize now this was because I made a mistake: initially I did not provide much explanation. I was guarded because I feared if I told her the truth, it would create liability for the company.</em></p>
<p><em>In a later conversation, I was more open and honest. I reminded her of several incidents where she demonstrated a failure to perform her job. I also reminded her of the many times I had warned her (verbally and in her performance reviews).</em></p>
<p><em>Within a couple days, her whole attitude changed. She told me she could see how hard I had worked to support her over the last several months, and expressed gratitude that I tried to help her. She admitted that she struggled in the position and even said she was a little relieved (she was constantly in fear of being fired). She saw how generous the offer was, and thanked me.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been rough, but she completed the assignment, and we&#8217;ve hired a replacement who is starting on Monday.</em></p>
<p>Good for you for tackling this, even though it was tough on both sides, and for helping your employee with the transition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good reminder that being transparent about the reason with an employee who you&#8217;re firing is usually in everyone&#8217;s best interests. When you don&#8217;t share your reasons, that&#8217;s when people tend to assume something unfair is happening &#8212; and it&#8217;s also when people tend to be more likely to sue (because if they don&#8217;t hear a reason that makes sense, they&#8217;ll often go looking for one, and sometimes land upon the idea that it&#8217;s because of their race/religion/disability/age/other protected class).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I applied for a job that I thought I&#8217;d be a good fit for. It turned out that I was applying to a recruiter, and he phoned me the next day and wanted to meet. We had a coffee meeting at one of the outlets the company I was applying to is running. I clicked with him immediately, and he said he wanted to introduce me to the client, which would involve a meeting with a recruiter who was working for the company and charged with recruiting for this position.</em></p>
<p><em>When I met the second guy, he said he would definitely like to introduce me to the owner/director of the business.</em></p>
<p><em>I met with the owner/director, who was really cool. We talked for over an hour, and half an hour after I left, the original recruiter was in touch saying how much she liked me and wanted to meet up again.</em></p>
<p><em>An email heads-up from Recruiter 1 said that she would like to hear me explain what I can offer the company and how my skills can help move it forward. I decided to compile notes on all areas&#8230; sales, communication, people, costs, then round off with talking through the words people have used to describe me in feedback i&#8217;ve had throughout my career. I thought we had covered this already and in detail.</em></p>
<p><em>I got to the interview this morning and there was another man there, who the owner had worked with before with huge success. When I sat down, they said, &#8220;So, talk&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>This threw me completely and I started talking with a voice I&#8217;ve never heard myself using before, just pure nerves. I talked through everything I had prepared and they both said I had covered everything. They did comment on my nerves at the end, and I tried to explain that I am not always like this in business meetings, but this being about all me and at such a late stage&#8230; yeah, I was nervous.</em></p>
<p><em>The reason my head is on fire just now is that at the end they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll get back to you on Monday, we think&#8230; we might need candidates at this stage to complete a personality test. We&#8217;ve hired badly in the past and we don&#8217;t want to make mistakes again.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Christ, this is the fourth interview I&#8217;ve had regarding this&#8230; I&#8217;ve been very open and honest and I think I&#8217;ve given a full picture of who I am and what I can do.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>They kept talking about avoiding a bad fit, but as far as I was concerned I had decided I really wanted to work for them after interview #3 and told them that. So I guess my quandary is&#8230; getting a second interview is a signal that they&#8217;re really interested, getting a third one should be even more positive, right? But a fourth or a fifth? I just do not know what to make of this; my head is buzzing.</em></p>
<p>Getting the right fit <em>is</em> important &#8212; and while you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;d like to work for them, that doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re sure that the fit is right on <em>their</em> side.</p>
<p>And sometimes it does take multiple interviews to be sure that the fit is right. And after all, it&#8217;s better for both of you to invest time at this stage than for you to end up struggling in the job and quitting or getting fired later.</p>
<p>But when an employer is doing this many interviews and asking for a lot of a candidate&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s really important for them to ensure that they&#8217;re organized and strategic about it &#8212; so that they&#8217;re not using someone&#8217;s time irresponsibly. And that&#8217;s what worries me about this company. They had you do two separate interviews with recruiters before you actually talked with a hiring manager, and when you finally did talk with a hiring manager, they apparently didn&#8217;t bother to ask you how your skills could help them (since they needed to ask for a later meeting for that), and then they had you return for a fourth meeting without explaining why that was necessary.</p>
<p>Moreover, in that fourth meeting, it sounds like they weren&#8217;t especially warm or collegial (&#8220;So, talk&#8230;&#8221;), which is concerning at any stage, but especially in this context.</p>
<p>What we can conclude is that, at a minimum, this is a company that doesn&#8217;t quite know how to hire well and isn&#8217;t especially concerned about being considerate of you.</p>
<p>So, what can you do? You can certainly say, &#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in working with you, but before we go any further, can you tell me what the rest of the process is likely to look like and your timeline for filling the job?&#8221; That might get you some useful information, or it might not. It also might nudge them into thinking about how this is all coming across to you, or it might not. But it&#8217;s worth asking.</p>
<p>You should also do some serious probing into their culture, and how they make decisions, and how they operate in general &#8212; because those are things that will have a major impact on your quality of life while working there, as well as your ability to succeed in your work for them &#8230; and right now there are some red flags going up around that stuff, so you should really do some due diligence there.</p>
<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s not the number of interviews that concerns me on its own &#8212; sometimes that really <em>is</em> warranted, for some jobs (although I don&#8217;t know if this is one of them or not). What concerns me is their haphazard approach to it, and you want to see if that approach is typical for them in other areas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I hate taking phone calls. I find them intrusive &#8212; they require 100% of your attention (it&#8217;s almost impossible to multitask while on the phone), immediate responses to questions, and I for one find it awkward and difficult to talk in real-time to someone whom I can&#8217;t see face-to-face. Phone conversations also aren&#8217;t very private &#8212; unless you have a closed office, everyone around you can hear your end of it.</em></p>
<p><em>I vastly prefer email, instant messaging, or texting for any long-distance communication &#8212; with those media, I can take time to re-read and think before replying, I can multitask around them much more effectively, and there&#8217;s much less chance that someone walking by will accidentally catch a snatch of a private conversation. I sometimes think I should just stop picking up incoming phone calls &#8212; I could record a voicemail greeting something like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t answer phone calls, but leave me a voicemail and I&#8217;ll get back to you, or even better, send me an email &#8211; in general, that&#8217;s the best way to reach me.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a reasonable position to take, or do I need to just get over it and accept that phone calls are part of the way business gets done? Am I alone in feeling this way, or do others hate phone calls as much as I do? Are there &#8220;phone people&#8221; and &#8220;email people,&#8221; like cat and dog people?</em></p>
<p><em>(This has been on my mind lately because I&#8217;m in the final stages of the hiring process with a new company, and have been dealing with some HR folks there who insist on calling me about every little thing, rather than emailing. It&#8217;s getting on my nerves, especially since I cannot take these calls at work due to the risk of a coworker overhearing. I&#8217;ve taken to leaving the office and walking down the street to a park to take/make these calls, which is of course inconvenient. If they emailed, I could respond from the office with no concerns about privacy.)</em></p>
<p>I hate the phone too &#8212; hate it, hate it, <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/i-hate-talking-on-phone.html">hate it</a>. Unless something is urgent and needs to be attended to immediately, or is so complicated that an email would be inefficient, I don&#8217;t see why people default to the phone. If you email me instead of calling me, I can concentrate on other things without interruption and answer you when I’m at a good stopping point. And lots of conversations take far longer on the phone than they would in email.</p>
<p>However, that said &#8230; yes, you do need to accept that phone calls are part of the way business gets done.</p>
<p>And there are indeed phone people and email people. Some people are like us and despise the phone, and others can&#8217;t imagine why we&#8217;d write an email instead of jumping on a five-minute call and dealing with whatever&#8217;s at hand right there and then. They are wrong, of course, and we are right &#8230; but they are plentiful, and it&#8217;s not reasonable to think you can avoid them in your professional life.</p>
<p>That means that you really should not leave an outgoing message on your voicemail telling people that you don&#8217;t answer phone calls. It will come across as odd, kind of rude, and a bit prima donna-ish. You can, however, have a voicemail message that <em>suggests</em> that people can get a faster response by emailing you. For instance: &#8220;You&#8217;ve reached Fitzwilliam Darcy. While you can leave a message here, I&#8217;m often able to respond more quickly by email, so feel free to email me at ___ instead. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll return your call as soon as I&#8217;m able.&#8221; (Keep in mind, though, that this might not be cool to do in some offices, so make sure you know your culture first.)</p>
<p>As for those HR people who keep calling you &#8230; You can certainly say, &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to for me to talk from work during the day, so it&#8217;s often easier to reach me over email.&#8221; However, ultimately this may be about who wants who more. If they want you more than you want them, feel free to take a strong stand on your communication preferences. If that&#8217;s not the case, though, then I wouldn&#8217;t take a hard-line here; they&#8217;re communicating with you in the way that works best for them &#8230; just like you prefer to do yourself.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. How can I reach out to a great candidate who I had to reject?</strong></p>
<p><em>I conducted an interview screen recently that resulted in a no-hire decision for the candidate. It was, however, an extremely difficult decision, and the candidate, while not the right fit for what our team is looking for, would be a clear good fit for several other jobs in our office. In addition, the candidate and I share similar (very unusual and on-the-surface not very &#8220;marketable&#8221;) educational and work experiences&#8211;I really feel for how hard it is to find a position coming from that background!</em></p>
<p><em>I did pass the resume on to the hiring manager for the other positions in our office, with a good word about &#8220;not right for our job, but perhaps for yours.&#8221; The candidate sent me a &#8220;I understand I&#8217;m out of the running, thanks for your consideration&#8221; follow-up email today, and I would really like to reply with some sort of&#8230; encouragement? Links to other job posts? That if they&#8217;re looking for advice on what to do with our sort of weird background, I&#8217;d be happy to chat? I&#8217;m not sure what (if any) the appropriate thing to do here is!</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d really be happy to chat, that would be a really kind thing to offer. Most candidates would love to get feedback and personalized help from an employer, so if you&#8217;re willing to take the time to do that, definitely offer it!</p>
<p><strong>2. Will declaring bankruptcy affect my job search?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about jobs and bankruptcy. I am considering filing for bankruptcy to get some help with my student loans. Unfortunately, I bought into the hype during high school that I would be able to make a lot of money after attending college. Other than my student loans, I only have one medical bill that is past due, but that is because my student loan bills are so high. I took out student loans to go to a great school and to obtain an in-demand major, but things did not work out in my favor. Since employers now are requiring background checks, do you think that it will hurt my job prospects in the future? I have never mismanaged any money from the jobs where I was required to handle money. Will employers ask me why I had to file for bankruptcy and consider my circumstances?</em></p>
<p>Well, first, this might not even be an option, because most student loans aren&#8217;t dischargeable in bankruptcy. So you&#8217;d want to look into that first. But if for some reason yours are, then whether it will impact your job prospects will depend on what type of field you&#8217;re in and what types of companies you&#8217;re applying with. Loads of companies, particularly smaller ones, don&#8217;t check credit records at all. And many others only do for jobs that involve handling money or having authority over money. Some employers are now starting to use them more frequently — but certainly not all or even most.</p>
<p><strong>3. My manager will fire me if I don&#8217;t get a car</strong></p>
<p><em>I have recently been told by my boss that if I do not purchase my own vehicle for the purposes of the business, that he will be looking to replace me. When I applied for the position, I was asked if I have access to my own vehicle, I said that I do not but am able to use my parents&#8217; car. In email correspondence and in my contract, it was mentioned that he would reimburse me should I use my own vehicle for business. There was no mention of it being a necessity. I have since been unable to use my parents&#8217; car as it is their only asset and they are trying their best not to run too many miles on it.</em></p>
<p><em>I have told him that purchasing a car for his business is an expense that I cannot possibly afford right now. I had also moved closer to work in order to walk. He says that if I do not have a car by the end of next week, he will fins someone else to replae me. I am currently on &#8220;short time&#8221; which I believe he is counting as the first of my 2 week&#8217;s notice. Can he do this?</em></p>
<p>Yes. As a condition of the job, he can require you to have a car, or a suit, or a passport, or a charming smile, or anything else that doesn&#8217;t discriminate based on race, sex, religion, national origin, or other protected classes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Next-day interview, and employer wants to fill the job in less than a week</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying for entry-level nonprofit communications roles, with plenty of communications internship experience and a year as an administrative assistant under my belt. Today I got a phone call from an organization I applied to work for, and they wanted to schedule me for an interview. Great! But when I told them my availability for the end of this week and beginning of next week, the response was, &#8220;What about tomorrow?&#8221; This in the mid-afternoon. I ended up taking an interview slot for tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m.! It seems more than a little crazy to me that they want to interview me with less than 24 hours notice.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, it got weirder. The person I was on the phone with said that they want someone to start by Monday. Like, the coming Monday. I don&#8217;t know how they can possibly do due diligence in their hiring process in that short a time period. Even if they were to offer me this job, I can&#8217;t start on Monday &#8212; I&#8217;m in the middle of the interview process for two other organizations, and I would need at least a couple days to think things through and see if I get one of the other offers. I really want to ask these people &#8220;What&#8217;s the rush?&#8221; when they ask me if I have any questions for them, but I have a feeling that&#8217;s too terse. Any suggestions for how to ask about the crazy time table at my interview?</em></p>
<p>Hey, sometimes positions need to be filled on short timelines. If that&#8217;s the case here, and it&#8217;s a job that has a ton of well-qualified applicants, they probably don&#8217;t see any reason not to fill it that quickly. And since it&#8217;s entry-level, they might not be planning on extensive reference checks. It&#8217;s not the way people would ideally hire, but it&#8217;s not unheard of either. If it makes you uncomfortable, though, you&#8217;re certainly not under any obligation to accept an offer with them, or even interview.</p>
<p>As for how to ask about it though, you can say, &#8220;It sounds like you&#8217;re on a very tight timeline for filling the position. What&#8217;s driving that?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Handling an interviewer who talks a lot</strong></p>
<p><em>How do you handle an interview where the interviewer talks a lot and you feel as if you can&#8217;t get a word in unless she actually stops to ask something? I went on my first full-time interview yesterday and my interviewer talked a lot. I&#8217;m a shy person so it was hard enough for me to even be in the interview, let alone try to get a word about why I want the job. In the end, I felt like I didn&#8217;t even get a chance to talk about myself and all we did was talk about the company and the position.</em></p>
<p>If it happens again, try steering the conversation back to the job opening and your qualifications. Say something like, “Would it be okay to take a minute and lead you through my professional background? I think it’ll tie in with what you were just saying about the job.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that someone who hires this way likely is making hiring mistakes along the way, so you&#8217;ll have some not-so-great coworkers unless the person is quick to fix their hiring mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I ask for a raise even though I just got a small one?</strong></p>
<p><em>I work as an office administrator at a tech company. My day-to-day consists of all of the basics &#8212; I answer phones, order snacks and supplies, greet guests, and basically run the office (we have about 350 onsite on any given day). In addition to this workload, I feel that I do many things that go above and beyond the typical office admin role. My managers, as well as other employees, frequently praise my work ethic and ability to get things done (I am the go-to person when someone needs something to happen).</em></p>
<p><em>That said, I have been at the job for less than a year. My time with the organization (about 9 months) happened to coincide with yearly reviews, and so I was given one despite being around less than a calendar level. I received excellent scores in all criteria and received a scheduled raise. However, because of the way that increased are calculated, I received half of what I would have, had I been working at the company for one month longer. This comes out to a 1.3% increase. This review happened in February, and it&#8217;s been weighing on my mind ever since &#8212; with inflation and increased payroll taxes, I essentially received a pay cut even after being given very high praise.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you think it is too late to bring up the issue of compensation with our HR department? I love my job and wouldn&#8217;t want to do anything to jeopardize my status at the company, but I felt a little slighted by the increase. If you do think I would benefit from a conversation with my superiors, do you think I should include my thoughts on the relative scale of the actual increase (i.e. that it&#8217;s essentially a pay cut) or should I dwell solely on positives &#8212; things like a repair I did on an item that saved the company $700.</em></p>
<p>Wait until you&#8217;ve been there a full year, since generally it&#8217;s not reasonable to expect any raise before that anyway. At that point, go to your manager (not HR; this is an issue for your manager) and advocate for a higher raise. You can point out that because of the raise cycle, you weren&#8217;t eligible for a full raise when salaries were last assessed, but don&#8217;t dwell on that &#8212; the main thrust of your argument should be <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/04/11/10-tips-for-negotiating-a-raise  ">why your performance warrants more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Can I cite my expected raise when employers ask how much I make?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m in a bit of a conundrum. I am expecting a promotion and salary increase, but I do not know the new salary or title (not a work scope change). I do know it is imminent. As I am interviewing for a few positions elsewhere, I wanted to ask what you would recommend if I am asked about salary history and recommendations in the meantime. Do I base estimates on what I&#8217;d expect or what I&#8217;m currently receiving?</em></p>
<p>You can say that you&#8217;re expecting a raise of around $X, but really, you want to focus on what your contributions to the new company are worth, not on your salary history. Allowing employers to peg your salary to what you&#8217;ve earned in the past is a good way to avoid getting a large jump when you change jobs, so you want to avoid that as much as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I need to have a conversation with my manager about why I continue to get excluded from strategic conversations when my teammates are included.</em></p>
<p><em>My colleague, who is just a bit senior than me, has mentioned on more than one occasion conversations she has had with our manager about overall strategic goals for the team or for the organization. Every time, I am left wondering: Wait&#8230; when did this conversation happen? Why wasn&#8217;t I invited?</em></p>
<p><em>I am starting to worry that there is something larger at play here. Last year, I was brand-new to the team, so in some sense I did not expect to get staffed on projects/conversations about the long-term vision for our work. This year, however, I have been here just as long as one person who participated in these conversations last year. (I hope that makes sense. That person has moved on from the role.)</em></p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s a concrete example: I developed a tool this year for one client that has since been adapted for several other clients. Word got out in the community we served, and now other non-clients want us to come and give a talk about this tool. My colleague was asked to go give this talk, and I only heard about it from her in passing. Given that I created it, I imagine I should have the opportunity to be at this talk, and even help lead it.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, a lot has run through my head about this. Does my boss not like me or think I do good work? I think she likes me quite a bit. I&#8217;ve independently led several projects that have generated so much positive publicity for the organization and for her, as my supervisor. When I needed a recommendation letter, she told me she would be thrilled to and only has glowing things to say about my work. Likewise, when I had my mid-year performance review, it was truly the best I&#8217;d had. (That has not always been the case. The one a year prior was lukewarm, as a result of a messy project I hadn&#8217;t managed well.)</em></p>
<p><em>I *do* find that she sometimes leads me down dead-ends &#8212; especially on a major project that she had me lead over a year ago that, to this day, has not materialized into anything substantial. I created the product, yes, but testing and implementing it has been incredibly stressful. She has refused to make a decision about it (she is incredibly indecisive and risk-averse), and I have given up trying to get buy-in for something I was *asked* to do in the first place.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond how I feel about her management style, I would like to approach her about my feeling that I am not getting invited to important conversations. I want to know why that is, so that if it is an impression *I* am giving, that I can stop it immediately. Your thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Talk to her! Say something like this: &#8220;Jane often mentions to me that she&#8217;s been talking with you about our team&#8217;s strategic goals or the organization&#8217;s long-term vision, and I&#8217;d love to be included in conversations like that. I know those conversations often happen spontaneously, but when there are advance opportunities to be included and you think it makes sense, I&#8217;d really like to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And if it fits in with the conversation, you can also ask, &#8220;Are there things I could do differently in my own performance that would lead me to being more involved in those types of discussions?&#8221;</p>
<p>Which that leads me to this: This might be less about something you&#8217;re doing wrong and more about something that your <em>coworker</em> is doing right. If she&#8217;s initiating strategic conversations with your manager and volunteering for projects, she might be simply making herself visible in a way that you&#8217;re not. In other words, it might not be that your manager is deliberately leaving you out, but rather than your coworker is putting herself in. And if so, you might look for ways that you can do that as well.</p>
<p>In fact, if you have a good relationship with your coworker, you could ask her about this too &#8212; not in a resentful way, of course, but something like, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you and Emma often talk about things like this. I&#8217;d love to have those types of conversations with her too but for some reason I don&#8217;t seem to. Do you have any insight into how you&#8217;ve been able to make that happen, so that I can figure out what I can do on my end too?&#8221;</p>
<p>You might hear something in response that&#8217;s as simple as, &#8220;Oh, I just ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s also worth noting that that lukewarm performance evaluation from two years ago might still be lingering in your manager&#8217;s head &#8212; or more accurately, the performance that caused it. Performance problems can have a long shelf-life in managers&#8217; memories, and even though you feel it&#8217;s behind you, it&#8217;s possible that she still looks at you as less skilled or reliable or less of a strategic thinker than your coworker. There might be something to that, or it might be wrong, but if none of the above works, you might consider that the echo of whatever happened that year could still be coloring the way she sees you. If that&#8217;s the case, and if tackling it head-on doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s useful information to factor in as you ponder the next steps in your career.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been told by some professionals in my field that in order for me to get hired in this tight job market I would have to take a position that I don’t want. My field is environmental science, and they have suggested that I try similar fields such as environmental health, public health, and other similar fields.</em></p>
<p><em>Although I am qualified for these positions, I don’t have that great of an interest to actually work in these fields. I was advised to apply for positions and then work my way into what I really want to do once I get my foot in the door.</em></p>
<p><em>I don’t know if this is the best advice because I don’t want to be stuck doing something I don’t like for a year or two, but I do desperately need to get a job in my field even if it is not what I want to study. Am I just being a prima donna? Should I suck it up and branch out more, or is this a terrible idea? What do you think?</em></p>
<p>I get versions of this question a lot, and the answer always comes down to two factors:</p>
<p><strong>1. Realistically, what are your job prospects?</strong> What signals are you getting about your prospects for getting the jobs you want? Are you getting lots of interviews and second interviews and hearing that the decision was close but they ultimately went with someone else? If so, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to think that you&#8217;re a strong candidate with a good chance of getting an offer reasonably soon. But if you&#8217;re not &#8212; if you&#8217;re not getting very far in employers&#8217; hiring processes, or even getting many interviews at all, then those are signals that you &#8212; for whatever reason &#8212; aren&#8217;t viewed as an especially strong candidate for those jobs. If that&#8217;s the case, it makes sense to be realistic and look at what other options you have.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&#8217;s your financial situation?</strong> How quickly do you need to take a job? Are you in a financial position that allows you to wait many months more? Or is your situation becoming increasingly dire? If the former, you obviously have more flexibility (although you should also factor in that the longer you&#8217;re unemployed, the weaker your candidacy might become). If the latter, then your finances might dictate that you be willing to work outside your field, whether that appeals to you or not (since paying your bills trumps job satisfaction).</p>
<p>And assuming you&#8217;re not in a position to wait <em>indefinitely</em>, when will things become more urgent? It&#8217;s helpful to figure out things like, &#8220;I can wait and see what happens for the next four months, but if I&#8217;m not getting multiple serious bites by July, I&#8217;m going to be more flexible about what positions I&#8217;ll apply for because I don&#8217;t want to eat into my savings much beyond November.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, you can&#8217;t make these decisions based strictly on what type of work does and doesn&#8217;t interest you, and how far outside your field you are and aren&#8217;t willing to go. You need to make them based on a realistic &#8212; brutally realistic, I&#8217;d say &#8212; assessment of what your prospects are in the current market, how many options you have, and how long those options will support you.</p>

Many of the people whose help you’d most like are busy and often get more email than they can respond to. And since emails from strangers often go to the bottom of the list, it’s important to craft an email that that they won’t be inclined to ignore.</p>
<p>Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about how to write a networking email that gets a response – including being specific about what you want, being concise, and being at least somewhat flattering. You can <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/04/10/how-to-send-a-networking-email-that-wont-be-ignored">read it here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should I stop by in person to see why an employer called me?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied for a summer job in February, interviewed at the beginning of March, and have been anxiously waiting for early April when they said they would be done with interviews. I finally got a call from my interviewer, but due to some phone malfunctions on my end did not get her message until two days later. All the message said was to give her a call back, which I did immediately. I got her voicemail so I apologized for not getting back to her right away, briefly explained the issue with my phone, and left her my number again. That was Friday. On Monday, I tried her again and got her voicemail again. She hasn&#8217;t called me back.</em></p>
<p><em>I volunteer in the building where she works tomorrow, and my parents suggested if she hasn&#8217;t called me back yet that I should stop by her office. Is that appropriate? Also I&#8217;m assuming she was calling to offer me the job, otherwise she could have just emailed. But is there a chance I could be putting her on the spot to give some news in person she would rather give over the phone?</em></p>
<p>No, don&#8217;t do that. You&#8217;ve called her and left her messages, and she knows how to get in touch if she wants to. Stopping by in person without an appointment will put her on the spot and come across as overly pushy and inappropriate. At this point, I&#8217;d simply move on and trust that she&#8217;ll get in touch with you if she wants to. You could send one final email (as opposed to a call), but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Finding out the hiring manager&#8217;s name</strong></p>
<p><em>What&#8217;s the best way to find out exactly who is hiring for a position? I&#8217;ve been told to never address a cover letter to &#8220;whom it may concern&#8221; or &#8220;HR dept,&#8221; and I agree, but sometimes it can be quite difficult to find out who a hiring manager is. You can simply call and ask for smaller companies, but large companies that use automated voice response can make it impossible to even talk to anybody at all!</em></p>
<p><em>I recently reached out to a company&#8217;s recruiter through LinkedIn, and I never got a response from them either. What is the best way to reach out to a recruiter to get my question answered? Or is a recruiter the best person to go through? And if, in the end, I&#8217;ve exhausted all of these attempts, should I still send the cover letter without a name on it?</em></p>
<p>Stop thinking about this at all. Seriously, no sane hiring manager cares whether you address the letter to her or to &#8220;dear hiring manager.&#8221; They care about your candidacy. Write &#8220;dear hiring manager&#8221; and be done with it.</p>
<p>This is not worth any expenditure of stress or energy, particularly when there are so many more important things to spend your time on, like writing a great cover letter. And if your cover letter and resume don&#8217;t need more attention, then read a book or watch a movie &#8212; there&#8217;s no reason to spend time on something like this. <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2011/06/is-it-worth-calling-to-find-out-the-hiring-managers-name.html">More here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fitting my resume on one page</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve followed the philosophy that resumes should be one page only. I am starting my third job in my career, and due to the amount of responsibilities, can only fit my last two jobs on one page. If I leave out my first entry-level job, will it look like I have a 2-year gap between my college graduation and my actual second job?</em></p>
<p>You can go to two pages if you&#8217;re more than a few years out of school. If you&#8217;re not, then you&#8217;re including too much detail and you need to edit. Resumes should include the most impressive highlights of what you&#8217;ve achieved; they don&#8217;t need to list every responsibility you had at each job.</p>
<p><strong>4. My resume shows I left soon after a promotion</strong></p>
<p><em>I was &#8220;promoted&#8221; to a different position within my last company in my last 6 months on the job. I would like to show both positions on my resume so companies can I see I have experience in both areas, but would it look bad to have a position last only 6 months before moving on to another company? I had already known I wanted to leave when I was promoted, but I accepted the position so that I could show better/more experience on my resume. I&#8217;m worried that companies may think I was let go or something equally negative.</em></p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s not the same as leaving a brand-new job (at a new company) after only six months; it&#8217;s different when it&#8217;s internal and you have a longer history with the company.</p>
<p><strong>5. Negotiating salary when my company might have pulled someone&#8217;s offer over it</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning to apply for an internal position, and I believe I&#8217;m likely to get it&#8211;I&#8217;ve been told so by the hiring manager, plus I helped <em>develop the job description. I hope to negotiate the salary offer for the first time in my life. As I&#8217;m sure you can imagine, since previously I&#8217;ve always just taken what I was offered, my current pay is on the low end. I&#8217;m excited for the chance to boost it up to a professional level.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that I&#8217;ve heard nasty rumors about how management handled salary negotiations with a recent potential hire. What I know for sure is that the hiring process got to the point of making one candidate an offer, and then the job was suddenly reposted. What I heard from the hiring manager was that the candidate was &#8220;crazy&#8221; during the negotiation and that the offer was rescinded. What I heard through the rumor mill was that the candidate tried to negotiate salary and management was so taken aback and insulted that they rescinded the offer, even after the candidate tried to back down.</em></p>
<p><em>This is obviously concerning to me. If it matters, my organization is a nonprofit, and there&#8217;s definitely a culture of considering it an honor to work here and help advance the mission, so&#8230; maybe that&#8217;s part of what happened? Of course I don&#8217;t know what really happened, but the management of my organization has been just screwy enough in the past that it seems possible that the rumor mill is correct. If it is true, how can I handle a salary negotiation without running into a minefield? I don&#8217;t want to push too hard on the off chance that management will react really poorly, but I also don&#8217;t want to just take what I&#8217;m offered and sabotage my own payscale yet again.</em></p>
<p>Ask your coworkers what their experience has been in trying to negotiate raises. It&#8217;s possible that the story you heard wasn&#8217;t accurate, or that at least key details weren&#8217;t accurate. And even if it was, it&#8217;s possible that your company handles internal raise requests differently from salary negotiations with job candidates.</p>
<p>It would obviously be ridiculous for them to function this way, but ask the people who are going to be most likely to know: your coworkers who have been there for a while.</p>
<p><strong>6. Coworker loudly slurps liquids</strong></p>
<p><em>We have a well educated, middle-aged man in our office who slurps any liquid and loudly! Whether in his cube (his is next to mine), in office meetings or in the lunch room, he slurps! It is not a cultural thing, as I think his family came over on the Mayflower. We’ve tried to say things like, “Gee, that coffee must be really hot” to draw attention to the fact that his slurping is distracting (disgusting, really). He always responds in a hurt voice, like “I wasn’t aware that I was doing that” or “in my house, slurping and burping are signs of good food.&#8221; Sorry, it’s really an excuse.</em></p>
<p><em>What can I/we do to tell him it’s offensive? Should we take him aside and do it one by one or as a group or &#8230;.? What should we say?</em></p>
<p>Stop hinting and be direct &#8212; as is always the answer when you want someone to stop doing something but haven&#8217;t yet told them that! The next time it happens, say, &#8220;Bob, could you please not slurp your drink? I can hear it over here and it&#8217;s very distracting.&#8221; If it continues, say, &#8220;Bob, I understand that you have different conventions around this, but it bothers me when I&#8217;m working and I&#8217;d appreciate you reining it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it continues after that, well, you work with an annoying slurper and will have to live with it. You can&#8217;t fix every annoying behavior in the workplace &#8212; but you can certainly start by directly asking for what you want.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do I need in-state residency to apply for jobs?</strong></p>
<p><em>My husband and I are thinking about moving from Michigan to Florida for a couple of years in order for him to attend seminary. We&#8217;d both need jobs &#8212; part-time for him, full-time for me. My snowbird grandma is adamantly insistent that my husband and I would both need Florida residency &#8212; drivers&#8217; licenses, plates for the car, etc. &#8212; before we could even interview for jobs. Is this true?</em></p>
<p><em>For reasons of convenience and expense, we&#8217;d like to maintain our Michigan residency while in Florida, which I&#8217;ve always assumed is standard for out-of-state students (and their spouses). Would doing so really impact our ability to find jobs, or (as my grandma insists) our legal employment status? My grandma&#8217;s known for her sometimes bizarre opinions, but she was so absolutely dogmatic about this it&#8217;s got me wondering.</em></p>
<p>Your grandmother is wrong. There are certainly some jobs that require in-state residency or an in-state driver&#8217;s license (some government jobs, for example), but they&#8217;re not the majority, and they&#8217;ll make it clear if they require that. In general, you can assume you don&#8217;t need it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Our company takes an annual trip, usually to the Caribbean. Our airfare and hotel are paid for by the company, but our food and other activities are not. As a matter of fact, we are expected to buy our bosses dinner one of the nights. When you are hired, you are told to sign a form that states if you commit to the trip and then quit the job or cannot make the trip, you are to reimburse the company for their costs.</em></p>
<p><em>This year, several of us have opted out of the trip for financial reasons (I spent over $350 on food last year) so we did not commit to this year&#8217;s trip. Now they are saying that it is a mandatory trip. Can they do that, force us to do someone we cannot afford to do?</em></p>
<p>I wrote back and asked what the purpose of the trip is. The response:</p>
<p><em>They want to create a feeling of team spirit.</em></p>
<p>Hahahahahahahaha!</p>
<p>There is nothing like creating a feeling of team spirit by forcing your employees to go on a trip that costs them hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>Please pause and enjoy a hearty laugh at this, as I have.</p>
<p>Okay, now &#8230; Yes, your company can indeed make this trip mandatory. Whether or not they <em>should</em> is a different issue (hint: they should not), but as for whether they can legally require it as part of your job? Yep, they sure can.</p>
<p>But of course it&#8217;s a terrible idea for them to do so. First, in general, companies should cover work-related travel expenses, because it&#8217;s not fair to ask employees to bear what should be business costs. And second, the alleged purpose of this trip &#8212; to build team spirit &#8212; provides extra cause for them to cover the expenses, because even people who are inclined to be filled with team spirit tend to get a bit deflated when told that they&#8217;re going to be out $350 for the privilege, and that they&#8217;ll be fired if they don&#8217;t agree.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s certainly your employer&#8217;s prerogative to decide that this trip is a key part of their culture-building (and they&#8217;re at least doing the right thing by being up-front about that with people when they start working there; it would be worse if they were springing it on you afterwards). They&#8217;re allowed to decide that the culture they want includes an annual trip, even an expensive one &#8212; just as they&#8217;re allowed to decide that their culture means that everyone dresses up like clowns on Fridays or that you can&#8217;t wear red or that you all have to speak in tongues after lunch. If they think that stuff contributes to the culture they want, it&#8217;s their call &#8212; and as long as they&#8217;re really clear with prospective employees before anyone accepts a job there, so be it. I don&#8217;t want to work there, but some people will. (Just like I don&#8217;t want to work in Southwest Airlines&#8217; really effusive, bubbly culture either, but they&#8217;re entitled to decide they want that culture, and it works for them to screen me out and hire people who are aligned with their vision of a workplace.)</p>
<p>And in this case, your company has decided that they want people who will be excited to go on this trip every year, and will see enough value in it (and probably see it as sufficiently like a vacation) that they won&#8217;t mind covering their own food expenses. And that really is their prerogative.</p>
<p>As for what you can do though &#8230; I&#8217;d go to your manager and first get clarity on exactly what the situation is. Start by saying something like, &#8220;It was my understanding when I was hired that it was fine to decline the trip as long as the company knew far enough in advance that our tickets hadn&#8217;t been purchased. Is it now mandatory regardless?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re told yes, it&#8217;s now mandatory, then you can say something like this: &#8220;I understand the company intends this as a team-building trip, and I&#8217;d be glad to go. But last year my food costs were around $350, and that&#8217;s not an expense I can fit into my budget. I&#8217;d like to be able to go on the trip, but I can&#8217;t afford those costs. Is that something the company can include, or would it make more sense for me to stay here?&#8221;</p>
<p>If your manager says that neither of those options are possible &#8230;. well, then these are apparently the new terms of your employment, and you&#8217;ll have to decide if you want the job under these conditions. I think it&#8217;s BS to do that to you, but at that point, that&#8217;ll be the choice you&#8217;re looking at.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I am a job applicant and recent MBA grad. I have gotten a lot of resume feedback from various sources, one of whom advised me to make my resume a narrative. My contact is an angel investor for high-tech start-ups and would presumably know what he&#8217;s talking about. Basically his point was that that format would help convey passion and excitement between the lines &#8212; if not explicitly written out.</em></p>
<p><em>He suggested the narrative resume to tell my story in full sentences, including everything from the degrees I have to the experiences I have had. I wrote one on his suggestion, and here&#8217;s an excerpt:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Parallel to the MBA program, I engaged with a number of exciting companies. As a start-up consultant analyst for Swift Expo (July 2012 – December 2012) I performed a market assessment through pricing analysis, conjoint hedonic analysis, and value-based pricing concepts such as lower-valued use of assets, marginal analysis, price ceilings, floors and controls.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I am very hesitant to use this version in job applications since it feels like what I wrote was simply a very long cover letter (he suggests also sending a separate cover letter). I&#8217;d very much appreciate to know what your take is.</em></p>
<p>What?! No. That is not the way you should word things on a resume.</p>
<p>A resume needs to be able to be quickly scanned, and it needs the information most employers are looking for to be easily accessible in that quick scan &#8212; which is initially only about 20 seconds, if not less. It shouldn&#8217;t be in narrative, it shouldn&#8217;t be in the first person, and it shouldn&#8217;t be in full sentences. It should be bullet points.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that: Bullet points. I beg you. Otherwise, employers&#8217; eyes are going to <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/03/large-paragraphs-of-text-are-a-resume-killer.html">glaze over</a> reading those blocks of text, and you are going to be overlooked in favor of candidates who wrote easier-to-skim, punchier resumes that provide information quickly and in the format most hiring managers want it in.</p>
<p>Your resume also shouldn&#8217;t characterize your employers as &#8220;exciting&#8221; or anything else subjective. Subjective stuff is for your cover letter. Your resume is for what you achieved, not how you felt about it.</p>
<p>The guy who gave you this advice might be a fantastic angel investor, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that he knows what most hiring managers are looking for on resumes. You can always find people with random/minority opinions about what makes a good resume &#8212; including people in positions of power and authority &#8212; but they don&#8217;t always speak for what&#8217;s effective with the majority.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s told you how to write an effective resume for a job with him, perhaps. But it&#8217;s not the most effective way to do it more broadly.</p>

<p><em>What do you do if a job candidate&#8217;s sister writes you an email saying, &#8220;Please keep this as a secret&#8221; and says that she will help her very talented brother with the job and that this job would be perfect for him &#8212; on and on for a whole page.</em></p>
<p><em>Do I answer her? Do I tell the candidate? Do I ignore her?</em></p>
<p><em>How would you handle this? He is in the top three, but this makes me wonder.</em></p>
<p>Ignore it, on the assumption that even the best candidates can have crazy siblings. I&#8217;d  pay some extra attention to ensuring that <em>he</em> seems to understand normal business conventions, but aside from that, make your decision independent of this. And if you end up hiring him, tip him off that his sister is sending emails that aren&#8217;t doing him any favor with employers.</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s one part of this that I&#8217;d want more information about: Do you mean that the sister wrote that she would help him with the job, or just that she wants to help him <em>get</em> the job? Because if she&#8217;s saying she&#8217;ll help him with the job itself, that&#8217;s additionally weird and something that you probably do need to address with him before offering him a job. I&#8217;d say something like, &#8220;I received an email from your sister that I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how to interpret. She said that she&#8217;d help you with the job if you were to be in the role. I didn&#8217;t respond to her, but I&#8217;m wondering if you can shed any light.&#8221;</p>
<p>And meanwhile, siblings, spouses, parents, children, significant others, and friends of job candidates: This is a very, very bad thing to do. Do not do this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Applying for a job at a company whose customer service I&#8217;ve complained about in the past</strong></p>
<p><em>A job I&#8217;m interested in just opened up at a large telecom company based where I live that shall remain nameless. We&#8217;ll call them BT&amp;T. I&#8217;m well qualified, the salary is quite a bit higher than my current salary, and I have an in at the company &#8212; one of my good friends is a manager. Seems perfect, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Well&#8230;the only hold-up is that in the past I have had HORRIBLE relations with customer service at this company. I&#8217;d like to blame it all on BT&amp;T &#8211; and to the best of my knowledge all of my past troubles have originated with them &#8212; but I can admit I&#8217;ve lost my cool with the service reps multiple times somewhere during the 85th minute of being on hold or being transferred around. So, is it possible that these conversations would affect my chances being hired here? Do they keep files on this kind of stuff? I know they record conversations &#8212; so I just wondered if that meant I was in some sort of database of &#8220;angry BT&amp;T customers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty unlikely. I mean, I&#8217;ve never worked for a telecom company so it&#8217;s possible that something like this goes on, but generally speaking, it would be very unlikely. Hiring is a separate function from customer service. Unless you were a truly notorious customer, you&#8217;re probably in the clear. Anyone know otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>2. How do I know if I&#8217;m being paid off the books or not?</strong></p>
<p><em>I started working for a company in January and was hired for Sales/Marketing with a salary and commission. I get paid on time, I get a check, but no pay stub. He gives us a check and a handwritten break down of the taxes. I know he has two people employed off the books and I don&#8217;t want to be taken for a fool. How do I know for a fact that I am on the books?</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s entirely possible that he&#8217;s handling this all correctly but not using a payroll service and doing the calculations himself, but of course you don&#8217;t know that based on what you&#8217;re receiving. I&#8217;d imagine, though, that you could contact the IRS and your state tax agency to confirm that they&#8217;re receiving taxes on your behalf.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should non-exempt employees be paid for time at non-mandatory work dinners?</strong></p>
<p><em>Recently our entire department was invited to a dinner with staff members from an outside vendor. I believe the purpose of the dinner is to thank us for our business, as my company is their biggest client, and we do work with them almost daily. Our department head hasn&#8217;t said the dinner is mandatory but he cleared the date with us all ahead of time. As a non-exempt employee, am I entitled to be paid for my time spent attending this dinner? If so, how do I go about asking whether I&#8217;ll be paid if I attend? I&#8217;m an introvert and will likely find the dinner stressful so I don&#8217;t want to commit to attending if I&#8217;m donating my time. I do worry, though, about the impression it will give if I decline the invitation.</em></p>
<p>Say this: &#8220;As a non-exempt worker, how should I handle my time for this dinner?&#8221; It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask. If you&#8217;re told, &#8220;Oh, since it&#8217;s voluntary, you won&#8217;t be paid for the time,&#8221; then it&#8217;s fine to decline to attend.</p>
<p><strong>4. What to say at the end of an interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m a recent graduate who has been trying to find a job in this tough market. Since December. I&#8217;ve applied to about 18 entry-level positions in my field, and have only had two interviews. Most recently, my dream job has come up (it&#8217;s a year-long internship in the cultural sector; I could care less about the &#8220;intern&#8221; title because frankly I&#8217;d love to work in the local arts and cultural scene for the rest of my career) and I&#8217;m worried that I&#8217;m a bit rusty in my interviews.</em></p>
<p><em>With that being said, here&#8217;s my question: as long as I don&#8217;t come across as desperate or begging&#8211;just using a firm voice with a confident smile&#8211;is it not too forward to mention at the end of an interview, &#8220;I want you to know that I really want this position, and I know I&#8217;d be a great fit here, if you&#8217;d give me the chance&#8221;?</em></p>
<p>Eh, it&#8217;s not a disaster or anything, but it&#8217;s a little cheesy. And you don&#8217;t really know if you&#8217;d be a great fit somewhere until you have much, much more insider information than you can get from an interview. Why not just say, &#8220;I want you to know that I really want this position, and I&#8217;d be hugely excited to be offered it&#8221;?</p>
<p><strong>5. Letting an employer know I turned down another offer</strong></p>
<p><em>Last week, I had two follow-up interviews at two different organizations. On Tuesday, it was a second interview, and a few hours later they called to offer me the job. On Thursday, it was a third interview for a job I really want. As we were discussing timing at the end of Thursday&#8217;s interview, I did let them know that I had received another job offer and so it would be helpful for me to know as soon as they could. The interviewer (who I know and have a good professional relationship with) said that she really appreciated my telling her and that she would be do her best to update me by the middle of this week.</em></p>
<p><em>Since Thursday, I have been in communication with organization A about their job offer and have decided to decline it. My question is&#8230;should I reach out to organization B to let them know that I did this? Ordinarily, I wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to over-share with a job prospect on this, but I did get the feeling that she might twist her schedule/go out of her way to expedite a decision on my behalf. I am completely over thinking and going back and forth on which decision would give me more of a competitive advantage. But in the end, my inclination in general is to err on the side of transparency and tell her. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Yes, transparency is generally good, and there&#8217;s no reason not to use it here. Particularly since she might feel pressured to get you a quicker answer than she otherwise would, and that can lead to the answer being &#8220;no&#8221; if she&#8217;s not 100% ready for it to be &#8220;yes&#8221; yet. Send her an email and let her know.</p>
<p><strong>6. Is this a good sign?</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to move back to my small hometown (10k) and was shocked when I found a company that does work in my niche industry. I sent a cold inquiry email with my resume on Friday night. I got a quick response early Saturday morning saying he was very interested in speaking, but couldn&#8217;t talk until after tax season ends, and would call me April 17.</em></p>
<p><em>Would you take &#8220;very interested&#8221; to mean he has a real opportunity and potential to hire, or possibly just willing to network for future?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way of knowing. But regardless, you&#8217;re better off taking it as &#8220;future networking&#8221; so that you don&#8217;t start counting on it in your head &#8212; since even if he means &#8220;I have an open position,&#8221; there&#8217;s no guarantee that it will stay open or that he&#8217;ll hire you for it.</p>
<p><strong>7. I think my cousin is cheating his employees</strong></p>
<p><em>My cousin owns a construction and assorted services (lawn care, snow plowing, etc.) business. I am not close with him; he lives several states away from me and I haven&#8217;t seen him in years.</em></p>
<p><em>I recently heard from another family member (who does know him well, spends a lot of time with him, etc.) about a number of problems he&#8217;s been having with his business lately, stemming from his poor treatment of clients and employees. One of the things she described was that, in retaliation for some employees &#8220;slacking off,&#8221; he retroactively cut their pay. I don&#8217;t know any more details (or even if it&#8217;s true, since I heard it secondhand), but it makes me so angry. His employees (who include other members of my family) are in no position to advocate for themselves. It feels like someone should do something, but I&#8217;m not sure what.</em></p>
<p><em>There are obviously plenty of family relationship issues here that are outside your scope. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on whether I should get involved &#8212; and if so, what can actually do. I&#8217;ll say up front that my bias is that, ethically, I (or anyone in this situation) should do something (e..g, call the state Dept. of Labor, or whatever). I&#8217;m open to hearing that I shouldn&#8217;t, but I wanted to put that out there.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really see what you can do. You don&#8217;t have any way to verify the information, and you don&#8217;t have a relationship with your cousin where it would make sense to talk to him about this &#8212; you don&#8217;t have the standing to raise it with him the way you would if you were closer or in more contact. I think this falls under the &#8220;not your business&#8221; category, unless one of those factors changes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have a coworker who I&#8217;ve been friendly with for over two years. I took her under my wing when she got here because I saw that she was having a tough time. I had a tough time also when I first started and for the first two years I hated the office. I was bored, I didn&#8217;t have any work to do, and my supervisor was super moody. Things have since changed for me, so when I saw the new person having a a tough time, I took her under my wing and explained the ins and outs of the office personalities, the history of the office, and how I initially felt when I started.</em></p>
<p><em>My other coworkers and I did our best to make her feel welcome in the office. We all have a good rapport with each other, and some of us have even hung out socially. However, she is still refering to the office as a miserable place to work. She complains about not having enough meaningful work to do in our office but hasn&#8217;t spoken to the supervisor or anyone else about taking on other responsibilities.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I be offended by the negative remarks she makes about the office when my other coworkers and I have done so much to make her feel welcomed? We celebrate birthdays in the office and I do festive things and decorate during the holidays, and we laugh, joke and have great conversations during the day. Granted, we still have the same moody supervisor, but the rest of us have learned to accept and deal with the fact that our supervisor is moody. I really feel slighted but I don&#8217;t know if maybe I&#8217;m just being hypersensitive! I also should point out that she also splits her time between two different offices and often makes it seem like the other office is so much fun and is a much better place to work.</em></p>
<p>If she doesn&#8217;t like it, she doesn&#8217;t like it, and there&#8217;s no reason for you to be offended by that. Different people have different perspectives on the same work environment, and you can&#8217;t take that personally.</p>
<p>However, her complaining and negativity is legitimately frustrating, and you have every right to ask her to tone it down, and to stop venting it to you. The next time she does it, why not ask her to cut it out? Tell her that it makes work less pleasant for you, that you&#8217;re pretty happy there, and that you&#8217;d appreciate her not trashing an environment that you&#8217;re pretty happy in.</p>
<p>And frankly, in response to her frequent complaints, you could also try asking, &#8220;So what do you plan to do about it?&#8221; She seems to not realize that she has any agency here (she could talk to your manager, she could try to transfer to the other office full-time, she could apply for other jobs, etc.). It might be useful to point out that her complaints ring pretty hollow when she&#8217;s not taking any action to try to change her situation.</p>
<p>But overall, should you be offended? No. Just annoyed. Very, very annoyed. And well within your rights to tell her to cut it out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have been at my position for over a year and a half. I work in a college administrative office. We offer small business counseling for free twice a month. And twice a month, the woman in charge of the program tells me how to process the clients needing counseling. It&#8217;s simple things &#8212; copy this, check off the list, etc. I feel like she is insulting my intelligence by constantly telling me how to do these simple tasks.</em></p>
<p><em>She is an older woman (60&#8242;s/70&#8242;s) and I&#8217;m young (25). How do I kindly say to her &#8220;I know what I&#8217;m doing&#8221;? I feel like I&#8217;m being treated like a child.</em></p>
<p>Say this: &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you go over this with me each time we do this, and it makes me wonder &#8212; am I making mistakes or otherwise not doing this correctly?&#8221; Don&#8217;t say this in a snotty tone &#8212; say it in a tone of genuine concern.</p>
<p>This might be enough to make the point to her that you&#8217;ve got it and don&#8217;t need it repeated each time. (Or alternately, you might find out that she has some concern that you didn&#8217;t realize and that she&#8217;s not addressing head-on.)</p>
<p>And in general, that&#8217;s always the right pose to take with this kind of thing &#8212; if someone is treating you in a way that seems condescending or untrusting or inappropriately micromanagey, express genuine concern about what might be causing it. It&#8217;s a reasonably direct but non-aggressive way into a conversation about what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>But if that doesn&#8217;t work with her, then you can try, &#8220;I really do know the process well at this point, and I hate to have you spend your time reviewing it with me so often. Could I take it from here and check in with you if I run into questions?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if <em>that</em> doesn&#8217;t work &#8230; well, at that point you accept that she&#8217;s oddly neurotic about this program and you&#8217;re going to be receiving very basic instructions about it twice a month.</p>

But with most employers, being too aggressive will backfire and lead to more rejections than interviews.</p>
<p>You might wonder why – after all, employers like persistence and enthusiasm, right? But when those things cross the line into annoying employers, making you seem desperate, or making you appear not to understand and follow normal business conventions, you’ll harm your chances.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be too aggressive? Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about some of the most common overly aggressive tactics that employers see that can torpedo your chances.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Explaining why other companies didn&#8217;t hire me</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been unemployed for over a year now, but I keep sending out applications and sometimes manage to get a interview. And a question I&#8217;ve been asked several times is, &#8220;Do you know why you weren&#8217;t hired by those other companies?&#8221; It usually starts when they ask, &#8220;Where else have you been applying?&#8221; and I say hospitals, universities, and biotech companies. Then I get asked, &#8220;Do you know why you weren&#8217;t hired by Other Place?&#8221; or &#8220;Did you get any feedback from Other Place as to why they didn&#8217;t hire you?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>The truth is that I usually hear nothing back, but once in a while I get a personal rejection letter that goes along the lines of &#8220;You were a great candidate but unfortunately another candidate had more experience.&#8221; So I say lack of experience, although it could of course be any reason. But am I supposed to do a little soul-searching to answer that question? Are my interviewers wondering if I showed some red flag that is preventing me from getting hired for over a year? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m any weirder than the next person, but do interviewers think there must be something wrong with me, otherwise someplace would have hired me by now? Or is there is really something wrong with me?</em></p>
<p>This is really odd. It&#8217;s an odd question for any interviewer to ask, and so it&#8217;s really odd that you&#8217;re being asked it by multiple different interviewers. And it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going to tell them anything useful, like &#8220;Oh yeah, Company X said that I showed up drunk, and Company Y thought my degree was BS.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any case, I wouldn&#8217;t let it worry you too much. Just smile and say something like, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s just a tough job market right now and there are lots of good candidates.&#8221; Frankly, you could also add, &#8220;But if you have any feedback, I&#8217;d love it!&#8221; Because if they&#8217;re asking such an odd question, you&#8217;re entitled to ask them that back.</p>
<p><strong>2. Employer isn&#8217;t being clear about paid holidays</strong></p>
<p><em>Upon receiving an offer letter, I noticed nothing was noted about paid holidays. This is a full time salaried position directly under the HR supervisor. I emailed the HR supervisor asking her about this, and she quickly sent back an email quoting the company&#8217;s vacation day policy. I wrote back explaining that I was actually asking if there were any paid holidays, like Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc. that the office would be closed for. Four hours later, no response, so I called and she told me that she was asking the owner to answer my question. I told her I understood but asked if it would be safe to assume something like Christmas day. She told me she wouldn&#8217;t comment.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel like this is a huge red flag, not only because of the possible lack of holiday pay with only five vacation days per year, but because I would be working in the HR department and the HR director doesn&#8217;t seem to have a concrete answer to what I think is a pretty basic question.</em></p>
<p><em>The office is small, but the company is not. It&#8217;s a restaurant group that owns two large bars and one restaurant. This position is being created to help the woman running HR with her overflowing work load. She&#8217;s been there for a few years, so I thought she would at least tell me if they were closed for Christmas. I don&#8217;t know if that means they weren&#8217;t planning on paying me for holidays, or what. I still haven&#8217;t heard back.</em></p>
<p>The uncertainty might be because bars and restaurants are often open on holidays, so it&#8217;s possible that this company is too, even though you&#8217;d be working in their administrative office. But honestly, the whole exchange feels a bit adversarial to me (on both sides &#8212; you calling her after only four hours of not hearing back, her refusing &#8220;to comment,&#8221; etc.), and that&#8217;s the bigger red flag to me than whatever their holiday policy is.</p>
<p><strong>3. Employer was interested in me for a job but I didn&#8217;t pass their electronic &#8220;values&#8221; screening</strong></p>
<p><em>I was recommended for a role by a freelancer who works with me and for the company which was creating the role. The manager was given my CV and was really impressed and forwarded it on to their recruitment person, who called me. We had a good talk and she said my experience and qualifications were a perfect fit for the role and that at the end of our conversation she felt I was what they were looking for. However, they had to advertise the role to satisfy their HR policy and so she asked me to officially apply online, which would go to their outsourced recruitment provider and she&#8217;d look out for my name when the candidate list came through.</em></p>
<p><em>So I filled out the 8-page application form (lots of competanc- based questions needing lots of examples), which I submitted, and this then led me to a values questionnaire. Of the 20 questions, I struggled with at least 5 because I felt they were hard to answer without knowing the company&#8217;s policy on certain areas (refunds, etc.) where you may want to take bold actions but until you know if you have the support of your employer in those decisions, you wouldn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>I have since received a computer-generated email saying I have been rejected because I don&#8217;t share enough of their values. Should I call the recruitment person and talk to her again? I&#8217;m disappointed that because of 20 questions, a computer has decided I don&#8217;t even get an interview despite already being told I have the qualities they&#8217;re looking for. Or should I just accept the rejection and move on?</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can contact her and see if she&#8217;d be willing to interview you anyway. It&#8217;ll depend on how rigid they are about their computer screening (which I agree sounds dumb).</p>
<p><strong>4. Listing volunteer work that includes multiple roles</strong></p>
<p><em>If you&#8217;ve volunteered for a while with the same organization but in different positions, how would you recommend putting the experience on your resume without taking up too much space by listing each role? In my case, I&#8217;ve been volunteering for an organization that provides adult English as a Second Language classes, and I&#8217;ve done individual tutoring, teaching a small class (once a week), and soon I&#8217;m planning to be a substitute teacher, as other responsibilities have become more demanding.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d list it all as one volunteer role, explaining briefly (in a single line) what the specifics are. For instance:</p>
<p>Volunteer Teacher, XYZ Organization: teach weekly ESL class, provide one-on-one tutoring to three students, fill in as substitute teacher for advanced classes</p>
<p><strong>5. What to ask when considering working internationally</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve applied for a job that is right in line with my experience and qualifications. The interesting thing is that it is an international position, where I would work about half-time from home and about half-time at international client sites. The position would be quite interesting, but it is the international travel that I&#8217;m wondering about. I&#8217;m excited about the potential opportunity, but I&#8217;m not even sure what I should be asking when considering a position in which I would be working in other countries significantly, as I&#8217;ve only had brief work-related experiences before. Any advice you (or your esteemed readers) might have would be much appreciated.</em></p>
<p>Readers, what advice do you have?</p>
<p><strong>6. Pursuing more education to change careers</strong></p>
<p><em>Nearly 5 years ago, I graduated with a Master&#8217;s in English. I pursued a Master&#8217;s in part because so many of my undergrad mentors/advisors/professors said that many more job opportunities would be open to me. Unfortunately, that has not been the case, and I&#8217;ve been stuck as an adjunct since I graduated. It&#8217;s become clear that I will probably never get a full-time teaching job. And the MA seems to make me appear overqualified for most other jobs (and lack of experience outside of academia makes me under-qualified).</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of returning to school for an AA or AS, perhaps in something like HR, just so I can get my foot in the door in another profession. But I know BA to MA to AA would look strange. Ultimately, I don&#8217;t know what to do: take on a little more debt in order to hopefully find a full-time job or take on no more debt (I still owe for my BA and MA) but perhaps work part-time forever.</em></p>
<p>Ugh, I&#8217;m sorry &#8212; this sucks. And yeah, BA to MA to AA is going to look strange, and there&#8217;s no point in taking on more debt. I wonder if a better path is to network your ass off and convince someone that you&#8217;re passionate about HR (or whatever you settle on) and to take a chance on you. Consider interning or volunteering in whatever field you want to move into too &#8212; that will help you get experience and also make contacts who you can then lobby to let you try your hand at more. (Also, the people who told you a MA in English would make you more marketable need their licenses to advise revoked.)</p>
<p><strong>7. Making a presentation in a job interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying for a marketing manager position. I passed the first round and now have the personal meeting with my potential director. Do you think it would be fine to make a short presentation (4 or 5 slides of powerpoint) of how my skills and experience can attend his/company&#8217;s needs? Although it hasn&#8217;t been required, the development of presentations is part of the job description.</em></p>
<p>If you mean something like your resume in presentation form, no. That&#8217;s going to be overkill and annoying. But if you mean a presentation about ideas you have for excelling in the role you&#8217;re interviewing for, then potentially yes &#8230; but the only way this works is if it&#8217;s incredibly compelling. If it&#8217;s not, it can actually hurt you. So the answer depends on what the content is and how truly awesome it&#8217;s going to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Sunday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should I intervene when one assistant is rude to another?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a question about tolerating rudeness. I am on a team of about 14 people, three of whom are assistants. I am a supervisor and have one associate director and two directors who I report to. My issue is that one of my assistants is being very mean to another (she is very nice to the third assistant, as well as everyone else), and I am not sure how (or if) I should handle it. The mean assistant will giggle and roll her eyes in a meeting after her counterpart says something (sometimes silly questions but she is clearly junior and still learning), will ask her personal questions in a disdainful tone, and is just generally not inclusive or nice to her. The non-mean assistant is generally a good worker and good at her job, very eager and well liked by members of other teams. She has not said anything to me about her mean counterpart and it seems to kind of roll off her back. As supervisor though, I hate to condone such outright mean-ness because it is done in front of me.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts? Should I make sure it&#8217;s mentioned in her review? (Someone else is reviewing her, but my manager is reviewing that review, so I can talk to her.) I feel like it shouldn&#8217;t be tolerated but am conflicted because it is affecting no one&#8217;s work.</em></p>
<p>Yes, you should absolutely say something to her, and don&#8217;t wait for her review. You should be giving her feedback all along, and this is absolutely an appropriate topic for you to talk to her about. Tell her that she needs to be pleasant and professional to everyone she works with, that it&#8217;s not acceptable to roll her eyes at coworkers or otherwise be rude to them, and that you expect her to immediately begin treating the other assistant pleasantly. And if you notice any more of it continuing after that, have a more serious conversation with her, as you would for any performance issue that wasn&#8217;t getting resolved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about whether something is affecting the work; it&#8217;s that she needs to act in accordance with the culture and values that you want reflected on your team, and that includes not making it an unpleasant environment for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>2. No room at the office lunch table</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a grad student who is interning full-time at a small company as part of my program. From noon until 1, the office closes for lunch. My supervisor is always trying to get me to come to the workplace lunchroom for lunch. However, every time I go, there is no room for me. I have been able to get a seat there three times in the last seven weeks. The room is very small (it is actually a meeting room) and there no available chairs to borrow so that I can join everyone. I have tried showing up 10 minutes early or 30 minute late to no avail.</em></p>
<p><em>I end up eating at my desk or going to the large conference room where there is room for everyone to sit. However, I am always alone in that big room! The office had a lunch meeting in there last week, and several people mentioned that they should move lunch to the big room. However, nothing changed. I do not want to miss out on opportunities for socializing and networking, so I attend all work events and going away parties, etc., but my supervisor is convinced that sitting in the lunch room is a good way to network at this company. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>Since your supervisor is always trying to get you to join them for lunch, next time she mentions it, tell her why you can&#8217;t! &#8220;I&#8217;d love to, but when I&#8217;ve tried, there aren&#8217;t any chairs! What&#8217;s the secret to getting one?&#8221; You can also ask other coworkers the same thing &#8212; especially the next time you walk in to find the room full. I bet someone will make room for you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I get an MBA?</strong></p>
<p><em>For the last year or so, I have been struggling to identify what I want to do with my career. I finished my Ph.D. last May while working in a very high-profile job in the government. I loved my job, but a new director who did not have the same vision for my work left me feeling anxious and depressed. I ended up leaving that job for a position doing the same type of work at a small nonprofit. I still enjoy what I do and make a bit more money, but I&#8217;m finding that I thrive with a faster pace and higher visibility. I&#8217;ve been reading Lean In on my commutes lately and am realizing my goal is to get into more senior leadership at bigger organizations or government and have a more powerful and visible role. My Ph.D. gives me expertise in an albeit narrow field but I&#8217;m wondering if I should go pursue an MBA at night to help me achieve my goal. What else can I do to help get myself on that path? If it helps, I am 28 and about to get married with no kids.</em></p>
<p>Personally, a PhD and an MBA seems like overkill to me, but maybe there&#8217;s some justification for it. But I&#8217;d want to really know what that justification is &#8212; is an MBA truly necessary for what you want to do? I can&#8217;t tell from what&#8217;s here, but that&#8217;s the question to ask yourself. If it&#8217;s not required, then you&#8217;re better off getting the right work experience instead.</p>
<p><strong>4. Going from a research specialist to a research generalist</strong></p>
<p><em>My job is going to be eliminated in about a year and a half, and I am starting to look for a new position. I work in politics as a research analyst, but for the past 5 years I&#8217;ve focused on very specific issue areas that aren&#8217;t very marketable. I probably won&#8217;t be able to find a position doing the same issues I do now. That&#8217;s fine &#8212; in fact, I have become an expert on these issues mostly because my bosses needed someone to do them. They weren&#8217;t things I had prior knowledge or experience doing. My question is how to approach job opportunities that are in different issues, or how to market myself as someone who isn&#8217;t pigeonholed into a couple very obscure areas. I&#8217;m still looking to do policy analysis, but most of the jobs I&#8217;m seeing are either a lot more general than what I&#8217;m working on now, or are for different issues. I&#8217;m qualified for the analysis part, but I&#8217;m concerned with how to appeal to managers when I won&#8217;t necessarily have the particular issue expertise other candidates will probably have. I know for a lot of jobs this will be a sticking point and there&#8217;s not much I can do, but I&#8217;d love your advice on the best way to market myself for different areas.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re thinking this is more of a problem than it actually is. Unless you&#8217;re looking at job postings that specifically require experience in Issue X, generally policy research in one area makes you a fine candidate for policy research in another area. You know how to find information, judge what is and isn&#8217;t important, present it concisely, and become an expert in issues you previously knew nothing about. That&#8217;s the part you focus on when applying.</p>
<p><strong>5. Asking for a title bump</strong></p>
<p><em>I landed a fantastic short-term paid internship earlier this year. Thanks to your blog and commenters (I don&#8217;t comment, just read what others say), I&#8217;ve really been excelling at my position &#8212; so much so that my manager wants to keep me on after the internship ends! Long story short, the plan is to hire me on contract.</em></p>
<p><em>Currently, my title is intern. Would it be bad form to ask for a title bump &#8212; say, to assistant, so an entry-level title and nothing crazy? I&#8217;d really like to show some progression on my resume and somehow indicate that it wasn&#8217;t just a long internship. I&#8217;m not getting a raise (fine by me as it&#8217;s a nonprofit and I&#8217;m lucky for the contract when there are layoffs happening), so I&#8217;m not sure when or how I could ask as there aren&#8217;t going to be negotiations.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s completely reasonable to ask for. They may be planning something like that since you won&#8217;t be an intern anymore, but it&#8217;s totally fine to ask about now.</p>
<p><strong>6. My manager and I are applying for the same jobs</strong></p>
<p><em>One of my immediate supervisors and I are applying for many of the same jobs (and just, f.y.i., I&#8217;m really not applying for jobs that are over my head; it&#8217;s in academia where academic background is really important and I have a good work background, too). He is one of my references and an extremely strong one. There is at least one other person who I&#8217;m pretty sure would be willing to serve as a reference but it would be less strong because of knowing that person for a much shorter length of time and not having as close a relationship.</em></p>
<p><em>Basically, I&#8217;m wondering just how important references are. I think if my current reference and I apply to the same jobs, I&#8217;m not going to get a chance to interview because it would put the interviewer in an awkward position. But at the same time, I don&#8217;t want to use a weaker reference if that&#8217;s not the case. The supervisor and I have been discussing job searching, but I&#8217;m not about to ask him to tell me which jobs he&#8217;s applying for so that I know not to use him as a reference for those! It&#8217;s awkward either way, but I&#8217;m probably over-thinking this.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even worry about this. You don&#8217;t need to preemptively save hiring managers from the awkwardness of asking one candidate for a reference for the other; if you and your manager are both finalists for the same position, they&#8217;ll just ask you for other references if they want them. So it will be good to be prepared to supply others if asked, but I wouldn&#8217;t worry about it proactively.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Applying for jobs that require advanced degrees when I don&#8217;t have one</strong></p>
<p><em>I did not go to grad school for the <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2011/12/thinking-about-grad-school-think-again.html">kinds of reasons you cite</a> in your writing. Is it appropriate to apply for a job that lists an advanced degree as a requirement if I think my job experience qualifies me for the position? If so, is that something I should address directly in a cover letter?</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can absolutely do that, as long as it&#8217;s not a job that absolutely requires a graduate degree (as some do, like some teaching jobs, for instance, or practicing law). Some employers will consider you and some won&#8217;t, but there&#8217;s nothing wrong with trying, particularly if you&#8217;re highly qualified aside from the degree.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should I stay or should I go?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been working in a large nonprofit university for the past two years. I came on as an assistant and have been working here, heart and soul. I&#8217;m going to be finishing my Master&#8217;s degree this May and have a lot of technical experience as well. My problem is, I want to stay at my organization and can&#8217;t seem to find growth opportunities. Because of recent restructuring, I now have three supervisors in this department and this means three times the responsibility. They don&#8217;t need to manage me because I work independently and they know Ill get the job done.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been looking for other jobs at the company (the benefits are amazing, its prestigious, and other locations have excellent cohesive departments-so it seems) but can&#8217;t seem to find any. Should I start looking elsewhere? The growth I was promised when I started isn&#8217;t coming and it&#8217;s kind of a &#8220;boys club&#8221; department so I doubt they&#8217;ll try hard to make it happen, no matter how much they compliment my work (reluctantly I might add). I worry I may have to start over again and I don&#8217;t want to do that. I want to grow in college administration but I fear I&#8217;ll be stuck here as an admin forever. I&#8217;ve followed your amazing blog, presented really thought out projects with business proposals, attend networking events, etc. Should I stay or should I go?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d work from the assumption that nothing there is going to change since so far all signals point that way, and decide what you want to do with that knowledge. Are you willing to stay there for the next few years, without any promotion? If not, then yes, start looking around at other places.</p>
<p><strong>3. Asking about what a post-service-year job offer might look like, without committing to taking it</strong></p>
<p><em>The job I have now is not actually a job, but a “service year”, which means that I have a specific period of time that I am working with my organization (very tiny nonprofit). When my term of service ends in August my position is turning into a full-time staff position, and I have all but been offered the job. My supervisor has said “I hope you’re considering staying on” directly to me. So, it seems like they will offer me the position, but there has been no “official” offer.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not actually sure that I want to take the job. Maybe I just have “grass is greener” syndrome, but I’ve been thinking of looking for other jobs when my service ends. I work with a bunch of really nice people, but I am the youngest person by 30 years. I also sometimes feel that this position isn’t really right for me. I’m in a very direct service role but what I’m really interested in is more indirect service. It’s not like I struggle to do the work, I just feel like I could really shine in a different role.</em></p>
<p><em>I’d like to have a frank discussion with my supervisor about pay, benefits, vacation time, etc. before it’s too late for me to start searching for other jobs. Ideally, if I’m going to leave at the end of my service year, I’d like to have another job lined up. I’m not worried about looking like a job-hopper, because people in the nonprofit industry would understand by looking at my full job title why I only stayed for a year. So, do you have any suggestions about how to approach my supervisor about this? She is a pretty understanding person, so I’m not afraid of her flying off the handle or of being prematurely terminated. I’m more concerned about coming across like I’m only interested in what they can offer me, or that I don’t like the job and won’t be as committed if I stay on for another year.</em></p>
<p>Say something like this: &#8220;I really appreciate your mention that I might be able to continue in a full-time position after August. I know there are no guarantees of that at this point, but since I&#8217;m starting to think about making plans for that time, I wonder if you can talk to me about what the offer would look like if you did make one, as far as what the job would look like, the likely salary range, etc.&#8221; And you can either ask her about benefits or ask any coworker, since benefits are usually the same across the board, at least for junior level jobs.</p>
<p>If during the course of this conversation, she basically makes you an offer, it&#8217;s fine to just thank her, explain that you&#8217;ve only just started to think about what you&#8217;d like to do in August, and ask if you can have some time to think about your options.</p>
<p><strong>4. Answering questions about when I could start a new job</strong></p>
<p><em>I am currently job searching while still working a job. As I fill out applications, I get the standard &#8220;When can you start?&#8221; question. My honest answer is &#8220;After I give my current job my two weeks notice.&#8221; I make it clear that I would leave my current job if offered a new job, so it seems &#8220;after two weeks notice&#8221; would be the obvious answer. But is that too vague an answer to put down on an application or is that acceptable?</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s totally fine and normal.</p>
<p><strong>5. Why was this interview so unthorough?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve come to expect a kind of grilling at interviews, but recently I&#8217;ve gone to interviews where I was asked almost no questions. At a recent interview, most of the time was spent with the interviewer talking about the position and then me taking him through my resume. He asked questions about particular parts of my resume (but they were fact-based questions about what I did and not behavioral). It was almost too casual for a formal interview.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m applying to entry-level positions, so part of me thinks they might just be trying to figure out if they like me personally, since my experience is pretty limited. What do you think of this interview style? Is it related to the fact that I&#8217;m interviewing for entry level positions? Am I right in thinking it was more about fit and personality than relevant experience? I&#8217;ve had these types of interviews when I knew the interviewer previously, but I had never met this man before.</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;s probably just an unskilled interviewer. They are legion.</p>
<p><strong>6. Part 2 of question #5</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a different question relating to the same interview above. The interviewer spent a large part of the beginning talking about the position and company, and I asked questions throughout this time. Then we did the whole resume walk through and question period, and then at the end of the interview he asked if I had any questions. I said I had none because they were already addressed at the beginning. He gave me a bit of a weird look, so I&#8217;m wondering if I should have asked additional questions, but really, we spent such a large time talking about the position and company at the beginning that I was all out (although I probably could have made up a few about culture and whatnot).</em></p>
<p>If it was truly a conversational back-and-forth, then I can understand feeling like everything you were prepared to ask had already been answered &#8230; but I always wonder how it can really be when someone says they were left with no questions. This is, after all, a job that you&#8217;d be spending 40+ hours a week at for potentially years. When you think about the enormity of what you&#8217;re potentially signing up for, do you really have <em>no</em> other questions that you&#8217;re wondering about the work, the culture, the expectations, the management?</p>
<p><strong>7. Should I contact this employer again?</strong></p>
<p><em>I applied to a job almost three and a half weeks ago. The day after I applied, they called me after 5:30 pm and left a voice mail. I called back the following day (after 5:00 pm because it’d be difficult to call earlier and I thought it’d be okay since they called me late) and left them a message. I called again (earlier) the next day after that, and they answered, but had to go to a meeting and said they’d call me back. They didn’t call me back. I then had a medical emergency that I didn’t recover from for three weeks, so I wasn’t able to call back again myself. Should I call them and explain I’m still interested but couldn’t call sooner because of a medical emergency? Should I just apply again if I see them posting a similar position? Am I too much of a nuisance at this point for them to want to deal with me?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason you need to explain not calling them back; you made the last contact, so the ball was in their court. You can certainly follow up again, but it sounds like at this point they&#8217;ve probably moved on with other candidates (which isn&#8217;t your fault for not calling them back, because you did). You can definitely apply again in the future though.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work for a large California-based software company but live in on the East Coast. I came to this company through an acquisition, and while they retained the small office we previously operated out of, my specific job is based in Los Angeles. Specifically, I travel to the West Coast for two to three weeks of the month, every month (fly out Sunday night, return on the red-eye Thursday).</em></p>
<p><em>The significant travel, as well as a general bad fit in the role, has led me to a serious job search. I have stayed with the acquiring company for over a year and they have been great to me. I have even discussed my concerns with my current boss and he is supportive and interested in finding me another role internally, but unless I move to California, any role will require the travel and being a remote employee is not for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, the question: do I have to resign in person? If I accept a job during a week that I&#8217;m actually at home, should I wait until I actually see my boss to have the conversation? Best case is obviously to accept a job while I&#8217;m already there, worst case is that there could be up to nine business days between accepting a job and seeing him. I&#8217;d like to transition out of my role as soon as possible, while still giving two weeks notice. I am also sensitive to the cost of the travel. Each week they spend ~$1400 on my airfare, hotel, rental car and expenses.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it rude to resign over the phone? Will they think it&#8217;s disrespectful to continue to spend company money when I know that I&#8217;m leaving? I want to be respectful of both my current employer and the potential new employer by giving two weeks, but also moving to the new role as quickly as possible.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s absolutely not rude to resign over the phone. This isn&#8217;t like a break-up, where you owe it to the other person to talk face-to-face. The vast, vast majority of managers just want to receive your notice as early as possible, so that they have as much time as possible to plan for the transition, and they don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s in person or not.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&#8217;s still more professional to do it in person if you&#8217;re in the same location, so this isn&#8217;t license to send off a resignation email and hide in your office when your boss is right down the hall. But when you&#8217;re not in the same location, a phone call is absolutely fine &#8212; particularly when the alternative means waiting days or weeks.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re talking about methods of delivering resignations, here are two other things people don&#8217;t always realize:</p>
<p>* You tell your boss first. But if your boss is unreachable &#8212; out of the country on vacation for more than a couple of more days, for instance, or in the hospital with ebola &#8212; then you give your notice to your boss&#8217;s boss (or possibly HR if that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done in your company). You don&#8217;t need to sit around waiting for your boss to come back, if it&#8217;s going to be a while &#8212; or even if it&#8217;s not going to be that long, if it would mean eating in to an already short notice period. (In other words, if you&#8217;re giving six weeks notice, it&#8217;s fine to wait a couple of days until your manager&#8217;s ebola clears up. If you&#8217;re leaving two weeks from today, then you need to tell someone that today.)</p>
<p>* People often think they have to write a formal resignation letter. While you can certainly do this if you want to, lots of people don&#8217;t and many employers don&#8217;t ask for them. But when they do, the point is to simply document that you resigned and what date it will be effective (in case you later sue, or file for unemployment and claim you were laid off, for instance). It only needs to be about two sentences. It&#8217;s not supposed to be an explanation of why you&#8217;re leaving, and what could have made you stay, and the drama you&#8217;ve had with your boss. You can certainly cover that in the resignation <em>conversation</em>, if you feel like it &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t go in a letter.</p>
<p>This is your letter, if you need one at all: &#8220;This letter is to let you know that I&#8217;m resigning my position, effective May 1. I&#8217;ve enjoyed my time here and wish Chocolate Teapots Inc. the best of luck.&#8221; The end.</p>
<p>(And if you use a letter &#8212; which, again, you often don&#8217;t need to &#8212; you do <em>not</em> break the news this way. The letter comes after the conversation. Its purpose is documenting, not announcing.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m moving to a new city in a couple of months to follow my partner to his new academic job, so I&#8217;m beginning a job search. I don&#8217;t know anyone well in this city, though I have a few distant contacts, professional and personal, with ties to the area, i.e. a man I collaborated with briefly in a different city when I and I were both working for different organizations; a woman my grad school adviser went to grad school with and who still works in the dept. they both got their phDs from; a former colleague who grew up nearby, etc.</em></p>
<p><em>In other words, there are some people I can start networking with, and people I might be referred to by people I know pretty well, but no one I know very well directly or have a lot of personal experience with. My question is: What do I say to these people? I&#8217;ve read questions you&#8217;ve answered before about networking, and I know a lot of things NOT to do &#8212; don&#8217;t ask a lot of general questions, don&#8217;t take up too much time, don&#8217;t make vague inquiries, don&#8217;t ask for a job, and I get those. But where I&#8217;m struggling is in coming up with pithy, meaningful questions can I ask for help with in an introductory email or coffee meeting. If I was just out of college, I would ask for help understanding the field. But I&#8217;m mid-career, I understand my field(s) pretty well, and I want to come across as knowledgeable, not naive. All I can think of to ask is for other people to network with, but that just would seem to send me in a circle of content-less conversations.</em></p>
<p><em>Part of the problem may be that I hate networking just as much as you say that you do&#8230;and I want to make myself a general roadmap to guide me through these situations, rather than winging it.</em></p>
<p>Well, if you think about this as just a back-door way to make contacts, it&#8217;ll be hard to come up much to say, because you&#8217;ll be focused on the wrong thing: just adding a person to your list of people you know. You&#8217;ll be thinking about just wanting to check off a box instead of genuinely getting to know them, and that screams &#8220;networking for networking&#8217;s sake,&#8221; which makes people like you and me blanch.</p>
<p>So instead, think about what you&#8217;d genuinely like to know about your industry in your new city. When you imagine trying to find a new job in this city, what do you wish you knew? Do you have questions about firms there, people, trends, salary ranges? Are there good networking groups or do they suck? What&#8217;s the scoop on the top firms in your field there? Is Company X really family-friendly, or is that hype? What&#8217;s up with Company&#8217;s Y weird campaign from last year? And so forth.</p>
<p>If you had a magic genie who would tell you anything at all about your industry there, what would you ask? I bet you do have questions when you think of it like that. That&#8217;s the stuff to ask these people.</p>
<p>What other tips do people have?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Well, some of them are short. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Can you block off time on your calendar for your own projects?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it considered bad form to block off time on my calendar when I have a deadline? Two days a week, I&#8217;m tied up the whole afternoon because I have an evening deadline. (This isn&#8217;t procrastination; I get the handoff from others around noon and I have to be done with my part by the end of the day.) The people I regularly work with know this, but they often (understandably) forget which afternoons, and people I work with less frequently don&#8217;t know about my schedule. The result is that I have to continue to decline conference call invitations or remind people that I won&#8217;t have time to meet on Wednesday but Thursday works, creating more back-and-forth. Would it be frowned upon to create a recurring appointment on my Outlook calendar for those afternoons to mark that time as busy, considering it&#8217;s not really an appointment, it&#8217;s just regular work?</em></p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s <em>good</em> form. Getting your work done is at least important, generally more so, than most conference calls or meetings. Setting aside work blocks on your calendar is a good idea, both for conveying to others that that time is reserved and also for conveying it to yourself so you don&#8217;t schedule over it with less important things too. I&#8217;m a huge advocate of this &#8212; do it!</p>
<p><strong>2. Can I push back on this schedule change?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in a salaried full-time position. I work a 4/10 schedule (4 days a week, 10 hours a day), and commute an hour in each direction to make it to my job. Add on the branch mandatory lunch (which I never take), and that makes my work days 13 hours long.</em></p>
<p><em>My manager has proposed a schedule change which would not make my days longer on paper, but with changes in traffic patterns would effectively make my day over an hour longer—bringing me to 14 hours either spent at work or commuting. I will also be forced to miss necessary medical appointments. There is no room for negotiation, and my protests were met with how I should be happy because I have the best schedule, the easiest job (a job with one of the highest rates of burnout? I think not), and the fewest obligations because I’m single and don’t have children. Do I have any recourse?</em></p>
<p>Well, you can certainly make your case against the proposed schedule change. But ultimately it&#8217;s up to your manager. At that point you&#8217;d need to decide whether you want the job under these changed terms or not.</p>
<p>You could certainly point out, though, that citing your marital/parental status as part of the justification for your schedule change is problematic. (There&#8217;s no real legal issue there, both because few states protect against discrimination on those fronts and because that&#8217;s not the <em>reason</em> for the change, just part of his lame efforts to tell you why you shouldn&#8217;t care, but it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to point it out anyway.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Coworkers are pushing me to badmouth my predecessor, who I like</strong></p>
<p><em>I work as the director of my division in a large organization. My predecessor, who stepped down about a year ago, was my supervisor and was a great mentor to me. We still stay in touch and he has told me that he is willing to recommend me in the future (I am confident he would give me a great reference). However, the organization just wasn&#8217;t a fit for him and he was not well-liked by most of our colleagues.</em></p>
<p><em>Now that he has left and I have filled his position, on numerous occasions my colleagues (including people senior in the organization) have approached me to complain about his work and tell me how much better I am in the role than he was. Sometimes they will really push to try to get me to talk badly about him (&#8220;Can you believe so-and-so did that? What was he thinking?&#8221;). I obviously don&#8217;t want to engage in this because it&#8217;s so unprofessional. I would be horrified if it ever got back to him that I was involved in a conversation like this (in fact, it already worries me that it might, even though I haven&#8217;t said anything and am just on the receiving end). At the same time, if I say something in his defense (or even just say nothing), I&#8217;m pretty sure my colleagues will think I stand behind his work and will think less of me as a result. Any advice?</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the kind words about my work &#8212; I appreciate it! I know the fit here wasn&#8217;t a great one for Bob, but he&#8217;s a good guy.&#8221; And if you&#8217;re still pressed to say something negative or listen to them badmouth him after that: &#8220;I have a good relationship with him,&#8221; said in a pleasant tone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;re going to think less of you for either of those statements, unless Bob molested puppies or something.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can&#8217;t work out my two weeks notice</strong></p>
<p><em>I gave my two weeks notice to my boss after finding out my family would be moving to another state because my fiance was offered a better job. But they need him to start immediately, meaning I can&#8217;t fulfill my entire two weeks left. This would deem me not eligible for re-hire. Is this going to make it impossible for me to find a new job if I just don&#8217;t show up for the rest of the schedule?</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t mean you&#8217;d just stop showing up, right? You&#8217;re planning to talk to your manager and <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2010/04/19/when-you-cant-give-two-weeks-notice">explain the situation</a>, apologize, and ask for leeway? If you do that, your manager will probably be understanding. But yeah, if you just stop showing up without doing that, that would be a huge bridge-burner and reputation killer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Explaining post-graduation work as a server</strong></p>
<p><em>I graduated last May and continued working for a high-end resort as a server in one of their restaurants. My degree is in hospitality and tourism management so it is related. I planned on doing it just for the summer because I made more than I could make at any entry level job in my field. My husband is in the military and we were told that we were moving in September so I stayed. Then it got pushed to November and I didn&#8217;t want to apply, be accepted and then leave 2 months later. This continued until we finally moved in January.</em></p>
<p><em>How do I explain this in interviews when I&#8217;m asked why I didn&#8217;t go after a higher position in interviews? Being a server taught me many things and I know I can use these skills to sell myself in an interview, but I&#8217;m stumped on how to answer the question of why I stayed on as a server instead of going after a higher job. I&#8217;m hesitant to mention the husband in the military thing since I don&#8217;t want it to seem as if we will be moving again soon.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew I&#8217;d be relocating soon, and I didn&#8217;t want to commit to a new job and have to leave it a few months later. But the work taught me (fill in the blank).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>6. Can recruiter stop me from applying to a company directly?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m working with a legal recruiting firm. I am a paralegal/legal assistant. My recruiter tells me this scenario: They submit my resume for position XYZ at a very large law firm (100-plus attorneys). That same law firm advertises on Craigslist and any other form of recruiting they can. The recruiter has told me that if position ABC comes available in that firm, I cannot contact that firm directly, that I need to work through the recruiter because previously they submitted me for position XYZ. I&#8217;m told this is the policy for 12 months. This language is nowhere in their placement agreement with me. Can they prevent me from working directly with this firm on other positions?</em></p>
<p>They can&#8217;t stop you from applying directly if you&#8217;d like to, but that company has a contract with this recruiter stating that the recruiter &#8220;owns&#8221; any candidates they submit for 12 months &#8212; meaning that even if you apply with the company directly during that period, the recruiter will still be owed a fee on your candidacy. Because of that, the company itself is going to want you to go through the recruiter, since that&#8217;s the contract they have with that agency. (This is typical of how most recruiters work. And while the contact is with the company, not with you, the company is going to abide by it where you&#8217;re concerned.)</p>
<p><strong>7. How does my daughter explain a cruise ship firing?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m asking this question on behalf of my daughter, who has just graduated college with a degree in recreation and hopes to be hired for her dream job as a youth counselor for a cruise line. She did a two-week cruise internship over Christmas break 2011, and last summer worked for the same company on their Alaska cruises, working on three different ships in the fleet. She loved her job, loved the company, loved the kids, and was having the best summer. There was a very busy day when she was working alone with a group of kids (usually there are two counselors), and a child in her care slipped away unnoticed before being picked up by his parents. The checkout sheet was unsigned at the end of the session, but because she had seen the parents come by the kids club several times that morning she thought they had picked him up, and she didn&#8217;t report it to her supervisor. The parents noted the situation in their comment card at the end of the cruise, and without verbal or written warning she was terminated, confined to her cabin until the next port and put ashore in Juneau. The cruise line did provide a plane ticket home. It was traumatic, embarrassing, scary and demoralizing.</em></p>
<p><em>She still dreams of working for a cruise line. Cruise jobs are very competitive, so she needs her previous cruise experience to even be considered for an interview. Her supervisor from one of the ships has offered to be a reference for her. She is preparing responses for an interview, but the application is somewhat of an obstacle, especially the question &#8220;why did you leave your last job?&#8221; The Alaska cruises were a summer job, as she was returning to college full-time in September, so would it be acceptable to respond that this was &#8220;seasonal work&#8221;? Or should she give an ambiguous explanation such as &#8220;job ended&#8221;? One person suggested writing &#8220;willing to discuss at interview.&#8221; We have been advised that the cruise line HR office will provide confirmation of job title and dates of employment, and will state that she is not suitable for rehire. They may or may not refer inquiries to the hiring officer who has her personnel file for further information. </em><em>So how does she fill out her application? How does she balance being truthful while making herself an attractive candidate?</em></p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing: Letting a child disappear while under her care is a Big Deal. You and she realize that, right? While it might have been &#8220;demoralizing&#8221; for her to be fired without warning, it was terrifying for those parents and could have ended much worse than it did. And it was utterly reasonable to fire her without warning. It sounds like you don&#8217;t realize that, which worries me.</p>
<p>And this an especially big deal when she&#8217;s applying for jobs that would have her supervising kids again. It&#8217;s likely going to be prohibitive. While I understand that she wants to include the cruise experience to help her get a future cruise job, it&#8217;s not going to help her. Imagine if it happens again and something happens to the child, and it comes out the the company hired her knowing that it had happened before.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s probably better off getting other job experience for a while, and then trying again. But it&#8217;s not ever going to help her to include this job on her resume, because it will probably be disqualifying &#8230; and she certainly shouldn&#8217;t be misleading about why she left it; they will verify, and discovering that she was disingenuous will only make things worse.</p>

<p><em>Shortly before I retired a few months ago, the company I worked for declined my offer to come back and work for them on contract, as needed. Now a coworker is calling me, from time to time, for professional advice.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not &#8220;where&#8217;s the X file&#8221; or &#8220;what&#8217;s the password&#8221; kind of advice. It&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8217;ve tried X, X, X, and X, and it still isn&#8217;t in spec. What would you do?&#8221; It took me 7 years of college in a math and science field, and over 30 years of highly specialized training and experience become an expert, and be able to answer such questions.</em></p>
<p><em>The days of corporate paternalism toward loyal, hard-working employees are long past, and after experiencing the change in corporate culture the last ten or so years, I do not feel especially generous to my old employer. I do value the friendship of the coworker making the call, however. The company downsized recently and there is too much work for too few workers. Getting him in hot water is the last thing I want to do.</em></p>
<p><em>Perhaps time to again offer the company my contract services, without telling them they&#8217;ve already been getting them?</em></p>
<p>Since they already turned down the idea, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll have more luck offering the company consulting this services this time, particularly if you don&#8217;t tell them that you&#8217;ve already been advising your former coworker. But I wouldn&#8217;t approach them and explain that you have been doing that, either, because you risk making the former coworker look a little bad in the process &#8212; the subtext being, &#8220;Joe can&#8217;t do his job without my help.&#8221; And if he&#8217;s just been asking you informally because he finds your perspective helpful, without thinking of it as consulting per se &#8212; which is likely &#8212; then you risk causing weirdness for him and tension in your relationship.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#8217;d say something directly to him. For instance: &#8220;You know, I&#8217;d be glad to set up a consulting arrangement to answer some of this stuff. Is that worth talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>If your coworker has any ability to pick up on cues, he&#8217;s going to understand that this means that without such an arrangement, he can&#8217;t keep coming to you for help. And if he doesn&#8217;t pick up on cues and he continues to ask, then you say directly, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to help, but at this point I think we probably need to set up a consulting contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll then either (a) stop bringing his questions to you or (b) make the case for a consulting contract to whoever would have to approve it. But prepared for the company not to go for that unless your former coworker really goes to bat for it and lays out a strong case for why it&#8217;s necessary. That&#8217;s because, while I&#8217;m sure you <em>are</em> making his job easier, businesses generally feel able to go on after someone leaves &#8212; while still being quite happy to accept their help for free if they&#8217;re offering it. In other words, be prepared for the fact that however helpful your former coworker finds talking to you, it still might not reach the level that would justify a consulting gig. Or it might &#8212; who knows.</p>
<p>But either way, you&#8217;ll have set up some boundaries and have made it clear that you aren&#8217;t going to be providing advice for free.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I got a PhD in medieval studies. Not exactly the most practical field, but I learned a lot about abstract thinking, analytical skills, and data mining. Transcribing and translating medieval Latin isn&#8217;t exactly easy, after all.</em></p>
<p><em>However, it took me over a year and a half to find a job in the private field. And what happened? I&#8217;ve excelled so much that, since I was hired, my entire department had its budget doubled, and my manager has credited me with most of our success.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not trying to brag, but I want to make a point: nowadays, if you have a degree in making green widgets, hiring managers will throw your application in the trash if the job is making brown widgets. This is simply messed up and stupid. The fact is that there are a lot of very intelligent, well-educated people who could easily do great jobs if they were given a chance.</em></p>
<p><em>So my question: why can&#8217;t managers appreciate transferrable skills and hire more very qualified, intelligent people?</em></p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re unproven, and you&#8217;re competing against candidates who <em>are</em> proven.</p>
<p>In this job market, there are tons of well-qualified candidates for nearly every opening. Employers have no incentive to take a risk on someone without a track record in what they&#8217;re looking for when they have plenty of good candidates who do have that track record.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like asking why you&#8217;d hire the smart, warm nanny applicant who has a track record of doing a good job taking care of kids over the smart, warm nanny applicant who has only cared for animals in the past. There are some transferable skills there &#8212; but you&#8217;re probably going to go with the person with the track record actually doing the work you&#8217;re hiring for, unless there&#8217;s something about the other person that really impresses you, enough to trump the experience issue. The other candidate might have turned out to be fantastic at the job &#8212; but you&#8217;d rather not let your kids be her testing ground.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s a question of smart, capable people with no direct experience but transferable skills against not-so-smart-or-capable people with direct experience. There are smart, capable people in both groups, so of course the smart, capable people with direct experience are the most attractive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hiring is in part about managing risk. You might decide in some extenuating circumstances to take a risk on someone untested, but it&#8217;s certainly no way to hire as a matter of general routine. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the people you&#8217;re rejecting would all have performed poorly; it just means that you&#8217;re going with the more certain option.</p>
<p>Now, none of this means that hiring managers never take a chance on people who are less tested. They do &#8212; you&#8217;re a prime example of that. But surely you can understand why that&#8217;s more the exception than the rule when employers have plenty of options, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I’ve been at the same company for nearly 12 years, and during that time, the company has nearly tripled in sales and number of employees. I started as basically a clerk and as the company grew, I eventually worked my way into a manager’s position with 6 employees in my department. My level of responsibility has steadily increased and I’ve continued my education and have obtained specific certifications for my field, raising the sophistication in the operation of my department. I feel that within a few years, I may be ready to move on beyond what the company can provide in terms of challenge and opportunity.</em></p>
<p><em>I have recently had some conversations with recruiters and other hiring types, and have been told that while longevity was once a good thing to have, these days potential employers could look at my length of time at the same company as a strike against me. They’re saying that someone could look at me and think that I’m either locked into my present company’s way of thinking and that could be hard to break, or that I’ve simply become stale, stuck in a rut, and will always be there. I think I’ve gotten to where I am in part because I’ve always challenged the current way of thinking, including my own sometimes, so this is definitely not the case with me. Is this a trend in hiring? If so, how would I address this when I do start searching?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a point where staying too long at one place can raise questions about how you’ll adapt to new environments. I can’t pinpoint exactly when that is — it’s somewhere more than 8 years but well before 20.</p>
<p>The worry is that you&#8217;ll be stuck in one company’s way of doing things, won’t have been exposed to a wider variety of practices and cultures, and thus won’t adapt easily. So anything you can do to demonstrate that’s not the case is helpful. Certainly being able to show a progression in responsibilities and job titles &#8212; as you can &#8212; is helpful, and you should think about what else you can use to demonstrate that you&#8217;re flexible, open to change, and don&#8217;t have an insular viewpoint.</p>
<p>And for anyone who&#8217;s now worrying about what this means for them, this isn&#8217;t necessarily a deal-breaker and it certainly doesn&#8217;t mean that you should leave a job you love before you want to &#8230; but you should be aware that it could be a potential concern for future employers, and balance it against other factors.</p>
<p>And this is <em>not</em> a license to engage in <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/02/06/are-you-a-job-hopper">job-hopping</a>, which is far, far more harmful to your ability to get the future jobs you want.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Can you submit mileage reimbursements for only a few dollars?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m filling out last month&#8217;s out of pocket expenses and find myself wanting to make several mileage reimbursement requests for a few dollars each. Normally I might have one or two requests a month for about $20 or $30, but last month I had to make several errand runs for work.</em></p>
<p><em>As a manager, would you see the low mileage reimbursement requests as petty? I hate to be seen as someone who nickels and dimes the company, but I&#8217;m short on money and get nickle and dimed a lot myself. I usually don&#8217;t request reimbursement for the 50 cents I stick into the parking meters when I have to park in the city. I also can&#8217;t request mileage reimbursement if I have to travel to our site that&#8217;s further away (because it&#8217;s considered a &#8220;normal&#8221; part of my job duties to work there several times a year.) That trip alone is 70 miles round trip extra than I normally commute and I didn&#8217;t understand that I wouldn&#8217;t get reimbursed when I took this job. I guess I feel like at least by requesting a few dollars here and there, I can make up some of the losses I take as part of work. But I don&#8217;t want to hurt my relationship with my boss or company to do so.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give it another thought. You spent the money on a work expense that they&#8217;ve told you they reimburse, so it&#8217;s fine to submit it. I wouldn&#8217;t question it at all if an employee submitted low mileage reimbursements like this.</p>
<p><strong>2. I regret making a counteroffer to an employee</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a manager of a team of four analysts in a small field office overseas. Recently, one of my staff received an outside offer at another company. I gave him a modest counteroffer, including an upgrade in title from analyst to senior analyst. While his work is decent, it is not outstanding, and I would have not promoted him under normal circumstances, although I would have considered it in the next 8-10 months. He does an equally OK job as to someone I would hire new, so I promoted him to retain him, not because of his performance.</em></p>
<p><em>So, I have read your posts on <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/09/why-you-shouldnt-use-counteroffers-to-prevent-employees-from-leaving.html">counteroffers</a>, and now have a related question. As predicted, the day after this person&#8217;s promotion, another staff came to me completely demotivated. She has worked at our organization in the same role for the same amount of time. While she does have some issues, when you get down to it, she does outperform the newly promoted staff. She came to me asking for clarity about how one actually gets promoted at our organization.</em></p>
<p><em>I regret making the counteroffer/promotion, and realize it was my mistake. However, now I am stuck with it. How do I deal? I am trying to manage the newly promoted person to perform better and live up to his new title. But, what messages do I give to the rightfully disgruntled staff? Obviously, I can&#8217;t take her aside and say, &#8220;Hey, I know your coworker is kind of crappy, but got another job offer and I didn&#8217;t want to hire somebody else, so tough luck!&#8221; How do I manage my way out of this one?</em></p>
<p>I wish I had an answer, but I don&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t really justify promoting someone whose work doesn&#8217;t merit it, or even justify trying to retain the person by other means if their work isn&#8217;t outstanding. And because there&#8217;s no justification, I can&#8217;t think of any way to explain this to the coworker or mollify her very understandable frustration. (And to make matters worse, you might end up losing the better employee because of the attempt to keep the worse employee.) This is a clusterfudge.</p>
<p><strong>3. Putting a school career day presentation on my resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I presented at a school career day as a representative of an organization that I volunteer with. Should I include this as an achievement on my resume? I don’t have any children that attend the school (I don’t have children at all) so this was not something that I had to do. I was honored to be asked to present (although I don’t feel I really have a career at the moment) and I think that I did a great job. What do you think? For background, I would like you to know that I didn’t just talk. I created an experiment and conducted it in front of the students. In one class, I had the students separated into groups and they did the experiments with the help of the teachers and my instructions.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s cool that you did it (and I am sort of obsessed with school career days), but it&#8217;s not really resume-worthy. It was a one-day (one hour, probably) thing without accompanying evaluation or accountability, so it doesn&#8217;t really meet the bar for a resume.</p>
<p><strong>4. Applying for a job when a friend works in the same department</strong></p>
<p><em>I am applying for a position for a company that I am totally excited about. I meet the qualifications for the position that I am applying for, and I feel like I would excel in the work environment that they project. A college friend whom I haven&#8217;t kept in much contact with (I&#8217;m only a few years out), has worked for the company for 3+ years in the department that I am applying for. What is the most appropriate way to request her help? Ideally, I would love her to put a word in for me. How do I approach this situation without being presumptuous that she would do so?</em></p>
<p>Email her and let her know that you applied for the position, and tell her that you&#8217;d love any advice that she has. You don&#8217;t need to ask her to put in a good word for you; most people will do that on their own if they think you&#8217;d be a good candidate, and asking for it directly can be awkward, since the subtext of &#8220;I&#8217;m applying for a job on your team&#8221; is generally going to be &#8220;and I&#8217;d like the job and would love your help.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Is it ever okay to call to follow up after an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m contemplating when and how to follow-up after a final interview I had with an organization on March 19. It was 2.5 hours of back-to-back interviews with 3 people, which I thought went quite well. Of course, I have debated that issue many times in my head since. The hiring manager said that she would get back to me by the that Friday, but didn&#8217;t seem 100% sure about that. I sent my thank-you&#8217;s, and one of the 3 people said that they had one more candidate to interview that week before making a decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Friday passed. The following Thursday I hadn&#8217;t heard anything yet, so (based on my findings on your site) I sent an email asking for a timeline update in the afternoon. Still no response. A friend told me that I should call &#8230; Is it ever ok to call? If I were to call, I think I should at least give them a week after I asked for the update.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a junior-level management position at a large non-profit. Technically it is a new position that they want to fill &#8220;immediately.&#8221; They are reorganizing the management to create a more effective team.</em></p>
<p>Well, here&#8217;s the thing: If they want to make you a job offer, they are going to contact you and do it. They&#8217;re not going to be dragging their feet and only remember when you call them. So calling is likely to result only in (a) another lack of response, (b) a vague response (&#8220;we&#8217;ll be in touch once we have a decision&#8221;), or (c) a rejection. And yes, a rejection would give you closure, but frankly, you&#8217;re better off giving yourself closure right now and mentally moving on, and letting it be a pleasant surprise if they do offer you the job. Trust that if they want to hire you, they&#8217;ll get in touch.</p>
<p><strong>6. Listing a childcare business on my resume when my field is accounting</strong></p>
<p><em>Several years ago, I had to quit a job because the child custody and child support legal battle got to be too much for me to handle as a professional accountant and mother. I took a 6-month break then to plan a childcare business, which thrived for about a 16 months. Although this is a break in my accounting experience, I proudly list it on my resume because (a) I need to account for the time and (b) it shows the entrepreneurship in me. A girlfriend says I should list the childcare business in a section captioned &#8220;Other Experience.&#8221; What is your advice?</em></p>
<p>I agree with her. I wouldn&#8217;t kick off your main experience section with it because it&#8217;s not what you want to most showcase, but an &#8220;other experience&#8221; section is perfect for it.</p>
<p><strong>7. Getting an MA while job-searching</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m getting conflicting advice about this from my friends, so wanted to get your opinion. I am in the process of job hunting, and I have been looking for about 3 months now and finally got my first phone interview coming up this week. I decided a few weeks ago to apply for my MA in intercultural and international communications, because I need a plan B. If finding a job is going to take me several months (perhaps even a year), I want to make good use of my time, and getting my MA has always been on my &#8220;don&#8217;t want to call it a bucket list-bucket list.&#8221; The university is in another province, but it is about 80% online. I would have to go to the campus for two weeks in September or October for the in-class portion of the program, and the following year I will be out of country for three weeks for the placement portion of the program. But other than that, I can do the coursework at home. Therefore, I can continue to do this even if I got a job, which is why this program works so well for me.</em></p>
<p><em>First, does studying for my MA help bridge the gap in my resume? I am currently unemployed and have been since the end of November. I recently moved back to the country which is the reason for my unemployment. I figure the longer it takes to find a job, the bigger the gap will be since my last job. Second, when in the interview process should I bring up the part about needing two weeks to attend university classes as part of my MA? Would this be a deal-breaker for most hiring managers? In my opinion, improving my education and skills will only benefit my employer, as this program compliments most of the positions I am applying for and matches well with my skill set.</em></p>
<p>Since the program is one that you&#8217;re arguing won&#8217;t interfere with full-time work, it&#8217;s not quite as good of a resume gap-filler as a traditional program would be &#8230; but it&#8217;s not nothing either, and you can certainly use it.</p>
<p>As for when to bring up the time you&#8217;ll need off, I&#8217;d wait until you have an offer and negotiate it then as part of your overall negotiations. The two weeks shouldn&#8217;t be a deal-breaker for most jobs (although you might need to take it unpaid if you don&#8217;t have enough vacation accrued by then). The three weeks next year will be more unusual for most jobs, so make sure that you include that as part of your negotiations too &#8212; you don&#8217;t want to find out next year that they won&#8217;t let you take three weeks at once.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m currently working for a company I&#8217;ve been with for nearly a decade. The positions I can promote to are very few and unlikely to be vacated anytime soon. I&#8217;ve been at my level now for 3+ years. It&#8217;s time to move on.</em></p>
<p><em>I interviewed with a promising young company (let&#8217;s call them PYC) this morning, and by lunchtime they reached out with an enthusiastic offer below my current base salary, which won&#8217;t work for me. I countered with a base salary match and indicated that if the upside was worth the risk (meaning a generous stack of options), we&#8217;d be a lot closer to a deal. PYC stressed that they&#8217;d get back to me by the end of the day with numbers so that I could proceed with giving two weeks notice right away, as they want someone to start ASAP.</em></p>
<p><em>To complicate things, I have more interviews with other companies this week &#8212; exciting, big time companies! &#8212; and while they&#8217;ll almost certainly come with higher pay, it&#8217;s doubtful they&#8217;ll match that critical risk/upside component. While both are important to me, this offer is putting me on the spot! If PYC offers a base salary match, the same amount of vacation, a title upgrade AND enough options to calm my nerves, is that a good offer, or am I jumping the gun? The rush is spooking me a little; it&#8217;s not the way I&#8217;m used to making decisions. Should I be rightfully spooked or is this just my decade of being off-market showing?</em></p>
<p><em>I think they&#8217;re going to be extremely successful. I want to be part of it, the folks I met today were great, and the ship appears to be in great shape.</em></p>
<p>There are really two separate questions here: Should you be spooked that they&#8217;re moving so quickly and pressuring you to as well, and can you slow them down?</p>
<p>First, should you be spooked? Maybe. There are certainly companies that move this quickly, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that people don&#8217;t end up happy there. But at a minimum, they&#8217;re probably not great at hiring if they&#8217;re offering people jobs only hours after interviewing them for the first time. (They&#8217;re almost certainly not checking references, for one thing, although maybe they had already talked informally with people who have worked with you.) And if they&#8217;re not great at hiring, that means that you&#8217;re probably going to have some less-than-great coworkers, unless they&#8217;re really good at cleaning up hiring mistakes quickly.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also assuming that <em>you</em> can and should make a decision as quickly as they have. But deciding where to work is a big, big decision, and they should want you to think it through and be absolutely sure that it&#8217;s right for you. The fact that they&#8217;re not thinking of it that way indicates that they&#8217;re either pretty inexperienced or not quite reasonable in their expectations. Those can both be bad, in different ways. If they&#8217;re inexperienced, what else haven&#8217;t they thought through or had experience dealing with yet, and how will that affect (a) their business and (b) your quality of life as an employee? (Are they experienced enough to make reliable revenue projections? Is your health insurance going to lapse because they&#8217;re clueless about what needs to be done to keep it current? And so forth.) Or, if they&#8217;re experienced enough but just not quite reasonable in what they expect of people, will their expectations be any more reasonable when it comes to things like time off, workload, etc.?</p>
<p>Now, despite what it might sound like, I&#8217;m not pre-judging this. This might be a great offer that you should be excited to take. But these are all things you want to think through without blinders on.</p>
<p>As for the second question &#8230; You should absolutely be able to slow them down. It&#8217;s entirely reasonable to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m really interested in joining you, and I&#8217;m excited about the position. However, I need some time to think over the offer and the position and make sure that it&#8217;s right for me. Can I give you my answer by Monday?&#8221; (And in the meantime, you should feel free to ask for an additional conversation if you have unanswered questions, which you probably do &#8212; or should &#8212; after only a single interview.)</p>
<p>They might be hesitant about waiting a full week, but they should at least give you a <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/06/how-long-should-employers-give-candidates-to-respond-to-a-job-offer.html">few days</a>. And if they push you for an answer faster than that, I&#8217;d consider that a much bigger red flag than the fast offer itself. They should want you to be sure about your decision &#8212; both for your own comfort and for theirs; people pressured to accept a job offer faster than they&#8217;re ready to are at high risk for reneging later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Many of my colleagues have an agreement with our boss that they can work from home on Fridays. All of them happen to be moms of young children. I am married but do not have children.</em></p>
<p><em>I am all for a flexible work environment, but I feel that they take advantage of the situation. They constantly post on Facebook that they are at karate tournaments, music class, etc. or tell team members they can&#8217;t participate in client calls because they have to pick up their kids at school. I realize I am not a parent so I don&#8217;t understand the balance or struggles of being a working mother, but I am expected to be in the office five days a week, while they essentially work four.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want to be the group tattle tale but it&#8217;s really starting to affect the morale of those who are childless when we see empty offices on Fridays. Thoughts on how to approach this, or do I just suck it up and deal with it?</em></p>
<p>Well, first, you want to make sure that you&#8217;re right that they&#8217;re not working much on their Fridays at home. It&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;re simply working flexible hours that day. For instance, if someone worked from 7-11, went to their kid&#8217;s karate tournament from 11-2, worked more from 2-4:30, and then put in another hour and half over the weekend, that would total eight hours of work.</p>
<p>And to some people, that&#8217;s the point of a flexible schedule and working from home: It allows you to fit life in, and schedule work around it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s entirely possible that that&#8217;s not how your coworkers are using the flexibility. Maybe they&#8217;re working 9-5 from home but taking tons of time off in the middle of the day that they never make up. But do you <em>know</em> that, or are you just assuming it?</p>
<p>And if you <em>do</em> know that they&#8217;re abusing it, then what you have is a management problem, because no good manager is going to neglect to notice that hmmm, the people who work from home on Fridays seem to produce less work than everyone else. That doesn&#8217;t make it any less frustrating &#8212; in fact, it makes it more frustrating &#8212; but it&#8217;s worth being clear that that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>Of course, the one thing that you do know for sure is that these coworkers are at least sometimes missing client calls on those days, and that&#8217;s potentially a legitimate issue. But even there, the question is how much that matters. Are they missing these calls more than someone else might miss them for occasional dentist appointments or other conflicts? And what&#8217;s the impact on their work?</p>
<p>If there <em>is</em> an impact and you&#8217;re concerned about it, then you should handle that just like you would any other concern with a coworker&#8217;s work that impacts you: First talk to the coworker, and then to your manager if the problem remains. In this case, that might mean saying to the coworker, &#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed you often can&#8217;t make client calls when we schedule them on Fridays, and I know that Client X really likes having you there. Is there a different time we can schedule them so you&#8217;re able to call in?&#8221; Or, depending on the situation, &#8220;I know there&#8217;s not much notice, but they&#8217;re usually in the afternoons. Is there a way for you to keep that time free?&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you remain concerned, then you&#8217;d talk to your manager, just as you would about anything else that was affecting your work. For instance: &#8220;I love that we have schedule flexibility, but I&#8217;m having trouble getting what I need on Fridays from people who are working at home and often can&#8217;t get people on client calls when I need them. I wonder if we could give people clearer guidelines on how accessible they should be when they&#8217;re working out of the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>But overall, you want to (a) keep the focus on the impact on your work, and (b) assume that if these are otherwise good coworkers with a strong work ethic, you have no reason to think they aren&#8217;t putting in a full day&#8217;s work even if it&#8217;s spread out in an untraditional way &#8212; unless you really know for sure that that isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>And last, I&#8217;m assuming that this benefit isn&#8217;t just offered to parents in your workplace, so there&#8217;s no reason you couldn&#8217;t responsibly take advantage of the flexibility too, if you want to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Mentioning that I&#8217;d take a more junior position</strong></p>
<p><em>I am in an interview process. Tomorrow morning, I have a second interview for a middle management position. I do not know how things will evolve. Meanwhile, the company advertised a position that involves less responsibilities &#8212; assistant manager. If I receive a NO for the manager position or feel that things are not going in the right direction, I am tempted to mention that I would be open for the less senior position. Any idea how I should approach them on this, and still look professional?</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t do this in the midst of an interview for the higher level position. If you don&#8217;t get that job, at that point you can mention that you&#8217;re interested in the more junior position &#8212; but if you mention while you&#8217;re being interviewed for the more senior role, you risk making yourself look like you&#8217;re not confident in your own skills. They&#8217;re giving you a second interview &#8212; they think you&#8217;re a viable candidate for this job, and so you should too.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do different companies compare notes on their candidates?</strong></p>
<p><em>During my latest job search, I came across a situation that made me uncomfortable. I had interviews with three different companies: Company A, then B, and lastly C. Company B gave me an offer the day before my interview with Company C. Talking to HR in Company A and C afterwards, they both knew I had an offer from Company B.</em></p>
<p><em>I would like to look for a job in a different state and use a recruiting agency to help, but I am concerned with my current company finding out in the same way the other companies did last time. Is this kind of &#8220;comparing notes&#8221; between HRs of different companies normal?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not especially common, but it can happen in particularly close-knit industries where all the players know each other. Generally, though, I&#8217;d assume it&#8217;s not happening.</p>
<p><strong>3. Being paid as a contractor when I&#8217;m treated as an employee</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently came across the following information in one of your blog posts: &#8220;Your employer can&#8217;t pay you as a contractor while treating you like an employee. If your employer controls when, where, and how you work, the government says you&#8217;re an employee—and your company needs to pay your payroll taxes and offer you the same benefits it offers to regular employees.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a federal law? Or does it vary by state? Where can I find this information outlined so I can show it to my employer? My employer takes advantage of me and my pay requirements, and although I work as an employee he gave me a 1099 for my salary this year. I think he should pay whatever I owe.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a federal law, although it&#8217;s commonly broken, and you can read about it <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-(Self-Employed)-or-Employee%3F  ">here</a>.</p>
<p>For whatever it&#8217;s worth, you don&#8217;t need to wait to be issued a tax form to find out how your employer is paying you; if taxes aren&#8217;t being taken out of your checks each pay period, you&#8217;re being paid as an independent contractor (legally or illegally).</p>
<p><strong>4. I&#8217;ve been promoted but don&#8217;t know what to do</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m 23 and have been working since I left school at 16. I&#8217;ve never had a sick day off work, I&#8217;m always 30 minutes early and the last one to leave. Finally after many years of hard work, a new project has come up at work and my manager and his business manager think I&#8217;m the perfect guy to help run the show. My promotion is leading me to run a team of six people, letting agreements, and marketing. Only problem is I know little about these subjects, but they really do think I&#8217;m the perfect person for the job. This has lead me to quite a few sleepless nights! It got worse today when the business manager asked me to help her write the job descriptions for the new positions, and it seemed like she was getting annoyed that I wasn&#8217;t putting much input in. I&#8217;ve been working so hard since I left school to reach a promotion like this and it&#8217;s my ticket to a successful career. But I really don&#8217;t know what to do, and don&#8217;t want to show them my weakness.</em></p>
<p>They promoted you for a reason, and since you&#8217;ve worked with them before, they have a pretty good idea of your skills. But it&#8217;s fine to admit when you don&#8217;t know something &#8212; in fact, the most confident people are usually the ones most willing to admit that, because it doesn&#8217;t threaten them. Why not go to your manager and ask for guidance in what you can do to get up to speed? If there are specific things you&#8217;re wondering about, ask about those too. Ask for help, and ask for feedback. That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll learn the new role &#8212; don&#8217;t feel you need to walk in already having it mastered.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I ask for a raise now that I have new responsibilities?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been at my current positon for a year and recieved the standard 3% pay increase this week. Since I&#8217;ve been at this company, I&#8217;ve taken on new responsibilities. It&#8217;s been a great learning curve and I feel that I&#8217;ve grown a lot in this role. I&#8217;m also working at stepping up my skills in areas where my manager and I mutually agree I can improve. Recently, I was asked to be the main coordinator in an area where I&#8217;ve only had a supporting role before &#8212; that is, I&#8217;m responsible for tasks that I was only assisting with before. Right now I feel a bit shaky in this area as I&#8217;m learning the ropes, but I know I&#8217;m capable of doing an excellent job once I get the hang of it. I&#8217;m writing to ask, would you advise on asking for a higher raise at this point, or do you believe I would be in a better position to do so once I&#8217;ve demonstrated more value to the company through handling my new tasks?</em></p>
<p>You just got a raise. You need to demonstrate that you can excel at your new responsibilities &#8212; and that you&#8217;ve addressed the areas where you and your manager agreed you&#8217;d improve &#8212; before you ask for another one.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can I reopen salary negotiations after starting work?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been doing some consulting work for a company a few hours a week from home. A couple months ago, they let me know about an opening for a different, but related position in their office. As we went through the hiring process there was talk about rolling my consulting duties into this new job, but nothing concrete was decided on. The new job doesn&#8217;t require an extra credential that I have, and that is reflected in the salary. I was still interested because of the potential to get full time employment and benefits with this company.</em></p>
<p><em>I figured that if I was offered the job, we would go over the details of how to handle my consulting work and I would negotiate a rate increase if they wanted to roll those duties into the new job. However, when I got the packet to look over, it was an acceptance packet with a start date and nothing to sign or negotiate. I missed my offer negotiation and went straight from interview to acceptance!</em></p>
<p><em>I started the job two weeks ago and while I haven&#8217;t been doing the duties from when I was consulting, last week my manager mentioned that I would be able to start doing those tasks again and that it&#8217;s no big deal because they could fall into &#8220;other duties as assigned.&#8221; I want to do the work that I had been doing as a consultant, but I want to be paid for that specialized skill. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say it&#8217;s part of &#8220;other duties&#8221; because if they had hired someone who didn&#8217;t have my background that person wouldn&#8217;t be able to do it. </em><em>Do I have any leverage to say that I won&#8217;t do it until we&#8217;ve agreed on a rate for adding those duties? Please help me fix this, I&#8217;ve neglected my growth opportunities for so long and just started reading your blog and want to get my career on track!</em></p>
<p>First, you guys need to stop accepting job offers without negotiating just because the employer doesn&#8217;t proactively offer you a chance to negotiate. You can still bring up salary yourself.</p>
<p>However, at this point, you&#8217;ve missed your window of opportunity; you&#8217;ve already accepted the job at the rate they offered. I also wouldn&#8217;t try to ask for more now based on the fact that the new job includes your consulting work. First, they&#8217;d already mentioned previously that they might roll that into the position so they&#8217;re not springing this on you out of nowhere &#8230; and second, the fact that you could do this stuff is probably part of the reason they hired you and not someone else. You don&#8217;t really have standing to go back and negotiate now. The time to do that was when the offer was made, and you can&#8217;t do it weeks later.</p>
<p><strong>7. Employer said a letter is in the mail</strong></p>
<p><em>I had an interview for a secretary position 12 days ago. I called yesterday to see if the position had been filled and was asked if I received a letter in the mail. When I said no, the interviewer said she couldn&#8217;t tell me anything until I get the letter in the mail. I&#8217;m assuming this means I didn&#8217;t get the job, but wanted to know what your thoughts were on this. Is there any chance it could be a good thing? The position was with the State of TN Dept of Human Services office. They interviewed several people and said we would be notified when the position was filled. I assumed it would be by email because that&#8217;s my preferred method of contact.</em></p>
<p>It probably means that you didn&#8217;t get the job, but with government hiring, who knows. It&#8217;s entirely possible that they deliver job offers by putting them in bottles and throwing them into the ocean.</p>

<p><em>I just had a terrific second interview interview and was verbally offered a job yesterday, and I am over the moon about it. It&#8217;s a huge jump in title and salary. The CEO said, pending my reference checks, I will have the offer in writing on Friday. They are small and scrappy, and they need me to start as soon as I can, so I said I would give notice two weeks after I have the offer in writing.</em></p>
<p><em>However, the organization I work with now (another lovely nonprofit, but very large and resource-rich) is sending me to a three day conference on Sunday &#8212; flight, hotel, the whole nine yards. My boss will be at the conference too &#8212; and she&#8217;s not a very positive person to be around as it is. She has a mean vindictive streak, which is part of why I am so excited about moving on.</em></p>
<p><em>How should I handle this? I don&#8217;t want to ruin both of our conference experiences by giving notice on Friday and then enduring awkwardness, and I don&#8217;t want to look like a jerk who purposefully planned a free conference out of this and then gave notice on my first day back. (It was a total coincidence &#8212; this organization even recruited me, I wasn&#8217;t job hunting!) Should I back out of the conference altogether? The fees/hotel/airfare are all paid and non-refundable, nor are they transferable, so it&#8217;s not like I could send someone else in my stead.</em></p>
<p><em>I have great relationships with the whole team at my current organization, except my boss. I want to do the right thing here. What do you recommend?</em></p>
<p>Talk to her your manager and give your notice on Friday, after you have the written offer (and have accepted it). Tell her that you will do whatever she prefers regarding the conference &#8212; go or not go, whatever she thinks makes the most sense.</p>
<p>From there, it&#8217;s up to her. You&#8217;ll have been open and transparent and willing to do what the organization prefers. And some job offers just aren&#8217;t perfectly timed; reasonable people understand that.</p>
<p>That said, if you&#8217;d really rather not attend the conference now and you don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any benefit to the organization for you attending since you&#8217;re leaving, it&#8217;s fine to push the scales a little in that direction, by saying something like, &#8220;I realize that it won&#8217;t be very useful to the organization to send me to the conference now, so I could stay home but see if I can negotiate refunds for us from the hotel and the conference.&#8221; (You have better chances of succeeding at refunds with those two, even if they&#8217;re allegedly non-refundable, than with the airline tickets.) And even if you can&#8217;t get any refunds, not going will still save the organization some money &#8212; your meals, cabs, etc. So it&#8217;s worth offering.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t wait until you&#8217;re back. Be transparent, give the organization as much notice as you can, and let them decide how they want to handle this.</p>
