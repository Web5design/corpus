				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Thank you very much for being a sounding board. My wife has been working at her current position for over five years in an A/R and HR capacity. However, she isn&#8217;t trained in this, and she has a master&#8217;s degree in an unrelated field that is actually the primary focus of the company. Because she is hard working and competent, however, her boss refuses to see her as a fit for positions within the company that she is actually trained in. She has stated her desire to move into this other arena, but so far it has fallen on deaf ears. I&#8217;m afraid that as an owner/manager, he sees her as a cog that is keeping the wheels turning, and that&#8217;s all he really cares about, especially since her position has seen a lot of turnover in the past.</em></p>
<p><em>As her husband, I want to see her happy, and she is not. She is incredibly intelligent and very gifted, and it bothers me greatly that she isn&#8217;t working in the arena that she is trained for. At this late stage, I would like to write a letter to her boss on her behalf, but I don&#8217;t want to jeopardize her job. Is this a bad idea? I just want to help if I can, but I don&#8217;t want to make the situation worse for her either.</em></p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, no. Do not do this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very sweet that you want to help your wife, and of course you&#8217;re frustrated to see her unhappy, and maybe you&#8217;re additionally frustrated if you feel that she&#8217;s not doing or saying the things that could improve the situation. But reaching out to her employer yourself will not help, and it will absolutely hurt.</p>
<p>You will make your wife look like she can&#8217;t handle her own career. She is a professional adult, and these are her battles to fight (if indeed it even needs to be fought at all; she may simply need to change jobs). There&#8217;s just no possible scenario where it would be appropriate for you to ask her employer for anything on her behalf (aside from time off if she&#8217;s in the hospital and unable to call them herself), let alone a change in job responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you reach out on her behalf, you&#8217;ll be effectively ruining her reputation at this company, as well as with anyone they speak with about her in the future. This is a story that would get told and re-told, believe me, and she will forever be the person whose husband asked her boss to give her more interesting job duties.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s no way she&#8217;ll get what she wants from this company after this. No sane manager is going to respect her or see her as someone they want to retain once this happens. Employers deal with employees, not their spouses, parents, or children. Their relationship is with her, not her family.</p>
<p>But what you <em>can</em> to is to support your wife in handling this on her own. Talk through options with her, point her to sources of advice if she wants them, encourage her to explore other jobs if she&#8217;s not finding what she wants at her current one, and generally be a supportive sounding board.</p>
<p>And frankly, it&#8217;s also probably worth thinking through why you think that you&#8217;d be a more effective advocate for your wife than she would be for herself, to the point that you&#8217;re seriously considering interfering in her professional dealings. Do you not trust her to speak up for herself effectively? Do you see her as less capable than you? It&#8217;s not crazy to think that you might be better at this kind of thing than she is &#8212; that happens in couples &#8212; but you can&#8217;t respond to that by infantilizing her. You&#8217;ve got to find a different approach there.</p>
<p>Those are all constructive things to think about and talk about. But she needs to handle her own career, and you need to stay far, far away from her boss!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I am beginning to feel very frustrated with the nonprofit organization that I have been interning for the past six months.</em></p>
<p><em>My internship is supposed to end this Friday and the organization does not allow for internships to last more than six months. This January, I was told about a new part-time position opening up in the department I&#8217;ve been working in and was highly encouraged by the acting director to apply. The idea of hiring someone was thrown around a couple times in December, so I was really excited for the prospect of turning the internship into a job! The acting director gave me the job posting before it was made available to the public, which was extremely kind of her to give me the heads up. I was told that the organization has rules on promoting from inside and that the department needs to follow protocol to interview others outside of the organization.</em></p>
<p><em>The posting was finally made available sometime middle-to-end of February. I had followed up with the acting director a couple days after the submission of my application to see if she had gotten my resume and cover letter through email, because I figured I didn&#8217;t want to pester her in person. She came to me in person and reassured that I would get an interview soon. Finally, I received an email of my interview schedule the second week of March. I had the interview last Wednesday and everything went smoothly and was told that I will hear back latest by on Tuesday of this week.</em></p>
<p><em>I work there from Wednesday to Friday. Yesterday (Wednesday), I went into the office with the intention of asking about the hiring decision. As usual, everyone in the department was swamped with work (and so was I), so I didn&#8217;t have the chance to ask. The department is obviously understaffed, and they really need my help. I am continuously given the most tedious and silliest grunt work without pay. I didn&#8217;t mind it so much until recently because of the long time it took for them to interview me.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t make the hiring decision sooner. What frustrates me even more is that they had hired an paid intern for a more specific program in the department two weeks ago (I&#8217;m more of the general department intern). Now that there&#8217;s a paid intern, I feel like I am being undervalued for the amount of work I do and effort I put in. And often times, my supervisor gives me very short notice to complete projects because she was given a very short time by the people who she&#8217;s working with.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t know if their intentions are. Do they think it&#8217;s okay to wait until the end of my internship, which is this week, to hire me? The job description stated that the position is temporary, lasting from February to June. February is over, and March is soon to be, too. I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I&#8217;ve put in in the last six months and I am still unpaid! I understand everyone&#8217;s very busy with their work, but does it take that long to make this hiring decision? How should I handle this situation?</em></p>
<p>The problem here is that you&#8217;re assuming that they should make a hiring decision along your timeline, rather than on theirs, and that&#8217;s not how hiring works.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things that can make hiring <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/09/21/why-is-it-taking-so-long-to-hear-back-after-your-job-interview">take a long time</a>: assuring that the funding for the position will be available, resolving questions about whether the funding should go to this position or somewhere else, dealing with higher priorities that come up, interviewing candidates and checking references, waiting for decision-makers to be in town, and much more. (And wouldn&#8217;t you rather have them wait until they&#8217;re confident the position is fully funded than to hire you and lay you off in two months?)</p>
<p>The timeline for filling the position is going to be determined by what makes sense on their side, and how it fits in with other work they need to juggle. It&#8217;s not going to be determined by when you&#8217;d like it to be done. It might take far longer than what you were originally told; that&#8217;s normal. It might stall; that&#8217;s normal. It might get pushed aside because other things are more important to them right now; that&#8217;s also normal.</p>
<p>Moreover, it sounds like you&#8217;re thinking that the job is yours if only they&#8217;d hurry up and offer it to you, but there&#8217;s no guarantee that they&#8217;re going to hire you at the end of this. You were one of a group of candidates who was interviewed. It&#8217;s possible that the job will go to someone else.</p>
<p>You are sounding as if you feel oddly entitled to something that you&#8217;re not really entitled to. That has the potential to make you unhappy in a couple of different ways: If you really believe that you&#8217;re entitled to this stuff, you will be frustrated and unhappy when others don&#8217;t give it to you. And if it shows in your attitude at work, it will impact your reputation (and maybe their interest in hiring you).</p>
<p>I understand that you&#8217;re feeling resentful because you&#8217;ve been working all this time unpaid, but &#8230;. you agreed to that when you took the internship. They&#8217;re under no obligation to hire you, they haven&#8217;t made any promises to hire you, and you knew you were signing up for an unpaid role when you took the job. It&#8217;s not reasonable to be resentful that they haven&#8217;t converted you to a paid position. It&#8217;s not reasonable to be resentful when people don&#8217;t give you something they never promised you.</p>
<p>As for what you can do, go talk to the person in charge of hiring. Say that with your internship ending tomorrow, you&#8217;d love to get a sense of their timeline for making a decision, and whether you&#8217;re a finalist for the job or not. But that&#8217;s all you can do &#8212; you can&#8217;t push them to move any faster, and you can&#8217;t even reasonably <em>expect</em> them to move any faster.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you haven&#8217;t been counting on this position coming through and you&#8217;ve been conducting an active job search over the past few months. If you haven&#8217;t been, start that immediately and move on mentally from the idea of this position. If you end up getting it, it will be a pleasant surprise. If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be focused on a job search elsewhere anyway.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. My new job just reposted an ad for my position</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently got a new job and have been working there for a week. It&#8217;s a copywriting position, and I was hired to replace another recent hire whose work was not up to par. This company puts new employees on a 90-day probationary/trial period to start and then evaluates their work and determines whether to offer them full employment.</em></p>
<p><em>After a week on the job, I feel reasonably confident that things are going well. I&#8217;ve always had strong writing skills, and my superiors have told me directly that I&#8217;m doing a good job and am picking up on things quickly. Yesterday, however, I happened to notice that the listing for this job had been reposted online that same day. It&#8217;s the exact same ad that I answered to get an interview and this job. What does/could this mean? Should I be worried?</em></p>
<p>Speculating won&#8217;t do you any good, because it could be something as innocuous as someone in HR automatically refreshing the ad by mistake. Rather than worrying without really knowing, ask your manager. Say, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the ad for my position was reposted today, and it made me a little anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>2. Explaining flushing at work (no, not that kind)</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m trying to figure out the best way to handle a situation that I know will come up at my new job. I’m on a medicine right now – a necessary one, can’t be substituted – that has a side effect of causing fairly severe intermittent (so it comes and goes) flushing on my face and neck. And I have really pale skin, so it’s quite obvious. I’m concerned that it will be perceived as me being nervous or shy, and that will have a negative effect on my reputation and relationships at work. The flushing occurs in a whole variety of situations that are both high and low pressure.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m working on my ability to control this through mental tricks and maybe I&#8217;ll try out biofeedback, but I think there’s a limit to how much I can really control this, given that it’s happening due to the medicine. If someone were to ask me about it, I think I’d be fine with saying something casually like, “oh, thanks for checking, I’m on a great preventative medicine for headaches that has that unfortunate side effect – but I’ll take fewer headaches any day!” What I don’t know is how to handle people who just watch me and make assumptions. Maybe I can’t do anything about that, and they’ll just think what they think. I’d like there to be something I can do, though! I’d really appreciate any suggestions.</em></p>
<p>Can you feel when it&#8217;s happening? If so, I&#8217;d just say something in the moment: &#8220;I think I feel myself flushing &#8212; don&#8217;t be alarmed; I&#8217;m on a headache medicine that causes that sometimes.&#8221; If you can&#8217;t tell when it&#8217;s happening, then why not just mention something to your new manager after you start? You could say something like, &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m taking a headache medicine that&#8217;s been causing me to flush at random times. I don&#8217;t want you to think it&#8217;s a stress reaction, so I wanted to warn you ahead of time.&#8221; Your manager can then correct anyone who might comment on it.</p>
<p>To be clear, you don&#8217;t have to do this &#8212; but because it&#8217;s bothering you, it might give you peace of mind to say something.</p>
<p><strong>3. Why can&#8217;t I get promoted?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been passed over for a promotion twice in the six years of working in the same department, and three times for positions outside of my department. I have gotten my MBA, taken additional training, and am in the process of planning an event for a staff of 50. No one has any complaints about my work to my knowledge, and I was one of the top two for a promotion out of 250 applicants. I did ask the hiring manager what it was that I could do to improve myself for the future and he said &#8220;nothing, it was just one of those things.&#8221; Any suggestions?</em></p>
<p>You might need to go somewhere else to get a higher-level job. Your company isn&#8217;t necessarily sending you a signal that they don&#8217;t plan to promote you (it&#8217;s possible that there were simply better candidates each time), but (a) they should sure as hell be giving you some feedback on how to better position yourself at this point, and (b) after six years there, there&#8217;s no reason not to be looking at all your options if you&#8217;d like to move up.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can HR share candidates&#8217; information with a competing candidate?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it ethical for a person in HR to divulge a candidate&#8217;s information to a competing candidate, specifically give that person your LinkdIn information? This recently happened to me.</em></p>
<p><em>I interviewed for a position and found out it was awarded to someone else on the inside when that person, who I didn&#8217;t know from Adam, went on my LinkdIn profile announcing she had the job. There was no way she could&#8217;ve known who I was or that I had also interviewed for the job unless someone on the inside gave her my information (unless she somehow was able to sneak a peek at the competition). Why would someone do this? I am very disheartened and feel my privacy was invaded. Am I overreacting? I mean, this doesn&#8217;t seem ethical to me at all.</em></p>
<p>Are you sure that&#8217;s what happened? An internal candidate posting gloating messages on external job candidates&#8217; LinkedIn pages seems pretty out there, and I wonder if there&#8217;s some more innocent interpretation. In any case, though, I&#8217;d just let it go and not be terribly disheartened &#8212; there&#8217;s no real privacy violation if she works for the company where you applied (since you have to assume when you apply to a company that anyone who works there could become privy to it); it&#8217;s just bizarre and not worth stewing over.</p>
<p><strong>5. I&#8217;m being made to sit in a painful chair</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a full-time employee for a very large national company. That company holds a government contract that I work on. Recently the government agency we are contracted with had new chairs brought in for our entire office, though no ergonomic study was done beforehand that I am aware of. At over 6’6”, I am a very large parson and my shoulder blades literally rest on the top of this hard plastic and mesh chair back. The lumbar support is also not adjustable so it does not feel right. This causes both lower back and shoulder pain that I have never experienced before. The day after I was forced to sit in these chairs I woke up with continued back and shoulder pain even though it had been 12 hours after I had last sat in the chairs.</em></p>
<p><em>After talking to my manager, they told me I had no other option but to get a doctor’s note. I made the next available appointment and went. They accepted my note and I got a new chair that, while not perfect, was 100% better than my current chair. But after only a week, I was told that I and anyone else who had a different chair due to a doctor’s note would have to give up their chair because the government contractor didn’t like that the chairs weren’t all the same. I was told that I would need another doctor’s note with more exact specifications or I would not be able to get a different chair. I feel that even if I bring in a note with the exact make and model of chair I need, I will still be sitting in these painful chairs for the rest of my time at this contract. My manager, I, and even my doctor don’t know what to do. What would you suggest as a next course of action for something like this?</em></p>
<p>Go back and get the more specific note that they&#8217;re asking for. Yes, it&#8217;s a pain in the ass, and yes, it&#8217;s ridiculous that they&#8217;re micromanaging what chairs you sit in, and yes, it&#8217;s even more ridiculous that they&#8217;re requiring this extra documentation, but they are. So get it, and hopefully put an end to it.</p>
<p><strong>6. Termination if company ceases to exist</strong></p>
<p><em>After two years of active job searching (unemployed), I have finally landed a job offer. Love the company&#8217;s culture (small company in terms of staff, but moderate size in terms of capitalization).</em></p>
<p><em>However, I am a little unsure of how to interpret the following paragraph in the offer letter: &#8220;Your employment with the company will be as a regular employee, subject to your successful completion of a six-month probation period, at which point your salary will be reviewed. However, should the company cease to exist, for whatever reason at any time, your employment may then terminate on simple notice as per the company’s policy.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>So, as I understand this, any possible future termination would be swift, with no notice or severance package, regardless of the amount of time employed with them? I can&#8217;t imagine a 15 or 20-year employee being treated in this way. I know that in Canada, an employer must at least pay vacation pay if not taken at the time of termination. Is there any way that I can protect myself from being booted out should the company &#8220;cease to exist&#8221;? Can I try to negotiate this clause in some way (doubt it)?</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t advise on what protections might be available to you in Canada or about anything related to Canada for that matter, but it&#8217;s pretty normal that if a company ceases to exist, it might not be paying severance. I&#8217;d point out, though, that this language isn&#8217;t saying that you&#8217;d have no notice; it&#8217;s saying that you&#8217;d have notice per the company&#8217;s policy &#8212; so to find out how much notice that is, you&#8217;d want to look at the relevant policy.</p>
<p>Overall, though, this doesn&#8217;t alarm me too much. It&#8217;s what would happen in lots of cases; they&#8217;re just telling you in advance. (Maybe because Canada requires it? Who knows what goes on up there.)</p>
<p><strong>7. I put the wrong phone number on my resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently realised I made an ridiculous mistake on my resume &#8212; my phone number had the wrong area code. In Toronto, where I live, there are two area codes and I inadvertently switched them &#8212; the last 7 digits were correct though. I know how important it is to have my resume perfect and am furious at myself for the mistake. However, in all of my cover letters (in the body of the email application) my phone number is correct. Would employers who were potentially trying to contact me have given up/passed upon reaching the wrong number, or would they have contacted me by email instead?</em></p>
<p><em>Do you think I should re-send emails for potential applications to inform of the mistake? Or will this look worse for pointing out a glaring mistake?</em></p>
<p>Some employers contact people by phone and some by email, so there&#8217;s really no way to know if someone has tried to reach you and given up. I&#8217;d err on the side of a follow-up email with a correction. It&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s better than letting the mistake go unfixed and possibly missing phone calls. (I should note, though, that even a follow-up may not fix the problem, because it won&#8217;t be attached to your resume itself &#8212; but it&#8217;s your best bet.)</p>

<p><em>My granddaughter has just received a new contract of employment. She works part time as a waitress in a local pub/restaurant. I am concerned about a clause in it that reads: &#8220;You agree that in the event of termination of your employment, you will not have any involvement with any other licensed premises within a three-mile radius for a minimum of two years.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Can this be enforced on her? She is looking to work part-time in another restaurant nearer to our home and only 2 miles from where she is now working.</em></p>
<p>Where on earth is your granddaughter working that a restaurant is using contracts with employees, let along bothering with a non-compete clause?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very rare in the U.S. for employees to have contracts at all, and even rarer for waitresses.</p>
<p>In any case, the non-compete clause probably isn&#8217;t enforceable, because courts generally rule that the employer must show that the restriction is reasonable and necessary to protect them against unfair competition. That&#8217;s unlikely to apply to a waitress. Additionally, if she was already working there when she was asked to sign this contract &#8211; as opposed to the contract being presented as something she needed to sign before she can be hired &#8212; then most courts will invalidate the agreement because there was no &#8220;consideration&#8221; to her for signing it (meaning some payment or other benefit to her).</p>
<p>Your granddaughter should ask her manager why they&#8217;re asking this of her, and why they&#8217;d object to her waitressing somewhere else in the future. And if the manager holds firm, then she&#8217;ll need to decide whether she wants to take a stand, or just sign it with the intent of ignoring it and assuming it&#8217;s unenforceable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been working for the same company for about 3.5 years now, but a year and a half ago I was promoted to a more interesting, more lucrative position. This job is still at the assistant level, but I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to be working under a woman who has been very kind, generous, and helpful. She has really been more of a mentor than a boss. She has given me opportunities to try things that were above my pay grade, and I&#8217;m proud to say that I&#8217;ve really flourished in the role. I get things done well, on time, and under budget.</em></p>
<p><em>But then I had a meeting with the executives about a week ago. My mentor and I have contracts that are up for renewal at the end of the month, and they told me in this meeting that they&#8217;re so impressed with how I&#8217;ve grown in the position (and they said they&#8217;re concerned about my mentor&#8217;s performance) that they&#8217;re seriously considering giving me her job and only hiring her back at part-time &#8230; or possibly not at all.</em></p>
<p><em>So &#8230; do I mention this to my mentor? She is my friend and my confidante, but since everything said in this meeting was vague and nothing official was offered, I feel uneasy saying anything at all. Plus what if the execs change their minds? They said they were going to have a meeting with my mentor, but it&#8217;s been over a week and nothing has been scheduled.</em></p>
<p><em>WHAT DO I DO?! Do I warn her? Do I sit tight? And if they offer me the job, do I take it? It would be a huge step up for my career, but I don&#8217;t want to burn a bridge with my mentor.</em></p>
<p>They put you in a tough position by sharing their thoughts with you before they&#8217;ve made any decisions. And if they end up keeping her after all, you&#8217;ll now know things you probably shouldn&#8217;t really know about your boss (the performance problems and how close she came to losing her job). Plus, they&#8217;ve risked you getting your hopes up about getting promoted, which really isn&#8217;t a smart thing for them to do in case it falls through &#8230; unless they&#8217;re actually already planning on all of this and only presented it as a &#8220;maybe&#8221; to you to test the waters and gauge your interest.</p>
<p>In any case &#8230; It doesn&#8217;t sound like you have permission to share what you were told with your mentor. It sounds like you were told in confidence and you&#8217;re expected to keep it private. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;re bound by that, of course; you could still decide to tell her. But you&#8217;d need to be aware that you&#8217;d be breaking a confidence and possibly harming your own prospects with your employer, because if they find out you shared this with her, they&#8217;re likely to question your ability to be discreet with information in the future (which is usually a huge strike against someone when they&#8217;re being considered for a management role, now or in the future). And you might think that it&#8217;s unlikely that it will get back to them, but if your manager feels compelled to talk to them about what she learns from you, you probably won&#8217;t be able to contain it.</p>
<p>So whether or not to tell comes down in part to whether you value your relationship with your mentor over your own career prospects with this company, and in part to how seriously you take confidences that are shared with you in the expectation that you&#8217;ll keep them to yourself.</p>
<p>If it sounds like I&#8217;m pushing you toward the path of not sharing it &#8230; I am. That&#8217;s because part of having a job is handling sensitive information discreetly and not sharing things that it&#8217;s clear the people who sign your paychecks didn&#8217;t mean for you to share, even <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2009/07/should-i-warn-my-friend-hes-about-to-be.html">when it&#8217;s hard</a>.</p>
<p>As for whether to take the job if it&#8217;s offered to you, would you accept it if you didn&#8217;t feel it was being taken &#8220;from&#8221; your mentor? If so, a good mentor wouldn&#8217;t want you to turn it down. She might feel weird about it, but she wouldn&#8217;t expect you to say no simply as an act of solidarity with her. And if she did, then she&#8217;s not much of a mentor.</p>
<p>(Also, keep in mind that you&#8217;re not taking the job from her; she&#8217;s being removed from the job because of performance concerns. You&#8217;re not lobbying to steal her job away; you&#8217;re a bystander.)</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just an abstract argument. If despite this you&#8217;d feel like a traitor or won&#8217;t be able to sleep soundly at night if you accept the job, then it&#8217;s your prerogative to decide that it&#8217;s not for you. You&#8217;re allowed to turn down a promotion, although doing it can sometimes limit you in undesirable ways in your present company. But you&#8217;re still allowed to.</p>
<p>(However, keep in mind that turning the job down might not preserve your mentor&#8217;s job; it might mean that your company brings in someone else instead.)</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an easy situation. As you sort through it, keep in mind that the business conventions governing these situations are different than social/friendship conventions, but remember too that it&#8217;s fine to make the decision based on what you can live with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. I&#8217;m quitting, but my employer wants me to stay on to finish a project</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been reading your blog for about two years. Your advice helped me land my current position, and guided me through finding a new position which I officially accepted last week. I turned in my two weeks notice on Wednesday, and on Thursday my boss asked me to stay on to finish my current project (through June 30). I spoke with my boss and HR in a meeting on Friday where they said they&#8217;d like to break down my current salaried pay into an hourly figure and pay me as an hourly, part-time employee. I told them I&#8217;d feel more comfortable terminating my employment and becoming a contractor, creating objectives and being paid a lump sum for finishing the project.</em></p>
<p><em>I should note that I&#8217;m leaving because my boss is a complete jerk. He became my boss midway through this project and I&#8217;ve been miserable ever since. He&#8217;s very much a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; and take credit for everyone else&#8217;s work-type of leader. I don&#8217;t want to continue to be under his constant control. I would love to see this project through &#8212; but how do I get my old employer to see that letting me become a contractor is the way to go? I can do everything I was doing from home, in the evenings or weekends. My new job is 4 10-hour days, so, yes, I could come in on Fridays but I don&#8217;t want to. My boss has already said how appreciative he is of me staying on board to wrap this up &#8212; I want to but not on their terms. Any advice?</em></p>
<p>Frankly, I&#8217;d urge you to seriously consider <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/08/my-boss-wants-me-to-do-contract-work-after-i-move-to-a-new-job.html">not doing it at all</a>. You need to have all your focus on your new job, and not deal with the distractions (and apparently serious hassles) of the old. You&#8217;re finally getting away from your horrible boss &#8212; why drag out the relationship instead of having a clean break?</p>
<p>But if you still want to do it, then just lay out the terms that you&#8217;re willing to do it on: You&#8217;ll do it as a contractor, working from home. If they refuse, then walk away. They can&#8217;t make you do it, and whatever desire you have to see out your project is going to fade dramatically after a week or two at your new job, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>2. Interviewer asked me to call her, but I can&#8217;t reach her</strong></p>
<p><em>Two days ago, I had a phone interview that apparently went very well. The woman I interviewed with stated she would get back to me in about a week about the next steps in the hiring process. Later that day, I sent her a thank you email and expressed my continued interest in the position. She emailed back right away and stated she had a great time talking to me and wanting to schedule an in-person interview. Her instructions stated to call her when I had a moment to schedule an in-person interview. Instantly, I called her and had to leave a voicemail. I thought I would hear back from her in a business day, but I have not. I do not want to bug her with numerous phone calls and emails (especially, since her instructions ask that I call her). How long would you suggest I wait to contact her again and in what form?</em></p>
<p>Wait two business days from your last call and call again. It&#8217;s also fine to send a response to her email letting her know that you weren&#8217;t able to reach her and asking her to call whenever it&#8217;s most convenient for her (just as you&#8217;d probably do with any other business contact &#8212; no need to treat this one more gingerly just because it&#8217;s for an interview).</p>
<p><strong>3. When you don&#8217;t know a candidate&#8217;s sex ahead of time</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a issue that&#8217;s arisen a few times in the past few weeks. I&#8217;m working in HR/hiring right now, and the company I&#8217;m working for is going through a rapid expansion &#8212; tons of interviews and new hires happening. There have been a handful of candidates invited for interviews where we can&#8217;t tell the gender of the person beforehand through email/resume screens. It&#8217;s not a major problem &#8212; it&#8217;s just disconcerting to the interviewers when they were expecting a male voice and instead hear a female. This mostly has happened with gender-neutral or &#8220;unique&#8221; names. What are your thoughts on this? I don&#8217;t want to presume to assign a sex to a person, but I also want to prep my coworkers adequately!</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say to let your coworkers deal with it and not worry about prepping them. First, there&#8217;s really no way that you can (I mean, I suppose you could try Googling the person to see if there&#8217;s something out there that would tell you, but &#8230; is it really worth the trouble?), and second, it really shouldn&#8217;t matter. I suppose that if it&#8217;s a gender-neutral name, you could note for the interviewer that you&#8217;re not sure if the candidate is a man or a woman, but it raises the question of why people need to know. I do know that you&#8217;re not saying that it&#8217;s important info, but just that it can be a little weird to hear a very different voice than what you were expecting. But your colleagues should be able to take the mild surprise of realizing they got it wrong and should be able to recover immediately. (If they can&#8217;t, though, that&#8217;s a different issue.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Taking time off to study for a professional exam</strong></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s been a month now since I was &#8220;let go&#8221; from a temp assignment. I went through my ups and downs and tried looking for work again. I started looking at the bigger picture of the career goals I want to achieve and have formulated a plan. The first step is taking a professional exam. I also finally feel like I&#8217;m in a position to relax and take the time off from the stress of looking for work.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve learned the hard way that multitasking isn&#8217;t my strong suit. So I want ot take time off from working to study for the exam. I&#8217;m just wondering, how would this look to future employers? That while I wasn&#8217;t working I was studying for an exam? Is it something that&#8217;s not looked down upon?</em></p>
<p>It depends on how intensive studying for that particular exam is known to be. If it&#8217;s something like the CPA exam or the bar, then you can probably get away with saying that. If it&#8217;s less intensive, employers are more likely to wonder why you needed so much time off for something that most people do while they&#8217;re working.</p>
<p><strong>5. Quoting from a job ad in your cover letter</strong></p>
<p><em>In a cover letter, is it okay to quote from the posting of the position I&#8217;m applying to? I don&#8217;t want to come across as unoriginal or, worse, as plagiarizing, but if they use a particular wording that really does describe me or the work I do, can I go ahead and use it? Or is it going to be a big strike against me?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d do it only very sparingly, if at all. You&#8217;re generally better off describing yourself in your own words &#8230; at very clearly acknowledging that you&#8217;re quoting them (for instance, &#8220;you wrote that you&#8217;re looking for someone maniacally obsessed with clowns, and I&#8217;m exactly that&#8221;).</p>
<p><strong>6. Asking for a raise when the company is being sold</strong></p>
<p><em>I work at a very small company (about 20 people, including freelancers). The owner has been working in this industry for many many years and is well over retirement age. Myself and many of the coworkers have picked up on subtle clues from her (guiding people on &#8220;tours&#8221; of the office–we never have people from outside come here–and her introducing us to them but not them to us) and have found other information on the internet to confirm that the business is up for sale. People have found out that &#8220;due process&#8221; ends today, and the closing could be any time within the next month. The owner has not directly told anyone about this information.</em></p>
<p><em>My question is about when I should be asking for a raise. I am coming up on the 2-year anniversary of my start date (June). I believe the work I have done and the accomplishments I have achieved merit a raise. However, I don&#8217;t know when I should ask for it. Should I be asking for it now? I am hesitant to do it now because it may seem odd that I didn&#8217;t wait the 2.5 months until June. But I&#8217;m worried that if I don&#8217;t do it now, the new owners will see it as me trying to take advantage of the situation. or they could think &#8220;well if the old owner hasn&#8217;t given her a raise, why should we?&#8221; I also think that if I wait, they won&#8217;t know anything about my work and accomplishments and will say no because I have not proven myself to them yet. Is it customary for new owners to discuss previous work with the old owner to decide on issues like this?</em></p>
<p>Go ahead and ask now. The worst that can happen is that you&#8217;ll be told no.</p>
<p>Be prepared for the fact that she may be less inclined to give you a raise now because retaining good employees isn&#8217;t going to be her problem for much longer, but again, you lose nothing by asking.</p>
<p>Whether she&#8217;ll advise new owners on this kind of thing as part of the handover very much depends on the situation, but in general new owners like to make their own decisions on this type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>7. Getting online marketing jobs without online marketing experience</strong></p>
<p>I<em>n recent years, social and digital marketing has become a key component of many job requirements in public relations. My problem is that I have worked for organizations that actively refused to enhance their digital footprint. I kept up on trends by reading the books and attending the professional development sessions. I&#8217;m preparing to apply for a job that I&#8217;d be perfect for, but I don&#8217;t have any direct social or digital marketing experience they want. How do I address this in my resume and cover letter?</em></p>
<p>You might think you&#8217;d be perfect for these jobs, but &#8212; well, <em>they&#8217;re</em> less likely to think you&#8217;re perfect since you don&#8217;t have actual experience doing the work. And when you&#8217;re up against well-qualified candidates who do have the experience, employers won&#8217;t have much incentive to hire you. I&#8217;d try to get that experience first &#8212; volunteer for a few organizations who want help in this area and start building up a portfolio of work and accomplishments that you can point to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>My coworker&#8217;s husband comes in every day between 3:30 and 4:30, depending on when he gets out of work, and sits in our open concept, 468 square foot, 6-person office until my coworker is ready to leave around 5. They do not ride into work together.</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes he stands beside her hugging her while she works, and they are always whispering to each other. My desk faces them and it’s distracting to me. Am I wrong or is this inappropriate, and if so how can I ask my coworker or my boss to reduce this visitation?</em></p>
<p>Eeuwww. Yes, it&#8217;s totally inappropriate.</p>
<p>Honestly, it would be a little weird to have this guy in your office for this long every afternoon even if he were just sitting quietly in a corner, keeping to himself. But the whispering and the extended hugging? And she&#8217;s supposed to be <em>working</em> while he snuggles with her? It&#8217;s not professional and it&#8217;s not considerate of others. (Or of basic decorum, for that matter. And it&#8217;s making my skin crawl a little.)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine why your boss is okay with your coworker being distracted that way or with the rest of you dealing with the distraction they pose. Does she know it&#8217;s happening with this frequency?</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re up for it, you could certainly say something to your coworker, her husband, or her boss, although how it goes over with the first two will depend entirely on how reasonable each is, and how it goes over with your boss will depend on how savvy she is about handling stuff like this.</p>
<p>To the coworker: &#8220;Do you think Frank could sit over there (somewhere far from the rest of you) when he meets you here, or even wait downstairs some of the time? I end up getting distracted when he comes in and talks to you every afternoon, and I&#8217;ve noticed it makes it harder for me to focus.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the husband: &#8220;Hey, Frank, could you wait over there? It&#8217;s pretty distracting to have you canoodling with Jane while we&#8217;re working. Thanks.&#8221; (I actually prefer this option to saying something to the coworker, since the husband is the one committing the actions you object to &#8230; although ultimately your coworker is the one responsible for not allowing visitors to interfere with the rest of you.)</p>
<p>To your boss: &#8220;For the last few months, Jane&#8217;s husband has been meeting her at work every afternoon and spending up to 90 minutes hanging out in her space while he waits for her to be ready to leave at 5. It&#8217;s pretty distracting, because he stands there whispering and hugging her while the rest of us are working. I feel awkward saying anything to them because I don&#8217;t want to strain my relationship with Jane, but it really is distracting and making it hard to focus. I wouldn&#8217;t care if it were occasional, but it&#8217;s every day. Could you maybe ask her to have him wait for her somewhere else so it&#8217;s not interfering with our work?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you doubt that speaking to your coworker or her husband will have any effect and so you know you&#8217;ll end up needing to say something to your manager next, it might be better to just skip that and jump straight to your manager &#8212; since otherwise it&#8217;s going to be quite clear to your coworker who instigated the manager&#8217;s intervention.</p>
<p>If that intervention comes, of course. Some managers are laissez-faire to the point of neglect, and if you&#8217;ve got one of those, then you might end up just needing to live with an hour-plus of inappropriate cuddling and whispering every day. My sympathies if so.</p>

<p><em>A former coworker reached out to me via LinkedIn recently to ask if I&#8217;d be willing to serve as a reference for him during his job search. He is leaving the company where I used to work in a role that was semi-managerial. He was a great coworker and valuable member of our team, so I agreed, but I&#8217;m not sure what I need to do to be prepared to give him the reference he deserves.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve never been asked to serve as a reference before, so I honestly don&#8217;t know what I just agreed to and what the most professional way to approach this is.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s tiny answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Interviewer asked me to send him all my contacts</strong></p>
<p><em>I just interviewed at a start-up where 3 people liked me and the CEO said he would like to give me a shot for 90 days and see where things go. I then interviewed with a sales director, on a different day. He had a different interviewing style &#8212; grilled me and asked me to send him ALL my contacts on Monday. He wasn&#8217;t even sure why they were interviewing me! (They were not ready to open that division.) I thought this was strange and emailed a friend who has been in healthcare sales for 20+ years. She thought it was strange.</em></p>
<p><em>Sunday night, I sent an email stating I was very interested, but those contacts were my clients and I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable handing them over without an offer (some were big time names, of big time hospitals). 30 minutes later, I got a &#8220;thank you but we are looking for someone with a different skill set&#8221; email.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s the contacts they were really after or if I offended them? The email was not harsh. Is it appropriate and expected to hand this over? I worked on these for years and they span 15 states (where this company would eventually expand to).</em></p>
<p>No, no employer should expect you to hand over your contacts before you&#8217;re working there. This may or may not be the reason you didn&#8217;t get the job, but I doubt they put you through all those interviews just as a ploy to access your contacts. In any case, don&#8217;t second-guess your decision &#8212; you were in the right, and the interviewer who asked was in the wrong.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is it too late to negotiate salary when I&#8217;ve already accepted the offer?</strong></p>
<p><em>I accepted an offer for an insurance position and I lowballed my salary requirement in an effort not to price myself out of the position. They of course offered me the position at my requested amount. I had a sinking feeling I could have asked for more, but accepted the position. Now that I&#8217;ve been there a week, I know i deserve more! Is it too late to negotiate salary?</em></p>
<p>Yes. The time to negotiate salary is before you accepted the offer. At this point, you&#8217;ve already agreed to their offer and are working there. Imagine, after all, if they came back to you now and said they&#8217;d decided they want to pay you less than you earlier agreed to &#8212; you&#8217;d be rightfully irked. Same thing here. You made an agreement, and you&#8217;re expected to honor it, at least until you&#8217;ve been there long enough to credibly ask for a raise (which for most people is about a year). This is the problem with lowballing yourself in order &#8220;not to price yourself out of the position.&#8221; You commit to taking the salary you&#8217;ve asked for, lowball or not.</p>
<p><strong>3. My new cubicle is right by the bathroom, and I can hear everything</strong></p>
<p><em>Our department just moved to a newly remodeled floor with the restrooms located within the area. I sit outside the handicapped restroom, and the men are using it instead of going around to their larger restroom. Unfortunately, I can hear them urinating and other bodily functions. Then they leave the door open after they use the restroom. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom to ventilate it and/or mask the sounds. It makes me sick to listen to this everyday, all day. What do I do about this situation? The cube I am in is probably only 5 ft from the bathroom door. What should I do? Wear noise-cancelling headphone and place air fresheners on the upper edge of my cube?</em></p>
<p>Explain the problem to your manager and ask if you can move. If you can&#8217;t, then yes, noise-canceling headphones are going to be your friends. (If you&#8217;re wondering whether you can ask people not to use that bathroom, no, you probably cannot. I mean, you could &#8212; but in most offices people are going to think it&#8217;s a bit of a prima donna request, unfortunately.)</p>
<p><strong>4. I cried in a job interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I had a job interview today and one of the questions asked was &#8220;Pick a stressful time in your life and explain how you coped with it.&#8221; I was doing great in the interview, until this. It reminded me of recent issues and I began to cry. I felt so dumb! The interviewer gave me a Kleenex and apologized for bringing up memories, and after a minute of crying, I picked myself up and answered the question. After that, I was fine and answered all remaining questions with no problems. When I apologized again, the interviewer said that she knows exactly how it feels and shouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed. Even though she told me that, do you think that I am not going to get the job because of this?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way to know. She might have genuinely not cared, or she might be worried that you&#8217;re more thin-skinned than would be ideal for their office. All you can really do is be patient and wait and see what happens &#8212; and remind yourself that people don&#8217;t get job offers for all kinds of reasons, you might have not gotten it even without the crying, and some mistakes are unavoidable, and don&#8217;t beat yourself up about it too much.</p>
<p><strong>5. Can I reapply if I applied too early?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m trying to get an internship at the company of my dreams this summer, and after reading some of your blog archives I sent them a really personalized cover letter that was much more true to my own voice and passions than what I had been sending out before that. The thing is that I got a little overzealous, and I was so eager to get on their radar that I sent them my info in early January while they were probably looking for spring semester interns. They usually take applications for summer interns in March and April, and on somewhat of a rolling basis. They&#8217;re pretty low-key on the timeframe for this kind of stuff (when they announce they&#8217;re looking for new interns, they do it via tweet!). I assume my resume is lost somewhere in their email cyberspace now because I sent it at the wrong time and it wasn&#8217;t useful to them at that point. Maybe they set it aside for summer but I doubt it.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I send my information again when they ask for summer intern applicants? Or will that just look like an annoying repeat if by some chance they DO still have my info from January? There&#8217;s a new addition to my resume since then that might make them see me as a stronger candidate. If I do reapply should I acknowledge that I already applied earlier so they at least know I respect their time and am not trying to spam them into hiring me?</em></p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s basically a whole new hiring round, like a company advertising again for a regular, non-intern position. It&#8217;s fine to reapply when they announce their summer internships &#8212; and for that matter, it&#8217;s fine to reapply when they finally announce their spring internships too. For the latter, just include a note saying that you had applied in January but later realized they weren&#8217;t hiring for spring yet at that point.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can you be treated as both exempt and non-exempt?</strong></p>
<p><em>My husband is an attorney, and he&#8217;s been working a long-term temporary job. He has never been told if he is classified as exempt or non-exempt. His contract with his employer indicates that he is to be paid on a salaried basis of $X per year. However, his manager docks his pay if he is not in the office during the times the office is open. For example, on a day that he had to leave an hour before the office closed, he came in an hour early and skipped his lunch. She still docked him an hour&#8217;s pay, even though he&#8217;d worked two hours extra. Because of the nature of his work, she has also suggested that he come in on weekends to get things done. He does this. On average, he works 10+ hours a week outside of the hours his office is actually open. But not only does he not get paid any extra, his manager docks his pay if he needs to leave the office an hour early, or if he needs to come in a little late (between treacherous winter roads, a death in the family, and a major illness, he&#8217;s needed to be out a handful of hours in the past year).</em></p>
<p><em>I feel that his manager is trying to have it both ways &#8212; she expects him to work extra hours to get the job done, as if he&#8217;s exempt, but she docks his pay if he isn&#8217;t in the office during certain hours, as if he&#8217;s non-exempt. He&#8217;s put his heart and soul into this job, bringing work home, going in on the weekends, waking up insanely early to make it into the office before anyone else gets there, and staying later than anyone else. I feel like, if he&#8217;s non-exempt, his manager needs to manage his workload so he doesn&#8217;t need to work more than the hours he&#8217;s paid for, and if he&#8217;s exempt, she shouldn&#8217;t dock his pay when he needs a little flexibility in his schedule. Any thoughts on how to handle this?</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that she&#8217;s trying to have it both ways, and the law doesn&#8217;t allow it. By docking his pay for hours he misses, she&#8217;s treating him as <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/exempt-and-non-exempt">non-exempt</a>, which means that they law requires her to meet the other requirements for non-exempt workers, meaning that he must be paid overtime in weeks where he works over 40 hours, and that she probably owes him back wages for the times when she didn&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/02/20/how-to-assert-your-legal-rights-at-work">advice on how he can raise this with her</a> &#8230; although he&#8217;ll almost certainly sour the relationship if he demands back wages, legally entitled or not, so he might want to settle on just getting it straightened out going forward.</p>
<p><strong>7. Employer won&#8217;t tell me much about the job they&#8217;ve hired me for</strong></p>
<p><em>I got hired on the spot at a childcare center as a lead teacher. I told the manager that I&#8217;ve only been a assistant teacher, and most of my experience is assisting the teacher in the room! The manager said that&#8217;s okay, but that I will be by myself with 7-10 2-year-olds and I will be their lead teacher. She didn&#8217;t tell me what my job duties are exactly just I&#8217;ll be in the room by myself with the kids. She said that if I had questions, to speak up and call her. I did call her, and when she answered, she told me not to call her because she is too busy, but that she will let me know the job duties right before I enter the room. I feel I may have to quit because I&#8217;m not sure if I can handle it. Please help!</em></p>
<p>Um, yeah, that&#8217;s ridiculous. You&#8217;re not under any obligation to accept a job you don&#8217;t want or feel prepared for, or one where the hiring manager won&#8217;t answer questions or even tell you what your responsibilities will be. You can certainly tell her that you need to know more before you can accept the job. If you have any doubts, it&#8217;s probably better to do this now rather than waiting for your first day, since being left alone in charge of children when you&#8217;re not sure you&#8217;re equipped for it isn&#8217;t a good situation for you or the kids to be in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>My husband and I are both in the same specialized field and have very similar education/degrees, skills and experience. He recently applied to a position that read like it was made for him, with the bonus that it was located in the area where he grew up and to which we wanted to move. This was a very rare combination and he tried really hard to get this job. After several phone interviews with recruiters and a hiring manager, he was getting great feedback and they seemed to really like him as a candidate. The recruiter called him on a Wednesday and said he was doing really well, and that the company would like to set up another interview with another key manager the next week. We were really happy about this, but the next Monday he received an email from the recruiter that said they filled the position with another candidate. We were disappointed but moved on.</em></p>
<p><em>A couple of weeks later, he received an email from a second person at the same recruiting agency, saying that she had an open position for which he should apply. It was the exact same job. He was annoyed and wanted to sent a nasty reply (he has been frustrated and cynical after job-hunting for many years), but I cajoled him into sending a pleasant but &#8220;confused&#8221; response that he had already gone through the interview process for that position, and he had been told that it had been filled. The second recruiter said she would look into it, but she never got back to him. He emailed her to say that he was no longer interested in the opportunity, and suggested that she contact me, since I have also been looking for employment.</em></p>
<p><em>I heard back from the first recruiter the next day, and she conducted an initial interview over the phone. At the end of the conversation, I told her that I understood this position had already been filled. She told me that it had not. I decided not to say anything about my husband because it seemed awkward at the time. After about a week, she emailed me to say that the position had been filled, and my contact ended there.</em></p>
<p><em>I suppose it&#8217;s possible that they had indeed made a job offer to someone and that fell through, but the whole experience struck me as being weird. My husband had a similar experience a few years ago where he made it through the final interview process but was told they chose another candidate &#8212; but then saw the same, unique position re-advertised a few weeks later. Is this common, or were they just trying to let him down easy?</em></p>
<p>Who knows. There&#8217;s rarely any point in trying to speculate on stuff like this, since there are so many possible explanations.</p>
<p>Maybe they had indeed offered the job to someone but that fell through, or maybe it was a miscommunication between the recruiter and the employer, or maybe it was just disorganization on the recruiter&#8217;s side, or maybe the recruiter meant to convey &#8220;they&#8217;re interested in going with someone else, although they don&#8217;t yet know who&#8221; but it got conveyed as &#8220;they did go with someone else,&#8221; or maybe the recruiter did indeed lie to your husband and said it was filled when it wasn&#8217;t. (But honestly, that last one is pretty unlikely, since recruiters have plenty of experience rejecting candidates; it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re so uncomfortable with it that they have to lie to get out of being direct.)</p>
<p>Hell, it&#8217;s also possible that the recruiter was right when she told your husband the position had been filled, and it was all the subsequent communications that were wrong. (The second recruiter at the agency might not have realized the job had been filled when she contacted him and then you.)</p>
<p>The best thing you can do when dealing with recruiters &#8212; and when dealing with employers directly, too &#8212; is not to bother to try to read too much into any of this. It doesn&#8217;t really matter, after all. They&#8217;ve declined to proceed with you, and that&#8217;s really the relevant information; trying to read into what might have happened beyond that is generally a waste of energy, because unless someone tells you directly, you really can&#8217;t know. And don&#8217;t really need to, even though it&#8217;s tempting to try to do a post mortum on it all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I&#8217;m traveling today, so I&#8217;m throwing two questions out to readers to help with. Here&#8217;s the first one, from a reader who writes:</p>
<p><em>I have job anxiety. </em></p>
<p><em>I graduated from college last May and as such I am relatively new to the job field. But I&#8217;ve had experience as an administrative assistant and marketing intern. </em></p>
<p><em>When I see a job advertisement, I get so intimidated by the job description because it always requires experience in terms of years that I don&#8217;t have. Even if the experience is within my qualifications and I do receive an offer, I constantly worry about if I can do a good job. If I don&#8217;t do it competently enough, will they fire me? If they give me something to do in the job description that I don&#8217;t know how to do (i.e. spreadsheets, expense reports), will they allow me to learn or show me how to do it? Can I meet their expectations? </em></p>
<p><em>Those are some of the thoughts I have and I lose the courage to continue with the job process. If it was a minimum wage job, I wouldn&#8217;t even have a problem with anxiety like that. But with a professional job, I am scared to an anxious degree. I know that I can&#8217;t be the only one who has a problem with this. What is this exactly and what can I do to get over it? Is this something that is fairly common with recent grads? Thank you for your help.</em></p>
<p>What advice do you have for this new grad?</p>

For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a job offer but you’re waiting to hear back from another employer about a job you’d rather take. Can you stall the first employer while you wait to hear from the second?</li>
<li>A prospective employer asks if they can contact your current manager for a reference, but your manager doesn’t know you’re looking for another job.</li>
<li>You exaggerated your salary history on your job application, and now an employer is asking you to verify the numbers.</li>
<li>You need to schedule an interview, but you’re currently employed and can’t get away during the workday.</li>
<li>You have an interview after work, but if you come to work wearing a suit, your whole office will know you’re interviewing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about how to navigate these and come out safely on the other side. (Well, with one exception.)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. When should you let your employer know you&#8217;re looking for a new job?</strong></p>
<p><em>When is the best time to tell your current employer that you are looking for/about to get a new job elsewhere? I&#8217;ve heard of various scenarios&#8211;letting them know early that you are &#8220;just looking,&#8221; in which case they might feel compelled (and have the time) to promote you or give you a raise. Or letting them know that you are actually in the midst of interviewing, which could give them more incentive to try to retain you. Or only tell them once you have a hard offer from another company so they have clear numbers to work with in case they want to counter offer.</em></p>
<p><em>In all scenarios, the individual is ready and willing to leave; it&#8217;s not a ploy to stay and get more money.</em></p>
<p>This depends 100% of how your employer handles the knowledge that someone is planning to leave but hasn&#8217;t given official notice yet, and how they handle generous notice periods (of longer than two weeks). If your manager has a track record of handling these things well &#8212; of being appreciative of the long notice or informal heads-up &#8212; rather than penalizing people or even pushing them out the door earlier than they wanted to go, then great &#8212; you know how they operate, and it&#8217;s reasonably safe for you to be candid. But if, on the other hand, your manager has a track record of not handling it well (firing people, pushing them out early, denying you raises, bonuses, or good projects that you&#8217;d otherwise get for the remainder of your employment), then let that be your guide &#8212; meaning give only two notice (or give more, but be prepared for the consequences). In other words, there&#8217;s no blanket rule here; you need to know your employer/manager and act accordingly.</p>
<p>All that said, however, if your goal in telling them is because you hope they&#8217;ll give you a raise or promotion, that&#8217;s not the way to do it. If you want those things, you should make a case for them independently of mentioning your job search. If you can&#8217;t get them that way and it takes a threat of leaving to get them, you need to stick with your plan to leave. Somewhere that only acts when you have one foot out the door isn&#8217;t a great place to work. (And taking a counteroffer is usually a bad idea for all the reasons discussed <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/03/26/why-you-shouldnt-take-a-counteroffer">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Job ads that ask you to describe how interesting you are</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m having trouble with job ads that ask to describe how interesting you are. I don&#8217;t find myself very interesting. This isn&#8217;t a self esteem issue. I don&#8217;t have any interesting hobbies like skydiving or founding a burlesque troop. Or even any exotic pets like a ferret or lemur. What should I do?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know what industry you&#8217;re in that you&#8217;re encountering a lot of these requests; it&#8217;s an odd one. In any case, if you described why you&#8217;re obsessed with ___ (fill in the type of work you do), where that comes from, and how it manifests in your life, even outside of work, I&#8217;d find that pretty damn interesting if I were hiring for a job. But then that&#8217;s the kind of thing I want to know all the time anyway &#8212; not what your hobbies or pets are.</p>
<p>These ads are telling you something about their culture, and it might not be something you like.</p>
<p><strong>3. How to back out of a job offer you&#8217;ve already accepted</strong></p>
<p><em>My department recently restructured, and I was put into a role that was far less &#8220;important&#8221; than my previous position, though title and salary didn&#8217;t change. I went from managing a team and reporting directly in to an EVP to having one direct report and reporting to someone who has more or less the same experience as I do. Based on that, I started looking and secured an offer from another company, which I accepted (in writing).</em></p>
<p><em>Well, as it turns out, that was a terrible decision. The area I was put into, which I considered a demotion, is undergoing a large expansion, and the boss I am currently reporting to is leaving the company; the reporting situation was simply so I could be trained.</em></p>
<p><em>Hindsight is 20/20; obviously I should have communicated my concerns when the move happened. But now I&#8217;m in the awkward position of having to un-accept the offer. I haven&#8217;t received any compensation from the new company, and I only accepted earlier this week. There&#8217;s no specific language in my acceptance that reads exactly like a contract, though it clearly states I am accepting the offer. Does the other company have any recourse (other, obviously, than never hiring me again &#8212; I&#8217;m accepting that the bridge is probably a charred mess) against me? Do a lot of people accept and then rescind acceptance of offers?</em></p>
<p>No, they have no legal recourse against if you if you&#8217;re not breaking a contract (and just accepting the offer letter isn&#8217;t a contact, just like it doesn&#8217;t prevent them from pulling the offer or firing you on week two). You will burn the bridge, and you will probably harm your reputation with people who hear about it, but there aren&#8217;t any legal repercussions.</p>
<p>You asked if if a lot of people accept offers and then back out, and the answer is no. Most people have a story about someone who did it to their company &#8212; but it tends to be a notorious story about That Awful Bob Who Backed Out After We&#8217;d Already Turned Loose Our Other Candidates and Set Up His Computer. You will be Awful Bob at that company, so prepare yourself for that! (And talk to your employer the next time you&#8217;re unhappy about a restructure!)</p>
<p><strong>4. Explaining in a cover letter that you&#8217;re switching fields</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently decided that I need a career change in my life and was wondering if that is something worth mentioning in your cover letter. All of my experience lands in one field graphic design, but I also managed teams and provided customer service. I&#8217;m now looking into a recruitment position. Should I mention in my cover letter that I&#8217;m changing careers?</em></p>
<p>God, yes. Otherwise they&#8217;ll have no idea why you&#8217;re applying for a position that doesn&#8217;t relate to the work they see on your resume. In fact, not only do you need to mention it, you need to make the case for why you&#8217;ll be good at it and why your experience translates to the new field. Don&#8217;t expect them to make that case on their own &#8212; you&#8217;re going to need to figure it out and be compelling about it. (You should also be prepared for the fact that it&#8217;s hard to change fields in this job market, because employers generally have tons of qualified candidates who <em>have</em> worked in the field, and not much incentive to take a chance on someone switching careers. So you&#8217;ve really got to be compelling.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Is this salary too low?</strong></p>
<p><em>Via grapevine networking through a family member, I&#8217;ve been alerted to a job opening for a receptionist+ position at a small (less than 30 employees) company. As the &#8220;+&#8221; entails all of the marketing experience (3+ years) I bring to the table, they have added to the position responsibilities, but are still looking to pay close to what they originally conceived for the post &#8212; a full $17,000 less than what my last position paid, and still $10,000 less than the first role listed on my resume.</em></p>
<p><em>I know this is impossible to gauge, but just how low is too low? I live in a very expensive city, have high student loan bills, and chose my apartment based on my salary and budgeting of my last few positions&#8217; salaries.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. You&#8217;d need to look at what similar work pays for people with your experience in your particular geographic area. That&#8217;s what market rate is based on, not your last salary, your student loans, or your rent.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dealing with a board of directors that oversteps their role</strong></p>
<p><em>Have you or could you do a post about dealing with a dysfunctional board? My husband has been the executive director for two nonprofits, and his major issues have always been with the board. For example: board members who use their positions to promote their personal projects at official events; members who micromanage the staff when it&#8217;s the ED&#8217;s responsibility; members who backtrack on policies they&#8217;ve implemented to suit their current needs; members responding to disgruntled former chair instead of ignoring him.</em></p>
<p><em>You say that reputation is so important, and I worry that husband will have a reputation for not being able to work well with boards. He gets great results with his staff, receives recognition by industry experts, and is effective in his job (increased revenue, reduced expenses, removed problem employees, etc.). Instead of recognizing his efforts, his current board has started to micromanage his staff to the point that two key staff members want to quit and he is looking for another job. Any guidance that you can provide?</em></p>
<p>Boardsource.org and blueavocado.org both have good advice on dealing with boards, including on the appropriate role of the board (big-picture oversight and managing the ED) versus the appropriate role of the ED (managing the staff and the day-to-day operations of the organization). When you&#8217;ve got a board committed to doing the ED&#8217;s role rather than their own &#8212; and when they&#8217;re resistant to learning about best practices for boards and adjusting their behavior &#8212; it&#8217;s nearly always a nightmare for the ED (and often for the organization). Personally, I&#8217;d get the hell out of there and go somewhere that would let me do my job &#8230; which your husband probably needs to more carefully screen for in the future, really asking questions about how the board, ED, and staff interact, and doing some diligent research into the experiences of past EDs in the organization.</p>
<p><strong>7. Managing bad apples</strong></p>
<p><em>I manage 12 people, two of whom are bad apples. These two have a negative attitude and try to influence others to be negative. How can I stop this?</em></p>
<p>Um, manage them? Set standards for what is and isn&#8217;t appropriate behavior and consequences for not meeting that bar. Warn them that they&#8217;re in danger of losing their jobs if they don&#8217;t improve in areas A, B, and C, set a short period of time to evaluate whether they&#8217;ve moved to where you need them to be (meaning weeks, not months), and <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2011/01/how-to-fire-an-employee-with-a-bad-attitude.html">replace them</a> if they haven&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Sunday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Applying for a job with a store I stole from two years ago</strong></p>
<p><em>I stole from a store when I was 16. I took about $20 worth of items, and my sister took more than $100. It was a class B misdemeanor and I went to juvenile center. I was a minor and my case was dismissed. I&#8217;m 18 and I have an interview at that store for a job. Should I bring it up or not say anything? I didn&#8217;t put in on the application because I was a minor, I didn&#8217;t go to jail, and it was wiped clean from my record when i became an adult.</em></p>
<p>In general, because it was erased from your record, there&#8217;s no need to bring this up when you&#8217;re applying for jobs. But the same store that you stole from? I would not apply with that store. If you bring it up, they&#8217;re unlikely to hire you &#8230; and if you don&#8217;t bring it up and start working there, and someone there remembers you from two years ago, it&#8217;s going to be Uncomfortable. Why not try to get a job with other stores instead?</p>
<p><strong>2. Mentioning a spouse&#8217;s job when it might be relevant to yours</strong></p>
<p><em>My husband is applying for a position as an engineer within an event space. The job description requires interaction between his potential position and event planners that would be clients of the space. Ordinarily (obviously, perhaps?), engineers don&#8217;t have much familiarity with the events industry, but as I am an event planner myself, and even a client of this venue, he has a bit of inside knowledge of the industry and what event planners would be looking for. We both agree that this would be an asset to his candidacy and his position, if he got the job, but neither of us can figure out how to word it. Is it appropriate to include this information in a cover letter? Is there a good way to word it?</em></p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d say that info about a spouse never belongs in a cover letter (unless it&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;m relocating on April 1 because my spouse has accepted a job in your city&#8221;), but I could actually see mentioning this. I&#8217;d say something like, &#8220;Because my wife is an event planner, I know a fair bit about the industry and &#8212; unlike many engineers &#8212; actually enjoy talking about ___.&#8221; (Fill that in with something event-planning-related that&#8217;s likely to be relevant to him if he were doing the job &#8212; &#8220;the relative merits of various caterers,&#8221; &#8220;floral decor,&#8221; or whatever makes sense.) It&#8217;s fine if this sounds wry or semi-funny; that&#8217;s actually a plus if he can pull that off.</p>
<p><strong>3. Using a reference from a short-term job</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m starting to look for a new job and have a question about references. The jobs I&#8217;m looking at are in the school system, so I want to use a reference from my last job in a similar position at a school in a different district. The problem is that I only worked there for a few months last year. My position wasn&#8217;t carried over into the fall school year, even though my supervisors were happy with my work. My supervisor has said she&#8217;d be happy to be a reference for me, but is a few months a year ago too short a time, too long ago to work as a good reference? If I don&#8217;t use her, I&#8217;m limited to either having all my references from my current position, or using references from unrelated jobs or an unpaid practicum that was also a year ago, but lasted for the entire school year.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s not ideal. I&#8217;d want to know why your contract wasn&#8217;t renewed (and if you don&#8217;t know for sure, you should try to find out) before you decide whether or not to use it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why are my lazy coworkers still here?</strong></p>
<p><em>I work in a somewhat small office with six employees and one manager. I have worked here for two year and have survived multiple managers (most of whom have provided special treatment and overlooked things such as other employees&#8217; drug use). Last summer, I was extremely happy to find out that our company was hiring a new manager and after meeting with him it was clear that he does not put up with BS. However, lately he seems to be siding with the people who complain the most. Of the six employees, three continually get away with everything from not showing up for work, lying, not doing their jobs, and causing drama. While I make a point not to go and complain to my boss (for fear of being labeled as a problem child), these three constantly run down to his office and complain about everything. I have had them complain about me creating “tension” in the office and therefore they don’t get their work done. However, when I asked how I caused tension, they said I have been ignoring them and I close my door all the time. I do make a point to close my door when they are standing in the hall talking for over an hour sometimes to focus on my work. I say hello and goodbye every morning and I am polite when I am forced to work with them; yet I do make a point to stay away from them for fear of being affiliated with their lazy work ethic. I cordially explained to the three that I focus better with the door closed and that they are welcome to come in any time, but I made it clear that I was not going to start going out and BSing for over an hour with them to make them feel comfortable. I have never once been reprimanded by my boss for lack of being cordial, mostly because I deal with several supervisors and consultants who all like dealing with me and appreciate my work ethic. I have even been promoted and have joined several big corporate outings.</em></p>
<p><em>While I love my actual job and the experience I am getting as well as pay, I can’t stand dealing with the constant complaints and drama these three add. They are so lazy that when one fails to do a job it gets shoved onto me, or when they screw up I get nipped for it and told to watch it better next time. I am constantly having to pick up their slack and the few times I have mentioned it to my boss he defends these people. I am told to work with these people (I have no authority over them) yet when their work is lacking and mistakes happen I get nailed for it. I don&#8217;t understand why my boss has not fired them and found other employees and I am starting to doubt that he even cares whether these people do their jobs. When is it time to give up a great job due to horrible coworkers?</em></p>
<p>Now. And it&#8217;s not because of your horrible coworkers, but rather because of your inept managers who have shown they&#8217;re not going to do their job and manage these people.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do I stand out when 24 candidates are being interviewed?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have an interview coming up for a job I really, really want. Like, it&#8217;s a perfect fit. I know I am qualified for the job because I got called for an interview! Here&#8217;s my concern, they are interviewing 24 people for the position! What are some ways to stick out in the interview (and make sure the interviewing panel remembers me) without any gimmicks? I figure I have nothing to lose because it is going to be a competitive pool, but I don&#8217;t want to appear ridiculous.</em></p>
<p>You stand out by being a highly qualified candidate who has done <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/how-to-guide">a ton of preparation for the interview</a>. That&#8217;s it &#8212; there&#8217;s no other way to do it.</p>
<p>Interviewing 24 candidates in a first round is insane, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>6. New manager is asking me to bring in materials from my old job</strong></p>
<p><em>I am just making a move to a new job with a better salary and a nice position. The thing is that my new manager asked me to bring some work-related materials such as excel sheets and various templates from my previous employer. It&#8217;s my first time to switch jobs and I don&#8217;t know if this is a normal practice. I don&#8217;t want to do this as I perceive this to be completely unethical. On the other hand, the job is well paying and definitely a strong move in my career. How can I handle this situation in a way that doesn&#8217;t affect the relationship with my new manager?</em></p>
<p>Say this: &#8220;My agreement with my previous employer prevents me from sharing those materials.&#8221; If pushed, repeat it again. If still pushed, say, &#8220;I&#8217;m uncomfortable being asked to share these materials, when I know my previous employer would have strong objections to me doing it.&#8221; And then stand firm.</p>
<p>This response is completely normal, and any manager who won&#8217;t accept that is seriously bad news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. When your interviewers are stiff and not conversational</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a friend who had an interview this morning for an assistant position (she&#8217;s been out of college for a year). I had her read your blog to prepare and I helped her as well. After her interview, she called me and told me that she thought it went ok. Her biggest concern was that the two men interviewing her did not give much feedback or really attempt to make the conversation conversational, if that makes sense. My gut instinct told me it is a sign of an inexperienced interviewer because I have only had 1 interview out of dozens like that. I guess I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s more a reflection on them or does the interviewee need to try harder to keep the conversation flowing? And how do you handle an interview when it feels like you&#8217;re talking to the wall?</em></p>
<p>It could be inexperienced interviewers, but it could also just be their personal style. Some people are fairly formal in interview situations, and not everyone gives feedback on the spot (or ever). If you&#8217;re a candidate in that situation, the best thing to do is not to take it personally; if you start feeling it&#8217;s a reflection on you, you can get anxious and lose focus. Just treat it like a normal interview, since for them, it may be.</p>
<p><strong>2. Pre-planned vacation when interviewing with a tiny office</strong></p>
<p><em>I have read through your archives regarding interviews and waiting until an offer has been made to mention a <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2008/06/pre-planned-vacation-when-job-hunting.html">pre-planned vacation</a>. I agree with this approach as it doesn&#8217;t seem appropriate to bring up days I&#8217;d want off during an interview.</em></p>
<p><em>I recently interviewed for a position with a large company with offices nationwide. However, I&#8217;d be working in a very small satellite office that covers a small part of the country. When I say small satellite office, I mean the smallest you can get: my potential future boss and whomever is hired to be his assistant.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a vacation planned in about 6.5 weeks that will require me to miss 6 days of work. I already have plane tickets and have paid deposits on rentals. This vacation cannot be rescheduled because its purpose is for me to run a marathon for which I&#8217;ve been training for months. I don&#8217;t want to shorten the vacation because of my non-refundable plane tickets and rental deposits. Should I email my potential employer and let him know of these plans, or wait until I am offered the position? Normally I would wait until an offer has been made but I feel this situation is different due to the size of the office. I&#8217;m afraid if I wait he will feel duped and I don&#8217;t want to tick off my one-and-only coworker before I even start working. My interview was Monday and he said he hopes to make a decision by the end of this week.</em></p>
<p>Nope, just like always, wait until you have an offer and then negotiate it then as part of your overall negotiation. Employers don&#8217;t want to get into the specifics of what days candidates will need off; they want to wait until they&#8217;ve determined who they&#8217;d like to hire, and deal with it then.</p>
<p><strong>3. Should I leave if I get demoted?</strong></p>
<p><em>My company is going through an organizational change which will result in the elimination of my job. The company has been very vocal about wanting to keep all employees, and has offered three alternatives: a promotion with enough positions for 10% of the people with my job title, a demotion with loss of some PTO benefits and salary, or a lateral transfer to an entirely different job type. Although there is no formal interview process, I sent a cover letter style email to my bosses regarding my interest in the promotion, and have since met with all three of them to discuss the changes in the company. Although they&#8217;ve assured me that they like my work and my attitude, they&#8217;ve also emphasized that I&#8217;m competing against 100 other people. I&#8217;ve been in this industry for 5 years, but in this particular company for less than 2. Many of my colleagues have more than 10+ years of experience and are 5+ years older than I am. I&#8217;m confident in my abilities, but not confident that I&#8217;ll be chosen.</em></p>
<p><em>My question is whether or not I should stay with this company if I don&#8217;t receive the promotion. I would likely be placed in the lower paying job with less PTO and incentives, and would also lose my job title and many of my responsibilities. I&#8217;m worried that I will be stuck in a position I find unfulfilling and if I do choose to leave in the future, this demotion will impact my resume. I could take a severance package, but I&#8217;m also worried that I would be placing a time limit on myself to find a new career. I&#8217;ve never been in this position before, and I would appreciate any advice you may have!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to find a new job when you&#8217;re still employed, so if you don&#8217;t want to stay in the position you end up in, you can always stay in it while embarking on a job search and leave when you find something else. (In fact, you should probably start looking now so that you get a head start on your search. You can always curtail it if you get the promotion or otherwise decide not to leave.) If you leave quickly enough after the demotion, if indeed it happens, you can simply leave it off your resume.</p>
<p><strong>4. Listing seasonal work on your resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I saw you say that it&#8217;s bad form to leave months off resumes because it looks like you&#8217;re trying to hide rapid job-hopping. Does that apply to jobs that are very specifically seasonal? I&#8217;m in the education/youth org sphere and I have a few jobs on my resume listed as &#8220;Summer ____&#8221; because they were positions akin to a summer camp counselor that didn&#8217;t say so in the title. My thinking is that it provides a more accurate impression of my time there, it looks neater, and people in schools or other youth organizations are familiar with that type of job since many teachers and other professionals spend their summers that way. Someone who works in recruiting told me he liked that way of phrasing it, but I wanted a second opinion, or thoughts on whether it should be altered for certain jobs (maybe it&#8217;s more appropriate, for example, for my upcoming search for a summer job, since it signifies I&#8217;m experienced with the kind of position I&#8217;m applying for, than if I were to apply for an office-based position in a youth org that does similar work year-round).</em></p>
<p>Yes, &#8220;summer 2012&#8243; or whatever is totally fine and normal.</p>
<p><strong>5. Negotiating with a J.D. but not much experience</strong></p>
<p><em>I graduated in May of 2012 with a J.D., and have been searching for jobs since then. I am applying to jobs that are J.D. required/preferred, but not necessarily &#8220;traditional&#8221; law firm jobs. A lot of these jobs ask for so many years of experience (which I don&#8217;t have as a new grad) or will substitute having a J.D. for the required number of years. They list the salary as either a range or as negotiable.</em></p>
<p><em>I am wondering how, as a new grad, I can negotiate for a salary and come across as deserving of that salary, especially as a new graduate with minimal years of experience.</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;d negotiate the same way anyone else does, by making a case for why you deserve more than what they&#8217;re offering. That said, without much work experience, you don&#8217;t have a lot of negotiating power / standing to justify more, so you want to be aware of that so that you don&#8217;t come across as out of touch about your current market value. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>6. Getting a job with a vendor my company just rejected</strong></p>
<p><em>I would appreciate your advice on how to get a job with a vendor my company just rejected. Currently I work in sourcing for a large manufacturing company and have responsibility for vetting potential vendors. Recently I came across a really exciting startup company who could really provide a boost to our business. I spent several months reviewing their company, analyzing their business model, and realized this was a truly remarkable company with a great management team. I also presented my recommendation to several senior leaders and received very positive feedback about this partnership. Right before closing terms on the contract, we got a huge surprise, though. My company was no longer interested in the deal due to a sudden strategy shift.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is I like the vendor more than my current company. How do I approach them to let them know I would be interested in joining them even though my company turned them down? I know I have a lot to offer them from my background and experience, plus I know their business and industry very well. Should I just ask them to keep me in mind for future openings? Or offer to do some moonlighting? I am worried about a potential conflict of interest with my current employer. I only know a few people at the company, including the founder. Any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</em></p>
<p>Tell the founder you&#8217;re interested. Say something like, &#8220;I got to know so much about your company over the last few months and am impressed. If you&#8217;re ever looking for someone to do X, I&#8217;d love to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>7. Convincing my manager that I need to quit due to health issues</strong></p>
<p><em>I started working at a salon as a receptionist (part-time) to have a little extra spending money. My husband makes enough to cover our living expenses, but my extra income allows us to travel occasionally and not worry about money. Overall, I&#8217;m alright with my job; it&#8217;s not the best job I&#8217;ve ever had, but it&#8217;s not the worst either. However, in the six months I&#8217;ve worked at the salon I have had severe bronchitis four times. After an extreme lifestyle search with my doctor (I&#8217;m a nonsmoker, and have never had bronchitis before six months ago), he believes working at the hair salon could be what is causing my bronchitis. He said he would be more than happy to speak with my boss about it and has strongly encouraged me to resign.</em></p>
<p><em>How do I quit without burning the bridge at the salon? How do you professionally explain that you have to quit because the environment is making you ill? I&#8217;ve broached the topic with the owner several times before and she laughed and thought I was joking because &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t happen to anybody.&#8221; I&#8217;ve tried being direct and she has just blown me off. This sounds horrible, but she really has been a good boss to me other than this issue. Basically, as long as I go with her flow, I am golden in her eyes. Should I just write this off as a bridge that must be burned?</em></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to justify quitting for health reasons, and you definitely don&#8217;t need your doctor to talk to them. Just say something like, &#8220;My doctor has believes something about the salon is causing bronchitis in me, and has strongly urged me to resign. I feel I need to take his advice, so X will be my last day.&#8221;</p>
<p>If your manager mocks you or tells you you&#8217;re wrong, it doesn&#8217;t matter. Just stay pleasant and say, &#8220;This is the decision I&#8217;ve made. I really appreciate the chance to work here, and I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t stay longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sane manager would consider this a bridge burned. If she does, then she&#8217;s irrational enough that something else was likely to burn it anyway. But by staying pleasant but firm, you might be able to avoid that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Would you do me a favor?  Voting in the Bloggie Awards closes this weekend, so if you haven&#8217;t yet voted for Ask a Manager, would you please <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/#topical">take a second to do it now</a>? (I&#8217;m nominated in the Best Topical Blog category). Thank you &#8212; I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s a crazy one to end the week. A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work for the government in a small office where there is one director, nine educational specialists (of which I am one), five support staff, and four specialists who share our office space but actually report to a different department. I originally applied for a specialist position, and while I did not get the job, they hired me as support staff because they wanted me at the organization and I had the necessary skills. After one month, the person they hired for the specialist position quit, and I was asked to apply again. This time, I was selected!</em></p>
<p><em>The director of our organization was promoted just before I was hired. Previously, she had been a specialist for many years, and the other specialists are some of her very best friends. I like her and the other specialists and I have enjoyed my job a lot so far. However, last week I was invited out for dinner and drinks, which is where my problems began. I really did not want to spend my Friday night “at work” (because for me, this dinner was going to cause me a lot of anxiety and make me work at socializing all night long), but I decided to go and try to build relationships.</em></p>
<p><em>At the dinner were my boss and six of the nine specialists. They have all worked together for over three years and have made their “girls nights” a tradition, so no spouses are allowed. I assumed the other three specialists were not there because of schedule conflicts, but I found out during the course of the night that two of them are not invited because they are male and these dinners are only for ladies, and the other female specialist is not invited because they don’t get along. They also do not seem to like the male specialists very much.</em></p>
<p><em>I was hoping to be able to learn a little bit about my colleagues and boss’s hobbies and families, but instead they spent the entire evening venting and gossiping about the employees that weren’t there. I assumed that there would be SOME “shop talk,” but I felt very uncomfortable because our boss was joining in (and unlike the rest of them, I haven’t been friends with her since before she was a supervisor) and because I didn’t have anything to contribute to the conversation. I really don’t like gossip, I don’t like negativity, and I happen to like the support staff and specialists who weren’t there. By the end of the night, my previous boss and current colleague had shared details about my family that I had mistakenly thought were from private conversations between us, I knew the scores that the people who weren’t there had received on their annual performance reviews, and I had basically been warned “what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!”</em></p>
<p><em>They want to have a “drunk sleepover” in a few months which everyone is excited about. These are academic professionals ranging in age from 35-60 (I am in my 20s, but I used to be a teacher so this is not my first professional job) and I had assumed they would behave more professionally. I have zero interest in going out with them again, but I know that will put me on the “outside” with the rest of the office and they will probably spend their next dinner gossiping about my performance reviews. I also feel that now I can’t go to my boss with any problems because it will be spread around to everyone in the office, and I am a rather private person.</em></p>
<p><em>Can you offer any advice? I do enjoy the actual work I do, and of course in our economy I am grateful to have a job, especially since my husband was just laid off!</em></p>
<p>What the hell?!</p>
<p>This is so wildly beyond the bounds of any acceptable behavior for managers that I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. A manager holding &#8220;women-only&#8221; dinners?! And not inviting someone because she doesn&#8217;t like her?!  And badmouthing other employees? And sharing their performance evaluation scores?!</p>
<p>And &#8230; and &#8230; I can barely even type the words. A drunk sleepover?</p>
<p>Is this some sort of job apprentice program for teenagers and your boss is a 16-year-old girl? Because otherwise, this is ludicrous.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to continue to join them outside work &#8212; for exclusionary dinners, drunken sleepovers, or anything else &#8212; and so you shouldn&#8217;t. Yes, that may mean that you join the list of people discussed at those dinners, but you&#8217;re better off just resigning yourself to that than feeling obligated to join them. So they&#8217;ll talk about you. So be it. Avoid giving them fodder to discuss, and decide you don&#8217;t care about the rest of it. It sounds like you&#8217;ll have plenty of company on the list of outsiders, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too lonely of a place.</p>
<p>And meanwhile &#8230; is this where you want to stay long-term? It&#8217;s perfectly legitimate to decide that you&#8217;re just glad to have a job and you enjoy the actual work you do, and if that&#8217;s the case, then just keep your head down and focus on that. But you might also consider at some point &#8212; down the road, if not right now &#8212; whether you wouldn&#8217;t rather go somewhere where your boss acts like a grown-up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have been networking to try and find a job as an attorney or two years! Finally, one of my contacts has been able to get me an interview with one of the most prestigious law firms in Utah. At first I thought this would give me an inside track on getting the job offer, then the interviewer asked to do the interview during lunch. This has caused a lot of anxiety. Is this a serious interview or is he just doing a favor for my contact? Is this such a hassle that he can&#8217;t take time during his normal work hours to do it? What if he asks me where I want to eat? What type of place should I choose? What if he takes me to McDonalds? How should I deal with the check (I assume he&#8217;s buying)? You can see the thoughts I have been having. What do you think?</em></p>
<p>You are freaking yourself out unnecessarily, to the point that you&#8217;re not going to be able to eat without instantly vomiting on this poor guy. Take a deep breath!</p>
<p>First, no, I would not assume that a lunch interview means that it&#8217;s not a serious interview or that it&#8217;s such a hassle that he can&#8217;t take the time to do it during his normal work hours. Some people just operate this way &#8212; if there&#8217;s a candidate they&#8217;re interested in talking to, sometimes their default is to meet over lunch or coffee, particularly if they don&#8217;t interview a lot of people as part of their normal job. It&#8217;s not uncommon.</p>
<p>If he&#8217;s like most lunch interviewers, he will probably suggest a place to eat. But if instead he asks you, just suggest a mid-priced place near his office. While some people do hold interviews in more casual restaurants (although usually more along the lines of a Chipotle rather than a McDonald&#8217;s), the more common option is to do it in a sit-down restaurant with service at your table, so if you&#8217;re put on the spot, you should suggest a place like that.</p>
<p>Assume that he is picking up the check. This is a business expense for his company. This is always the case with any lunch interview, but you can be extra confident that it&#8217;s the case with &#8220;one of the most prestigious law firms&#8221; in your state. Seriously. They&#8217;re buying.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see, some other things that you should keep in mind:</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;re concerned about what&#8217;s appropriate to order, take your cues from him. If he orders an appetizer, entree, and dessert, do something roughly the same. If he orders water and an appetizer and no entree, restrain the price of your own meal accordingly. Either way, don&#8217;t be the only one ordering dessert.</p>
<p>* Don&#8217;t order alcohol.</p>
<p>* Don&#8217;t order anything that&#8217;s really messy to eat, like barbecue or tacos, or anything that you know from experience gets stuck in your teeth, like spinach.</p>
<p>* If you know where you&#8217;re eating in advance, look at its menu online ahead of time, so that you can decide what to order in advance, rather than spending a lot of time deciding when you&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>* Be unfailingly polite to the wait staff. (You should always do this, of course, but in case for some reason you don&#8217;t, now is the time to start.)</p>
<p>This probably won&#8217;t be the last lunch interview you encounter in life. Don&#8217;t agonize over it, and prepare as you would for a normal interview, and you&#8217;ll be fine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Sending a handwritten thank-you to follow up on your emailed thank-you</strong></p>
<p><em>I’m a recent grad who’s been going through a battery of interviews lately. Usually, I’m the type of girl to send a handwritten note afterward to follow up, but the companies I’ve been interviewing with all have short time frames for making hiring decisions so I’ve been following up with emails instead. I would still like to send handwritten notes though, but I don’t want to come off as redundant. Do you have any content advice for a post-email thank-you note so that I don’t end up repeating what I’ve already said?</em></p>
<p>It should be blank, because you shouldn&#8217;t send it. Sending two thank-you notes for the same interview is going to come across as overkill. It&#8217;s too much. Sending them by email is fine to begin with, and there&#8217;s no need for another. At this point, your job is to sit tight and wait to hear back. (And good luck.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Asking to telecommute to an unpaid internship</strong></p>
<p><em>If an internship is unpaid, is it ok to ask if you can telecommute? I think this is a reasonable request, but I have found that many managers I asked to do this were either perplexed or slightly offended that I asked. I don’t want to pretend that I don’t live in the real world and that I don’t have bills to pay, because I do, and I would like hiring managers to recognize that. I want the experience, but I have eat. What is the best way to articulate this request?</em></p>
<p>Well, a lot of them aren&#8217;t going to be amenable to it, as you&#8217;re discovering. Many internships are designed to be based in the organization&#8217;s office because they involve interaction with other people, going to meetings, being available for ad hoc conversations, and other work that&#8217;s more easily done in-person. Moreover, with very entry-level work where part of the point is to provide feedback and development, managers usually find it easier to have a face-to-face relationship. So you can ask, but realize that a lot of them will say no &#8212; so make sure you do it at the very beginning of your conversation with any employer, because if you wait until the end of the hiring process, many are going to be irritated that you didn&#8217;t bring it up earlier (so that they didn&#8217;t invest further time in the hiring process if it&#8217;s a deal-breaker for them).</p>
<p><strong>3. I&#8217;m being told to donate my time to our CEO&#8217;s second organization</strong></p>
<p><em>I am the assistant to the CEO of a large nonprofit. As such, I not only help my boss, but also help out where ever needed. He recently started another nonprofit that is completely separate from the agency I am employed with. They keep different accounts, have different staff, and are a completely separate entity. I am not an employee of theirs, and their employees are not listed on our payroll.</em></p>
<p><em>Saying that, my boss who heads both organizations often asks me and a few other staff members to help out with things for this organization. They currently rent a space in our building. I love helping out, but the work is interfering with the already large work load I have. They are basically getting free labor for our agency staff, and aren&#8217;t reimbursing for any hours that we put in. Our accounting department and our independent auditor have discussed billing for our time, but there haven&#8217;t been any action made to remedy the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to approach my boss about the extra workload and how I am confused about how these separate agency fits into our own (we provide completely different services). Any suggestions? Or should I just suck it up and do the work hoping the problem will eventually fix itself?</em></p>
<p>Talk to your boss. Tell him that the work for the second organization is interfering with your ability to put your own organization first. Tell him that you&#8217;re uneasy about essentially volunteering your services for the other organization during time that you&#8217;re being paid by Organization 1, and that you&#8217;re not comfortable continuing to do it, at least not without a formal arrangement where Organization 2 is billed for your time.</p>
<p>You can also go back to your accounting department and push them to handle this, since &#8230; well, since they should. And out of curiosity, does your nonprofit&#8217;s board know that the CEO is diverting the organization&#8217;s resources to his own separate organization? If not, they probably won&#8217;t be pleased to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Is it normal for contractors not to get feedback or performance reviews?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been a government contractor working on-site for a large national institution for over 2 years. I like my job, but am becoming increasingly frustrated by that lack of feedback I receive from my manager. There are no performance reviews performed by my actual manager, who is a contractor from a different contracting company. I have the same position as eight other people and am losing my motivation to do a good job.</em></p>
<p><em>My superviser will casually say that I am doing a good job and thanks me for my work on various projects from time to time. He has even said that they couldn&#8217;t afford to lose me. The contract company I work for has almost no idea what I actually do all day and rarely communicates with me. They do an annual performance review where they basically check in with me for 10 minutes and give me a small raise, which I believe is given at the same rate to all of their other employees. I&#8217;m sure if there were a problem that was relayed to them from my supervisor I would hear about it, but positive feedback is never really relayed. I feel I am not being rewarded, financially or verbally, for doing work that is in some cases better than others who have my job. I watch one of them play video games for most of the day and ignore emails, while I work late to make sure my clients are happy. But we are treated the same.</em></p>
<p><em>This may be a fault, but I recognize that I do better and stay motivated by positive feedback. Is it normal for contractors not to recieve feedback or have a performance review with their on-site supervisor? What can I do to ask for a raise when the people who grant it don&#8217;t know what I do or how well I do it, really?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s pretty normal. In fact, it&#8217;s a widespread problem even among non-contractor employees and their managers &#8230; but among contractors, it&#8217;s often considered not even a problem, but rather par for the course with contracting.</p>
<p>You can certainly make a case for a raise by pointing to your achievements, just like you&#8217;d make a case for a raise normally &#8230; but realize that in the environment you&#8217;re working in, they may find it more efficient to treat you all as a group, without much individualized attention.</p>
<p><strong>5. Negotiating when a company has just been acquired</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently interviewed for a job with a start up. I was told that there would be no equity/stocks or options as my compensation, only the basics salary, med, 401. I agreed. My final interview is next week.</em></p>
<p><em>The company got acquired yesterday. They are eager to hire me. However, as I see it, we are now part of a larger org and my duties will increase and my initial negotiation had been with a start-up but that has changed. This situation is new to me and I would like to know what I can negotiate to get the best package due to this changed situation. Can you please advise?</em></p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a different situation now. But it doesn&#8217;t sound like you&#8217;d already discussed salary, only benefits, and being acquired doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;ll necessarily be offering equity now (in fact, it might be less likely). In any case, if they make you an offer, you can certainly ask about the changed landscape in light of the situation, and you then proceed with your negotiations accordingly. You&#8217;re not locked into anything yet.</p>
<p><strong>6. Putting church community outreach work on your resume</strong></p>
<p><em>I was just asked to help out with a community outreach committee at my church. My dream job would be to do community programming in the museum field, so it&#8217;s something that I want to do. I&#8217;m wondering if I do end up helping with community programming at the church (something I have done in the past), would it be OK to add to a resume? The community outreach is more in the way of helping people and events, not pushing the bible down their throats (ew).</em></p>
<p>Sure, you can absolutely put that on your resume. In general, assume that volunteer work can always go on a resume. Just be specific about exactly what you did, since volunteer work is often described in a vague way that doesn&#8217;t really convey what the person actually did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Remember the letter-writer last month who was wondering how and whether to give a reference for a <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/giving-a-reference-for-a-brilliant-but-abusive-former-manager.html">brilliant but abusive former manager</a>? Here&#8217;s here update.</p>
<p><em>I called my colleague on the phone and told him that I had both some positive and negative things to say, and asked that it stay off the record. He was totally cool about it, so I laid out basically what I wrote in my post: I think she could have great vision for the institution, but that she was sometimes hard to work with as she could be very sharp with her reports. I suggested that her skill set (grant writing, visioning, tech planning, etc) would potentially be really useful, but that her personnel management was weaker.</em></p>
<p><em>My colleague listened carefully and said that the position had actually been explicitly designed to have the director position be someone who could schmooze with the bigwigs, write grants, and provide vision and that his position would be actually be the one managing the employees. Great! Except he was concerned that all her &#8220;sharpness&#8221; would fall on him as the only report to her! I told him that I actually managed to have a really good working relationship with her and thought that it might not be as problematic if she only had one report to work with.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, it gave him some food for thought. I tried my best to be honest about the potential drawbacks and also be positive about the potential advantages. Some people in the comments suggested that she doesn&#8217;t deserve any kind of management job, but others commented on the possibility of putting her in a position where her strengths could be capitalized on and weaknesses minimized. My position is that I certainly don&#8217;t want to scuttle anyone&#8217;s career, but I also don&#8217;t want her damaging future institutions or employees.</em></p>
<p><em>It may be that if she&#8217;s hired they could simply be honest about what they heard? e.g. &#8220;We heard from various references that you have a history of anger management issues and while we think you&#8217;re great and want to offer you the job we need you to understand that that kind of behavior won&#8217;t be tolerated here. ABC are the consequences for such behavior.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t heard of that happening, but who knows.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I figured I&#8217;d bundle three somewhat-related salary-related questions into one post. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Should my promotion come with a higher raise?</strong></p>
<p><em>Today I accepted a promotion at work after waiting for the formal offer/salary for almost two weeks. The salary is about $5,000 less than I wanted (and I was aiming for $15,000 less than online pay scales state).</em></p>
<p><em>The thing is, it&#8217;s a decent raise from my current wage: 20%. It is also my first management position. However, I do bring skills that no one else in the company has and have produced work over the past year for which they would normally pay a consultant twice my wage. Am I being greedy in wanting more?</em></p>
<p><em>I feel foolish because I didn&#8217;t negotiate: the director who called me phrased it as though it was a great salary and I should be happy. I was stressed after waiting to find out the salary for so long (they told me right after my interview that they planned to offer me the job and they advertised for my current position a week ago). I felt like I had no choice but to accept.</em></p>
<p><em>They built this role up to sound very high-profile (significant responsibility nationally) and so I expected a salary closer to those I see online. Have I just accepted a much lower wage than this role would normally receive?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. But it&#8217;s your first management position, so you represent a risk and you&#8217;re guaranteed to need to learn on the job, and so it probably makes sense for them to pay you less than they&#8217;d be paying a more experienced and tested candidate.</p>
<p>As for salaries you see online &#8230; are you talking about salaries that you see in job listings, or salary websites like salary.com? Salary websites, unfortunately, aren&#8217;t going to give you very accurate information; they generally don’t account for the fact that job titles frequently represent wildly different scopes of responsibility, or vary significantly by type of company or geography. (You can get a far <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/05/09/how-to-determine-what-salary-to-ask-for">more accurate idea</a> by simply bouncing figures off of other people in your field, checking with professional organizations in your industry, or talking with recruiters.)</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s <em>most</em> useful is knowing what salary <em>you</em> can command on the market &#8212; you, with your particular set of skills, experience, and ability to market yourself. That&#8217;s very different from what knowing what a huge swatch of people all performing vaguely similar duties with very different skill levels at wildly different companies around the country can command.</p>
<p><strong>2. MBA working as executive assistant, disappointed in raise</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been an executive assistant at a large and prosperous firm for about a year now. Although being an EA wasn&#8217;t my original plan, when I graduated from my MBA program and spent many months applying like a madwoman and interviewing to no avail, I decided to take this job because of the security and great benefits.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve ended up loving my job and excelling at it. I frequently have to ask if there is any more help I could offer because I finish my regular tasks quickly. I received shining evaluations from the two executives I work under, and was called in to talk about my &#8220;raise&#8221; at the end of this year. It was $1,000. I was disappointed because I have received nothing but praise since starting here, and was hired at nearly $10,000 less than what I initially asked for. I figured that after a year of proving myself, they would at least try to meet me in the middle. Now I know that I should have advocated for myself more, but I was in shock at the time and unsure how to react.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve researched and even after my &#8220;raise,&#8221; my salary is significantly lower than even the low range of EA salaries listed on websites such as glassdoor.com. I have an MBA and finance/accounting experience, and now make even less than I did before I received my graduate degree. I am frustrated because I love my job, my firm, my coworkers and the company culture and don&#8217;t want to leave, but I also feel like I have sealed my fate by accepting what I was initially given and then this small cost of living raise. It&#8217;s now several months later and I feel it would be awkward to bring it up now. I don&#8217;t want to settle for less than I deserve, but I also don&#8217;t want to leave. Is it too late?</em></p>
<p>Well, again, websites like glassdoor or salary.com aren&#8217;t going to give you very accurate information. See #1 above. But you could probably get more reliable information by talking with recruiters or people with similar jobs at similarly sized companies in your area.</p>
<p>However, what you definitely <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to do is to base your raise request on having an MBA or on what you made before your graduate degree. It needs to be based on the value you bring to the company. Simply having an graduate degree doesn&#8217;t generally warrant a higher salary in most fields, particularly in a role that doesn&#8217;t require one; salary is about the value of the work you&#8217;re doing to the company. Are you using the MBA in significant ways in your role? If not, then you can&#8217;t reasonably expect that it will factor in to what you&#8217;re paid. (Although if you <em>are</em> using it in significant ways, and if that&#8217;s not something generally expected of the person in your role, then it can become part of your case.)</p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that depending on what percentage it is of your total salary, $1,000 might not be such a paltry raise. The average raise nationally is 3%. I don&#8217;t know what you earn, but if you&#8217;re earning close to the national average income of $43,000, 3% is $1,290, or pretty close to what you got. Of course, if you&#8217;re not an average performer, you deserve more &#8212; but it might be useful to know that it&#8217;s not the shocking insult that it might have seemed at first.</p>
<p>In any case &#8230; It&#8217;s not too late to go back and say that you think you&#8217;ve earned a larger raise. Here&#8217;s some advice on how to <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/04/11/10-tips-for-negotiating-a-raise">make that case</a>. Just make sure that you base it on your value to the company in your current role and what you&#8217;ve achieved there.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>. Boss doesn&#8217;t care if people leave over money</strong></p>
<p><em>I have worked in the accounts department of a property management company for 5 years. There are approximately 45 employees. I am happy in my job, most of my coworkers are great, the hours are flexible, and it&#8217;s close to home.</em></p>
<p><em>My boss is the owner of the business and is very tight when it comes to paying anyone what he should or what they are actually worth. Four years ago, I spoke to him about a raise and questioned whether he does performance reviews because I had been there over a year and nothing had been mentioned. Prior to speaking to the boss, I asked a coworker about the procedure for a review and pay raise, etc. and they told me not to bother, because &#8220;the boss doesn&#8217;t give raises.&#8221; I was really surprised, but I didn&#8217;t let it stop me from asking for one anyway. So, when I spoke to the boss and stated my case as to why I deserved a raise, he confirmed he doesn&#8217;t do annual reviews, but would consider my request for a raise. A month went by before he told me he had decided to give me the raise, but it was a very small one.</em></p>
<p><em>Since then, I haven&#8217;t approached him about another raise, but I know I certainly deserve one! Mind you, the company has had quite a few employees leave because they have asked for more money and the boss has knocked them back. He thinks everyone is dispensible, so he doesn&#8217;t care if they leave. So, recently, I have been thinking perhaps I should state my case again, but instead of asking in person, should I put it in writing? I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s going to be worth my while even though I know he doesn&#8217;t pay me what he should. I feel stuck inbetween a rock and a hard place &#8212; I don&#8217;t want to leave my job but I am finding it hard to earn so little. It also makes me feel unappreciated too. I&#8217;m not afraid to ask him for a raise in person but I feel like it would be a waste of time. What do you think my next step should be?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no advantage to putting in writing over asking in person. In fact, asking in person is usually the better route, since it allows for an actual conversation.</p>
<p>But, you know, you&#8217;ve been there five years. If your boss won&#8217;t give you the salary you want, it would make more sense to either move on or accept that you&#8217;re staying for reasons of your own (whether it&#8217;s liking the work, your coworkers, the flexibility, or whatever). This is what your employer pays for the work you do and it&#8217;s up to you whether to accept it or not accept it, but it&#8217;s not really fair (or good for your own state of mind) to accept it and then complain that he&#8217;s cheap and not paying people what they&#8217;re worth.</p>
<p>So either you want to stay under these terms, or you don&#8217;t. But trying to have it both ways is going to frustrate you endlessly, and probably won&#8217;t get you what you want.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Remember the reader whose <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/11/my-new-networking-group-uses-high-pressure-sales-tactics.html">new networking group used high-pressure sales tactics</a>, including requiring members to promote and buy from other members&#8217; businesses and pushing members to get friends to attend their meetings? Here&#8217;s her update.</p>
<p><em>You were right &#8211; SCAM! </em></p>
<p><em>I joined this so-called &#8220;networking group&#8221; in mid-October and by early February, members started dropping. In November, we were at 9 people, and although another chapter in our city kept claiming they had 4 or 5 new applications per week (yeah, right), our growth seemed to stagnate. </em><em>When we were at 5 remaining members, we met with our chapter&#8217;s coordinator (a paid position, working for this company) and expressed our concerns. She tried to rev us all up about re-launching the chapter, etc., which frankly seemed like a lot of work for little return. </em></p>
<p><em>We questioned her pretty intensely about the future of the chapter and the promises made to all of us when we paid our membership fees, including whether some of us could transfer our membership to the other, supposedly more-successful chapter. She finally got angry and told us that none of us could transfer to the other chapter without paying the membership fee again and that none of us were getting our money back for any reason, &#8220;because that&#8217;s just not how the company works.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I spoke to my boss and offered to pay back my membership fee; she said that wasn&#8217;t necessary, just find something else that works better. Since I left the group, I have spoken to several other current and former members, and learned a lot about this company and its &#8220;founder and CEO&#8221; &#8212; none of it good, but we did seem to do some bonding during these information-sharing sessions! </em></p>
<p><em>It was a good decision to leave, I just wish I had researched it more before I joined &#8212; lesson learned. I&#8217;m spending more time with the community and volunteer groups I like and with whom I have interests in common &#8212; people who already know me and trust me, and are likely to send business my way when they remember I&#8217;m around.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s terse answer Thursday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Manager wants to know if I&#8217;m looking for another job &#8212; and I am</strong></p>
<p><em>The company I work for is very small. Salaries are significantly below market rate and turnover is high. I have been in my position for almost two years. The majority of our department has left in the past six months and another employee just recently resigned. My boss is new to the company and is surprised by constant turnover. He just pulled me aside to ask if I was looking as well. I am.</em></p>
<p><em>I didn&#8217;t answer outright. I was honest that many in my age bracket (entry level up to a few years of experience) don&#8217;t stick around long-term because promotions here are awarded based on tenure and not performance (another post altogether but trust that this is true and not speculation). I told him I had doubts about my ability to move up within the company.</em></p>
<p><em>He had good reason to ask; he wants me to take on accounts that have been shuffled around to five different people in the last year and doesn&#8217;t want to have to reassign them again. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that these accounts had not been previously handled by an entry level employee until staff turnover necessitated it. Although he&#8217;s new, I do really like him so far and don&#8217;t want to mislead him, but how can I handle that without putting my current job in jeopardy? Also, I&#8217;ve been looking for several months and am finally getting calls for phone interviews (thanks to your blog!) So I will (hopefully) have to deal with this sooner than later.</em></p>
<p>Well, first, I&#8217;m a big proponent of being transparent with your manager when you&#8217;re ready to move on &#8212; but only if your manager makes it clear that it&#8217;s safe for you to do so. So you&#8217;ll have to judge whether or not that&#8217;s the case here, and since it sounds like he might be new enough that you don&#8217;t know that, it&#8217;s fine to err on the side of safety rather than potentially jeopardizing your own job. That doesn&#8217;t mean promising him that you&#8217;re absolutely not looking, but you can go with a middle-ground answer instead. For instance: &#8220;If someone came to me with an opening that gave me opportunities that I don&#8217;t have here, I&#8217;d have to consider it, but I don&#8217;t have any current plans to leave.&#8221; And when it does come time to leave &#8212; well, things change and people do move on when the right opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should employers offer more flexible interviewing arrangements?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m curious to know your thoughts on whether firms should allow for flexible interviewing, like giving candidates the option to request first round video interviews or out of hours interviews at evenings or weekends.</em></p>
<p><em>My thought is that employees are typically expected to be at work during a certain time frame (8 to 5, etc), and as such, they should be willing to interview during the company&#8217;s standard hours. In all of my years interviewing for jobs, never have I asked to do it after hours. It seems to me that, while yes we would want the candidate to want to work for us, we also want them to work for us, which would mean following the basic rules. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d necessarily want to hire someone who wants me to bend the rules for him or her, especially in something as simple as interviewing. I&#8217;m on board with occasionally having off-times for interviewing if a candidate just can&#8217;t get away from their current job, but I&#8217;ve always managed to do it. I&#8217;m more flummoxed by idea of offering first-round video interviews. If it were an out-of-town candidate, I can see that; it saves money for both company and candidate. But if it&#8217;s a local candidate, I fail to see why the candidates can&#8217;t be expected to use initiative. Lunch break, using PTO, and so on. Is this more of the bending-over-backwards that the younger generation seems to expect, or is it becoming the new norm?</em></p>
<p>It depends on the candidate, and it&#8217;s important to keep in mind that your job is to hire the best people out there. So for a desirable candidate who I really wanted to recruit, or for a hard-to-fill position, I&#8217;d be as flexible as I could and do a first-round interview by phone or Skype (although if we moved forward, I&#8217;d want to meet in person), and I&#8217;d try to work around their work commitments (especially given that the most desirable candidates are often already employed). But on the other hand, if I&#8217;m already skeptical that someone is the right candidate, particularly relative to others, I&#8217;m not likely to come in on a Saturday or arrive before breakfast.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see requests to meet at a non-standard hour as a candidate not following the rules, but rather as a reality of what might be an inflexible work schedule. You don&#8217;t have to accommodate the request, but you shouldn&#8217;t hold it against them for asking.</p>
<p><strong>3. Translating application materials for a spouse</strong></p>
<p><em>My husband is applying for some engineering jobs in Spain that specifically emphasize fluent English skills. Spanish is not required, but is mentioned as a plus (among other languages). My husband doesn&#8217;t speak Spanish, but I am a Spanish teacher. He asked if I could translate his resume and cover letter so that he could submit them in both English and Spanish. His thinking is that providing the Spanish would be helpful to anyone at the company who doesn&#8217;t know English well. I think that not only is it a little presumptuous, but it also might inadvertently misrepresent his language skills. There are no specific instructions for this on the job postings. Who do you think is right? Also, would it be okay to mention in the cover letter that his wife is fluent in Spanish, or is that a taboo topic?</em></p>
<p>You are right, and your husband is wrong. It would indeed misrepresent his language skills (and if the company needs applications translated, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re prepared to handle that on their own, so it&#8217;s not likely to come across as &#8220;considerate&#8221; but rather as &#8220;look, I have Spanish skills&#8221;).</p>
<p>He also shouldn&#8217;t mention in his cover letter that you&#8217;re fluent in Spanish, because it&#8217;s not relevant to his qualifications for the job. It will come across as if he thinks it is, and that will be confusing. (Is he implying that you&#8217;ll translate things for him if he&#8217;s working there? Or just that he has some exposure to Spanish? It&#8217;s not clear, but either way, it doesn&#8217;t belong on his application.)</p>
<p><strong>4. Managing people older and more experienced than you are</strong></p>
<p><em>After some company restructuring and a few people leaving, I&#8217;m being promoted to a (newly created) supervisor position. I&#8217;m one of five writers on our production team, and most of them have been there longer and are ten years older than I am. Our team is fairly tight-knit, and I&#8217;m friends with several of them outside of the office. I was hoping you could give some advice on managing a team of people older and more experienced than you, especially when you have worked with them as a peer? I&#8217;m not a confrontational person by nature, and I really have to fight &#8220;asking&#8221; people to do things rather than telling them &#8220;this needs to be done.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Coincidentally, my <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/my-book">book</a> co-author Jerry Hauser and I just wrote about this topic over at The Management Center. Rather than repeat it all here, I&#8217;m just going to link you to what we said there:<br />
<a href="http://managementcenter.org/managing-older-staff">http://managementcenter.org/managing-older-staff</a></p>
<p>One other thing I&#8217;ll add is that you don&#8217;t need to be &#8220;confrontational&#8221; to manage people. You just need to be matter-of-fact about what needs to be done (as opposed to being overly hesitant or overly aggressive) and believe me, your staff will appreciate you being straightforward rather than making them guess what you want. (And speaking of things that I&#8217;ve written with The Management Center, chapter 10 of our <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/my-book">book</a> &#8212; the chapter on exercising authority without being either a wimp or a tyrant &#8212; might be really helpful to you.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Am I applying for jobs too early?</strong></p>
<p><em>I want to get a job (nothing special, probably just data entry), but can’t start until mid-May because of prior commitments. I started applying to jobs yesterday, figuring if anyone called me it’d be in a few weeks or months. But someone called me about one of the jobs this afternoon. I’m assuming that since they’re calling so quickly it means they need someone right away and won&#8217;t want to wait until mid-May.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not sure what to do. Am I applying too early for this type of job? Talking on phones is really stressful for me, and now I’m afraid that I’m going to have to keep making phone calls just to find out I can’t be considered because of when I’d be able to start working.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s really hard to time this type of thing perfectly. If you wait, you might not have found work by the time May comes around, so it really does make sense to start looking now. But that also means that you might hear from employers who want you to start sooner than you can. And that&#8217;s fine &#8212; you can simply let them know your timeline and ask if that works on their end. Frankly, it&#8217;s not that far off &#8212; only seven weeks, and many hiring processes take longer than that &#8230; even when they start out moving quickly in the early stages.</p>
<p><strong>6. Leaving a job early to work overseas</strong></p>
<p><em>I graduated from undergraduate last spring and in November, I was lucky enough to start my first job at an international nonprofit, which was exactly the kind of place I was hoping to work.</em></p>
<p><em>Ever since I studied abroad in China, though, I have been itching to go back. I just found out I got into a selective two-year Peace Corps-like teaching fellowship in rural China, which is a dream opportunity that would certainly help my Mandarin language skills, likely relate to potential graduate study, and would allow me to work for a great cause with a solid alumni network. I&#8217;m pretty sure I want to accept, and I feel that it would be much more difficult to do something similar in a few years when I am more settled in the US with such luxuries as furniture I didn&#8217;t get used off Craig&#8217;s List and maybe even a car. (I also have a pile of student debt, but I could defer my loans while I am on the fellowship.) However, I might have to be in China as early as mid July or August for this program, which would mean that I would leave my job after less than a year of being there.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel very grateful for my job, and I do not want to let down my supervisor or burn any bridges. The job is definitely administrative and I expect that the basic tasks of the position would remain the same if I stayed on for longer, and I gather I would have to stay at the organization for several years before I would move into any other position. How heavily would leaving my job early weigh in the future?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the end of the world, and you can do it once. You may or may not burn the bridge with your organization. (Leaving after three months, you almost definitely would; leaving after nine or ten, you&#8217;re more likely to get away with it, but they won&#8217;t be pleased.)</p>
<p>This is not license for people to take jobs intending to leave them in a short period of time that they know the employer would never have agreed to up-front, because that&#8217;s still not okay. This is a bit different though &#8212; I assume you didn&#8217;t know that you&#8217;d get into this program when you applied and otherwise were planning to stay in your job for a while.</p>
<p><strong>7. How important is it that your resume and LinkedIn profile match?</strong></p>
<p><em>How important is it to have your resume and LinkedIn profile be similar? I understand that LinkedIn can be a platform to highlight more skills and attributes for past/current jobs.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, is it important to have your LinkedIn profile open to the public? I am still wary of having personal information on the Internet, let alone my resume. Do you have to list every job on LinkedIn as you do on the resume while searching?</em></p>
<p>Your resume and LinkedIn don&#8217;t need to be identical. In fact, LinkedIn gurus would tell you that what&#8217;s appropriate for a resume format isn&#8217;t appropriate for LinkedIn, and that if you really want to take advantage of LinkedIn, you should be presenting your information in a format better suited for the site anyway. That said, obviously if your job dates and titles don&#8217;t match up, that&#8217;s going to be a red flag. But sure, you might choose to mention one job on your resume and not on LinkedIn if you don&#8217;t care to highlight it there.</p>
<p>As for making your profile public, you certainly don&#8217;t need to, but you&#8217;ll really be missing out of the point of LinkedIn if you don&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>Here&#8217;s the deal: I work for a small nonprofit. There are currently 10 of us. I like the work I do but am on the lookout for new positions, as the organization is looking to merge with another organization at some point and I might be out of a job then anyway.</em></p>
<p><em>I had an interview a few weeks ago and I mentioned offhand that the company is small (I can&#8217;t remember the context, but it seemed relevant at the time). The woman I was interviewing with wrote down that there were 10 people in the company, and underlined it many times. I noticed, so I quickly followed up with &#8220;even though it&#8217;s a small organization, we are a consulting firm so I work with dozens of clients at any given time,&#8221; and made a mental note to never mention company size again.</em></p>
<p><em>Fast forward to last week, where I was asked by a recruiter what the bonus structure is at my current company, and I said that we don&#8217;t have one. He was taken aback by that, so I said &#8220;it&#8217;s a small nonprofit, so no bonuses,&#8221; and he asked how many people there are. I hesitated for a moment before being honest, since it would take about 30 seconds of research to see the staff listings on our website.</em></p>
<p><em>So, does size really matter? Am I hurting my chances at getting another job because the company is so small? I&#8217;ve worked for very large companies in the past, and can&#8217;t really see how a small company would be damaging. I work with the same number of people (probably even more in my current company, since there are fewer people to do the work) and am busier than I have ever been. I&#8217;ve been here for 3 years, and would like to move on at some point, but part of me thinks I should push to leave faster, since staying here long term might work against me. Any thoughts?</em></p>
<p>Size can matter or not, depending on the type of work that you do.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re, say, a therapist working one-on-one with clients, then it probably doesn&#8217;t really matter whether you work for a small 10-person practice or a large state agency. The meat of your work is basically the same, regardless (with some exceptions, which I&#8217;ll get to in a minute).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re, say, an HR director, then size does matter. Your job is going to be very different if you&#8217;re dealing with HR issues for a 15-person company versus a 3,000-person company. You&#8217;re going to have more people reporting to you, a larger budget you&#8217;re responsible for, a broader and deeper range of issues to handle, and you&#8217;re going to be working with more stakeholders, many of whom are very senior themselves. Similarly, managing I.T. for 40 users is very different than managing it for 4,000. Doing media relations for a small trade association is different than doing it for a large and high-profile union. And so forth.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that bigger equals better. It&#8217;s just different. If you&#8217;ve been at smaller companies, you might know how to thrive in a more agile culture and be comfortable with more flexibility in your role. That can be attractive to an employer. On the other hand, you might chafe at the structure of larger companies, and that can be a concern as well. The reverse is also true: Smaller employers often worry that someone coming from a large, very bureaucratic environment will have trouble adjusting to a fast-paced culture where decisions are made in minutes instead of months and where they&#8217;re expected to wear multiple hats. (And actually, this is a reason that company size might be noted even in the therapist example above; even when company size doesn&#8217;t affect the actual <em>work</em> you do, an employer might wonder how you&#8217;ll adjust to their differently-sized culture and environment &#8212; but again, that&#8217;s more about cultural adjustment than the actual work you were doing.)</p>
<p>And yes, some interviewers do see &#8220;large company&#8221; as shorthand for &#8220;this person was able to excel in an environment with more competition&#8221; and &#8220;small company&#8221; as shorthand for &#8220;this person hasn&#8217;t yet been tested in a large, complex environment.&#8221; And sometimes that&#8217;s accurate, but often it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Good interviewers will look at what you achieved wherever you were &#8230; but &#8212; as the examples above show &#8212; sometimes the size of where you&#8217;re working really <em>does</em> impact the work that you do, and it&#8217;s helpful to be realistic about whether that&#8217;s the case for you or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I have a significant problem with my former managers that is coming to a boiling point, and I could use some advice how to tread the political waters.</em></p>
<p><em>In my former role, I was the technical lead in a project that soured because it fell behind schedule when I had to leave the company for a few months on medical disability. When I returned to my role, my manager tried to cut corners at every turn and harassed me daily for results, but never involved himself or allowed me the resources to train anyone else to assist me. Needless to say, I went looking for and found another job due to the poor working environment, even though I loved the project.</em></p>
<p><em>I received a job offer at a nonprofit group supported by my former employer, but my now-current employer made a significant error in publishing my name in a presentation as an employee before I had signed an offer. When my former employer came across this error unbeknownst to me, I was &#8220;highly encouraged&#8221; to leave in order to stay on good terms. I was not given sufficient time to finish the project or train anyone else, nor were adequate replacements found; i.e. the people offered to cover my roles had no knowledge of the programs the data is stored in. I estimated that I needed a month to finish my work and train a new employee, and I was given 5 days.</em></p>
<p><em>Nevertheless, I wanted to make sure that this project was successful, so I set a written agreement with my current manager and my former director that I would spend no more than 5% of my time to assist with questions or remaining work items. Given that I had some time in the first few weeks on the job, I worked more like 20-50% on my former employer&#8217;s work to try to reduce further obligations. I cannot get my former manager to agree to compensate me for this time.</em></p>
<p><em>I have at least 40 hours left to come to a deliverable for my former employer, but spending any more time on this will prevent me from meeting deadlines at my current job. I could not meet a recent deliverable because I was out with the flu for almost a week, but apparently this isn&#8217;t a reasonable excuse to my former manager or former director, as both are now breathing down my neck for me to work on my former project against the terms set in my agreement.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I go back and play hardball and require that I be compensated for any further work? Even though I have continued to work for the company in this limited capacity, I lost my annual bonus for last year by being offered the position at the time. Given that the non-profit I work for receives donations from my former employer, I fear that angering these people by requesting a reasonable timeline or compensation will only burn bridges.</em></p>
<p>I wrote back and asked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did your agreement with them spell out compensation terms?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Did it specify an end date?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And what&#8217;s your current employer&#8217;s stance on you still doing work for the old employer and the possible complications you&#8217;re encountering?</p>
<p>Her response:</p>
<p><em>I asked for a consulting arrangement when I left, and my former director refused at the time. Given that his company funds my nonprofit, he cites that he&#8217;s &#8220;paying me regardless of what I work on.&#8221; However, he said that as long as we remained on good terms, then he would look into a consulting arrangement for large-scale work.</em></p>
<p><em>I think he&#8217;s being unethical in using his political leverage with my current employer to ask me to work for free (even if it is 5%, but particularly for this large update) but I don&#8217;t know how to approach this without burning bridges on both sides.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no end-date to the agreement as it was meant to offer limited sales assistance and training if/when the project moved forward.</em></p>
<p><em>The major problem is that my current employer does not communicate well. I have informed them of these conflicts and received no response from them &#8212; no reply whatsoever. So, I continue to get heated emails from my former employer with no recourse.</em></p>
<p><em>I am at my wits end here. I feel as if I have no choice but to hire an employment attorney, but this could really set fire to the situation.</em></p>
<p>Okay, this is all kinds of messed up.</p>
<p>First of all, you have no obligation to your former employer to work for free. None. Zero. Even if they were paying you &#8212; which they aren&#8217;t &#8212; you wouldn&#8217;t be obligated to continue working for them as long as they chose it; you have control over who you work for, for what pay, and for how long.</p>
<p>The problem here is that your current employer is dependent on your old employer for part of their funding, which puts them in a subservient position to your old employer and probably makes them reluctant to make waves. That&#8217;s understandable to a point &#8212; but only to a point. There&#8217;s some point where this has gone far enough that they&#8217;re going to need to be willing to take a stand &#8230; or they&#8217;ll need to be willing to lose you over it, but that would be pretty crappy of them, given that it was <em>their</em> error (publishing your name as an employee before you were) that put you in an awkward position with your old employer to begin with.</p>
<p>Your former employer&#8217;s claim that they&#8217;re &#8220;paying you regardless of what you work on&#8221; because they fund your employer is ridiculous. That&#8217;s not how grant-giving works. There&#8217;s also probably some legal regulation in play here about one nonprofit donating staff time to another (and your organization will need to report it), but I&#8217;m just guessing there &#8212; and really it&#8217;s beside the point anyway.</p>
<p>You have two choices: You can accept the situation and let it continue to play out, for as long as that takes, or you can speak with your current and former employers and insist that this arrangement come to an end. However, because of the funding situation between your current and former employer, you&#8217;re going to need to coordinate your actions with your current organization &#8230; and if they&#8217;re not willing to back you in taking a stand, then you&#8217;re out of luck. At that point, you&#8217;d need to either accept it or look for another job.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where I&#8217;d start: Talk to your current employer. You say that you&#8217;ve tried in the past and have received &#8220;no reply whatsoever,&#8221; which makes me think these conversations were over email, rather than in person. You need to talk in person. Schedule a meeting &#8212; an official one, with whoever has decision-making power in this situation; get it on that person&#8217;s calendar. Then sit down with her, and say something like this: &#8220;When I left Old Organization, I agreed to continue to help them finish up this project, using up to 5% of my time on it. It has now been X weeks/months, and I&#8217;ve spent far more than 5% of my time on it &#8212; closer to X%. They have refused to compensate me for this work. At this point, it&#8217;s interfering with my ability to do my job here, I&#8217;m unhappy with the way Old Organization is pushing me to do more than I&#8217;m able and refusing to pay me, and I need to tell them that I&#8217;m no longer able to continue working for them. I think this is more than reasonable, and that I&#8217;ve done far more than most former employees do when they&#8217;ve left an employer. However, I&#8217;m sensitive to the relationship between New Organization and Old Organization, and so I want to alert you to what&#8217;s going on. I plan to let Old Organization know this week that I can&#8217;t continue our arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<p>(And by the way, if for some reason you can&#8217;t get a meeting with the person you need to talk to, and they stick to their previous &#8220;no response&#8221; stance, then you should simply put the words above into an email and send it to them. That will give them fair warning of what you intend to do, and they can talk to you about it if they object. Make sure you do give them a few days to respond before you move forward.)</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s the risk here: Depending on how worried your new employer is about their funding from your old employer, they may tell you to simply consider this work part of your job for <em>them</em>. And then you&#8217;re out of luck &#8212; because if it&#8217;s part of your job for them, you have no real argument to use. You can, of course, ask them to decrease the rest of your work so that you have time for this other project, but that&#8217;s the only option you&#8217;ll have at that point.</p>
<p>But if that doesn&#8217;t happen, then it&#8217;s time to talk to your old employer (or email them, so you have it in writing). Let them know that you need to curtail your work on this project due to your other obligations. Hell, mention your health if you want &#8212; you said you were out sick recently.</p>
<p>Normally I would say to simply tell them that you&#8217;ll transition it over to whichever contact person they designate &#8230; but in light of the funding situation, you&#8217;re going to need to be more accommodating than that. Instead, you probably need to tell them that you can do X more hours of work over the next X weeks, but no more, in order to give them time to come up with another arrangement. The reason for this is that &#8212; as ridiculous as this arrangement is &#8212; you actually did agree to it. And while it&#8217;s an awful enough arrangement for you that normally you could just pull out without guilt, in this case the fact that your current employer depends on their good will means that you&#8217;re going to have to be nicer about it, and not give them the chance to argue that you already agreed to this.</p>
<p>But honestly, what&#8217;s most likely to happen is that your current employer is going to direct you to do this work under the auspices of your job for them. But that will at least be better than your current situation.</p>
<p>(I should also add that there&#8217;s a small but not inconceivable possibility that your current employer will decide that you taking a hard-line stand on this is more than they want to deal with and will simply decide to part ways with you, so you need to factor that into your thinking as well before you proceed. You mentioned you were considering talking to a lawyer, which you might want to do simply so you understand the lay of the land if indeed that happens. I don&#8217;t see any legal issues here so far &#8212; and bringing in a lawyer while you&#8217;re still working there is guaranteed to ruin your relations with both employers, which will make it hard to continue working there &#8212; but a lawyer could potentially advise you <em>in the background</em>, as well as advocate for you if your current employer did decide they wanted to part ways. Which, again, is only a small possibility, but one you should be aware of.)</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s to being very, very careful about taking a new job with anyone who&#8217;s financially dependent on your old boss.</p>

When should you expect to hear from them, if ever? Is it okay to check in and ask?</p>
<p>While in general, it’s best not to nag employers to respond to you, there <em>are</em> a few times when it’s okay to check in and see where your application stands. The rules are different, though, depending on whether you’ve simply submitted an application or you’ve been interviewed. Over at U.S. News &amp; World Report today, I talk about when you should and shouldn&#8217;t follow up, and how. You can <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/03/13/how-to-check-on-the-status-of-your-job-application">read it here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s wee answer Wednesday &#8212; six short answers to six short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Giving notice when your job has changed</strong></p>
<p><em>Up until 4 months ago, I loved my job. I was hired for a very specific channel of communication and I was passionate about the work I was doing. I thought I was doing a good job, and I was meeting my benchmarks. But then I was told that since I had been in my role for 2 years (as had my colleagues) that we were to switch responsibilities and I watched my passion and love go to a colleague while I took on a new role. Had the new role been advertised on a job board I would never have applied. I had literally no interest in my new work and unfortunately my poor attitude showed. I take responsibility for showing my disdain and lack of interest in learning my new role. Due to that, during my review I was put on probation/performance review for the end of the year where I struggled with the new role.</em></p>
<p><em>I had been looking for a new job ever since the role change. I am very close to receiving an offer, we are working out the details. At the same time I have a review to for my progress in 3 weeks. Do I still give the normal 2 weeks notice? If I am already on probation, is it likely I will get canned immediately? Also, my boss will be away for the next two weeks on assignment. I don’t find it fair to push my start date back for my new employer based on her being out. If it was already planned on her part, can I still give two weeks even if she won’t be in?</em></p>
<p>Your employer just assigned you to a whole new job because you&#8217;d been in your old one for two years and it was &#8220;time to rotate&#8221;? Did you have any warning that your company operated this way, and have you seen them do this with others? Because that&#8217;s bizarre if you didn&#8217;t know that was part of the deal when you accepted the job.</p>
<p>In any case, yes, you should still give two weeks notice, because not doing so is generally seen as unprofessional and would give them legitimate reason not to give you a good reference in the future (which hopefully you can still get for your first role there). That said, you should be prepared for them to tell you that there&#8217;s no need to work out the full notice period and to leave earlier. But you certainly don&#8217;t need to delay giving notice until your manager is back in the office. Call her, or if you can&#8217;t do that, give your notice to her manager or HR.</p>
<p><strong>2. Should you list your desired salary when it&#8217;s optional?</strong></p>
<p><em>I just applied for a position at a large, internationally known nonprofit. The competition to work there is intense. On their web application, they have an optional box to fill out your desired salary. I left it blank since it was optional, but now I&#8217;m wondering if I cut down my chances to work there. I understand that there are probably many people applying for the position and I may not get an interview based on others being better potential fits. But I do want to know for the future &#8212; should I list my desired salary, even if it&#8217;s an optional choice?</em></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t list it. If you name a number without having even spoken with them about the job yet, you might potentially under-cut yourself and end up with a salary lower than what you might have obtained if you had waited until you could negotiate later in the process. Or you might be taken out of the running altogether for asking for too much or too little (the latter sometimes signals that you&#8217;re at a more junior level than they&#8217;re seeking). They made it optional, so I&#8217;d treat it as truly optional.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do I have to take my break when my boss tells me?</strong></p>
<p><em>I arrived to work for a 8-10 hours shift, and my boss said that I have to go on break an hour after I get there. I said to him, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that defeat the purpose of a break?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, go on break.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to take a break when I&#8217;m tired a little later when I need one.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>I went on break but am not happy with this as it happens a lot. I was wondering if this was ok. It doesn&#8217;t seem right and we don&#8217;t like when it happens. I live in upstate NY.</em></p>
<p>Depending on the time and length of your shifts, you might be in luck. New York&#8217;s laws on breaks are a lot more specific than many other states&#8217; break laws. (And many states don&#8217;t require breaks at all.) In New York, you have to be offered a 30-minute lunch break between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. for shifts six hours or longer that extend over that period, and a 45-minute meal break halfway through your shift for shifts more than six hours starting between 1 p.m. and 6 a.m. (If you&#8217;re a factory worker, the breaks have to each be 60 minutes.) For shifts that start before 11 a.m. and last later than 7 p.m., you&#8217;re also entitled to an additional 20-minute meal break between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty unusual though. In most states, your manager can tell you when to take your break, whether that&#8217;s when you want to take it or not.</p>
<p><strong>4. Interviewing for your own job during a restructure</strong></p>
<p><em>Due to the current financial strain at my current employer, our department is to be restructured. We are reducing the number of staff but will be performing the same duties, requiring the same skills. Nothing else will change. How do you approach a competitive interview where you already know the candidates as they are all your work colleagues? They know you equally well. We all have the same strengths and skills. We are all highly qualified with equivalent qualifications. We can all perform the job very, very well and have all been very successful in our careers.</em></p>
<p><em>Do you have any advice on how you can be successful in a competitive interview under these circumstances?</em></p>
<p>Prepare for it just as much as you&#8217;d prepare for an outside interview; don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking that because you know the job and the organization well, you don&#8217;t need to do much preparation. Spend some time following the advice <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2011/09/26/how-to-answer-behavorial-interview-questions">here</a> on how to prepare for behavioral interviews &#8212; you want to do a lot of advance thinking about how you&#8217;ve excelled in different types of situations related to the job: how you&#8217;ve handled difficult customers, how you&#8217;ve taken initiative to solve problems, how you&#8217;ve handled a large workload &#8212; whatever specific situations are relevant to the job. You want to go in prepared with a bunch of examples of how you&#8217;ve done these things awesomely. You also want to think about why you should be one of the people hired &#8212; what is it about you that&#8217;s fantastic? Figure out how to communicate that as well. And last, you might be asked for your thoughts about internal matters that you know about first-hand (related the company’s operations, challenges, etc.), so come prepared to talk knowledgeably (to the extent possible) about those types of things as well. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>5. Why didn&#8217;t this hiring manager get back to me after I was personally referred and she said she&#8217;d schedule an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>Last month, I applied for an opening that I&#8217;m highly qualified for. I have experience working on the organization&#8217;s issue and I meet both</em> <em>the general and preferred qualifications. The hiring nonprofit also happens to be a coalition partner of the nonprofit I recently interned for. </em><em>Three people from the organization I interned for recommended me to the hiring manager &#8212; the president, a department director who is also my former supervisor, and a mutual contact. The mutual contact also introduced me to the hiring manager at an event we both attended. When we spoke, she asked me to send a follow-up email. She said she would review my application materials and schedule an interview.</em></p>
<p><em>I followed up that same day. Five weeks have passed and I haven&#8217;t received a call or email. I haven&#8217;t followed up again because I don&#8217;t want to seem pushy. What should I do and what do you believe is going on?</em></p>
<p>She&#8217;s disorganized, or she decided to move forward with other candidates instead, or the job is on hold, or all kinds of other possibilities. It&#8217;s not being pushy to send a follow-up when you&#8217;ve been personally referred to a job or when the hiring manager told you she&#8217;d be in touch to schedule an interview. Both of these things are true here, so you have double reason to not feel pushy. Follow up right now, today, with an email telling her that you&#8217;d still love to talk if the position is still open and she thinks you&#8217;d be a strong candidate.</p>
<p><strong>6. Can employer forbid me from drinking water until my break?</strong></p>
<p><em>Is it legal for my boss to tell me that I cannot drink water until my break? I work in a factory that gets extremely hot, and recently my boss implemented a rule that we can&#8217;t drink anything until we go on break. We already have people passing out from the heat and several other questionable rules.</em></p>
<p>OSHA worker safety regulations require that employers to maintain safe working conditions, including access to drinkable water. However, OSHA makes determinations in this area on a case-by-case basis, rather than having one blanket rule. A receptionist in an air-conditioned office with regular breaks may not need to drink water at her desk, and in most cases employers could legally prohibit it. On the other hand, in a hot factory without frequent breaks, OSHA would probably require that you be allowed more frequent access to water. (Although that&#8217;s strictly a guess on my part; a lawyer could tell you more definitively.)</p>
<p>One complication: OSHA regulations also require that employees NOT be allowed to have beverages in an area where they could be contaminated with toxic or infectious materials, so if that&#8217;s your manager&#8217;s concern, it would make more sense. (Although then OSHA would presumably require that you be given more frequent breaks to drink water, given the heat.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I just started a new job a few months ago at a great company &#8212; it&#8217;s a well funded start-up, and I&#8217;m really excited about the opportunity. The only issue is that most of my colleagues are in their early to mid-20&#8242;s, live in the city where the office is located, and hang out together frequently &#8212; go to the gym, go out for drinks after work, etc. On the other hand, I am in my mid-30&#8242;s, married, with young children, and live about an hour-and-a-half away from the city by a very-limited bus and ferry schedule, and thus really need to bolt out the door right at 5 pm so I can be home by 7.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;d like to find some way to bond with my colleagues, and get to know them on a more personal level. Any suggestions?</em></p>
<p>Ask people to have lunch with you, or to grab coffee.</p>
<p>Also, be an awesome coworker &#8212; helpful, responsive, and good at your job. That goes a long way.</p>
<p>And if you can swing it with the limited bus and ferry schedule, you could go to the occasional happy hour &#8212; not every month, but maybe once or twice a year.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I wouldn&#8217;t worry too much about joining in this social extravaganza. Yes, it does help to have good relationships with colleagues, and getting to know people in a more relaxed environment can help with that &#8212; it&#8217;s generally easier, after all, to feel cheerful instead of resentful about fielding someone&#8217;s last-minute, could-have-been-avoided-with-better-planning request for help when you&#8217;ve shared a beer with them and discussed your mutual crush on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Kit+Harington&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DoQ_UdeFHYTS0gGNzoCgCg&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1314&amp;bih=671#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=Kit+Harington+jon+snow&amp;oq=Kit+Harington+jon+snow&amp;gs_l=img.3..0.4826.5850.0.5960.9.3.0.6.6.0.101.226.2j1.3.0...0.0...1c.1.5.img.w8uzK1L9R4c&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.43287494,d.dmQ&amp;fp=7083ed61e8f9587e&amp;biw=1314&amp;bih=671">Kit Harington</a> than if you only know them as the guy down the hall who always wears khakis. But the reality is that you&#8217;re at a different stage of life than most of your coworkers, your interests are probably going to be somewhat different, and you can accomplish a perfectly reasonable amount of coworker bonding through the stuff above, without feeling like you need to leave your spouse home with your kids while you do shots (or bench press, or whatever) with your coworkers.</p>
<p>Anyone want to advise differently?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I perform the same job functions as a couple other people in my office. There&#8217;s one person who consistently does more work than the rest of us combined. She works late into the night, sometimes late into the next day, she gives up most of her weekends and always makes sure we know how stressed and busy she is and how much she&#8217;s working.</em></p>
<p><em>My problem? I want to do work, too! I like to be busy. But she hoards almost all of it. I&#8217;ve asked her for stuff when she complains about how stressed she is, but she says she has trouble delegating.</em></p>
<p><em>I also have let my boss know that I&#8217;m low on work, and I have also let her know that I am free and available and eager to take on others&#8217; work to lighten their loads. Nothing really changes, though.</em></p>
<p><em>The part that kills me is that the hoarding colleague gets all of the praise for sending emails at 3 a.m. on Saturday or for the very long hours she works and her incredible rate of output. I don&#8217;t even have enough work on my plate to put in those kinds of hours. And frankly, it also seems like she&#8217;s being rewarded for something that is completely unnecessary. She&#8217;s working such long hours because she won&#8217;t pass off work that others could tackle for her. It&#8217;s starting to make me feel both angry and not very valued here. I go home having little to show for my days sometimes.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, my boss is risking losing two people: one of us will burn out, and the other will leave out of boredom.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there anything you could suggest I do? Or is this just one of those things that won&#8217;t change? Maybe I need to start looking elsewhere? I&#8217;m tired of spending my days surfing the internet and trolling the office for tasks while my colleague drowns under a mountain of work and gets praised for it, while I feel like a useless slacker.</em></p>
<p><em>I should also add that I am good at my job and knows that my boss thinks so, too. This isn&#8217;t because I&#8217;m seen as incompetent (at least, to my knowledge!). This colleague has just been here longer and has a far deeper understanding of this place. I&#8217;m very happy here otherwise, but if this continues, I feel like I may need to think about other options.</em></p>
<p>Talk to your coworker, and if that doesn&#8217;t work, talk to your boss.</p>
<p>To start, you need to lay out the problem more directly for your coworker than you already have. Don&#8217;t just ask for work when she&#8217;s complaining about being stressed &#8212; that makes it sound like you&#8217;re offering to help her with a problem she has, and that it&#8217;s up to her whether she wants help or not. Instead, you need to make it clear that this is a problem for <em>you </em>&#8211; and that&#8217;s the crucial distinction.</p>
<p>Schedule a meeting with her &#8212; and possibly with the other people performing the same function as you two, depending on where they stand on this &#8212; and say that you&#8217;d like to discuss a better system for dividing workload. Then, be explicit. Say something like, &#8220;I do not currently have enough work to keep me busy, and it&#8217;s very frustrating to me. I need more work to do. At the same time, Jane, I see that you&#8217;re very busy. Since we&#8217;re all charged with performing the same work, we need a better system to divide workload so that it&#8217;s more evenly spread between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>If she resists, say, &#8220;My job is the same as yours, and yet our workloads are very different. And while I understand that you prefer to do this work yourself, I need to take some of it on, both because it is my job to do so and because it is my strong preference to have a fuller plate.&#8221; (And frankly, if you&#8217;re willing to, you might consider adding in that you&#8217;re at the point where it&#8217;s affecting your satisfaction with your job, because you are and it might be helpful for her to hear that.)</p>
<p>Come to this meeting prepared to suggest a new way of dividing up work. For instance: &#8220;My thought is that I can take everything related to A, B, and C, while you handle D, E, and F.&#8221; Or if the nature of your work doesn&#8217;t lend itself to that, &#8220;Let&#8217;s meet at the start of each week and figure out how to evenly divide that week&#8217;s projects.&#8221; Or just simply, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to start handling A, B, and C.&#8221; Or whatever &#8212; just come prepared with a proposal and share it.</p>
<p>If she argues with your proposal, then say, &#8220;Okay. What division would you prefer?&#8221;</p>
<p>If she absolutely won&#8217;t come around, then you say, &#8220;Okay. I think we should talk with (manager) about this and see if we can figure out a better solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you talk with your manager. And you should be fairly candid about the fact that you&#8217;re frustrated with this, and that you&#8217;ve tried to solve it to no avail. That&#8217;s something your boss needs to know. After that conversation, you should have a better idea of whether this is going to change or not.</p>
<p>One other thing, though &#8212; it sounds like there&#8217;s a dynamic where you&#8217;re <em>asking</em> your coworker to share work with you, and she&#8217;s talking about not wanting to <em>delegate</em> it to you. But if you&#8217;re equals, how is she getting all this power over the work to begin with? How is it hers to delegate or not?  I don&#8217;t know what type of work you do and how it&#8217;s assigned, but it&#8217;s worth looking at how it&#8217;s all ending up with her in the first place. If someone else is assigning it directly to her, that&#8217;s an issue to tackle too. Or if it&#8217;s up for grabs but she gets to it first, you may need to change your habits in that area. It&#8217;s hard to say without knowing how the work is generated in the first place, but don&#8217;t neglect this piece of the issue.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s tiny answer Tuesday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. What to wear for a Skype interview</strong></p>
<p><em>I had my first Skype interview on Saturday. I got an email on Friday saying the position I applied for was a &#8220;hot&#8221; position and they wanted to know if I could interview on Saturday morning. I&#8217;d never done it before, but said yes. I set it up and did makeup and hair and put on a nice blouse (yoga pants on the bottom) and did the interview from my dining room table in a very quiet environment. The interviewer was in an office and in a suit. It went okay, but it was a bit awkward for me, mostly because it was my first time using Skype. Also, the job is in fundraising for a nonprofit (fairly casual unless dealing with donors in person, more casual than not). Are you expected to be in full-on interview attire for a last-minute Skype interview, especially on a Saturday morning? It felt like a test (more so than most interviews are), but maybe I am being paranoid.</em></p>
<p>Well, all interviews are tests, by definition &#8211; but yes, generally you should wear full-on interview attire for a Skype interview, regardless of when it takes place. Basically, if you agree to interview, you agree to the full interview enchilada, even if it&#8217;s on a Saturday morning, unless they tell you otherwise in advance.</p>
<p>Not wearing a suit jacket isn&#8217;t likely to be a deal-breaker though.</p>
<p><strong>2. Employee calls out sick due to self-inflicted sickness</strong></p>
<p><em>We have an employee who has a diagnosed chronic illness which is manageable by diet, lifestyle, and medication. However, the employee misses work being out sick to the point where they are being docked pay. The real issue is when the employee shares any &#8220;stories&#8221; from their weekend (and then missing half a day the following Monday for sickness), it is evident that they are making diet and lifestyle choices that are leading directly to them missing work, as well as not taking any medication (or improperly taking it) to alleviate the symptoms. I know it sounds harsh and no one doubts the existence of the illness, but it seems the real problem is the employee&#8217;s attitude towards their well-being. Any suggestions?</em></p>
<p>Stop judging her reasons for being out as either legitimate or self-inflicted. It&#8217;s irrelevant, and it&#8217;s not really your place to judge. Your employee&#8217;s attitude toward her own well-being isn&#8217;t your business. What you need to do instead is to focus on whether the employee is sufficiently reliable and at work enough of the time. She could have the most sympathetic reasons in the world or the least sympathetic, but ultimately the question is whether she’s there reliably or not.</p>
<p>Respond to is the overall picture &#8212; she&#8217;s there enough or she&#8217;s not; she&#8217;s reliable enough or she&#8217;s not &#8212; and don&#8217;t get hung up on the reasons.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can my employer make me train a new employee?</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a front desk representative at a hotel. I&#8217;ve been working here for about 7 months. I was told to start training a new front desk representative. I have no experience on training, and quite frankly, it&#8217;s stressful. Is it legal to get an employee to train new employees rather than a manager doing this? Or are we at least in the right to get some type of bonus from doing this?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s perfectly legal. Employers can assign employees any tasks they want, with the exception of work that&#8217;s government regulated, like performing surgery on someone or writing a prescription. And not only is it legal, it&#8217;s pretty common to be asked to train coworkers. You don&#8217;t typically get paid extra for it; it&#8217;s part of the job.</p>
<p><strong>4. Manager sleeps on the job and gave me a bad review</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been in the corporate world for 12 years &#8212; 5 with my current employer &#8212; and have always received solid, if not stellar, reviews. This past week, in my annual review, I was given a &#8220;partially meets&#8221; review and was stunned as it does not reflect the work I&#8217;ve done. My manager even said that as he was giving the review! HR has changed requirements so that everyone on a team can&#8217;t receive &#8220;meets&#8221; or &#8220;exceeds&#8221; even if they do. I understand that, but I am having a really hard time with this especially as I had been told all year what a good job I was doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Compounding the problem is the fact that my manager sleeps at his desk every single day! I am always answering the emails and phone calls I get when employees can&#8217;t reach him, in addition to my work. It&#8217;s a running joke on our team (his boss doesn&#8217;t know he does this) but it&#8217;s very hard for me to not be resentful of this review in light of the fact that he is literally asleep on the job. (No, he does not have a medical condition.) How do I act professionally and not let this review ruin my career? Right now I am angry, sad, etc. because I know I do good work. And do I report his sleeping to any higher-ups? I don&#8217;t want it to look like revenge for my review, but I also have been tired of it for a while and feel like this was the last straw.</em></p>
<p>You have a manager who sleeps on the job every day and an HR department that directs your manager to give you misleading feedback on your performance review. You&#8217;ve been there 5 years, more than enough time to put it before it&#8217;ll look like you left too quickly. Rather than trying to find a way to feel good about the situation, why don&#8217;t you look for a job somewhere better managed?</p>
<p><strong>5. Where on your resume should you include references?</strong></p>
<p><em>I graduated from college almost a year ago. My career advisor told me to keep my resume to one page (which I saw you also recommend to recent grads). She said I can put references on a second page, which I&#8217;ve done. Is that acceptable, or should the references be included on one page? If a second page with references is okay, can I submit the two together (they&#8217;re in the same document), or should I keep them as separate files?</em></p>
<p>Keep your references on a separate page from your resume. Your resume shouldn&#8217;t include references at all; they should be provided only when an employer specifically requests them. That&#8217;s partly because you want to know when your references are going to be contacted so you can give them a heads-up, and partly because it can look a little naive to send them along with your resume if they weren&#8217;t requested.</p>
<p><strong>6. Company asked me for an interview but then never responded again</strong></p>
<p><em>Almost exactly a month ago, I applied for a position and received an email back from the hiring manager expressing an interest in having me come into the office and meet her and the rest of her team for an interview. She emailed me on a Thursday afternoon, asking me for my availability for the following week. I politely and enthusiastically responded (without being obsequious) giving her a few dates and times I was available in the following week.</em></p>
<p><em>Then I never heard back from her. At all. Not a peep. I sent her a follow-up email about a week later, reiterating my interest in the position and giving her a few more potential dates/times in the week following. Nothing in response then, either.</em></p>
<p><em>WHAT GIVES?! Well, no, that&#8217;s a silly question that you&#8217;ve covered ad nauseam on your website: sometimes people are just unfathomably rude/sometimes people just get super busy/sometimes people are disorganized. Or any combination of, or all three. That said, I&#8217;m wondering if it wouldn&#8217;t be worthwhile to follow up one more time before officially writing this position (and company) off. If so, how do I word my email? I don&#8217;t want to come across as grovel-y and desperate, but I also don&#8217;t want to seem snotty or demanding, either (not matter how irritated I am about them vanishing without a word). What do you think?</em></p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose by trying one more time, as long as you&#8217;re not going to be devastated if you once again don&#8217;t hear back. You could certainly say something like, &#8220;You reached out to me about interviewing for the X position on February X. I&#8217;d still love to talk with you if you&#8217;re still interviewing. I&#8217;m attaching my materials again for you reference, and hope to hear from you.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>7. Explaining why I&#8217;m leaving my job over pay</strong></p>
<p><em>I have been with my company since 2009, starting out as HR assistant and subsequently promoted in 2011 to HR director. I knew at the time of my promotion that I was accepting a low-end salary for the position because I was still completing my degree and had only two years of HR experience (I later discovered through an archived company email that I was getting paid $10,000 less than the low end of the pay scale &#8212; that was depressing). Because of these shortfalls, I accepted the salary in 2011 and have since received two &#8220;exceptional&#8221; evaluations in the position with consistent good feedback from my boss. However, as I am coming across student loans and some other personal expenses that were not present a few years ago, I am barely making ends meet with my salary. Even though my pay did increase slightly with the completion of the degree, it does not even cover half the cost of my monthly student loans.</em></p>
<p><em>Aside from the pay issue, I am happy in my position, but I am beginning to apply to jobs in the hopes of a better financial future. Unfortunately, my company is experiencing tight budget constraints, so I am sure they could not match any reasonable offers out there. What should I say to potential employers during the interview when asked why I am leaving my current job? I do not want to come across as just looking for a fatter paycheck (it&#8217;s just necessary to pay the bills now!). I am not sure how to frame my reasoning for leaving that sounds positive to employers.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;My company is facing a difficult budget situation right now, so I want to explore other options.&#8221; Don&#8217;t get into any of the other details.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Remember the recent letter-writer whose interviewer wanted her to <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2013/02/interviewer-asked-me-to-rate-my-interview-on-a-scale-of-1-to-10.html  ">rate the interview on a scale of 1-10</a>? Here&#8217;s her update.</p>
<p><em>I just wanted to write to give you a quick update on what happened following the interview.</em></p>
<p><em>HR called me today to inform me that they would not be pursuing my candidacy any further. The lady was very gracious and told me that the primary reason was that they had reservations regarding my communication skills. I asked her if she could give me any details or examples as this would be extremely helpful to improving myself, and she said that the director had been concerned that I did not respond to his question on the rating and thought it might be an indication of certain gaps there.</em></p>
<p><em>I was quite surprised, especially when she wondered why I was not able to give an answer. I told her when I&#8217;d responded (that I thought it was for him to rate me, etc), and it eventually turned out that the director had wanted to know how I thought I&#8217;d done with respect to the objectives that I&#8217;d had prior to the interview (i.e., did I feel I had accomplished what I&#8217;d wanted in the interview). Needless to say, I wish he&#8217;d actually said those missing words, or that I&#8217;d thought of that angle (I didn&#8217;t&#8230;the only context that jumped to mind was him wanting to know my rating of my own performance). It would have made such a difference!</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m of course disappointed about how things turned out, but I&#8217;ll use this as a learning experience for my next interviews and hopefully things will go much better next time!</em></p>
<p>The only thing you should learn from this experience is that people who seem like jackasses generally are.</p>
<p>And there are two of them here: the interviewer who asked you an unclear and fairly useless question in the first place and then rejected you for not answering it in the way he wanted, and the HR person who thought this was legitimate enough feedback to pass along.</p>
<p>(And to recap: It wouldn’t have been unreasonable for him to ask you for your thoughts on the job and your fit for it at the end of the conversation, but he asked you a question that was unclear, unlikely to provide useful information, guaranteed to make most candidates uncomfortable, and that put you on the spot. And he refused to answer the same question when you asked it back to him.)</p>
<p>Not all feedback is useful, and there&#8217;s a danger in drawing lessons from experiences like this. If you heard that your interviewer rejected you because you wore a blue tie, you wouldn&#8217;t conclude that you should avoid blue ties from now on; you&#8217;d conclude that that person was ridiculous and you wouldn&#8217;t want to work with them anyway. The same applies here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve worked at my current job for 14 months. There are 17 people in my division: 4 managers, 4 admin assistants, and the rest are professional staff. I am professional staff.</em></p>
<p><em>It goes without saying that it is the job of the admin assistants to cover the phones during office hours. However, years before I started here, the managers decided that the admin assistants, as the lowest paid in the office, should have the additional benefit of leaving between 3:30 and 4:30, when the office does not close until 5. The reasoning is because they have families to care for and long commutes and need the additional time. I have no problem with this part of the arrangement.</em></p>
<p><em>I was not hired to answer phones&#8230;at all. I&#8217;m an analyst. I work with numbers, not people, and I like it that way. I also have no skill for customer service. Knowing this, I asked during my interview if I would need to answer phones. I was told no. Also during the interview, I asked if I would be able to work from home 2 days a week. I was told yes. I was also told I would have flexible work hours. I did not get this in writing, but none of the three people I interviewed with are disputing my claim.</em></p>
<p><em>Flash forward to my first day of work: I was told by my manager that I need to temporarily cover the phones from 4:30-5 until they could hire someone to take over. So, I have to cover phones and my &#8220;flexible work hours&#8221; must cover 4:30-5, which I wasn&#8217;t planning on. I also can&#8217;t work from home, but that was because of policy that says all teleworking employees must have one year of service.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been covering the phones all this time and I finally have my year of service, so I decide to revisit the issue with my supervisor. All I&#8217;m getting is &#8220;this isn&#8217;t a good time for that.&#8221; He&#8217;s not wrong. Everyone is strapped for time and resources. But from my point of view: I left my previous job solely for those three benefits. My pay is the same. My work is the same. I wanted greater flexibility with my time and to never need to talk on the phone as part of my job again.</em></p>
<p><em>What should I do? I&#8217;ve told my manager that I&#8217;m unhappy with the arrangement and that I expect a timeline on when I can use these benefits that I was guaranteed in my pre-employment period. Other than this, I like where I work and who I work with.</em></p>
<p>Grrrr.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that they probably didn&#8217;t intend to pull a bait and switch on you, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ve ended up doing. They lured you into switching jobs with promises that they&#8217;re not keeping. It&#8217;s really unfair &#8212; and it&#8217;s also not good management, because organizations need a staff that believes managers will keep their word. Moreover, getting a reputation for making promises during hiring that they don&#8217;t keep once you&#8217;re actually working there will impact their ability to attract good candidates in the future.</p>
<p>In any case, the basic steps in a situation like this are to: (1) explicitly say that you were made promises that aren&#8217;t being met, (2) see how the organization responds, and (3) decide how much of a deal-breaker it is to you if it doesn&#8217;t change.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell from your letter how much of #1 you&#8217;ve done so far. You&#8217;ve met with your manager and asked to stop covering the phones, but have you been explicit with your manager about the fact that you were promised these benefits before taking the job, that you left your previous job specifically for these three benefits (this is key to say), and that you haven&#8217;t been allowed to use them in the year since starting? If you haven&#8217;t spelled that out, it&#8217;s an essential part of addressing this now. You&#8217;d want to say something like, &#8220;I specifically asked about these areas before being hired, and I left a previous job that I was happy with in large part because of these three benefits, which I was promised. Everyone agrees that I was indeed promised these things; that&#8217;s not in dispute. I appreciate that there&#8217;s no easy solution for this and so I&#8217;ve been flexible in helping out in this area. But it&#8217;s been a full year now, and I&#8217;d like someone else to cover these areas, so that the company can honor the original agreement it made with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>From there, though, it&#8217;s up to your manager to decide whether to act ethically or not. If he refuses to change anything, then you&#8217;ll need to decide whether this is a deal-breaker for you or not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><em>And now a break to talk about a sponsor…</em></p>
<p>Food plays a big role in the workplace – from catering for client meetings and employee events to group lunches and meals for people working late, food is on an awful lot of our minds at work. But if you’re ever charged with managing these food orders, you&#8217;re well aware of <a href="http://www.seamless.com/business/events-resources/watch-our-video/">what a pain it can be</a> to keep track of who needs their food vegan, who always wants extra pepperoni, and who doesn&#8217;t like anything from the deli and always wants sushi instead … as well as processing invoices, chasing down budget codes, and filling out expense reports. At some point you&#8217;ve probably thought to yourself that there should be an easier way to manage it all.</p>
<p>Enter Seamless. With a corporate account from <a href="http://www.seamless.com/business">Seamless</a>, all of your office food ordering hassles are about to end. Seamless streamlines the entire process with online ordering, access to hundreds of local caterers and restaurants, easy capture of all billing and budget codes, complete enforcement of all your budgets and rules &#8230;. and you get only a single invoice for all orders, no many orders and no matter how many separate people are ordering.</p>
<p>The group ordering option is basically the holy grail of office food management: You can send your coworkers a link to use and let them place their own orders without involving you at all. All the orders get aggregated and sent to the restaurant, and then they arrive all at the same time, individually labeled and bagged.</p>
<p>And it’s all done online, so you don&#8217;t have to talk to anyone. Which is ideal if you&#8217;re like me and hate the phone. And you can log in whenever you want to run expenditure reports, etc. &#8212; again, without ever having to talk to anyone.</p>
<p>It. Is. Awesome.</p>
<p>You can use Seamless for catering, group orders, individual meals, and more. And businesses that use Seamless say that they save up to 30% in food ordering costs because it streamlines the whole process.  (They even have a savings calculator <a href="http://www.seamless.com/business/events-resources/savings-calculator/">here</a> if you&#8217;re skeptical.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Seamless for a couple of years now, and it&#8217;s on my list of Top Services That I Love. Seriously, <a href="http://www.seamless.com/business/more-info/">get started right now</a>.</p>
<p><em>Disclosure: This post was sponsored by Seamless. All thoughts and opinions related to Seamless are my own.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s mini answer Monday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Do I have to disclose my relationship with a student?</strong></p>
<p><em>I recently started a new job at my alma mater, working in a business school (part of a large university) after having graduated 1 year ago and worked a first job elsewhere.</em></p>
<p><em>Before applying for the job (but after graduating), I was involved intimately with an undergrad student who started the program a couple years behind me and whom I originally met while I was still enrolled as an undergrad. I have continued to be involved with her since. I am now fully in my role working for the school, and the undergrad student and I are dating.</em></p>
<p><em>My role is in a business development capacity with graduate level programs, meaning I am not a professor, instructor, grader, or even working with the program in which she is enrolled. I am still involved in unofficial and informal capacities with undergrad aspects as an alumnus (coaching, mentorship, informal advice to those involved in the programs which I was involved in &#8211; this includes working with the student in question). I am curious if I have any obligations to report this relationship to HR or the union which represents me. Or even worse, if this could get me in trouble.</em></p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d say to ask your manager or HR, but since you have a union, ask them. Universities are notoriously squicky about relationships with students. In your role, it may not be an issue, but given that you&#8217;re in a university setting, you&#8217;re far better off disclosing it up-front than being confronted about it later on.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does this mean I didn&#8217;t get the job?</strong></p>
<p><em>I went on an interview today, and I thought it went well. I got a business card at the end and felt very comfortable with the interviewer. However, when I asked what the timeline was for hiring, she mentioned that the interview process is going to take a while because she wanted to give all the great candidates a chance, but that she would be in contact with me. Does this mean I didn&#8217;t get the job?</em></p>
<p>Nope. It means that they have other candidates who they&#8217;re interviewing and it&#8217;s going to take a while. Take it at <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2013/01/is-this-employer-signaling-that-they-plan-to-offer-me-a-job.html  ">face value</a>. Take all of it at face value &#8212; the feeling comfortable and getting the business card <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/10/01/6-job-search-signs-that-dont-actually-mean-anything">doesn&#8217;t mean anything either</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Are these application directions non-negotiable?</strong></p>
<p><em>I generally send my resume as a PDF, because I&#8217;ve found that some computers and/or versions of Word tend to screw up my formatting. Generally, this isn&#8217;t a problem, but I found a job posting that I am very interested in, and they mention that they want a &#8220;Word resume.&#8221; From an HR perspective, would that be non-negotiable? Would this be one of those &#8220;applicant can&#8217;t follow directions&#8221; things, and should I rework my entire formatting to make sure that it works no matter what?</em></p>
<p>Yes. If they&#8217;re asking for it in Word, you give it to them in Word. Or you get discarded for not following directions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Should I give my company feedback about their management?</strong></p>
<p><em>For the last 4-5 years, I&#8217;ve received a .2% average raise (accounting for inflation). After benefits, I&#8217;m actually making less than I did in 2008. Last year I was written up for offering some constructive criticism of leadership&#8217;s vision and given no raise. I have tenaciously studied leadership for the last few years while accomplishing all my normal duties (and doing an awesome job at it). I&#8217;ve applied elsewhere, but the competition for leadership positions seems to be very high. I am not willing to risk my income to offer feedback that is perceived as unwarranted, unnecessary, and &#8220;won&#8217;t be tolerated.&#8221; I could write a lot more, but it is enough to say that the culture where I work is quite toxic and I honestly wish I could work to change this. Do I dare bring up more conflict or should I continue sticking my head in the sand?</em></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve made it very clear that they&#8217;re not interested in hearing it, and that they&#8217;re willing to penalize you for offering it. There&#8217;s no upside to going out on a limb on this (other than that it might feel good on principle, but it will feel less good if it jeopardizes your job).</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, studying leadership (by which I&#8217;m guessing you mean, at least in part, management) is no substitute for actually leading and managing, and in general companies aren&#8217;t thrilled to be told that they&#8217;re doing it wrong by people without experience running companies themselves. That&#8217;s in no way intended to defend your company&#8217;s actions, because it&#8217;s ridiculous to respond to feedback the way they did, but it&#8217;s worth factoring into the way you&#8217;re looking at this, overall.</p>
<p><strong>5. Coworker is rude and dismissive when she reviews my work</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a colleague who used to be my supervising manager and is no longer. Her role still dictates that she review my work and provide feedback, but I am now directly supervised by her supervisor (the president/owner of our small company).</em></p>
<p><em>When I present my work, ask questions, explain how I came to solutions,etc., she is often extremely disrespectful &#8212; texting or talking on her phone, yawning, looking at the clock, interrupting me and/or answering me as though my questions/comments/etc. were poorly conceived or downright stupid. After almost two years of this, I have lost confidence in my work, in my ability to articulate information and in my respectability as a professional and as a human. My supervisor&#8217;s solution is for me to &#8220;toughen up&#8221; and ignore her, but I&#8217;m not sure I can continue doing that. Should I try to have a conversation with her about how disrespectful and hurtful her actions are? Is there another possible solution?</em></p>
<p>Keep hurt feelings out of it. Instead, you could say, &#8220;I get the sense that you&#8217;re frustrated when we speak, especially when I ask questions. You often seem in a rush to end our meetings. Is there something you&#8217;d like me to be doing differently?&#8221;</p>
<p>She might tell you something you didn&#8217;t know (like &#8220;you take an hour with this stuff when I can only allot 15 minutes for it&#8221; or &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem to pay attention to feedback I gave you in the past, requiring me to repeat it again&#8221;), or she might be jolted into realizing she needs to behave differently. Or not &#8212; she might continue totally unchanged. She might just be a jerk.</p>
<p>The thing is, though, you don&#8217;t have any control over her; you only have control over how you respond to her. Do you really want to give random jerks the power to make you feel this horrible? That brings us back to your boss&#8217;s advice, which I think is meant to tell you that you&#8217;re taking her behavior way, way too personally. I know it&#8217;s unpleasant to deal with someone like this, but it&#8217;s about her, not you. Because someone professional and not-a-jerk wouldn&#8217;t treat you that way, no matter what you were doing to provoke it. Therefore, it&#8217;s not about you.</p>
<p>Sometimes we end up working with jerks; you&#8217;re giving this one too much power over how you feel about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>6. When a company keeps interviewing but not hiring</strong></p>
<p><em>What is happening when companies go all the way through first and second stage interviews but then change recruiters and start the process all over again? I have gone through the second stages and twice now there has been silence, then the job has been re-advertised with new recruiters (with no changes). I am then always the first to get a call for the role from the new recruiter as I have some fairly niche skills that are an exact match.</em></p>
<p><em>All second stage candidates are being rejected, so I am not losing out to someone with a better fit, and while racking my brains what I could have got so badly wrong, I just can&#8217;t see it &#8212; and due to the silence there is no feedback to go on. I know that some interviews do turn out just to be fishing expeditions, or the jobs get pulled, but that doesn&#8217;t feel like the case here.</em></p>
<p><em>Is it possible I am unknowingly doing something at the second stage that is so awful I am wiped off the map? I am not new to the interview process, and this is the first time I have come across this. It seems perversely picky, as the jobs remain unfilled, with all candidates rejected.</em></p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s possibly that you&#8217;re not interviewing well, but it&#8217;s also possible that the company simply doesn&#8217;t think any of the candidates that have been presented to them are quite what they&#8217;re looking for. Some positions are hard to fill for various reasons &#8212; either the job requires some tricky combination of skills, or they really care about culture fit and are going to be picky for that reason, or the manager is hard to work for and they&#8217;re looking for a personality match &#8230; or sometimes they&#8217;re just very picky. There&#8217;s no real benefit to speculating since you can&#8217;t know for sure. You&#8217;re better off just moving on.</p>
<p><strong>7. Turning down a coworker</strong></p>
<p><em>One of my colleagues asked me out on Facebook via a private message, and I avoided the question. What makes this problem worse is I secretly like another one of the coworkers! And I am not attracted to the one that has asked me out. The workplace is a very close family-like environment. My normal comeback is &#8220;sorry, I&#8217;m taken,&#8221; but on this occasion it won&#8217;t work, as I like the other guy. How do I let the one that has asked me out down without making it uncomfortable to return to work with him? And if I let the one I like know, what can I say to the one that has asked me out without making work become awkward?</em></p>
<p>First of all, &#8220;avoiding the question&#8221; is unkind. You need to straightforwardly say no to this guy. And&#8221;sorry, I&#8217;m taken&#8221; isn&#8217;t ever a good response because it implies that you&#8217;d be open to dating the person if you weren&#8217;t committed elsewhere. &#8220;No, thank you&#8221; is the response I&#8217;m looking for &#8230; following by &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not interested in dating you&#8221; if he persists.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d reconsider whether you should be dating <em>anyone</em> you work with if it&#8217;s a &#8220;close, family-like environment,&#8221; because that will be uncomfortable if things don&#8217;t go well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Ugh, it&#8217;s the dreadful Daylight Savings! How I despise it, with its end to winter and all that is cozy and wonderful.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s also short answer Sunday, and so we have seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. When a company encourages applications without specific openings</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you do when a company doesn&#8217;t advertise actual job openings on their website? They simply say &#8220;Think you&#8217;d be a good fit? Apply here!&#8221; and it opens a blank email for you. How do I apply to something I don&#8217;t even know exists?</em></p>
<p>You write a cover letter based around the type of work you do, and why you do it well. What type of opening would you want to see them have? That&#8217;s the one that you write your cover letter about.</p>
<p><strong>2. Do I have to tell my manager the reason for my doctor&#8217;s appointment?</strong></p>
<p><em>I have a . . . shall we say, &#8220;lady problem.&#8221; I assumed/hoped it was the kind of lady problem that could be resolved with an over-the-counter treatment, but since it hasn&#8217;t gone away and an at-home screening kit showed a potential issue, I may have to see a doctor to resolve it. Not sure yet, I&#8217;ll keep an eye on it over the weekend, but if the problem&#8217;s still there on Monday I&#8217;d like to see a doctor ASAP.</em></p>
<p><em>Of course, this isn&#8217;t something I want to tell my manager about, since my manager is a guy. Heck, my team lead is a woman and I don&#8217;t even think I want to tell her. But I&#8217;m afraid if I don&#8217;t disclose the reason they&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m up to something (or that I&#8217;m dealing with something much worse and possibly reprehensible), or that I was just faking. Is there a way I can remain vague without raising suspicions? Or should I just come out and tell my manager the reason?</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s absolutely no need to tell your manager the reason! Person medical things are no one&#8217;s business. You can just say, &#8220;I have a medical thing that I need to deal with right away, so I need to leave early this afternoon for a doctor&#8217;s appointment.&#8221; Your manager isn&#8217;t going to think you&#8217;re &#8220;up to something&#8221; unless you have a pattern of last-minute absences or unless he&#8217;s bizarrely paranoid (in which case, you have bigger issues to deal with).</p>
<p><strong>3. Unexpected reference call for a peer</strong></p>
<p><em>I was called out of the blue by a recruiter asking me to give a reference for someone who I&#8217;ve worked with as a peer. We aren&#8217;t close, but we have done a few things socially in the past. The problem is, she was let go from my current company over a year ago for poor performance. I was not her supervisor or in any kind of position to comment on her work, so I really have no idea what she expects me to say as a reference. (And no, she did not give me any kind of a heads-up that she was using my name either!)</em></p>
<p><em>I feel somewhat indebted to her, however, because she referred me to my current position. We trained together for a job about three years ago. She seemed competent and intelligent and, as I said, we did go to a few social things together. But after the training we went to different departments and a year later she accepted a position at my current company. When my company had a position open, she thought of me and passed my résumé along to the hiring manager. About a month after I was hired, she was let go. I&#8217;m not even sure on the specifics because I was not working closely on her accounts, but I know it was performance related.</em></p>
<p><em>I pretty much told the recruiter that I was her peer, not in a position to comment on her work, but she was a reliable person and I did enjoy working with her. I did not mention that she was let go. What else could I have said in this situation? And how can I politely ask her not to use me as a reference in the future? I don&#8217;t want to damage the relationship or connection, but the situation made me very uncomfortable!</em></p>
<p>I think you handled it well. Saying that you were a peer and not in a position to evaluate her right is exactly the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Some people do put down references without alerting those people, and some people do use peer references (although they really shouldn&#8217;t &#8212; reference-checkers want to talk to managers, and when I see peers on a reference list without managers, it raises a red flag). But you can certainly steer her away from doing it again. Say something like this: &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like I can give a useful reference, since we only worked together for a month and I wasn&#8217;t in a position to evaluate your work.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>4. Explaining why I don&#8217;t want a management job anymore</strong></p>
<p><em>About a year ago, I was promoted to a supervisor role, which I have since realized is not a good fit for me. As a result, I&#8217;m looking to return to a senior analyst role, but I am finding a lot of resistance from prospective employers. In a recent interview for a position that was eerily similar to the position I had before becoming a supervisor, I told them I was looking to return to a role that allowed me to use my analytical skills and that I truly enjoyed that type of work more. But I could tell the hiring manager was worried I may up and leave, as there were no future opportunities in the department, and I think that is why I didn&#8217;t get the job, even though HR said my references were great. How can I make it clear in an interview that I have no management aspirations, at least not in the near future, without it sounding negative? Is there a good way to say you feel more comfortable as a worker bee rather than a supervisor?</em></p>
<p>You have to be straightforward about your reasons, and you have to be convincing. Interviewers are programmed to suspect that you&#8217;re just saying that because you need a job, so you need to be believable. Explain whatever it is that you prefer about non-management roles, and be persuasive. For instance, &#8220;The whole time I was managing, I was constantly thinking about how much I wanted to get back to an individual contributor level, which is where I&#8217;m more comfortable. I&#8217;m really excited about this job because ____, and I&#8217;d be thrilled to stay in a role like that for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>5. Correcting executives&#8217; grammar when proofreading</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a veteran administrative assistant with years of experience supporting executives at all organizational levels. The one thing they seem to have in common is a preference for using the reflexive pronoun &#8220;myself&#8221; when &#8220;me&#8221; would be correct (i.e., &#8220;Please feel free to contact Jane, Tim, or myself if you have further questions&#8221;). At times, with supervisors with whom I am particularly comfortable, I have made the edits and let them know that in similar cases that they should use &#8220;me&#8221; instead of &#8220;myself&#8221; (with a brief explanation of the grammar rule), and am generally ignored. Complicating the issue is that many people seem to think that &#8220;myself&#8221; is the correct pronoun, so when they see &#8220;me&#8221; used in memoranda and/or email, they assume it to be a mistake. This drives me bonkers. Is it worth trying to explain the rule to a superior while editing and revising documents and/or communications? Can you recommend a tactful (and perhaps more successful) way of framing the conversation, or would it be best to not die on the reflexive pronoun hill?</em></p>
<p>Stop trying to educate them. Make the correction when you&#8217;re proofreading something, but don&#8217;t bother with the explanation. Unless you think they&#8217;re going to change it back because they&#8217;ll think YOU&#8217;RE wrong, in which case I&#8217;d put a note in the margin, but you should be as un-schoolteacher as possible about it. Don&#8217;t deliver a lecture on the rule. Just say something like, &#8220;I know people think &#8216;myself&#8217; is correct, but it&#8217;s actually &#8216;me&#8217;!&#8221; &#8230; and that&#8217;s only to ward off the likelihood of them thinking you&#8217;re mistaken and changing it back if you don&#8217;t explain.</p>
<p>But as for educating them in general? Not the hill to die on.</p>
<p><strong>6. Help, I&#8217;ve been put on a PIP!</strong></p>
<p><em>I work in a company and recently got a bad review from my manager. He mentioned that I will be put on a performance improvement plan (PIP), and also suggested that I find another position. This comes out of the blue, and he has been acting regularly or even nicely in the past few months.</em></p>
<p><em>He said this is the decision from both him and HR. When I talked to HR, the HR manger was reluctant to explain the policies and rules to me, and now I feel that everyone around me seems to know about it and act differently. I am actively looking for a job but I just need some time. What is my best strategy now?</em></p>
<p>Try as hard as you can to meet the terms of the PIP (it should spell out specifically what improvements you need to make), and if you&#8217;re unclear about its terms or how this works, you can ask HR to explain it to you again, and they should. But more importantly, be actively looking for another job &#8212; because often once you&#8217;re put on a PIP, the writing is on the wall and you&#8217;re likely to be let go at the end of it.</p>
<p>If you think that&#8217;s a foregone conclusion, you could also try saying to your boss, &#8220;I think it will take me X months to find a job. Would you be willing to give me that long?&#8221; Sometimes managers will agree to that because it&#8217;s emotionally easier than firing you (and often cheaper too, if it means the company isn&#8217;t paying severance and unemployment).</p>
<p><strong>7. Closing early on Fridays</strong></p>
<p><em>The president of our company often allows all salaried employees to leave early on Friday. This is normally announced by email at 1 pm or later.</em></p>
<p><em>Our normal ours are 7 &#8211; 4 or 8 &#8211; 5 (with an hour lunch). If it&#8217;s not announced till 4, this means some people do not get the free hour, while others get to go home early, although just by an hour.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this okay by law? Where some get the hour and some don&#8217;t? If an employee had previously posted 8 hours of PTO, should they get their 1 hour returned to them, or is all this based on the discretion of the company? The president of the company has that right to close shop early, right?</em></p>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s nothing illegal about this. It&#8217;s true that the people who work the earlier schedule are missing out on the free hour on the days that the office closes early &#8230; but that&#8217;s how early closings work. They might look at part of the package that comes with choosing the earlier schedule.</p>
<p>And PTO is up to the company&#8217;s discretion, so they can make any rules they want on that. But really, this is an awful lot of clock-watching for exempt employees (assuming you&#8217;re exempt, which is sounds like). If people complain, their best bet is to appreciate that the company occasionally closes early, not resent it when they don&#8217;t benefit from it, and accept that sometimes they might have a day off scheduled that day and will miss out. They might miss out on a free lunch that day too, or doughnuts in the morning. This stuff happens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s short answer Saturday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Is my unpaid internship ever going to offer me a paid position?</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been working an unpaid internship for around 8 months now. I was asked if I was intersted in a paid position doing basically the same thing I have been doing for free. I let them know I was very interested and they said they&#8217;d get back to me within a week with the details. It&#8217;s now been six weeks and I still haven&#8217;t been hired or even know if I will be. I asked my supervisor about it twice, and each time he said he was waiting on his supervisor for a response. I can&#8217;t help but feel if I continue working for free they will never get around to hiring me. Should I just keep being patient and work for free, or should I quit the unpaid intership, but then let them know if they want to hire me, I&#8217;m still interested?</em></p>
<p>Set an ending date. Tell them that you need to find paid employment so you need to set an ending date for your internship. At this point, you&#8217;ve been working for free for eight months; it&#8217;s unlikely to provide you with significantly more benefits if you stay longer. So set an ending date, and start looking for paid work. If this motivates them to offer you a job, great. If not, keep your focus on jobs with other organizations.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you don&#8217;t really want to quit even if they don&#8217;t offer you paid work but you&#8217;d just like to nudge them in that direction, tell your manager that you need to start actively searching for paid work and need to know if they&#8217;re going to offer you a position or not, so that you know whether to launch a search.</p>
<p><strong>2. MOOCs versus business school</strong></p>
<p><em>I am a recent-ish graduate of an elite law school (top 3), but the more time I spend practicing law, the more I become convinced that, while I enjoy it well enough, it&#8217;s not what I want to do for the rest of my work life. My 10-year plan is to continue in criminal litigation (my current area of practice) for 5-8 more years before attempting to transition into business management or a related field.</em></p>
<p><em>The problem is that I don&#8217;t want to go to business school. I don&#8217;t mind putting in the hours and time, but I&#8217;ve already shelled out $120k+ to to a seriously overrated educational institution for essentially a piece of paper with a name on it. My attitude towards re-upping for business school is &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>My question is whether you have any thoughts on Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as a replacement for business school. They&#8217;re free, and I can finish them on my own time over the next several years. I&#8217;m not sure, though, how much of an asset they&#8217;d be on the job market. Certainly I could talk about it in an interview, but would it be appropriate to list on a resume? Would I be rejected out of hand simply because I don&#8217;t have an MBA? Can my law degree compensate for that? For what it&#8217;s worth, my undergrad degree is from a large state school in Economics and Business.</em></p>
<p>Some of the biggest advantages of business school are the networking opportunities and internships you get placed in with your school&#8217;s help. That&#8217;s probably more valuable than what you actually learn there. And that&#8217;s stuff that MOOCs won&#8217;t provide. So from that perspective, I&#8217;d say no, although frankly neither is necessary to move into business management &#8212; work experience is. Few jobs outside of some consulting positions actually require MBA coursework. Anyone else want to weigh in on this though?</p>
<p><strong>3. Following up on a raise</strong></p>
<p><em>When is an appropriate time to follow up on a raise that a few months ago was mentioned as likely to happen this month? My manager, who is retiring in a few weeks, knows I&#8217;ve applied for a few other positions within the company (interviewed for one last week) but hasn&#8217;t mentioned my raise. Should I wait and ask the new manager who will be internally promoted? I&#8217;d like to get some sense from my department, as it may help me get a higher offer from the other departments on my radar. Even still, If I get neither, I&#8217;d rather be making more money sooner than later.</em></p>
<p>Ask now. You want to ask your current manager before she leaves, because the new manager will come in without knowing all this context and potentially not as committed to getting you a raise as your current manager. Keep in mind, though, that since your manager knows you&#8217;re applying for other positions, she may feel less incentive to get you a raise out of her department&#8217;s budget &#8212; if you have one foot out the department&#8217;s door anyway.</p>
<p><strong>4. Avoiding job hopping while in school</strong></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m currently a student, and since October I&#8217;ve been working part-time at a retail store. It took me a while to actually get that position, but it&#8217;s worked out well while I&#8217;ve been in school and I generally enjoy it. However, in my program, like many others, it&#8217;s pretty much expected that we get some sort of summer position or internship. Luckily, I&#8217;ve managed to get a 35 hour/week summer job from May to August, but now I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be able to keep my retail job. In a perfect world, I would be able to work a schedule where I could balance both, but the hours of operation for the organization my summer job is at are pretty much the same as my retail job.</em></p>
<p><em>I would honestly like to keep my retail job, so I can still work there during the next school year. If I wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep it due to scheduling, would it look terrible on my resume if I quit this job after 7 months to go to a relevant summer position in a field I&#8217;m studying for? Should I speak to my manager at the store and tell her what&#8217;s going on and see if she can work around my new schedule? I won&#8217;t know my new schedule until I start my job in May though. I&#8217;m kind of torn. I really don&#8217;t want to look like a job hopper, but I&#8217;m afraid that I&#8217;ll have to.</em></p>
<p>Wait until a month before your new job starts, and then explain the situation to your manager at your current job. Say you&#8217;d love to stay on if she can work around your other schedule, but if she can&#8217;t, you&#8217;d love to return in the fall.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to worry about this looking like job hopping. The job hopping concern doesn&#8217;t really apply while you&#8217;re in school; in school, it&#8217;s expected that you&#8217;ll have various short-term jobs and internships. It&#8217;s once you graduate and are working full-time that it&#8217;s an issue.</p>
<p><strong>5. Should I have to make up these hours?</strong></p>
<p><em>If my manager closes the building for a meeting for an afternoon and it is usually my shift at that time, should I have to work the hours to make up for the ones I missed, even though it wasn’t my fault and I would have been willing to work? It was also suggested I take the &#8220;time off” as a holiday, which doesn’t seem fair.</em></p>
<p>This stuff isn&#8217;t usually about whether you were willing to work; it&#8217;s about whether you did or didn&#8217;t work, regardless of the reason, even when it&#8217;s a reason you had no control over.</p>
<p><strong>6. Should I clear a blog with my manager before I start it?</strong></p>
<p><em>I work as a care provider for a mental institution on a unit that works with children and teens. There are a lot of considerations that have to be made on a regular basis concerning HIPAA.</em></p>
<p><em>Lately, I have been wanting to do other things besides think about work. It is a stressful job, and anytime I can leave work and do something other then think about it, is great for my stress level. I have an idea for a blog that would involve fashion, taking pictures of me in certain fashions, and another of my passions. I am worried, however, that this may cause conflict at my job. I have noticed in the media lately people getting fired for Facebook posts, blog posts, pictures posted, and comments made on the internet. I want to ask my boss what she thinks, but I am unsure if this would be the right and professional course of action. So, what do you think about this? Do you have advice on how I should proceed?</em></p>
<p>If your blog isn&#8217;t going to have anything to do with your job, and isn&#8217;t going to compromise patient privacy or talk about your employer in any way, most managers won&#8217;t care. But if you any doubts, just ask your manager; explain what you want to do and say you wanted to ensure it wouldn&#8217;t be an issue.</p>
<p><strong>7. Do employers observe you during a typing test?</strong></p>
<p><em>Do employers stand behind you during typing tests? Are you put in a cubicle or something? I mean, I type pretty fast, but I am not actullly using the home keys; I just know where the letters are, if that makes sense.</em></p>
<p>No reasonable employer stands behind you during typing tests; they just look at your final score. If you find someone standing behind you watching you, run for the hills.</p>

<p><em>I currently work at a nonprofit and have been in my department for a year now. While I love my job, I am struggling with a coworker who does not know boundaries.</em></p>
<p><em>Quick background: I’m in my late 20s and look young, and my coworker, who helped train me but has the same position and title as I do, is much older, in her 50s, and has worked at our organization for over seven years. While she is a very nice person, she’s done some things that make me feel uncomfortable. It first started when I noticed certain things missing off of my desk, like my personal office supplies, and found that she had used them and taken them to her desk (this would be fine if she’d ask and bring them back, but she didn&#8217;t ). Another time, while I was working, she came over and, without asking, took a production schedule I had pinned to my cube wall off and walked off with it. The few times I&#8217;ve asked her if she could ask first before taking stuff off of my desk space, her response is usually a dismissive, “No, it’s okay.”</em></p>
<p><em>I also rarely take personal phone calls at my desk, but once in a while need to take a call with access to my computer screen (doctor appointments, financial planning, etc.) and try to do it at lunch time and as fast as possible. After some calls, my coworker has turned around to ask far too personal questions about them, like why I was going to the doctor and for what. I&#8217;ve tried to take as many calls as possible away from my desk, but it is sometimes difficult to get around that, and I know she&#8217;s always listening and ready to ask questions.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve thought about bringing this up to our manager about her lack of boundaries, but he seems to put up with her and lets things slide—sometimes if he stops by my desk to ask me a question, she’ll butt in loudly to ask what we are talking about, and he normally laughs it off. I don’t know if I’m the one being uptight over all of this, but it’s made me increasingly uncomfortable, especially since her boundary breaking makes me feel like she’s treating me like a child. Any suggestions?</em></p>
<p>I would <em>not</em> bring this up to your manager. It&#8217;s really an interpersonal issue that isn&#8217;t impacting your work &#8212; it&#8217;s just annoying you. In the scheme of things, it&#8217;s not significant enough that you should take it to your manager, irksome as it is. You want to look like someone who handles your own stuff and doesn&#8217;t involve your manager in interpersonal things unless it&#8217;s really warranted.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to be more direct with your coworker if you want it to stop.</p>
<p>That means that the next time she takes something from your desk, you should say, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t take things from my desk without asking or bringing them back afterwards. I&#8217;m often counting on them being there.&#8221; If she brushes you off and tells you it&#8217;s no big deal, say, &#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a big deal, I&#8217;d appreciate you humoring me on this. It really bothers me when things disappear from my desk.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the next time she asks you questions about a personal phone call, refuse to play along: &#8220;That was a personal call. I&#8217;d rather not discuss it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while her taking things from your desk is something you can&#8217;t stop without her cooperation, whether or not you answer personal questions about your calls is 100% within your control, even if she keeps asking forever.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried that telling her to cut this stuff out will cast a chill over your relationship with her, you can counter that by making a point of being warm and friendly to her the rest of the time, as long as she&#8217;s acting appropriately &#8230; but if you want this stuff to stop, you&#8217;ll have to tell her.</p>
<p>In fact, that&#8217;s the rule for most coworker annoyances: If you want them to stop, you have to say so.</p>
<p>If you try this and she continues anyway &#8230; well, you have an annoying coworker. She won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
<p>But in the scheme of things, this isn&#8217;t vastly out of the normal range of coworker annoyances, so it&#8217;s also worth just trying to get a thicker skin about it if it continues after you say something. Not because you should have to, but because from a purely practical standpoint, it will make your life at work happier.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A reader writes:</p>
<p><em>I work at a women&#8217;s magazine. We have a a lot of advertiser promotions that we feature on our social media outlets (Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest). I have been asked numerous times to post these on my personal social media accounts to garner more eyeballs. This is something I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with, but am looked down upon for not doing so, as I&#8217;m not going out of my way to promote the brand.</em></p>
<p><em>Should employees be pressured to do this type of promotion? What are appropriate boundaries?</em></p>
<p>This is both annoying and increasingly common.</p>
<p>You used to see it mainly in nonprofits, where the assumption was that you support the cause they&#8217;re advocating and would want to share advocacy opportunities (or whatever) with your connections. But then it spread to businesses, and it got a lot more annoying, because asking people to share ads for businesses is really an imposition. (And to be clear, I&#8217;m not saying nonprofits should require it either, just that it&#8217;s less ridiculous to <em>suggest</em> a share in that context.)</p>
<p>If I were in your shoes, I&#8217;d probably say, &#8220;Sorry, but it&#8217;ll just annoy my friends/followers, and that won&#8217;t be helpful.&#8221; And if that didn&#8217;t go over well, I&#8217;d do what I could to make it look like I didn&#8217;t have any of those accounts (locking down Facebook, not using my real name on others, etc.).</p>
<p>But I wanted a social media pro&#8217;s take on this, so I turned to my personal social media wizard and friend, Erica Manney, who writes <a href="http://youshouldonlyknow.com">youshouldonlyknow.com</a>. She says: &#8220;This is totally annoying when it comes to regular companies asking general employees (like, accounting, or the IT people) to put things on social media, and a different thing when you are a media company and in a public role such as social media person.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is true. So are you in a social media role? Or are you a regular, non-social-media person? If the former, Erica points out: &#8220;If you&#8217;re a social media person, you kind of have to be &#8216;bought in&#8217; to your job. You&#8217;re the #1 cheerleader, public voice, and advocate. If you aren&#8217;t willing to promote and be excited about your company, even to your own social network, within reason, you may not be in the right role at the right company. /koolaid&#8221;</p>
<p>She also asks, &#8220;How big is her own personal social network? How many more eyeballs are they really hoping to gain? If she&#8217;s a regular, non-power user, then them asking her to do this is kind of stupid. The campaign should be so big that one extra person wouldn&#8217;t even register.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overall, she says, &#8220;This is a stupid request, unless you are a known power user &#8212; but it <em>is</em> the changing way of the world, and I could see why they would want you to do it as a show of support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her suggestions for you: &#8220;Explain that certain profiles are private (or &#8230; don&#8217;t, because ones you intend to keep private should already be locked down) and then publicly and occasionally use your other platforms. Because &#8230; that&#8217;s kinda the way things are going.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is right. If social media is part of what you&#8217;re there to do, well, this is part of how social media works. The lines are blurred between personal and professional accounts, at least on some platforms. But if that&#8217;s not your job, then go with some combination of polite demurrals, account lockdown, the occasional tweet for good will, and trying to get away with ignoring the rest of it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s fast answer Friday &#8212; seven short answers to seven short questions. Here we go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>1. Are you supposed to drop everything to schedule an interview?</strong></p>
<p><em>Today I was excited to get a call from a woman (while I was busy ) who wanted to set up a phone interview with me. I asked if I could call her back with a date and time that works best once I had a chance to look at my schedule. (I&#8217;m a fitness instructor and my schedule changes weekly.) I called her back in 20 minutes though. However, my boyfriend said it was very impolite of me, that I should always be aware of my schedule, and that it made me appear unprepared. He says that this is &#8220;job hunting 101 stuff.&#8221; I&#8217;m usually inclined to listen to him, and I am more so with things pertaining to this position because he has pull with the organization, but I can&#8217;t shake the feeling that he is wrong.</em></p>
<p><em>Do employers really expect this? Am I just supposed to drop everything anytime someone calls with an interview offer?</em></p>
<p>No. Your boyfriend is wrong on this. You are not supposed to just be sitting by your phone all day in case an employer calls, ready to respond to their every whim with no regard for your own schedule. It&#8217;s completely reasonable to ask to call someone back. Please remind your boyfriend that job-searching is a <a href="http://www.askamanager.org/2012/08/things-you-dont-need-to-apologize-for-or-dont-kowtow-to-your-interviewer.html">two-way street</a>; you&#8217;re contemplating a business relationship with them, not prostrating yourself at their feet in the hope that they will bestow their favors on you.</p>
<p><strong>2. Federal hiring during the sequester</strong></p>
<p><em>I just received a call to set up an interview for a federal government position that I applied for a long time ago&#8230;before I had even heard of the sequester or was even serious about my own job search.</em></p>
<p><em>Given the sequester, I am concerned about this agency having the ability to make hires now. Can I ask them about this during the interview? I have had a friend in the past who was &#8220;screwed over&#8221; by a budget issue in the past. I don&#8217;t want to put them off by asking about the money stuff, but I don&#8217;t want to invest myself in something that may be fruitless.</em></p>
<p>Sure, that&#8217;s fine to ask. The sequester is big news and it&#8217;s not going to surprise them that it&#8217;s on your mind. Just say something like, &#8220;How is the sequester affecting you? Will it impact hiring in your division?&#8221; Keep in mind, by the way, that not all federal jobs are impacted, only some, and plenty of hiring is continuing to go on. (Also, job searching is always about investing yourself to some extent in something that may not pan out, so don&#8217;t get too caught up in wanting to avoid that, either.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Intern isn&#8217;t getting reimbursements owed to her</strong></p>
<p><em>I am really curious on what my friend should do in this situation. She and I interned together 3 months ago. I am still at the internship position but she left in December, because of her limited availability. During her (unpaid) internship, she paid for several things (cab ride back home from company event, catering services for the event, etc.) that she should be compensated for. Because she isn&#8217;t in the office anymore, she had sent a couple of emails to the supervisors since the time she had left, asking for the compensation. Still, she didn&#8217;t hear from them. So, she contacted the HR manager who oversees the internship program. The HR manager asked for the receipts from my friend in February, so my friend sent them over electronically immediately. There&#8217;s been no response from her! I&#8217;ve offered to send her the expense forms from my end, but I imagine that won&#8217;t do much for my friend, since the supervisors aren&#8217;t doing anything to address this problem. What should she do?</em></p>
<p>She should call up the HR manager, today, and ask her when she will receive the reimbursement. If she doesn&#8217;t get a specific date, she should tell her that she needs it resolved by next Friday and ask if she can come by then to pick up a check. She&#8217;s been doing this all by email; it&#8217;s time to move to the phone, where she&#8217;s actually speaking to someone.</p>
<p><strong>4. Listing references who were laid off</strong></p>
<p><em>My temporary job has ended, and I&#8217;m updating my references. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve learned that one of my references (former manager) was laid off (two years after I was). Fortunately, I got in touch with him and now have his current (personal) contact info. My question is, when listing him as a reference, how do I list his title if he no longer works there? &#8220;Joe Smith, former Principal, Firm ABC&#8221;? Also, the info I have listed for my references includes the street address, phone number, and email address. Will it look weird to be missing his street address, and that the email is a Yahoo address rather than a company address?</em></p>
<p>Yes, list it exactly like that &#8212; with what his former position was. They don&#8217;t care what he&#8217;s doing currently; they care what his position was when they worked with you.</p>
<p>As for not having his street address, you don&#8217;t need it. In fact, get rid of all the other addresses on there, because that&#8217;s weird to include in references. No one is mailing your references (and if some odd employer is, they can ask you for an address). Phone number and email address, and that&#8217;s all you need. The fact that it&#8217;s his personal email address is fine.</p>
<p><strong>5. Office requires food and drinks to be stored in one cabinet</strong></p>
<p><em>Our company wants no food or drink in our work areas. They have a metal cabinet with doors that stay closed, with 35 or more people putting half-eaten food and drinks in the same cabinet. Can this be healthy? We don`t even have a sink to wash your hands nearby. The cabinet is in the break area, but the manager doesn’t want people setting there lunches down just anywhere because it looks unprofessional. Same with drinks and food. Please advise</em></p>
<p>I have no idea if it&#8217;s healthy or not, but people do the same thing with office refrigerators and cabinets, so I&#8217;m not sure how this any different, except for the lack of refrigeration. I hope people aren&#8217;t putting perishable stuff in there, but that&#8217;s more for their own safety.</p>
<p><strong>6. Company-issued iPads</strong></p>
<p><em>My company issued iPads for business and good-judgment personal use. They are supplying the device and 4G service. They want the employees to buy a case with our money. And if the device is lost or stolen, the employee will incur the cost. Is this normal?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not shockingly unusual, but it&#8217;s annoying. If you don&#8217;t want to play along, can you simply decline the iPad and say you&#8217;re not comfortable assuming the risk?</p>
<p><strong>7. Do lateral moves hurt your career?</strong></p>
<p><em>Do lateral moves have the potential to hurt your career progression if the lateral move is in the opposite direction of your future career? My intentions are to transition into HR. However, due to being pregnant and not wanting to give up my well deserved maternity benefits by applying externally, my only option is to apply internally. HR positions within my company are few and far between. Also, since I don&#8217;t have as much HR experience as other HR professionals, I&#8217;m very unlikely to secure an HR position if it does become available.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I&#8217;m miserable in my current position. I was forced to transfer to this role when my previous line of business closed. While I thought things would get better, I&#8217;ve been here for a little over a year and they&#8217;re getting worse. To make matters worse my manager isn&#8217;t that great of a manager and at the end of the day could care less about me.</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve started looking at current positions that are a good fit for me, but not in line with my career path. Would taking a lateral move (actually a demotion, as my current role truly doesn&#8217;t reflect the scope of what I do in relation to my employer&#8217;s job codes) hurt more than help?</em></p>
<p>Yes, it will hurt, if you then try to move into HR later; you&#8217;ll look like you have no idea what you want to do and are just trying things out. Stick it out where you are until you&#8217;re done with maternity leave, and then look into moving into HR.</p>

<p><em>How long is the &#8220;window&#8221; open for a job advertisement? I just started my job search, so when I see a position that the company lists on their website as &#8220;open,&#8221; but it&#8217;s been &#8220;open&#8221; since January, I&#8217;m not sure I should apply to it because it&#8217;s been such a long time.</em></p>
<p><em>What do you think? As I search for jobs, what is a good time frame to keep in mind? Just apply to jobs advertised for two weeks? Three weeks? A month?</em></p>
<p><em>I just want to make sure I&#8217;m not wasting my time!</em></p>
<p>It really depends, and it&#8217;s very hard to know from the outside.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s possible that they&#8217;ve already filled the position and have just neglected to take the ad down. But it&#8217;s just as possible that they&#8217;re still actively hiring, and you have as much of a chance today as you did the day the ad went up. It&#8217;s also possible that it&#8217;s somewhere in between, i.e., that they&#8217;re in the later portion of the hiring process and are interviewing finalist candidates, but would consider new candidates if they were extremely strong. It&#8217;s not something you can tell from the outside.</p>
<p>Hiring takes a long time. Some companies don&#8217;t even begin reviewing resumes until a month after an ad goes up, or they intend to do it earlier but then the process stalls &#8212; someone goes on vacation or is out sick, or a budget question comes up that needs to be resolved before hiring work can move forward, or something higher priority comes up that needs to be worked on before attention can be turned back to hiring, or they thought they had a candidate to hire but it fell through and now they&#8217;re starting from scratch, or all kinds of other things.</p>
<p>It takes even longer if it&#8217;s a hard-to-fill role.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t know from the outside what&#8217;s going on. You can certainly call and ask if the position is still open if you&#8217;re really concerned, but in general, you&#8217;re better off assuming that something is still open than assuming that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re concerned about wasting your time &#8230; well, you can&#8217;t really avoid that possibility in most job searches. You can never know if your application is going to be looked at or not, or whether the role closed five minutes before you applied, or whether it&#8217;s a post intended for someone internal and they&#8217;re just going through the motions in posting it publicly. You&#8217;re better off making your peace with that and not worrying about it too much.</p>

<p><em>You are always so great at getting to the heart of matters, so I&#8217;m hoping you can help me figure out a few witty retorts to the following problem. I&#8217;m writing you today about a situation I&#8217;m sure most women have been in. I am a female in an office with 15 men and 3 women. I am not an assistant of any sort, nor am I a manager. I am not on the front lines; it is not in my role to answer phones, order lunch, order office supplies, etc. However, I find myself responding to frequent requests for things such as:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Where are the cleaning supplies stored?</em><br />
<em> Were you aware that the men&#8217;s room is out of toilet paper?</em><br />
<em> Where is the nearest seamstress / tailor where &#8220;insert client name&#8221; can get a zipper replaced?</em></p>
<p><em>Not to mention that when the receptionist is away from her desk, the phone will ring and ring and ring and ring&#8230;unless I answer it. (We ALL have phones capable of picking up incoming calls).</em></p>
<p><em>What gives here? I am super tempted to remind my coworkers that I am not their wife, mother, or personal assistant. And just because I wear a bra does not mean that I inherently know where the Mr. Clean wipes are kept, am better equipped to answer the phones, or change the toilet paper roll when it&#8217;s empty. I just need a response that is going to make the point and have a long-lasting effect, that I won&#8217;t lose my job over.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you asking me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Delivered totally neutrally, even pleasantly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question that should force them to pause and think about why they really are asking you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d go with that versus a witty, snappy retort, because it keeps it simple and straightforward. And really, it belongs in the &#8220;huh?&#8221; realm rather than the humor realm anyway.</p>
<p>Regarding the phones, if everyone else is getting away with not answering them when they ring, then you might consider doing the same. Yes, you want to be responsible and not shirk a shared responsibility just because everyone else is, but if you take that stance, you&#8217;ll essentially be agreeing to be the sole sub for the receptionist when she&#8217;s away. If you  join your coworkers in not picking it up and it becomes a problem, the office will address it, and <em>everyone</em> can be told to answer it, rather than you picking up all the slack. (And yes, I am slightly uncomfortable with that solution, but I&#8217;m far more comfortable with it than you doing the work for everyone or with you having to nag your coworkers.)</p>
<p>Speaking of nagging, I&#8217;m not a big fan of reminding coworkers that you&#8217;re not their wife or mother. First, it implies that other women in their lives <em>are</em> responsible for doing things that capable adults handle on their own, and second, it puts you in the role of &#8230; well, mother, by admonishing them to do something differently.</p>
<p>Instead, pretend that gender isn&#8217;t involved here at all, and just don&#8217;t play along.</p>

<p><em>I have worked 5 years for an international nonprofit as a regional coordinator for a certain region of developing countries where I oversee local consultants hired to implement our projects with our beneficiaries. These consultants are on year-long renewable contracts (and in the past have tended to be treated more like employees, but we are now handling it more like normal consultancy contracts). I was young when I was promoted to the position (26) after having been one of those consultants myself for one year. When I came into the position, it was originally on interim during my previous boss&#8217;s 9-month sick leave. I was managing remotely in three countries with three consultants: two with whom I managed to build great relationships, they worked great, no complaint, and a third who was always very difficult to work with. He resented me having been promoted to &#8220;oversee&#8221; him and kept referring to me as interim even after it was clear my former boss wasn&#8217;t coming back and I got officially the position. He had done very bad work before, but my previous boss thought he could improve and liked him as a person. His work never improved. With my immediate manager, we spoke to him many times, making reports on how he needed to improve his work, and put him on &#8220;probation&#8221; at least twice. He&#8217;d temporarily improve, then get bad again (no reports, bad attitude, not meeting timelines, etc). Eventually, at the end of 2011, with the approval of my manager, I decided that we would not renew his contract, as it was expiring. I was new into the &#8220;management&#8221; world and tried to get as much mentoring and training as I could, but this was a very intense way to &#8220;learn on the job.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>He has since been on a personal vendetta against me. He has been sending mass emails to all our stakeholders, beneficiaries, partners, all the board of our organisation, etc. saying how badly I have done my job, how awful I am, etc. Within my organization, nobody doubts my actions and they all stand by me and highly value my work (I have since had one more promotion). My managers recognize in his vendetta the sad side of a disgruntled ex-worker. Both my manager and higher managers have responded to him very professionally and have followed up (without copying in all the stakeholders of course), but he keeps on attacking, every three or four weeks over the past six months, with roughly 80 people in copy. He has taken his crusade to many of the people we work with who have never met me, and many partners he copies on emails are potential places where I might want to work one day. I have gotten feedback from some of them that they do not take it seriously at all (his ramblings do seem slightly paranoid or schizophrenic), but I am drained emotionally by this. Letting him go was one of my first difficult management decisions, and although I do not regret it for the better of our organization, I wish I had not opened that Pandora&#8217;s box. I have learned from it and would handle future layoffs differently, but in the immediate situation I am at a loss. My manager seems pretty overwhelmed and doesn&#8217;t know what to do either.</em></p>
<p><em>Legally, we can&#8217;t do much; he lives in another country, and my organization would not take on an international court case (if that even exists). This is a strange complex situation, But in general terms, how would you deal with ex-employees / workers who have been fired for bad behaviour/ poor performance when they start harassing the company or their ex-manager?</em></p>
<p>This is going to sound counterintuitive, but do nothing. Ignore it.</p>
<p>The way this guy is acting is so counter to how normal, rational people act that anyone who receives his missives isn&#8217;t going to take them seriously. (Frankly, cc&#8217;ing 80 people is enough to ruin his credibility, and that&#8217;s before we even get to the content of the emails.) And the fact that his letters are rambling and seem to come from someone unstable &#8212; believe me, people are not taking these seriously. Imagine, after all, if you were on the receiving end of these letters about someone else. Would you think, &#8220;Wow, Jane sounds like she really treated him horribly; she must be a bad person,&#8221; or would you think, &#8220;This guy has some serious problems and he&#8217;s annoying me&#8221;? You&#8217;d think the latter.</p>
<p>So I can promise you that no one is putting stock in these letters. <em>You</em> are, of course, because they&#8217;re about you, and it&#8217;s horrible to feel that someone out there dislikes you so much and is sharing it with the world. And you&#8217;re questioning how you handled the ending of his contract, and you&#8217;re feeling that he&#8217;s exposing you as having done wrong in some way. But he&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the details of how you handled the end of his contract, but certainly the decision to do it sounds more than justified. And if you were awkward in how you handled it because it was your first time doing something like that &#8212; well, welcome to the club. <em>Most</em> managers are awkward in the early stages of learning how to do that. It&#8217;s not ideal, but it&#8217;s reality. And 99.9% (more, really) of their employees don&#8217;t react like this guy is. The issue here is him. It&#8217;s not about your actions.</p>
<p>You had the bad luck of having an unhinged person on your staff. And people hearing from him see that.</p>
<p>So I would ignore it, and keep reminding yourself that other people are too. It will go away in time, I promise.</p>
