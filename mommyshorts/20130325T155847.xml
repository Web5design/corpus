<p>I said, "Gee, I don't know, Jenny... I'm really busy and this sounds like it might eat into my weekends." </p>
<p>Or maybe, I said something more like, "SERIOUSLY??!!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!! Especially since I have SECOND CHILD SYNDROME and ADULT HARLOW is going to be PISSED when she sees her LACK OF QUALITY DOCUMENTATION!"</p>

Now, I'm sad to say, it seems like a pain in the ass to lug around and is buried somewhere deep in our coat closet. </p>
<p>Almost all of the photos we have of Harlow are taken on our phones.</p>
<p>As much as I love Instagram <a href="http://instagram.com/mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://instagram.com/mommyshorts">(follow me-- @mommyshorts!)</a>, those photos don't usually hold up very well if you blow them up to print.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, I have no videos of Harlow. It didn't even occur to me to take them, because she doesn't DO anything.</p>

I took video of Mazzy constantly. I have hours and hours of footage of Mazzy lying on different surfaces in various outfits... propped up in chairs, getting baths, having her hair combed, looking at herself (also not moving) in the mirror. I have videos of Mazzy SLEEPING. </p>
<p>CHILD #2 has one video that is about five seconds long. I stopped recording when I realized nothing was happening and it was just going to take up storage space.</p>
<p>

It's called <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2011/01/still-here-me-too.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2011/01/still-here-me-too.html">"Life Thus Far"</a> and it's probably my favorite thing on earth.</p>
<p>It's also how I created <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2010/11/home-video-is-boring-even-mine.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2010/11/home-video-is-boring-even-mine.html">the video of Mazzy rolling over for the first time</a>. It's a full two minute video chronicling months of Mazzy's numerous rollover attempts before she finally completed the manuever at 6 months. </p>
<p>You know who rolled over a few weeks ago?</p>
<p>Some chick named Harlow.</p>

<p>MEMORIES.</p>

<p>Granted, Harlow rolled over successfully after her first attempt, whereas Mazzy spent three months propelling herself to one side without completing the task. We tried demonstrating, offering incentive, egging her on. There was frustration, determination, crying, laughter— the stuff home videos are made of!</p>
<p>But Harlow?</p>
<p>She was just like, "Yeah, I wanna roll over. There I did it. No big deal." </p>
<p>All beginning and ending, NO STORY ARC.</p>

Nope, little Harlow, flipping over at a mere three months, <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/the-evil-faces-of-harlow.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/the-evil-faces-of-harlow.html">shooting looks that kill</a> at anyone who dares to glance her way...</p>
<p>CHILD #2 IS NOT WALKING IN ANYBODY'S SHADOW.</p>

<p>Sometimes multiple judges gets complicated. Not this time. Nine out of the thirteen judges picked Meg Hanson's momoir, <strong>"Everything I Know About Parenting, I Learned from Google"</strong>. </p>
<p>I guess that goes to show you just how many of us have googled terms like, "do stretch marks go away", "what does neon yellow poop mean" and "who would like to take my toddler for a long weekend".</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations, Meg!</strong> Now, you just have to write 200-300 single spaced pages and your momoir will be complete! Please email me to get your prize. The rest of you can purchase "I Just Want to Pee Alone" by clicking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988408031/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0988408031&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">here</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0988408031" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.</p>
<p>But I'm not done yet. You guys wrote so many brilliant momoir titles, I couldn't let them linger underneath <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/10-title-options-for-my-inevitable-momoir.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/10-title-options-for-my-inevitable-momoir.html">an old post in the comments</a> for eternity, so I decided to unearth my favorites here. </p>

<p>In contrast to <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/what-a-child-feels-like-when-you-tell-them-they-are-getting-a-new-sibling-video.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/what-a-child-feels-like-when-you-tell-them-they-are-getting-a-new-sibling-video.html">the video I showed on Tuesday</a>, Mazzy embraced the addition of Harlow pretty quickly and continues to enjoy her company. Sure, she'll get pissed when I'm holding the baby and she wants to be the one sitting in my lap. Or she'll request I leave Harlow in the other room while I come with her to play. But for the most part, Mazzy keeps coming up with new and interesting ways to interact with her little sister. Whether Harlow likes it or not.</p>
<p>Since Harlow can barely move, she is more Mazzy's prop than her playmate. Or helpless victim, depending on how you look at it. </p>
<p>Harlow just furrows her brow as Mazzy pokes, prods and smothers her, silently plotting her revenge. If you could hear Harlow's inner monologue, it would probably be something like, "This is cool now, my friend. But you just WAIT."</p>

<p>Here are Mazzy's top ten methods of harassing the baby:</p>
<p>1. Dress-up the baby, usually in various hats. Then surround her with carefully selected and precisely placed toys. <em>(see above)</em></p>
<p>2. Run circles around the baby. Literally.</p>
<p>3. Make the baby hold unweildy objects.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad9c6970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_1010" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad9c6970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad9c6970b-800wi" title="IMG_1010" /></a></p>
<p>4. Scream into the baby's ear.</p>
<p>5. Force the baby to eat a fake banana.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0184" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b-800wi" title="IMG_0184" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b-pi" style="display: inline;" />6. Pet the baby like a dog.</p>
<p>7. Violate the baby's belly button.</p>
<p>8. Make a bridge over the baby.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0981" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c-800wi" title="IMG_0981" /></a></p>
<p>9. Jump over the baby giving her mother a heart attack.</p>
<p>10. Pretend the baby is a telephone.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtT4eFg3G4Q" width="470" /><em>Note: I have no idea how Mazzy even knows what a rotary phone looks like.</em></p>
<p>Despite how often I must tell Mazzy to be careful around Harlow and discourage her from performing some of her more reckless interactions, I know Mazzy's antics are all with the purpose of one common goal: </p>
<p>Get as close to the baby as possible.</p>
<p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee99426b7970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Today, <a href="http://www.pediacare.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.pediacare.com">PediaCare</a> asked me to write about the activities I do with my kids when they are stuck at home sick. You know, to pass the time in a productive fashion. Yup. Head nod. Mmmmhm. Of course.</p>
<p>Immediately, I thought of all the amazing projects Mazzy and I accomplished a few months ago when she stayed home from preschool with bronchitis. From the second Mazzy woke up feverish and hacking up a lung, I was determined to make sure each moment was more creative and action-packed than the last. </p>
<p>What better way to start a sick day than with strawberry banana pancakes created entirely out of felt!
</p>

<p><a href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d421fba02970c-pi"><img alt="0e1df75c492322f5f42fc85ee1b503b1" border="0" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d421fba02970c-800wi" title="0e1df75c492322f5f42fc85ee1b503b1" /><br /></a><em style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saraj715/4439084961/in/photostream" target="_blank" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/saraj715/4439084961/in/photostream">Photo Source: Lisajhoney on flickr</a></em></p>
<p>After breakfast, Mazzy ran around the apartment collecting the excess fabric I have lying around the house for such an occasion, and then, between snotsucking and nose wiping, I sewed all the material into what I call "GET WELL WINGS".</p>
<p><a href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9938f5d970d-pi"><img alt="0ae737d82c7939c4cd31626416e6f4a2" border="0" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9938f5d970d-800wi" title="0ae737d82c7939c4cd31626416e6f4a2" /><br /></a><em style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="http://www.handmadecharlotte.com/diy-bird-wings-children/" target="_blank" title="http://www.handmadecharlotte.com/diy-bird-wings-children/">Photo Source: Handmade Charlotte</a></em></p>
<p>When Mazzy skipped her nap due to the discomfort of excessive phlegm build-up in her throat, we passed the time making a chrysanthemum mirror out of 300 plastic spoons.</p>
<p>Isn't it beautiful? And not tedious at all!</p>
<p>

<p>What? You don't do this sort of thing when your child is home ill? Please don't tell me you let them sit on the couch all day covered in snotty tissues with their glassy little eyes fixated on the television! You don't have all three Toy Stories cued up on the DVD player, an iPad with 50 todler apps at your child's germy fingertips and a season of Dora the Explorer playing on a loop...</p>
<p>DO YOU????</p>
<p>Nope, sick days are an opportunity for parent/child activities and kid-friendly crafts! At the end of the day, you should have something to show for it! I was just kidding about that whole television thing. You would NEVER do that. </p>
<p>When Mazzy gets sick, instead of parking ourselves on the couch in the living room, we spend the time in our fully-supplied craft room full of ribbons, buttons and all the materials one would need should we have the sudden urge to decoupage.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="3b7b955c90e20bde0580c32e6cd12827" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b-800wi" title="3b7b955c90e20bde0580c32e6cd12827" /></a></p>
<p>You'd be surprised how often the urge to decoupage arises. Usually right after a particularly bad stomach bug. I always say— if you are going to have bodily fluids coming out of both ends, you better have a container of Mod Podge at the ready!</p>
<p>If you don't have a beautiful craft room full of supplies, that is no excuse. You can make very simple crafts out of household garbage. Like these easy-to-execute toilet paper roll silhouettes.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d421fdef3970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="60be61f36a3004d2d04c1e000d580c8f" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d421fdef3970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d421fdef3970c-800wi" title="60be61f36a3004d2d04c1e000d580c8f" /></a><em style="font-size: 8pt;"><a href="http://blog.anastassia-elias.com/category/rouleaux/" target="_blank" title="http://blog.anastassia-elias.com/category/rouleaux/">Photo source: Anastassia Alias</a></em></p>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable handing your three-year-old an exacto knife, especially when she is delirious with a fever, don't worry— there are tons of toilet paper roll crafts you can create with one hand while using your other hand to take your daughter's temperature or wipe her sweating brow.</p>
<p>Like these pasta toilet paper roll bracelet cuffs!</p>
<p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee993d1d4970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Worried that the fumes from the spray paint might not be what the doctor ordered?</p>
<p>Well then, how about this simple toilet paper roll family:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42202898970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Toilet-paper-crafts" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d42202898970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42202898970c-800wi" title="Toilet-paper-crafts" /></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><a href="http://www.kidskubby.com/toilet-paper-roll-crafts/" target="_blank" title="http://www.kidskubby.com/toilet-paper-roll-crafts/">Photo Source: Kids Kubby</a></em></span></p>

Let's do more CRAFTS and EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES! SICK DAYS ARE WHERE MEMORIES ARE BORN!!!"</p>
<p>Still too difficult? FINE. Have it your way. Make a toilet paper mummy and then turn on Calliou. </p>

<p>If you scan the names of the people who wrote essays for the book (Julianna Miner from <a href="http://www.rantsfrommommyland.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.rantsfrommommyland.com">Rants from Mommyland</a>, Jen from <a href="http://www.peopleiwanttopunchinthethroat.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.peopleiwanttopunchinthethroat.com">People I Want to Punch in the Throat</a>, Brenna from <a href="http://www.suburbansnapshots.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.suburbansnapshots.com">Suburban Snapshots</a>, Nicole from <a href="http://www.ninjamomblog.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.ninjamomblog.com">Ninja Mom</a> and virtually every other funny mom blogger in existence), you will notice that I am not amongst them.</p>
<p>Cue sad trombone.
</p>

<p>I'd love to go on a rant about how I was not considered kickass enough to contribute, but the truth is, when they asked for submissions, it was right after Harlow was born and I just couldn't swing it. I was at a point where I was trying to exercise my right to say "no" for the greater good of my family (and sanity) and unfortunately, when I finally did say "no", I said "no" to the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Not that I actually said "no". I just kind of ignored the request and totally underestimated how bummed I would be when the book came out and I wasn't included. </p>
<p>Especially when the essays have hilariously kickass titles like: </p>
<p><strong><em>I love Disney World. No Wait, That Whole Title is a Typo</em></strong>.....By Karen of <a href="http://babysideburns.com" target="_blank" title="http://babysideburns.com">Baby Sideburns</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Eat Poop, Laugh. No, I Did Not Forget a Comma</em></strong>.....by Patti of <a href="http://www.insanemombrain.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.insanemombrain.com">Insane in the Mom Brain</a></p>
<p><strong><em>In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Penis</em></strong>....by Bethany of <a href="http://badparentingmoments.com" target="_blank" title="http://badparentingmoments.com">Bad Parenting Moments</a></p>
<p><strong><em>So She Thought She Could Cut Off My Stroller</em></strong>....by Keesha of <a href="http://www.momsnewstage.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.momsnewstage.com">New Mom's Stage</a></p>
<p><strong><em>A Stranger in the Land of Twigs and Berries</em></strong>.....by Suzanne of <a href="http://www.toulouseandtonic.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.toulouseandtonic.com">Toulouse and Tonic</a></p>
<p><strong><em>The Tale of Two Vaginas</em></strong>....by Susan of <a href="http://www.divinesecretsofadomesticdiva.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.divinesecretsofadomesticdiva.com">Divine Secrets of a Domestic Diva</a></p>
<p>and so on. </p>
<p>See? Aren't you sad that you weren't included too???</p>
<p>The only other bloggers missing that I can tell, are Jill from <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.scarymommy.com">Scary Mommy</a>, Nicole from <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/moms-who-drink-and-swear/" target="_blank" title="http://www.chicagonow.com/moms-who-drink-and-swear/">Moms Who Drink and Swear</a>, Amber from <a href="http://crappypictures.com" target="_blank" title="http://crappypictures.com">Parenting Illustrated with Crappy Pictures</a>, and Leanne from <a href="http://ironicmom.com" target="_blank" title="http://ironicmom.com">Ironic Mom</a>, but they all have a much better excuse than I do— they have THEIR OWN BOOKS coming out.</p>
<p>So, what's a blogger without an amazon author profile to do besides write a book of her own? </p>
<p>Let's start with a title, shall we?</p>
<p>

I just need you to answer one simple question in the comment section below. </p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em><strong>What would you title your momoir?</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Best answer wins. You must be a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts" target="_self" title="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts">Mommy Shorts Facebook Fan</a> to enter. Winner will be announced on Friday.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee977522e970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />You know that recurring nightmare where you're walking through the halls of your high school completely naked and everybody is laughing at you and it takes a moment to figure out why? Except instead of your high school it's your office and instead of "completely naked", it's you strapped to a breast pump in a strapless bra with holes in it? And instead of everyone laughing at you, they have these horrified looks on their faces like they may rethink all plans of procreating? And instead of you not knowing what's going on, you know exactly what's going on because this isn't a nightmare, it's your real fucking life? </p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Last week <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-weird-places-ive-pumped.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-weird-places-ive-pumped.html">I wrote about pumping right out in the open</a> at the sinks by the entrance to the bathroom, while people came in and out the door. This week, I am freelancing at a new office which actually has a room for me to use, but one wall is all windows looking out to the building across the way. 
</p>

<p>Even though, I could care less who knows what I am doing in there, I still don't feel quite comfortable giving the neighbors a show. Particularly a show that plays on regular timed intervals two-three times a day.</p>
<p>So, I'm left trying to figure out what to wear to work so that I can pump as discreetly as possible.</p>
<p>As we already know (see <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/shopping-for-post-maternity-clothes-a-play-in-three-acts.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/shopping-for-post-maternity-clothes-a-play-in-three-acts.html">"Post Maternity Shopping, a Play in Three Acts"</a>), post maternity clothes are next to impossible to find because you have a laundry list of requirements. But... I decided to take that laundry list, add my back-to-work pumping issues to the mix and actually find a uniform that works.</p>
<p>Dresses are out because then I have to completely disrobe. Button-down shirts are out because my boobs are two completely different sizes and the buttons pull all weird. The only thing that works is wearing jeans or tight pants with a loose long top. Tops that are made of material that don't cling to me in a wow-that-bagel-could-be-another-baby kind of way, tops that are long enough to cover my post maternity belly (and the top of my maternity jeans should I choose to wear them, oh my god, I love them so much, I think I'll wear them forever), and tops that are loose enough so that I can put my breast pump on and then pull the shirt back down over the whole apparatus altogether, making me 100% comfortable should anyone happen to barge in or take a peak.</p>
<p>The problem is I only have two shirts that fit the bill and they are starting to smell like breastmilk.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37d4d06e970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-17 at 11.38.42 PM" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37d4d06e970b" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37d4d06e970b-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Screen Shot 2013-03-17 at 11.38.42 PM" /></a>So, tonight I looked at every online shopping site I could think of (from Banana Republic to Zara to Bloomingdales) and started relishing tops that met my qualifications on <a href="http://www.sweetrelish.com/?affref=mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://www.sweetrelish.com/?affref=mommyshorts">Sweet Relish</a>— <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/sweet-relish-the-secret-sauce-of-shopping.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/sweet-relish-the-secret-sauce-of-shopping.html">the social shopping site I told you guys about a few weeks ago</a>. Turns out, this kind of top seems to be on trend, and I found quite a few <em>(see image up top)</em> in solid modern shapes, as opposed to flowy floral peasant blouses.</p>
<p>Now I've got a handy <a href="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/ilana/products/" target="_blank" title="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/ilana/products/">"Back-to-Work Pumping Shirts"</a> list on Sweet Relish with links to all the individual stores where I can purchase them. And thankfully, they all look like the kind of shirts I wouldn't have to try on in-store to make sure they fit before I purchase. </p>
<p>Is there a mom on earth that has time to go clothes shopping for herself OFFLINE??? If so, it's not me.</p>
<p>More importantly— <em><strong>if I was to buy two tops from the ones pictured above, which two should I pick?</strong></em></p>
<p>If you'd like to <a href="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/ilana/products/" target="_blank" title="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/ilana/products/">follow my shopping lists</a> on Sweet Relish or create your own, <a href="http://bit.ly/YpGqPr" target="_blank" title="http://bit.ly/YpGqPr">click here</a>.</p>

However, I want to be clear that even through the stumbles, we have still had tremendous success with <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/toddler-sleep-rehab.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/toddler-sleep-rehab.html">Erin's plan</a>. </p>
<p>We are still putting Mazzy to bed earlier which, oddly enough, means she doesn't put up a fight and falls asleep within a few minutes as opposed to singing and talking to herself for hours in bed. Also, because she gets more hours of sleep, Mazzy no longer wakes up crying in the morning. </p>
<p>Those were two of our biggest goals.</p>
<p>Mike and I talked to Erin tonight to go over the next steps of our plan. One reason Mike was on the phone was because I realized we are making a lot of changes and all parties needed to be completely on board or else none of this is going to stick.</p>
<p>We have one big new goal...
</p>

<p>Ever since we switched Mazzy to a toddler bed, she has been coming into our room between 5:30-6:30am to wake us up. The new plan is to get her to stay in her room quietly playing by herself until Mike or I come to get her at 6:30am. </p>
<p>THAT, would truly be something. </p>
<p>Erin suggested accomplishing this with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QS802K/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001QS802K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">My Tot Clock</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001QS802K" style="width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> (a clock that changes color at a set time) and creating a clear plastic "treasure chest" full of dollar toys. We will let Mazzy pick one for instant gratification every time she stays in her room until we come get her. But, it's important that Mike and I don't oversleep and are there for her when we say we will be.</p>
<p>I'll let you know how it goes!</p>

<p><strong>WHO WON THE SLEEP CONSULT???</strong></p>
<p>After reading all of your comments under the giveaway, I really wish I could give sleep consultations to everyone. But unfortunately, there is only one winner today. </p>
<p>The $150 child sleep consultation with <a href="http://www.picklesandicecreamstl.com/sleep-consulting" target="_blank" title="http://www.picklesandicecreamstl.com/sleep-consulting">Pickles and Ice Cream</a> goes to...</p>
<p><strong>Jill B!!!</strong> </p>
<p>Jill B's got an 18 month-old son with no schedule who frequently wakes up throughout the night requiring excessive rocking to go back to sleep. Congratulations, Jill! Please contact me at ilana@mommyshorts.com so Erin can get your entire family some much needed sleep as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Erin will be back in a few weeks to put Harlow on a sleep schedule and we'll be giving a second consultation away then. In the meantime, if you would like to hire Erin to help get your child's sleep patterns under control, <a href="http://www.picklesandicecreamstl.com/sleep-consulting" target="_blank" title="http://www.picklesandicecreamstl.com/sleep-consulting">you can contact her here</a>.</p>
<p>I previously thought hiring someone like a sleep consultant was a pretty luxurious proposition, but Erin is very reasonable. For $150, you get a phone conversation, a written sleep plan and two weeks of back and forth communication. </p>
<p>That's worth it's weight in gold, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.mommyshorts.com/"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><em>Giveaway: Two Handmade Mobiles from <a href="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/mobiles-2/" target="_blank" title="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/mobiles-2/">Baby Jives</a>, one given away on Instagram and one given away on the blog</em></strong></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d41d68769970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-baby-jives-giveaway2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d41d68769970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d41d68769970c-800wi" title="Mommy-baby-jives-giveaway2" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d41d68769970c-pi" style="display: inline;" />I have yet to move Harlow into Mazzy's room, since we are still working on <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/toddler-sleep-rehab-part-two.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/toddler-sleep-rehab-part-two.html">getting Mazzy's sleep habits under control</a>. In case you are curious, Mazzy now has a cold and wakes up every fifteen minutes screaming for a tissue, even though I make her sleep with an entire box. </p>
<p>Mazzy's antics haven't stopped me from getting Harlow's side of the room ready, which mostly means we must stop using Harlow's crib as a conveniently accessible storage container and the world's largest hamper. 
</p>

<p>I'd also like to create a space that feels just as special as Mazzy's side of the room, without duplicating it. That's a tough job when you consider Mazzy's got a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/114892196/bespoke-personalised-girls-cot-or-crib?" target="_blank" title="http://www.etsy.com/listing/114892196/bespoke-personalised-girls-cot-or-crib?">gorgeous custom quilt from Cheeky Handmades</a> hanging above her bed.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled on the beautiful handmade mobiles from <a href="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/mobiles-2/" target="_blank" title="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/mobiles-2/">Baby Jives</a>, and knew Harlow had to have one.</p>
<p>Baby Jives mobiles are created by Jahje Ives, who says her creations are inspired by her four-year-old son, Gavril and her one-year-old daughter, Elodie. In fact, Jahje started making mobiles during her first pregnancy when she couldn't find anything she liked enough to hang over the baby's crib. </p>
<p>The name Baby Jives was derived from the name she and her husband gave their unborn child while he was in utero, which is a combination of their names— Joe and Ives. </p>
<p>FYI- Mazzy was Yoko Ono while in the womb, later nicknamed Yolkie. You know, like an egg. Harlow was nothing. You know, because she's a second child.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/cloud-mobiles/" target="_blank" title="http://babyjives.com/shop/category/cloud-mobiles/">Baby Jives cloud mobiles</a> the most because they remind me of a modern handcrafted version of the satin hearts and stars I used to have hanging from my ceiling in the eighties. Except these have a tasteful zen quality as opposed to a Lisa Frank aesthetic. </p>
<p>But Baby Jives also makes mobiles in many variations including birds, planes, and butterflies.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee94aa0b3970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Baby-jives-mobiles" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee94aa0b3970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee94aa0b3970d-800wi" title="Baby-jives-mobiles" /></a></p>
<p>You can hang one or hang a few at varying lengths to great effect.</p>

<p>I don't like to brag, but there are so few parenting moments when I feel like I have done something correctly that I am going to seize the day and give myself a little pat on the back. I hope we can still be friends even if I start to sound like I might actually know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I talked about <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/10-things-i-didnt-know-about-potty-training.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/10-things-i-didnt-know-about-potty-training.html">the process of potty training my daughter</a>. (FYI- don't ever put the potty training stickers in a place where your child can reach them, unless you want to walk in on a scene like the one pictured above.)</p>
<p>Actually, I've been talking about potty training for well over a year now. We thought she was ready, then we thought maybe she wasn't ready, then we were sure she wasn't ready and then we thought she should be ready even though she said she wasn't ready. And then finally we blamed ourselves for her not being ready.</p>
<p>Basically, I forgot all about the potty training flow chart I made last summer. Remember this bit of wisdom?
</p>

<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c379ca6c8970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Potty-training-flow-chart" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c379ca6c8970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c379ca6c8970b-800wi" title="Potty-training-flow-chart" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c379ca6c8970b-pi" style="display: inline;" />I knew what I was talking about back then.</p>
<p>When Mazzy turned three, I decided to start training even though she resisted. After one unsuccessful weekend, she got sick and it seemed unfair to make her do something she didn't want to do when she already felt miserable.</p>
<p>So I didn't pressure her and waited.</p>
<p>A few months later, Mazzy had a week off from school which seemed like the perfect time to try and make potty training stick. More importantly, when I brought it up with her, she didn't seem entirely opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>She was three and three months.</p>
<p>During that week, we had two to three accidents at home but within a day or two, Mazzy started to go to the potty without us having to remind her. In fact, when we asked her if she needed to go, she said, "No, I will tell you when I need to go." Which she did.</p>
<p>When we finally took the risk of venturing out, she had one accident at a friend's house but then asked to use the potty the next time.</p>
<p>The following Monday, we sent her to school in underwear and she has yet to have an accident.</p>
<p>This is the part, where I would usually segue into the AWFUL POTTY TRAINING DISASTER that happened after I got too confident, but oddly enough, it hasn't happened yet. (Yes, I'm fully aware that after I post this, disaster will strike.)</p>
<p>We were told to expect many emergency scenarios where we must find a bathroom immediately or else. But we have yet to find ourselves in that situation. So far, she's never asked to use the potty while at the playground or while in transit.</p>
<p>It seems to me <em>(knock on wood one hundred times)</em> that Mazzy is able to hold it in until she knows she is some place where a bathroom is accessible.</p>
<p>I think it comes down to her finally being old enough to have full control over her bladder.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://blogs.babble.com/toddler-times/2012/07/24/no-my-daughter-is-not-potty-trained-thanks-for-asking/" target="_blank" title="http://blogs.babble.com/toddler-times/2012/07/24/no-my-daughter-is-not-potty-trained-thanks-for-asking/">that post I wrote for Babble</a> about bladder maturity? Not to get all medical on you or anything, but pediatricians say your child's bladder isn't fully deveoped until the age of three. Which is, therefore, the age parents should potty train.</p>
<p>It's kind of like that time I freaked out because <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2012/11/40-weeks-pregnant-the-pie-chart.html" target="_blank" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2012/11/40-weeks-pregnant-the-pie-chart.html">I thought my unborn child was going to live inside my belly forever</a>, when in the end, Harlow came out exactly on the day the doctors said she would— <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2012/11/say-hello-to-harlow-eden-but-not-too-loudly-shes-sleeping.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2012/11/say-hello-to-harlow-eden-but-not-too-loudly-shes-sleeping.html">her due date</a>.</p>
<p>So, here's my advice. If you are contemplating potty training and your child is not yet three, give yourself a break and wait it out. At the end of the game, your child will be just as potty trained as those who started a year ago, except you probably saved yourself a lot of aggravation.</p>
<p>Full disclosure— Mazzy is only pee-trained. Poop is a work in progress and we still let her wear a diaper at night. I asked her today when she is going to start pooping in the potty and she told me, "When I get a little bit older." I decided to trust her because she's been right so far.</p>
<p>Pooping aside, I let Mazzy collect on her potty training prize. Initially, she asked for a Lego Castle, but then changed her mind and asked for something else.</p>
<p>"I want a pink furry caterpillar."</p>
<p>"A what?"</p>
<p>"A pink furry caterpillar."</p>
<p>"I thought you wanted a LEGO castle."</p>
<p>"I want a pink furry caterpillar."</p>
<p>"A pink furry caterpillar?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh."</p>
<p>"Okay. I'll see what I can do."</p>
<p>Luckily, the internet exists and a parent can google "pink furry caterpillar plush toy" to see what comes up. You know what I found? <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/106664590/stuffed-toy-fuzzy-caterpillar-pink?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=product_listing_promoted&amp;utm_campaign=toys_mid&amp;gclid=CPyDu6fp-LUCFUXf4AodZnkA6g" target="_blank" title="http://www.etsy.com/listing/106664590/stuffed-toy-fuzzy-caterpillar-pink?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=product_listing_promoted&amp;utm_campaign=toys_mid&amp;gclid=CPyDu6fp-LUCFUXf4AodZnkA6g">THIS</a>:</p>

<p>Congrats, Mazzy. May you pee in the potty, poop when you're ready and outgrow your ginormous caterpillar as quickly as possible. </p><xhtml:img xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MommyShorts/~4/mr6A2k5wj_4" height="1" width="1" /></div></content>
