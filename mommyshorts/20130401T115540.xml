I imagine attaining Egg Hunt Perfection is a lot easier in the 'burbs. But just in case there are others like me who partake in communal neighborhood egg hunts instead of family hunts in their own backyard— this one is for you.
</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EASTER EGG HUNT FANTASY:</strong></span></p>
<p>Children in their Easter best gather on the White House lawn or some other lawn equally expansive. All eggs have been thoughtfully hidden in places that are neither too easy nor too difficult to find. When the hunt begins, the children know instinctively to spread out as much as possible so they don't step on one another's turf. There are enough eggs so all children are thoroughly occupied for at least thirty minutes time, with each child successfully filling their basket to the brim. When all eggs have been collected, the children gather together to open them up and see what they have inside. This is only a formality because, of course, whatever is inside the eggs, the children will be equal parts delighted and grateful. Afterwards, each child hugs and thanks their parents for showing them such a magnificent time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EASTER EGG HUNT REALITY:</strong></span></p>
<p>Your husband dresses your child while you are breastfeeding the baby and by the time you involve yourself in the process she is wearing pink leggings with a hole in them that she refuses to remove. They have paired those leggings with a forest green "Super Soccer Stars" t-shirt that is three sizes too big. You opt out of this battle because it's not like you are going to church and she'll be wearing a jacket anyway.</p>
<p>The one instruction you were given by the Egg Hunt Organizers was to bring your own basket. Between getting your three-year-old, your baby and your husband out the door with the necessary snacks, diapers and changes of clothes, you don't remember the basket until you have already left the house. Then you have to circle back, run upstairs with a baby strapped to your chest and find something ANYTHING to use. You settle on a beach pail. At least it's not a white plastic bag from Duane Reade.</p>
<p>The hunt takes place in a large courtyard between a few residential buildings. Due to lesson from last year (in which all the big kids overtook the little kids and left them with no eggs to find within a span of two minutes), the hunt has been split into two separate heats. At 11:30pm, all kids under three will search for eggs. At 12pm, all kids over three will search for eggs. You are also given strict instructions (again, due to last year) to only allow your child to take five eggs. You nod your head at these restrictions, thinking them very wise.</p>
<p>You arrive at the location at 11:45am, right when the little kid hunt is ending and the eggs are being re-hidden for the bigger kids. But, since your kid is exactly three (on the cusp of the little kid/big kid cut-off), she is not yet mature enough to undertstand why she must wait fifteen minutes for the hunt to begin. She sees eggs, she wants eggs, she was told she is here to hunt for eggs and so, SHE RETRIEVES EGGS. You then have to spend the next fifteen minutes convincing your child to put them back so that she can hunt for them again at the official time. A concept that makes no sense to her whatsoever. </p>
<p>When you have finally convinced your child to rehide the eggs (through a variety of threats, bribes and thanking her profusely for being SUCH A GOOD GIRL), you lead her to the group of kids assembling behind a rope. Your child runs under the rope making sure she is front and center and you avoid glances from other parents because perhaps they missed the whole premature-hunting-thing and won't realize she is yours.</p>
<p>At 12pm exactly, the rope drops, the kids squeal with excitement and take off. Unfortunately, they all focus their attention on the same bush. Hands are stepped on, parents yell to look elsewhere, THE PINK ONE is ripped right out from under your child's grasp. Uh-oh. You know that look. Tantrum will commence in 5, 4, 3— "It's okay, we'll find another pink one!" "I WANT THAT PINK ONE!!!!!!!" "Look, there's a pink one over there!" you lie. It works. She spots a tree, all the way in the back, makes a break for it. "I FOUND ONE!!!!!!" She picks up a pink one. You breathe a sigh of relief. Then a green one, a yellow one and a striped one, in quick succession. SHIT. This is too easy! You remember the "5 Eggs Rule". Oh no! How is this supposed to be enforced? "Make sure you leave eggs for the other kids!" you yell cheerily. She ignores you. Your husband begins removing eggs and throwing them back into the bushes when she isn't looking. She quickly finds twice as many to replace them. You overhear another mother, "Wow, she's got a lot of eggs..." "We're going to put them back!" you say a little too defensively. "No, no, I wasn't judging you!" the woman assures you. This is what's happening now. You're misinterpreting friendly banter at a neighborhood egg hunt. </p>
<p>You realize all the kids have tons of eggs. There seem to be more than enough. You relax. Your child is happy. She sits on the ground to open her eggs and see what is inside. A rubber bunny. A plastic ring. A cat tattoo. She doesn't stop until every last one is open. "Isn't this FUN?????" you say.</p>
<p>"But— THERE'S NO CANDY!!!!!!!!!"</p>
<p>Tears.</p>
<p>It's 12:02.</p><xhtml:img xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MommyShorts/~4/hthI2Oi8290" height="1" width="1" /></div></content>

Just don't eat too much— that shit is BINDING. Pun intended.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/multiple.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/multiple.html">as predicted</a>, I broke Passover prematurely and completely by accident. </p>
<p>I'd been very good about staying away from leavened-bread-type-objects and then yesterday during a momentary brain malfunction, I ate a chicken sandwich for lunch. I continued my day, came home, ate Seder leftovers for dinner and then finally, at about 9pm, I was like— Oh wait.... oops.</p>
<p>So... since I messed up that whole keeping kosher thing, I'm gonna go back to talking about all things Easter.

<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d21683970d-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="4146377622_74d3b552dc_o" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d21683970d" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d21683970d-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="4146377622_74d3b552dc_o" /></a>One of my very best friends owns a very popular creperie/bakery/bar in Providence, Rhode Island called <a href="http://www.theduckandbunny.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.theduckandbunny.com">The Duck &amp; Bunny</a>. With that name, you might imagine they are open for Easter Sunday only, but no, they are open all year round. </p>
<p>My friend's name is Jessica and she's owned The Duck &amp; Bunny with her husband, Dan, ever since they fled NYC once everyone around them started having babies.</p>
<p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong> Every crepe on the menu is named after one of their friends' kids. The Mazzy Star (portobello, fontina with rosemary and truffle oil) is named after my daughter, Mazzy.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d3bbae970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="The-duck-and-bunny2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d3bbae970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d3bbae970d-800wi" title="The-duck-and-bunny2" /></a></p>

<p>When I signed on to do <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/multiple.html#more" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/multiple.html#more">my Peeps post earlier this week</a>, I told them about my Peeps-obsessed friend, who's restaurant happens to have been awarded <strong>RHODE ISLAND'S BEST CUPCKES OF 2012</strong>. Peeps agreed to send Jessica a bunch of marshmallow chicks to let The Duck &amp; Bunny work its magic.</p>
<p>Here is the result.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d81b97970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Peeps-filled-cupcakes" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d81b97970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9d81b97970d-800wi" title="Peeps-filled-cupcakes" /></a><br />I have not tasted them (although I am tempted to drive the 2+ hours just to do so) but having eaten many of The Duck &amp; Bunny's cupcakes before, I can guarantee they are delicious. </p>
<p>I'm particularly impressed with the Peeps buttercream filling which I'm told took multiple tries to get the consistency just right.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">INGREDIENTS</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups (500 mL) sugar</li>
<li>4 egg</li>
<li>2 ½ cups (625 mL) all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 cup (250 mL) milk</li>
<li>¾  cup
(175 mL) vegetable oil</li>
<li>2 ¼ teaspoons (11 mL) baking powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">INSTRUCTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).
Line cupcake pan with papers.</p>
<p>2. In a
large mixing bowl, with an electric mixer, beat sugar and eggs together until
slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Add flour, milk, oil, baking powder,
and vanilla and beat for another minute, just until the batter is smooth and
creamy. Don't overbeat. Scoop batter into paper lined cupcake pans.</p>
<p>3. Bake in preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or
until the tops are golden and a toothpick poked into the center of the layer
comes out clean. Let cool completely.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>FLUFF BUTTERCREAM</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>1 lb unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
<li>4-5 cups 6x powdered sugar</li>
<li>¼ cup
fluff (peep colored and warmed slightly) x4</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></span></p>
<p>1. In a stationary mixer with paddle attachment, cream
butter until smooth</p>
<p>2. Slowly add powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating
about a minute between each addition</p>
<p>3. Beat until creamy and smooth</p>
<p>4. Divide buttercream to match the number of peep colors
you have</p>
<p>5. Add colored fluff to each buttercream and stir with
spatula until combined</p>
<p>6. In a round tip fitted pastry bag, scoop colored
buttercream and begin to insert into cupcakes about half way, filling it with
fluff frosting until it barely peeks out of the top of the cupcake</p>
<p>7. Make another batch of buttercream by using the first
two ingredients and a teaspoon of
vanilla.</p>
<p>8. Follow instructions 1-3</p>
<p>9. Pipe a round “doughnut” shape on the top of the fluff
filled cupcakes</p>
<p>10. Sprinkle
green colored coconut on top of the buttercream and place peep in center</p>
<p>11. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Before I go, I've got an Easter tip. Take it for what it's worth since it's coming from a Jew...</p>
<p>Hide those eggs really really really well around your house. I suggest places like inside the urn on the top of your bookshelf or behind the impossible-to-move dresser. Than sit back, watch the full season of <em>House of Cards</em> on Netflix, while your kids spend the entire day trying and failing to find them. </p>
<p>Have a good weekend and Happy Easter!</p>

I'm pretty positive, if you are a parent with a computer, you are already well aware of her. But, just in case you are living in the back of my coat closet in the storage bin that houses all the ski clothes I haven't worn since 1992, I will explain.</p>
<p>Amber Dusick writes an extremely popular blog called <a href="http://crappypictures.com" target="_blank" title="http://crappypictures.com">Parenting Illustrated with Crappy Pictures</a> in which she writes parenting stories illustrated with crappy pictures. If that doesn't sound like the funniest thing you have ever heard than you are not using your imagination. Check out <a href="http://crappypictures.com/last-monday-started-like-any-other-monday-except-the-boys-were-being-unruly-more-than-usual-i-mean-this-was-the-beginning/" target="_blank" title="http://crappypictures.com/last-monday-started-like-any-other-monday-except-the-boys-were-being-unruly-more-than-usual-i-mean-this-was-the-beginning/">"Going Viral, The Puking Kind"</a> and <a href="http://crappypictures.com/public-toilets-vs-girls-and-boys/" target="_blank" title="http://crappypictures.com/public-toilets-vs-girls-and-boys/">"Public Toilets Vs Newly Potty Trained Girls and Boys"</a> to fully understand the genius behind a badly drawn baby.</p>
<p>Amber came out with her first book this week (Congratulations, Amber!) called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0373892748/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0373892748&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">Parenting: Illustrated with Crappy Pictures</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0373892748" style="width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />" (obviously) and I could not be more excited to read it— my copy is currently en route.</p>
<p>To help promote Amber's book, I've got two things going on today.
</p>

<p>1) I'm giving away a copy! For a chance to win, leave a comment under this post.</p>
<p>2) Amber did me the supreme honor of illustrating Crappy Pictures for one of my old posts.</p>
<p>I must say, I'm feeling a little weird being all—<em> Amber is so hilarious! Now, read something of mine!</em> But a mom blogger must take thrills where she can get them and seeing myself and Mazzy illustrated in crappy pictures might be my biggest brush with greatness since Christain Slater autographed a playbill for me in the early 90's. (No, I was not wearing my ski clothes at the time.)</p>
<p>Amber chose the post herself (it's from just before Mazzy turned two) and I'm hoping that for many of you, it is your first time reading it. </p>
<p>Please notice Amber's attention to detail. Crappy Mazzy has a Crappy Bow in her hair.  </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A KIDDIE PARK?</span></strong><br /><em>Written by Me, Crappy Pictures by Amber Dusick</em></p>
<p>I loved amusement parks as a kid (the scarier the ride, the better) so I was super excited to take Mazzy to her first kiddie park. I figured she was too small to go on most of the rides but at least she'd go on the carousel and kick some ass at Wack-A-Mole.</p>
<p>Then the ticket booth lady said Mazzy could go on ALL BUT TWO of the rides.</p>
<p>REALLY? Are you sure you are not mistaking my kid for the fourteen-year-old with the neck tattoo behind me?</p>
<p>Yes, she was sure.</p>
<p>We started easy with a train that went around in a circle at .00000002 miles per hour. I rode next to Mazzy with my arm laid over her lap just in case she tried to wriggle free from the seatbelt, jump out action-movie-style and scream “Thomas!” before running headfirst into the front car.</p>
<p>Miraculously, Mazzy sat still, tightly grasping the steering wheel for the entirety of the ride.</p>
<p>Next we moved on to a boat ride where Mazzy continued to surprise by not diving head first into one foot of water.</p>
<p>With two successes under our belt, we got more adventurous and tried the plane ride, the big slide and the mini roller coaster. Mazzy emerged smiling after each one and suddenly I had visions of future mother-daughter upside-down roller coaster rides, alpine slide races and sharing a tube in the Tunnel of Terror at Splish Splash.</p>
<p>I thought about how much different I was going to be from my own mother, who’d sit on the sidelines waving and snapping pictures no matter how much I begged her to come along. </p>
<p>“Go with your dad," she'd always say. "I belong on the ground."</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we had one more ride ticket left. After scanning the park, I decided to take Mazzy on a harmless looking apparatus with a cheerful sounding name. </p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb52c6970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-1" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb52c6970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb52c6970d-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-1" /></a></p>
<p>We sat side-by-side as the "Happy Swing" started slow and steady. I yelled “whee!” on each downward motion, just in case Mazzy was unaware we were having fun.</p>
<p>Then the swing picked up speed. </p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574988970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-2" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574988970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574988970c-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-2" /></a></p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p><em>Hmmm. This seems a bit more dangerous than it did from the ground.</em></p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p>I found myself gripping Mazzy’s leg to make sure she stayed put.</p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt my stomach drop as if someone had just pushed me off the side of a cliff. </p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p>My brain rattled inside my head as my fingers practically bore holes into Mazzy’s thigh.</p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p>We were going to be thrown from the swing. I was sure of it.</p>
<p>Faster, higher, back and forth.</p>
<p><em>OH MY GOD WOULD THIS THING EVER END??!</em></p>
<p>I tried not to puke as I angled my head to make sure my baby wasn't crying. Then I offered her the only reassurance I could.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-3" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb55d0970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb55d0970d-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-3" /></p>
<p>Mazzy looked like she was in a state of shock— staring straight ahead, eyes wide as her hair whipped wildly above her. I was positive that if she survived the ride, this would be our first and last trip to the amusement park. She would forever be the little girl scarred by a crazy mother’s overzealous decision to take her on the most nausea-inducing ride in the park.</p>
<p>Finally, the swing began to slow and my hand loosened it’s grip on Mazzy’s leg. My stomach tried and failed to settle back into place as the ride screeched to it's upchuck-worthy end.</p>
<p>I looked at my poor 21-month-old daughter, prepared to plead forgiveness and assure her that this was the last time Mommy would ever place her in harm's way.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb573e970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-4" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb573e970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb573e970d-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-4" /></a></p>
<p>Mazzy was expressionless, still staring straight ahead. I touched her leg gently.</p>
<p>“Mazzy, it’s over, I promise.”</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb568f970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-5" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb568f970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017ee9cb568f970d-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-5" /></a></p>
<p><em>Oh my god. I'd killed her.</em></p>
<p>Then suddenly, her eyes sprang back to life and her arms flew over her head.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574d3a970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-6" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574d3a970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d42574d3a970c-800wi" title="Mommy-shorts-crappy-pictures-6" /></a></p>
<p>In that moment, I became my mother.</p>
<p><em>Go with your dad. I belong on the ground.</em></p>

<p>This Passover, the main objective was to get my three-year-old to stay seated at the dinner table, which meant numerous family members came to last night's seder armed with various Passover-themed books and toys. </p>
<p>None more disturbing than Grammy's gift of "The Ten Plagues Finger Puppets" <em>(see above)</em>. Yep. That's LICE, BLOOD and a DEAD BABY (aka the slaying the of the firstborn).</p>
<p>Are you having fun yet, Mazzy? What's that? You'd like a chocolate bunny and a basket full of candy? Sorry, babe! Now be a good little Jew and play with your DISEASED CATTLE puppet.
</p>

<p>In all honesty, the plagues were always my favorite part of the seder growing up (you get to dip your finger in the wine for each plague) and it wasn't until last night that I realized how horrifying this should be for a small child. </p>
<p>But Mazzy was fine and politely asked me to help her apply the BOILS sticker in her Haggadah workbook. </p>
<p>Someone else gave her a box full of the physical manifestations of the plagues (rubber locust, cup of blood, plastic frog), which caused her to wear an eye patch (DARKNESS) through most of dinner. </p>
<p>I gotta say though— Mazzy did look like she was having fun.</p>

Along with colorful Christmas lights and gingerbread houses, denying myself fluffy chick-shaped marshmallow confections was part of the sacrifice of being a Jew.</p>
<p>It wasn't until college that I ate my first Peep. You know, as part of the rebellious coming-of-age phase when you first leave home, drink lots of alcohol, hook up with questionable boys, and eat pink sugared marshmallow. Everyone goes through that, right?</p>
<p>Since I was introduced to Peeps so late in life, I didn't realize that people were doing more with Peeps than just eating them straight out of the pack.</p>
<p>Apparently, there are many kinds of "peepsonalities" beyond the purists.

<p>The kind who, even as a grown adult, still feels a tad guilty publishing a Peeps post on the second day of Passover. You know, before I forget I'm keeping kosher for the week and eat a piece of pizza by mistake on Day Three.</p>
<p>So, when Peeps asked me to express my "peepsonality" today, I deicided to pay homage to my heritage and make what I call "Matzah S'meeps". Or maybe "Matzah Sch'meeps"? That's the Peeps version of a s'more with a little Jewish twist.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHAT YOU NEED:</strong></span><br />Peeps<br />Matzah<br />Chocolate<br />Fire <br />Someone Who Does Not Care that Peeps Aren't Kosher </p>

<p>I'd offer actual instructions but that's probably not necessary. I will say to use two Peeps for each Sch'meep with the chocolate smashed between for maximum melting.</p>
<p>Aren't they pretty? Delicious too.</p>

<p>I said, "Gee, I don't know, Jenny... I'm really busy and this sounds like it might eat into my weekends." </p>
<p>Or maybe, I said something more like, "SERIOUSLY??!!! THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!!!!! Especially since I have SECOND CHILD SYNDROME and ADULT HARLOW is going to be PISSED when she sees her LACK OF QUALITY DOCUMENTATION!"</p>

Now, I'm sad to say, it seems like a pain to lug around and is buried deep in our coat closet. </p>
<p>Almost all of the photos we have of Harlow are taken on our phones.</p>
<p>As much as I love Instagram <a href="http://instagram.com/mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://instagram.com/mommyshorts">(follow me-- @mommyshorts!)</a>, those photos don't usually hold up very well if you blow them up to print.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, I have no videos of Harlow. It didn't even occur to me to take them, because she doesn't DO anything.</p>

I took video of Mazzy constantly. I have hours and hours of footage of Mazzy lying on different surfaces in various outfits... propped up in chairs, getting baths, having her hair combed, looking at herself (also not moving) in the mirror. I have videos of Mazzy SLEEPING. </p>
<p>CHILD #2 has one video that is about five seconds long. I stopped recording when I realized nothing was happening and it was just going to take up storage space.</p>
<p>

It's called <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2011/01/still-here-me-too.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2011/01/still-here-me-too.html">"Life Thus Far"</a> and it's probably my favorite thing on earth.</p>
<p>It's also how I created <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2010/11/home-video-is-boring-even-mine.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2010/11/home-video-is-boring-even-mine.html">the video of Mazzy rolling over for the first time</a>— a full two minutes chronicling countless rollover attempts before she finally completed the manuever at 6 months. </p>
<p>You know who rolled over a few weeks ago?</p>
<p>Some baby named Harlow.</p>
<p>

<p>MEMORIES.</p>
<p>

<p>Granted, Harlow rolled over successfully after her first attempt, whereas Mazzy spent three months propelling herself to one side without completing the task. We demonstrated, offered incentive, egged her on. There was frustration, determination, crying, laughter— the stuff home videos are made of!</p>
<p>But Harlow?</p>
<p>She was just like, "Yeah, I wanna roll over. There I did it. No big deal." </p>
<p>All beginning and ending, NO STORY ARC.</p>
<p>

Nope, little Harlow, flipping over at a mere three months, <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/the-evil-faces-of-harlow.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/01/the-evil-faces-of-harlow.html">shooting looks that kill</a> at anyone who dares to glance her way...</p>
<p>CHILD #2 IS NOT WALKING IN ANYBODY'S SHADOW.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to use Jenny Sherouse to take pictures of their family, I cannot recommend her highly enough. Hopefully, the proof is above. You can contact her <a href="http://jennysherouse.com" target="_blank" title="http://jennysherouse.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>I, of course, am indebted to her FOREVER.</p><xhtml:img xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MommyShorts/~4/RgP5G4_1y3U" height="1" width="1" /></div></content>

" by a "bunch of kickass mom bloggers". To enter, I asked you all to tell me the name of your inevitable MOMOIR; funniest title wins. There were so many great responses, I asked a few of the book's authors to help judge.

<p>Sometimes multiple judges gets complicated. Not this time. Nine out of the thirteen judges picked Meg Hanson's momoir, <strong>"Everything I Know About Parenting, I Learned from Google"</strong>. </p>
<p>I guess that goes to show you just how many of us have googled terms like, "do stretch marks go away", "what does neon yellow poop mean" and "who would like to take my toddler for a long weekend".</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations, Meg!</strong> Now, you just have to write 200-300 single spaced pages and your momoir will be complete! Please email me to get your prize. The rest of you can purchase "I Just Want to Pee Alone" by clicking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988408031/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0988408031&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">here</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0988408031" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.</p>
<p>But I'm not done yet. You guys wrote so many brilliant momoir titles, I couldn't let them linger underneath <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/10-title-options-for-my-inevitable-momoir.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/10-title-options-for-my-inevitable-momoir.html">an old post in the comments</a> for eternity, so I decided to unearth my favorites here. </p>

<p>In contrast to <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/what-a-child-feels-like-when-you-tell-them-they-are-getting-a-new-sibling-video.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/what-a-child-feels-like-when-you-tell-them-they-are-getting-a-new-sibling-video.html">the video I showed on Tuesday</a>, Mazzy embraced the addition of Harlow pretty quickly and continues to enjoy her company. Sure, she'll get pissed when I'm holding the baby and she wants to be the one sitting in my lap. Or she'll request I leave Harlow in the other room while I come with her to play. But for the most part, Mazzy keeps coming up with new and interesting ways to interact with her little sister. Whether Harlow likes it or not.</p>
<p>Since Harlow can barely move, she is more Mazzy's prop than her playmate. Or helpless victim, depending on how you look at it. </p>
<p>Harlow just furrows her brow as Mazzy pokes, prods and smothers her, silently plotting her revenge. If you could hear Harlow's inner monologue, it would probably be something like, "This is cool now, my friend. But you just WAIT."</p>

<p>Here are Mazzy's top ten methods of harassing the baby:</p>
<p>1. Dress-up the baby, usually in various hats. Then surround her with carefully selected and precisely placed toys. <em>(see above)</em></p>
<p>2. Run circles around the baby. Literally.</p>
<p>3. Make the baby hold unweildy objects.</p>
<p>

<p>4. Scream into the baby's ear.</p>
<p>5. Force the baby to eat a fake banana.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0184" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37fad0b3970b-800wi" title="IMG_0184" /></a></p>

<p>7. Violate the baby's belly button.</p>
<p>8. Make a bridge over the baby.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_0981" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017d422a1df7970c-800wi" title="IMG_0981" /></a></p>
<p>9. Jump over the baby giving her mother a heart attack.</p>
<p>10. Pretend the baby is a telephone.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="264" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtT4eFg3G4Q" width="470" /><em>Note: I have no idea how Mazzy even knows what a rotary phone looks like.</em></p>
<p>Despite how often I must tell Mazzy to be careful around Harlow and discourage her from performing some of her more reckless interactions, I know Mazzy's antics are all with the purpose of one common goal: </p>
<p>Get as close to the baby as possible.</p>
<p>

You know, to pass the time in a productive fashion. Yup. Head nod. Mmmmhm. Of course.</p>
<p>Immediately, I thought of all the amazing projects Mazzy and I accomplished a few months ago when she stayed home from preschool with bronchitis. From the second Mazzy woke up feverish and hacking up a lung, I was determined to make sure each moment was more creative and action-packed than the last. </p>
<p>What better way to start a sick day than with strawberry banana pancakes created entirely out of felt!
</p>

<p>After breakfast, Mazzy ran around the apartment collecting the excess fabric I have lying around the house for such an occasion, and then, between snotsucking and nose wiping, I sewed all the material into what I call "GET WELL WINGS".</p>

<p>When Mazzy skipped her nap due to the discomfort of excessive phlegm build-up in her throat, we passed the time making a chrysanthemum mirror out of 300 plastic spoons.</p>
<p>Isn't it beautiful? And not tedious at all!</p>

<p>What? You don't do this sort of thing when your child is home ill? Please don't tell me you let them sit on the couch all day covered in snotty tissues with their glassy little eyes fixated on the television! You don't have all three Toy Stories cued up on the DVD player, an iPad with 50 todler apps at your child's germy fingertips and a season of Dora the Explorer playing on a loop...</p>
<p>DO YOU????</p>
<p>Nope, sick days are an opportunity for parent/child activities and kid-friendly crafts! At the end of the day, you should have something to show for it! I was just kidding about that whole television thing. You would NEVER do that. </p>
<p>When Mazzy gets sick, instead of parking ourselves on the couch in the living room, we spend the time in our fully-supplied craft room full of ribbons, buttons and all the materials one would need should we have the sudden urge to decoupage.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="3b7b955c90e20bde0580c32e6cd12827" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c37f09d4e970b-800wi" title="3b7b955c90e20bde0580c32e6cd12827" /></a></p>
<p>You'd be surprised how often the urge to decoupage arises. Usually right after a particularly bad stomach bug. I always say— if you are going to have bodily fluids coming out of both ends, you better have a container of Mod Podge at the ready!</p>
<p>If you don't have a beautiful craft room full of supplies, that is no excuse. You can make very simple crafts out of household garbage. Like these easy-to-execute toilet paper roll silhouettes.</p>
<p>

<p>If you don't feel comfortable handing your three-year-old an exacto knife, especially when she is delirious with a fever, don't worry— there are tons of toilet paper roll crafts you can create with one hand while using your other hand to take your daughter's temperature or wipe her sweating brow.</p>
<p>Like these pasta toilet paper roll bracelet cuffs!</p>

<p>Well then, how about this simple toilet paper roll family:</p>

Let's do more CRAFTS and EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES! SICK DAYS ARE WHERE MEMORIES ARE BORN!!!"</p>
<p>Still too difficult? FINE. Have it your way. Make a toilet paper mummy and then turn on Calliou. </p>
