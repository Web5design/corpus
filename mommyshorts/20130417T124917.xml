<p><em><strong>GIVEAWAY: Signed Copy of "Girl Walks into a Bar"</strong></em></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38ae0666970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Girl Walks Into a Bar" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c38ae0666970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38ae0666970b-800wi" title="Girl Walks Into a Bar" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38ae0666970b-pi" style="display: inline;" />In addition to paying obscene amounts for our strollers and putting our names on waiting lists for summer camp before our children are even born, being a New York City parent means your kid has a slightly better than average chance of attending preschool alongside the offspring of previous cast members of Saturday Night Live.</p>
<p>In my case, Mazzy goes to preschool with Eli, son of Rachel Dratch.</p>
<p>Rachel, before she spent most of her time fending off stalkerish emails in which I insist we are best of mom friends, wrote a book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072NWKL0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0072NWKL0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">Girl Walks into a Bar</a> </em>about her life experiences as a comedian, a single person in Manhattan and in a surprise twist ending, a new mom at 44.  </p>
<p>The book is hilarious (as dating in Manhattan tends to be), relatable (I used to perform SNL skits too! Only for my parents in our basement!), but also surprisingly poignant. With all the internet snarkiness I am used to reading about parenting, it's refreshing to read Rachel's perspective, as someone who just feels lucky her life took an unexpected turn and she gets to be Eli's mom.</p>
<p>Today, Rachel was kind enough to answer twenty questions (it's my first celebrity interview!) and give away a signed copy of her book in the comment section below.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>1. Explain your parenting philosophy in five words or less.</strong></p>
<p>I don't really have one strong philosophy. Maybe "Live in the moment?" I'm not super rigid at all. I try to stick to a basic schedule but when things don't go as planned I try to go with the flow. Maybe that comes from my improv comedy background! In more trying times, I suppose my parenting philosophy is "Try not to lose your shit." That's six words though. </p>
<p><strong>2. Are you in danger of getting kicked out of show biz for naming your kid something normal?</strong></p>
<p>When I was pregnant I had a dream that our son was named Hercules. So we started calling him Herc in utero on a regular basis. Then it lost its jokey quality to me and I actually started thinking Herc sounded like a cool name. But I couldn’t go the distance with it. I think you can only pull off that name if you are Greek. And I wouldn’t have been able to deal with the double takes and questions. In the end I'm glad we named him Eli.</p>
<p><strong>3. If you had to be the spokesperson for one baby product, what would you choose and why?</strong></p>
<p>The Boppy Newborn Lounger. I had no idea what it was - someone gave it to me at my shower and it sat around for awhile until I busted it out and was like - "this is my salvation!" I’d plop Eli on it in the bathroom to take a shower on a daily basis. And, even though the label says not to do this - so please know this is not sanctioned by the good people at Boppy - my son had acid reflux and couldn't lie flat so we would let him sleep on the pillow.</p>
<p><strong>4. What is the most ridiculous thing Eli ever had a tantrum over?</strong></p>
<p>Luckily he hasn’t pitched many tantrums but the Biggie was like something out of a movie. I took him to see the model trains around Christmas time in Grand Central. He loved it so much that I realized, “Hmm, this is going to be a tough exit.” So I<strong> </strong>waited and waited as he watched the trains go around and around, until it was 6 o'clock and I had to pull the plug on the outing. After saying ten times, “Ok! We’re going to have to go soon!” I finally picked him up to take him out to leave. Commence screaming and crying, “I want the TRAAAINNS! I want the TRAAAINNS!” I’m wrestling him out of the building and I tried to step outside to get a cab (he is still screaming), but there were no cabs, so we go back in, and we end up in the very center of Grand Central by the clock when I had to put him down. He is lying on the floor screaming “I want the TRAAAINNS!” in the middle of rush hour. The place is packed with commuters and I can’t get him off the floor. You could almost see the camera panning out in the big crane shot. Someone helped me pick up his coat and of course in that moment when you do not want to be recognized she says over the din “Hey! Aren’t you from SNL?!”</p>
<p><strong>5. Do you think being a celebrity helps or hurts when it comes to making mom friends?</strong></p>
<p>I never really thought of that because I don’t really think of myself as a celebrity when I walk into a room full of people. It’s not like I’m so famous that walk around thinking “DON’T YOU KNOW WHO I AM?!”</p>
<p><strong>6. Who is your mom idol?</strong></p>
<p>I guess my mom idol for a preschooler is my own mom, because my memories of her when I was that age are just of her being engaged, and thinking up fun things to do, and giving a feeling of safety and empathy. Now, the teenage years - that would be another story...</p>
<p><strong>7. What's the weirdest parenting or pregnancy-related search term you've ever googled?</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that comes to mind is when I first learned I was pregnant it was such a shock, and I had unknowingly been partaking of alcohol throughout the first month of the pregnancy. Because of my age, I had assumed I was going through some sort of early menopause. So the day I found out I was pregnant, my internet history read “Menopause” “Symptoms of menopause” “Alcohol in early pregnancy”.</p>
<p><strong>8. What children's TV show gets the most airtime at your house?</strong></p>
<p>We go through phases. First Elmo, then Mickey, and lately it’s all about Little Einsteins. I thought I would not have him watch TV at all at such a young age, but then practical life kicks in and it’s like - “I’ve got to take a shower this morning! I know he will stay still on the couch for this show.” It’s a slippery slope...</p>
<p><strong>9. Which children's show makes you want to throw the remote at the television?</strong></p>
<p>Eli used to wake up super early, like 5:30, and I was comatose. The only age appropriate thing on television at that time is Barney. The lilt in Barney’s voice and the way they talk-sing all their songs drove me insane. But then, I never thought I'd say this - I got used to it. Another show I simply cannot watch is Wow Wow Wubbzy. I turned it on once to watch and after a few minutes, I said aloud, in spite of myself, “This is fucking horrible.”</p>
<p><strong>10. Which present or former SNL cast member would you most trust to watch your kid?</strong></p>
<p>SNL is such a bonding experience. Even the people you don’t hang with in your spare time, you are still up there in front of millions on live TV and you are all relying on each other, so if I can trust them all up there in a scene, I can trust them all with my kid! That said, as far as who I would trust the MOST - besides the ladies, I'll say Will Forte. He could be my manny.</p>
<p><strong>11. One day, when you decide to show Eli something of yours from SNL, which sketch do you think you'll show him first?</strong></p>
<p>I’d show him this 80 year old Hollywood producer I used to do named Abe Scheinwald, because you can just take one look at me dressed as this guy and understand it’s supposed to be funny. Although seeing me like that might really confuse the kid.</p>
<p><strong>12. If Debbie Downer showed up to a NYC preschool admissions tour, what would she say?</strong></p>
<p>“Your kids are all so cute! Too bad there are 600 of you applying and only 16 will get in.” WAAAH WAAAAAH.</p>
<p>“When I was a kid, I played with blocks too. Only difference is, my parents didn’t pay 15 grand a year for me to do it.” WAAAH WAAAH</p>
<p>“PS. Hope your kid started music class already or you have a nanny who speaks Mandarin. You don’t? Well I guess the PS stands for public school then. Cuz that’s where you’re headed. Hope you’re in one of the GOOD districts or it’s time to start apartment shopping. That’s a fun thing to do in New York.” WAAAH WAAAAAH</p>
<p><strong>13. You've got one hour of child-free, work-free time. What are you doing?</strong></p>
<p>My honest answer is, I think about all the things I should do with that time - clean up, groceries, work out, write, call friends, buy some new clothes - and then I get paralyzed by all the options and end up wasting the time looking online.</p>
<p><strong>14. What's the biggest advantage to having kids later in life?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose it’s that I’ve already “done” the career thing - not that I don’t hope to continue my comedy career, but in terms of climbing the ladder to SNL, I feel like I’ve checked that off, and I’ve also done a lot of the travel/NYC nightlife stuff, so I don’t feel torn at all when it comes to staying home and living a more domestic life with my kid.</p>
<p><strong>15. What's the biggest disadvantage?</strong></p>
<p>If I could have had kids earlier, I would have, but that’s just not how it worked out for me. I feel so grateful that I even have a child - he was such a great surprise - so I don’t spend too much time dwelling on the what-ifs. So far I don’t feel like an “old mom” and I hope i can keep that going!</p>
<p><strong>16. What was your proudest parenting moment thus far?</strong></p>
<p>The best stuff is the stuff they surprise you with, that seems to have nothing to do with your parenting but when you just get to see their innate little self come out. I had a moment at a family party when Eli went out on the dance floor and was just jamming out in his little khakis for like a half hour, and was going up to everyone and clapping at them and being this mini life of the party! But that’s not really a parenting thing, it’s just a fun thing. I guess I’m glad at this point he seems generally happy and smiley, and I’m proud if I’m keeping up a nice facade over my cynical side. Also, since he is the first and only grandkid, it’s really fun seeing my parents flip out over him and all the joy he has added to their lives. He was a surprise for them too!</p>
<p><strong>17. Why did you write <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072NWKL0/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0072NWKL0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">Girl Walks into a Bar</a></em>?</strong></p>
<p>I started writing because the acting roles had slowed down and I had a lot of free time on my hands and I had spent enough of it watching daytime TV. I began as a creative exercise to see what it was like to write up a funny story when something unusual happened to me. Then those stories kind of sat around for awhile until a few years later I had the surprise real-life pregnancy plot twist and that’s when I started writing it all as a book in earnest. One cool little thing about the book is that when I was writing stories about the single girl at the baby shower, I didn’t know I would be having a baby later in the book!</p>
<p><strong>18. What did John think of the book?</strong></p>
<p>He was supportive and I think he liked how it turned out. It’s a vulnerable feeling to share such a personal story, so you want to be extra sensitive to the other people involved. John is in business and every so often he’ll be in a meeting or something and afterwards the person will say, “So... I read that book!” Somehow the scuttlebutt gets around!</p>
<p><strong>19. What's harder— finding success as an actor, dating in Manhattan or parenting a two-year-old?</strong></p>
<p>Wooooowwww. I love this question. This is my real answer: I’d say the easiest is parenting a two-year old, (and it ain’t easy!), followed by finding success as an actor, and the hardest has to be dating in Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>20. If a psychic were to predict your not so distant future, what would you hope she would say?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh. You are referring to my psychic story in the book! (A psychic told me on my 43rd birthday that I would have a child, and I wasn’t even dating anyone, and I was like “Yeah, right.”) I would hope she would say, I get some really fun comedy job that doesn’t take too much time away from being a mom.</p>

Typically, I am terrible with expressing myself in a tragedy. I am always so worried about saying the wrong thing that my sentiments sound canned and generic. Writing about the bombings in Boston seem like it only serves to make myself feel better for acknowledging it, because I have nothing important to say beyond the fact that I am as sad and horrified as everyone else. </p>
<p>This morning, I talked to a few friends who said people are looking for a reason to smile today. I hope that's true. </p>
<p>If you want to hear thoughtful perspectives on yesterday's events fueled by a love of Boston and the human race, I suggest <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/baby-sideburns/2013/04/the-boston-marathon-is-fing-amazing-and-so-are-most-people/" target="_blank" title="http://www.chicagonow.com/baby-sideburns/2013/04/the-boston-marathon-is-fing-amazing-and-so-are-most-people/">"The Boston Marathon is F'ing Amazing and So Are Most People"</a> by Baby Sideburns (a Boston native) and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/15/if-you-are-losing-faith-in-human-nature-go-out-and-watch-a-marathon/" target="_blank" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/04/15/if-you-are-losing-faith-in-human-nature-go-out-and-watch-a-marathon/">"If You are Losing Faith in Human Nature, Go Out and Watch a Marathon"</a> from the Washington Post.

<p>If you want a simple smile, I'm posting babies in mugs.
</p>

<p>'Babies in mugs' is much easier to pull off than <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/crouching-baby-hidden-dragon.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/crouching-baby-hidden-dragon.html">my fancy photoshopped pictures of Harlow last week</a>. 'Babies in mugs' is actually holding a mug in front of your baby, so that it competely obscures their body and snapping a photo. That's it. No photoshop necessary.</p>
<p>You can even do toddlers in mugs.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea48d15e970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="IMG_2492" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea48d15e970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea48d15e970d-800wi" title="IMG_2492" /></a></p>
<p>Or dogs in mugs.</p>

<p>In fact, babies/toddlers/pets in mugs is so easy, I asked people on Instagram to submit pictures under the hashtag #babeinamug and I already have a bunch of submissions.</p>

<p>The Mommy Shorts Mug makes your morning coffee taste ten times better, will retain the optimal temperature for as long as possible and even suggest a second cup if the caffeine in one cup of coffee does not sufficiently wake you up enough to start your day. </p>
<p>It also features a perfectly placed handle to protect your hand should your mug get too hot, although you can't see it in the picture.</p>
<p>It does not make this world a better place to live or give you the words to explain your overwhelming sadness to your children, but it would if it could.</p>
<p>If you don't want to take your chances with the whole 'babe in a mug' thing, you can buy the Mommy Shorts Mug <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://www.zazzle.com/mommyshorts">by clicking here</a>. </p>
<p>For everyone else, I'll be anouncing the winner this Friday.</p>
<p>I hope all my readers who live in Boston or were there for the marathon yesterday are safe and home with their children today.</p>
<p>Thinking of you all,</p>

Industry insiders are already clamoring for the sequel, with options like "Brush Your Teeth or You Will Get Fucking Cavities," "Clean Your Room, It Looks Like a Shithole" and "Stop Being a Jackass and Eat Your Vegetables" all under consideration.</p>
<p>They've already signed on a writer to flesh out the screenplay but just in case he needs a little inspiration, I thought I'd offer up a scene from my own life as reference.</p>
<p>After all, "Go the Fuck to Sleep" could be a documentary shot at my house EVERY MOTHERFUCKING NIGHT.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characters</span></strong></p>
<p><strong />Mike.......... Father<br />Ilana.......... Mother <br />Mazzy....... Toddler<br />Harlow....... Baby </p>
<p><strong>SCENE I</strong></p>
<p><em>Open on Mike sitting in the living room watching television. There are toys strewn about the floor, a puddle of Go-gurt on the couch and a half eaten hot dog on an Elmo plate on the coffee table. Mike looks like he has been runover by a truck. </em></p>
<p><em>Ilana enters the room. She's got spit up on her shirt, her ponytail is askew and her <em>left boob is hanging out of her nursing bra</em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> Is she asleep?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Which one?</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> The baby.</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> I put her in the crib but I don't think it's gonna take.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> What about Mazzy?</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY</strong> <em>(yelling from other room)</em>: I want some water!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Does that answer your question?</p>
<p><em>Mike starts to get up. Ilana panics.</em></p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> WHAT ARE YOU DOING????!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> I'm getting her water.</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Are you CRAZY???</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> We can't get her water?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> If we get her water, then she is just going to scream for something else.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> So, what? Ignore her?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Yes, ignore her.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> She's never going to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> You have to wait it out.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> I'm getting her water. </p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can't get it for her NOW!!! You'll just be reinforcing that she has to yell repeatedly until she gets what she wants.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> So what you're saying is, if I was going to get her water, I should have gotten her water when she first yelled it?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> You mean, when I first got up to get her the water and you told me not to?</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WANT SOME WATER!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> She's not even going to drink the water. I got her water last night and she just put it next to her bed without even taking a sip.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> You got her water last night?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Yeah. But she asked while I was still in there putting her to bed.</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> You're sending mixed messages!!! The rules aren't clear!</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WAAAAAANT SOME WAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Don't answer her.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WAAAAAAAAANT SOME WAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I WAAAAAAAAAAANT SOME WAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> GO TO SLEEP, MAZZY!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> What did you do that for????</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> What?</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> We were getting through to her and you ruined it!</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> I don't think we were getting through to her. </p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Well, not now that you ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> Ignoring her isn't working.</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> It will! You just have to make it through the extinction burst.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>MIKE:</strong> The what? </p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> It has to get really bad before it stops. </p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Giving in at the height of the tantrum is the worst thing you can do. </p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> Then the next time, she will escalate to the crazy place that much faster.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....... WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!........ WAAAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!!!!!........ WAAAAAAAAAATER!!!!!!!!........ WAAAAAATER!!!!!.....................WAAATER!!!!!................... WAAAATER!!!!!!......................... WAATER!!............................................

<p><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p><em>(more silence)</em></p>
<p><em>(even more silence)</em></p>
<p><strong>ILANA:</strong> See? We just had to—</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c388bba7c970b-pi" style="display: inline;" />The photo above is Mazzy at our much-needed mother-daughter lunch that <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/4-reasons-my-daughter-hates-me.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/4-reasons-my-daughter-hates-me.html">I talked about last week</a> (thank you all for your comments and advice). </p>
<p>I wish I could say it went swimmingly but it went exactly how restaurant outings always go with Mazzy— fun until five seconds in, when she realizes she is confined to a table and chair for the duration of the meal. </p>
<p>Then I have to keep her occupied drawing on menus and counting change and playing "I Spy" until the pizza arrives, except the pizza is too hot and she has to wait that out too. </p>
<p>Then when I attempt to put a slice on her plate, she starts screaming like there's a ghost on top of it when in actuality its just a piece of basil.
</p>

<p>So I pick off all the basil from the entire pizza, cut up the slice into tiny bite-size pieces and by the time I'm done, the pizza is not only cold but now completely lost its novelty and Mazzy just wants to go home.</p>
<p>And I'm left there thinking things like— <em>WHY ARE YOU RUINING THE QUALITY TIME I'M TRYING TO SPEND WITH YOU????</em></p>
<p>Honestly, lunch didn't matter. The real mother-daughter magic came when I picked her up from school. She was so excited to see me there, she ran out screaming "MOMMMY!!!!" and practically knocked me over with her hug. </p>
<p>Even though lunch wasn't exactly "a fun time", I do think it made an impact on both of us, as far as Mazzy feeling like Mommy was paying attention to her. For our next one-on-one time, I'm going to take some advice left on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts">my fanpage</a> by Jenny B. She said to have Mazzy choose the mother/daughter activity herself.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Mazzy won't ask me to sit on the couch next to her while she watches Dora the Explorer. </p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c388e5fb5970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Motherhood_HC-374x525" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c388e5fb5970b" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c388e5fb5970b-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Motherhood_HC-374x525" /></a>Two more blogger books came out this week. Yes, I know, I'm talking about a lot of books lately. But it seems the publishing world has recently caught on to all the awesome content being created online and wants a piece. (They haven't caught on to my content yet, but I'll pretend I like flying under the radar.)</p>
<p>The first is Jill Smokler's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476728348/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1476728348&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">Motherhood Comes Naturally (and Other Vicious Lies)</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1476728348" style="width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />".</p>
<p>I asked people on my fanpage to tell me the lies they were told about motherhood and here are my three favorite answers.</p>
<p><strong><em>" 'It's the most rewarding job there is.' That only applies half the time. The other half we spend trying to figure out how to run away."</em></strong> - Kathy </p>
<p><em><strong>" 'You will glow during pregnancy.' Uh...I only glowed under the McDonald's light while snarfing their apple pies."</strong></em> - Kerry from <a href="http://www.housetalkn.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.housetalkn.com">HouseTalkN</a></p>
<p><em><strong>" 'Savor EVERY moment when they are young as its precious and you will never get it back.' Umm... my preschooler tells me at least five times a day that I "make her crazy" and I'm "ruining her life". Most nights I savor bedtime!"</strong></em> - Heather </p>
<p>The second book is How to Be a Dad's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449819876/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0449819876&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">The Guide to Baby Sleep Positions: Survival Tips for Co-Sleeping Parents</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mommshor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0449819876" style="width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />". Check out the first ten positions below:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea2f0d48970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="149275_624568940890252_2073216815_n" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea2f0d48970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea2f0d48970d-800wi" title="149275_624568940890252_2073216815_n" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea2f0d48970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />"The Booby Trap" is very popular in our house except somehow the person with the boobies (me) is the one kicked out of the bed. How is that even possible?</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, I've got launches for three more blogger books so please make room on your night stand. That is, if there isn't already a baby sleeping there.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THE NEWEST JAMES BOND VILLAIN</strong></span></p>
<p>Lastly, because everyone loved my <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/crouching-baby-hidden-dragon.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/04/crouching-baby-hidden-dragon.html">photoshopped pictures of Harlow</a> yesterday, I decided to do one more. </p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=617416114938868&amp;set=pb.153515434662274.-2207520000.1365774030&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank" title="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=617416114938868&amp;set=pb.153515434662274.-2207520000.1365774030&amp;type=3&amp;theater">the photo I posted on facebook</a> where it looked like Harlow was about to have me fired? Or call upon me to do a service for "the family" some day in the future? </p>
<p>Someone suggested she should be petting a fluffy white cat in that photo, like Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the early James Bond movies. </p>
<p>Well, here you go...</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c388bd8bd970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Harlow-cat" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c388bd8bd970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c388bd8bd970b-800wi" title="Harlow-cat" /></a></p>
<p>Now imagine that baby breaking out of her swaddle, flipping herself over and screaming for your attention at all hours of the night. </p>
<p>Scary, scary, stuff.</p>
<p>Take a moment and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts" target="_blank" title="http://www.facebook.com/mommyshorts">join me on facebook</a> (it's fun there, I promise!) and have a good weekend!</p>

<p>Wouldn't ya know, I always make good on my promises...</p>

</p>

<p>After exhausting all X-game events, that probably would have been the time to finally hit the sack. After all, that baby skateboarder would be waking up at 4am for a feeding. </p>
<p>But no, I moved on to movies. </p>
<p>I call this one <em>Crouching Baby Hidden Dragon</em>...</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea270d37970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Crouching" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea270d37970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea270d37970d-800wi" title="Crouching" /></a></p>
<p>And this one, <em>Karate Baby</em>...</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c3883df38970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Karate-kid-baby" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c3883df38970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c3883df38970b-800wi" title="Karate-kid-baby" /></a></p>
<p>But my favorite one has got to be— <em>BABY KONG</em>.</p>
<p>

<p>On Instagram, she posts pictures of her kids along with gorgeous yet self-deprecating selfies, screen grabs of various magazine articles she appears in, ironic pop culture fodder like Stephanie Tanner in suspenders and the brilliant picture up top promoting her new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062102222/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062102222&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mommshor-20">Everything Is Perfect When You're a Liar</a>", which might have been designed specifically for this Gwyneth side-by-side.</p>
<p>It all feels like looking into a window of a party to which I have not been invited and I go back and forth between obsession and debating whether to unfollow.</p>
<p>Then she posts a tweet like the one below and I imagine we are best friends in an alternate universe where I am much much much cooler.
</p>

<p>Last night Kelly Oxford was on Jimmy Kimmel and he had a hard time explaining who she is as well, so he opted to have children on the street read Kelly Oxford tweets out loud.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't even think you need the kids to understand the brilliance. </p>
<p>Let your lady crushes commence...</p>

If you are going to be boring about it, that name is usually Bean, Peanut or for the Dirty Dancing fans amongst us— Baby.</p>
<p>Mazzy, as I've mentioned was Yoko Ono, which translates into Egg #1. Granted, this translation is in a made-up language that exists only in my head.
</p>

<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38786fc1970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Yokoono-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c38786fc1970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38786fc1970b-800wi" title="Yokoono-utero" /></a></p>
<p>As for the rest of you, you named your unborn children everything from Junebug to Kumquat to Munchichi. </p>
<p>Some of you had sound reasoning for your choices, like Sarah who called her unborn child "Baby Grill" because that's what her little boy would tell people they were having. </p>
<p>Or <a href="http://www.thetiredmother.blogspot.com/">The Tired Mother</a> who called her fetus "Bacon" because her husband walked in while she was making breakfast and said "How's it bakin' in there?" to her stomach. </p>
<p>And then there were people like Chrissie, who refered to the tiny inhabitant inside her womb as "Madongo", the African word for uncircumcised, just to make for some awesomely awkward moments when someone innocently asked "Why?".</p>
<p>But I had the most fun devising my own reasons for your choices. </p>
<p>For instance, Kristina called her unborn child "Little Dude", which I can only assume means her babydaddy was "The Dude".</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b5cbe970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Dude-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b5cbe970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b5cbe970d-800wi" title="Dude-utero" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b5cbe970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Hollie called her unborn baby "Duckie", because that's what she says he looked like on the ultrasound. Whether that means her fetus looked like a long billed pond dweller with webbed feet or a high school outsider with a crush on Molly Ringwald is unclear.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b607e970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Duckie-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b607e970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b607e970d-800wi" title="Duckie-utero" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b607e970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Dolly and Ashlee both decided to express their love for McDonalds, by naming their soon to be children after items on the dollar menu. "Nugget" and "Tater Tot", respectively.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b61b3970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Nugget-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b61b3970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b61b3970d-800wi" title="Nugget-utero" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b61b3970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Personally, I think "Sausage McMuffin" would make an excellent in-utero-name as well.</p>
<p>Kurstin called her fetus "Michael Phelps", because DUH, she was high when she conceived him. Or maybe it had something to do with being the strongest swimmer...</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b650e970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Michaelphelps" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b650e970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea1b650e970d-800wi" title="Michaelphelps" /></a></p>
<p>If you're like Caro and already have four kids, than it makes perfect sense to name your current pregnancy #5. Just don't tell Steve Guttenberg in case he tries to collect royalties.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c387840ed970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Number5-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c387840ed970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c387840ed970b-800wi" title="Number5-utero" /></a></p>
<p>(No, that's not Wall-E for everyone born after 1986.)</p>
<p>If you have twins, than the smartest solution to deciphering between them are the affectionate names used by Zenmama: "Thing 1 and Thing 2". I'm sure her children appreciated those names equally once outside the womb.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38784dca970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Things-utero" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c38784dca970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38784dca970b-800wi" title="Things-utero" /></a></p>
<p>But I also love Jessica's in utero twin names, "JosA and JosB", pronounced with your best Spanish accent.</p>
<p>If you've got a kicker, then you have a few options. Lil' Ninja, Thumper or my personal favorite, David Beckham. </p>

<p>Sorry, I couldn't resist including the torso.</p>
<p>Beth says she called her unborn child "Izzy" short for "Izzy a boy, Izzy a girl?" but I suspect, Beth was just a big Grey's Anatomy fan and never got over the departure of Katherine Heigl.</p>

<p>After careful thought, I decided to save everyone the visual of a photoshopped turd inside a sonogram. But I will say, "Number Two" might be the name most likely to stick around after the baby is born.</p>
<p>You know, when you lovingly refer to your crying tantruming two-year-old as your "LITTLE SHIT".</p>

<content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US" xml:base="http://www.mommyshorts.com/"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea14e5f1970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cbeb01065a6211e283d722000a1f99fc_7" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017eea14e5f1970d image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea14e5f1970d-800wi" title="Cbeb01065a6211e283d722000a1f99fc_7" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017eea14e5f1970d-pi" style="display: inline;" />Once upon a time, Mazzy wore whatever I wanted. I put her in little dresses with adorable cardigans and matching socks and all was right with the world.</p>
<p>Now, there is not a clothing decision that is made in which Mazzy does not take part. Just as she is opinionated about which books I read at bedtime and what brand of string cheese she eats, she cares just as much about what clothing (if any) makes its way onto her body.</p>
<p>From underwear selection to hair ribbon color (NO! I WANT A HEADBAND!!!!!), Mazzy chooses EVERYTHING. It's either that or we get dressed for several hours and probably miss school. </p>
<p>Personally, I'd rather save my battles for something else.
</p>

<p>So, when Mazzy insists that every pair of pants she wears must be a pink pair of leggings and there is no way she is entertaining any kind of top besides her Super Soccer Stars t-shirt that is three sizes too large, that is what she wears. And it is up to us to make sure those pieces of clothing are washed and folded in her drawer or else you must be prepared to explain their absence the next day.</p>
<p>When she does steer away from the Super Soccer Stars t-shirt, Mazzy will stick within her comfort zone. </p>
<p>What's her comfort zone? </p>
<p>THE COLOR PINK.</p>
<p>Mazzy's goal is usually to wear as many pink items as possible. It makes no sense to her why you would wear a pink shirt with a different color pants— clearly THEY DO NOT GO TOGETHER IF THEY ARE BOTH NOT PINK (double negative, I know).</p>
<p>So, most days she is wearing a pink pair of leggings, a pink shirt, pink socks, pink sneakers, and a pink bow. Sometimes she'll even throw a pink skirt on top of the leggings for good measure. Add her pink hat and puffy pink jacket and the outfit is complete.</p>
<p><strong>VALUABLE LESSON:</strong> If you suspect your child will wear nothing but pink, do not buy him/her a pink coat. A pink coat on top of an all pink outfit (shoes included) makes your child look like a bottle of Peptobismol covered in cotton candy sitting in a glass of strawberry Quik. It is an ASSAULT ON THE SENSES.</p>
<p>Also, if you think all this pink means my child is AT THE VERY LEAST matching, you would be grossly underestimating the number of variations and shades of PINK. There is also the off chance PURPLE will work its way into the mix and nothing clashes more than a purple cardigan, bright pink leggings, a pale pink skirt, lavender socks and dark magenta shoes. </p>
<p>Case in point:</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c3871a438970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Photo-233" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c3871a438970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c3871a438970b-800wi" title="Photo-233" /></a></p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c3871a438970b-pi" style="display: inline;" />I once read Madonna wears the same blue track suit all the time because that renders the pictures snapped by the paparazzi worthless. Even <em>US Weekly</em> doesn't want twenty pictures of Madonna in the same outfit so the photographers leave her alone.</p>
<p>That's how I feel about Mazzy's pink on pink on pink on pink attire. It is no longer instagrammable.</p>
<p>So, now that's its spring and we will finally shed the puffy pink jacket for good, it is time to buy Mazzy some new clothes. Am I going to make the same mistake of buying a bunch of clothes I like that Mazzy won't wear? </p>
<p>NOPE.</p>
<p>I made Mazzy go online shopping with me— which I must say, she greatly enjoyed. We sat at the computer, looked at different online clothing sites and she picked stuff out. </p>
<p>She even picked some NON-PINK stuff out! </p>
<p>I have no idea what her criteria was for her selections, just gut reactions, I guess, but it was fun to hear her commentary. "That's too fancy." "That yellow dress is beautiful." "I don't need another sweater." "Oooooh!!!! A skirt with bicycles!" And so on.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38718d13970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Spring clothes for toddler girls" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0133f30ae399970b017c38718d13970b image-full" src="http://themommyproject.typepad.com/.a/6a0133f30ae399970b017c38718d13970b-800wi" title="Spring clothes for toddler girls" /></a></p>
<p>Because I'm not going to buy everything she wanted and because I also need to make sure there are some things that match, I saved all her picks in a <a href="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/story/profile?id=1cf714438e7706d4e802f663a72cedec&amp;list_name=Clothes%20for%20M" target="_blank" title="http://www.sweetrelish.com/enhanced/story/profile?id=1cf714438e7706d4e802f663a72cedec&amp;list_name=Clothes%20for%20M">"Clothes for M"</a> list on <a href="http://bit.ly/YpGqPr" target="_self" title="http://bit.ly/YpGqPr">Sweet Relish</a>. You relish shopping items just like you pin pictures on Pinterest— buy using a "relish" button directly on your browser. Then each item on your shopping list links to where you can purchase and will even tell you if it goes on sale.</p>
<p>Now, I have one big shopping cart of Mazzy-approved items from multiple stores and I will go back tonight to decide which items I will buy, what items I still need and make it all fit within my budget.</p>
<p>Then hopefully, in a few short days, Mazzy will have clothes besides pink leggings that she wants to wear in public.</p>
<p>If I was smart, I would make sure every item mixed and matched. </p>
<p>Maybe that's a task for summer.</p>

At right is Mazzy, me and Harlow. The photo on the right was taken by <a href="http://jennysherouse.com" target="_blank" title="http://jennysherouse.com">Jenny Sherouse</a> during <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-antidote-to-second-child-syndrome.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-antidote-to-second-child-syndrome.html">Harlow's three month photo shoot</a>. I insisted we all go outside and get the shot I have literally waited all my life to take. Thank you Harlow for being a girl and not messing up my lifelong dream.</p>
<p>I wish I had a green raincoat for the occasion but unfortunately, a green scarf had to suffice. I also wish I had thought to look longingly off camera with an expression that says, "Maybe if I stole the car and drove to Mexico myself, no one would notice until dinner..." but alas, I smiled and wrecked the perfect side-by-side.</p>
<p>Maybe in thirty years, Mazzy can recreate this photo but they'll all be wearing silver space suits and standing on hover crafts just like Marty McFly always imagined. More likely, they'll all be staring at tiny touchscreens that have been permanently implanted into the palms of their hands.</p>

<p><strong>ME:</strong> Hi, Mazzy. Want to play?</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Okay. (sits down on couch near where she is playing)</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> No! Go away! Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Don't worry, I won't try to play with you.</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> I said— GO AWAY!</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Alright. See you later... (gets up to go to other room)</p>
<p><strong>MAZZY:</strong> DADDY!!! Will you play with me???</p>
<p>This has been going on for the past couple of weeks and it's only getting worse.
</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was able to come home from work in the middle of the day unexpectedly, and I thought Mazzy would be so excited to see me. Instead, I walked in her room as she was waking up from her nap, she gave me this really odd half-surprised/half-pissed-off expression and then called for Ruth, our nanny. </p>
<p>OUCH.</p>
<p>I know this is all par for the course in parenthood but I thought three years old was a little early to be demonstrating such animosity towards your own mother. </p>
<p>I wish I was the kind of person who could just let it roll off my back, but I find myself feeling genuinely hurt. </p>
<p>At first, I figured it was just one or two instances of Mazzy asserting her independence, but then as the behavior continued, I started to think about how much has changed at home over the last few months.</p>
<p>Here are the four possible reasons my daughter is not my biggest fan at the moment:</p>
<p><strong>1. I am back at work.</strong> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-weird-places-ive-pumped.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/03/the-weird-places-ive-pumped.html">I went back to work</a> about two months ago. Typically, as a freelancer, I work a few weeks full-time and then I have a few weeks off until the next project. But I have been getting consistent work and have not had any time off since I started working again. The effects of being back at work are cumulative. A couple of weeks back and all is well, but now Mazzy is beginning to realize this is more of a permanent change. I'm starting to feel the increased absence of time with her as well so we are both more sensitive when we are together. Mazzy needs to show me she is mad I am not around and at the same time, I want the time I spend with Mazzy to be that much more special.</p>
<p><strong>2. Our new bedtime routine gives us even less time together.</strong></p>
<p>About a month ago, <a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/toddler-sleep-rehab.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/toddler-sleep-rehab.html">I started a new bedtime routine courtesy of a sleep consultant</a>. The consultant helped me realize that Mazzy was getting way less sleep than she needed and suggested we put her to bed earlier. After implementing the earlier bedtime, it became clear that she was right, but it also means that we cut the time we spend as a family practically in half. Mike and I usually get home from work between 5:30-6pm. The new bedtime routine dictates that Mazzy must be in bed before 7pm. At first, cutting out the extra 30-60 minutes of time together seemed worth having Mazzy wake up well-rested and in good spirits. But again, cumulatively, having that much less time with Mazzy (in addition to being back at work) has really taken a toll.</p>
<p><strong>3. I'm the bad guy.</strong></p>
<p>Every house has one. The parent that is more likely to say no and lay down the rules. I'm the one who won't let Mazzy watch TV before bed. I'm the one that tells her it's time to go to sleep. I'm the one who tells her she can't have a cookie for breakfast. My interactions with my child, in the little time I have with her, are all about saying no and making her do things she doesn't want to do. Someone told me yesterday that if your child likes you 100% of the time, you are probably not a very good parent. I think that's true. But if your child hates you 100% of the time, you are probably not a very good parent either.</p>
<p><strong>4. I'm always holding Harlow.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/my-loves.html" target="_self" title="http://www.mommyshorts.com/2013/02/my-loves.html">Mazzy loves Harlow dearly</a>. Even when she refuses to give me hugs and kisses, she is always eager to give Harlow affection. Because she took to Harlow so easily and fully, I thought we had avoided a lot of the new sibling resentment I had heard about. But now I realize that although Harlow's appearance in our lives didn't immediately have a negative effect, Mazzy now understands her beloved little sister diverts attention from herself. Mike is much better with Mazzy than he is with the baby so most often, when we are all home, I am the one taking care of Harlow. I have made a big effort to always hand off the baby to Mike so I can continue to be one who puts Mazzy to bed, but lately, Mike has been working late and I have been reading books to Mazzy while Harlow sits on my lap. </p>
<p>In fact, when I came home from work early yesterday and walked into Mazzy's room after her nap, I was holding Harlow. I think Mazzy needed to be held in that moment and her confused expression had to do with the fact that she was happy to see me but upset my arms were full. Then she called Ruth because she knew Ruth would be able to hold her.</p>
<p>So that's where we are. Lots of problems and I'm not sure if there is an easy solution to fix them. </p>
<p>But I did come up with something that Mazzy seems excited about. Today at noon, instead of running downstairs from work to grab a quick bite to eat, I am picking up Mazzy from school and taking her to lunch, just the two of us. </p>
<p>Last night, during bedtime routine, when I told Mazzy my plan, she told me she is going to have a turkey sandwich and I will be having soup. Then she retold this to her dad this morning and again when Ruth arrived.</p>
<p>So perhaps she doesn't hate me. She just needs some one-on-one Mommy/Mazzy time.</p><xhtml:img xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MommyShorts/~4/DlVNJw19iNY" height="1" width="1" /></div></content>
