        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-march-2013/">Sara Wachter-Boettcher on the relationship between vulnerability and empathy</a>, especially when it comes to making things for other people to use.</p>

<blockquote><p>[Empathy] means being open -- truly open -- to feeling emotions we may not want to feel. It means allowing another's experiences to gut us. It means ceding control.</p>

<p>Empathy begins with vulnerability. And being vulnerable, especially in our work, is fucking terrifying.</p></blockquote>

The break in occurred at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum#Art_theft_of_1990">when a night watchman opened the door to men dressed as police</a>. Works by Vermeer, Rembrandt, Degas, and Manet valued at over $500M were taken and have not been seen since. </p>

<blockquote><p>"The FBI believes with a high degree of confidence in the years after the theft the art was transported to Connecticut and the Philadelphia region and some of the art was taken to Philadelphia where it was offered for sale by those responsible for the theft. With that confidence, we have identified the thieves, who are members of a criminal organization with a base in the mid-Atlantic states and New England," Richard DesLauriers, special agent in charge of the Boston office of the FBI, said.</p></blockquote>

<p>The guard who opened the door, Richard Abath, <a href="http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/03/10/guard-who-opened-door-robbers-notorious-gardner-museum-heist-under-suspicion-years-later/1TUiDyi1GbcnBgQT64oISP/story.html">was looked at pretty closely again last week</a>, though he's not mentioned specifically this week.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/art">art</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Boston">Boston</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/crime">crime</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hands On a Hardbody, a 1997 documentary about contestants vying to win a brand-new pickup truck, is <a href="http://handsonahardbodythemovie.com/">now available in digital format for $10</a> (remastered and DRM-free, no less).</p>

<blockquote><p>In S.R. Bindler's 1997 cult classic, Hands On a Hardbody, two dozen small-town Texans compete for a brand-new "Hardbody" pickup truck at a local car dealership. The event is a contest of endurance and sleep-deprivation -- whoever can remain standing the longest with one hand on the truck will get to drive it home. Capturing several days of lunacy, laughter, struggle and heartbreak, Hands On a Hardbody is more than a documentary about winning a truck. It is a remarkable study of competition, camaraderie, faith and determination-the ultimate human drama.</p></blockquote>

<p>For an extra $5, you get 90 minutes of bonus material. The film has been unavailable in any format for years. I still have an original DVD in my squirreled-away DVD collection...it's one of my favorite documentaries.

You may have seen <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUZ-e2SkeMI">the first video</a> from last April...here's a follow-up that just came out:</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ntZPeosma2c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>The highlights for me were the bottle of red wine in the microwave and the rocket-powered drying rack from the first video and the bottle of Diet Coke shot with a bullet and gas leak in a camper. The Diet Coke scene is almost cinematic, the way the bottle's clothes are blown off and "arms" flap around as the bottle spins, wobbles, and finally falls to the ground.

        <![CDATA[<p>McDonald's started out as <a href="http://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2010/05/mcdonald%E2%80%99s-bar-b-que/">McDonald's Bar-B-Q</a> in San Bernardino, CA in 1940. Here's a copy of the menu from that time:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/original-mcdonalds-menu-00.jpg" width="600" height="448" border="0" alt="original McDonald's menu" /></p>

<p>The drive-in BBQ restaurant was a great success:</p>

<blockquote><p>The restaurant had carhops serving guests and would often see 125 cars crowding the lot on weekends.  They quickly saw their annual sales topping $200,000 on a regular basis.</p></blockquote>

<p>But competitors opened similar restaurants and they were selling more hamburgers than barbequed ham so the McDonald brothers closed their place for three months to retool. They reopened as plain old McDonald's, serving cheap fare (like hamburgers) quickly. This is what <a href="http://www.retronaut.com/2012/07/the-first-mcdonalds-1948/">an early version of the menu</a> looked like:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/original-mcdonalds-menu-01.jpg" width="640" height="449" border="0" alt="original McDonald's menu" /></p>

<p>The original McDonald's served potato chips and pie, which were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes after the first year; that photo must have been taken sometime after the switch. Ray Kroc got involved in 1955 and opened the first McDonald's franchise east of the Mississippi in Des Plaines, Illinois:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/krocs-first-mcdonalds.jpg" width="640" height="862" border="0" alt="Kroc's first Mcdonalds" /></p>

<p>The version of the menu currently going around (on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1adx96/original_mcdonalds_menu/">Reddit</a>; I found it <a href="https://twitter.com/iA/status/312815490999390208">here</a>) looks like it's from the Kroc era, the arches having been introduced in 1953, shortly before he got involved:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/original-mcdonalds-menu-02.jpg" width="583" height="833" border="0" alt="original McDonald's menu" /></p>

<p>It's interesting to compare these early McDonald's menus to the current menus of places like <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Out Burger</a> and <a href="http://www.fiveguys.com/">Five Guys</a>, especially in comparison with <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/full_menu_explorer.html">the sprawling McDonald's menu of today</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/in-n-out-menu.jpg" width="640" height="386" border="0" alt="In N Out Menu" /></p>

<p>After reading all these menus, you're probably getting hungry. So <a href="http://www.epicconstructions.com/mirror/mcd/">here's how to make a hamburger that tastes like an original McDonald's hamburger from 1948</a> (as well as recipes for a bunch of other McDonald's menu items, from McNuggets to the McRib to the dipping sauces).

        <![CDATA[<p>Writing for the New Yorker, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/03/18/130318fa_fact_remnick?currentPage=all">David Remnick covers the Bolshoi acid attack and the larger ills that afflict the historic ballet company</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>At around eleven, Filin, feeling tired and eager to see his wife, steered the Mercedes into a parking lot outside his building and headed for his door. The snow was icy and thick. Filin was reaching for the security buzzer when he heard someone behind him call out his name. Then the voice said, "Tebye privet!" -- literally, "Hello to you!," but more abrupt and menacing, as though someone were relaying an ominous greeting from a third party.</p>

<p>Filin turned and saw a man in front of him. He was neither tall nor short. He wore a woolly hat and a scarf wrapped around his face. His right arm was crooked behind him, as if he were concealing something.</p>

<p>A gun, Filin thought, in that flash of confrontation: He's holding a gun and I am dead. Bolt! But, before he could move, his attacker swung his arm out in front of him. In his hand was a glass jar filled with liquid, and he hurled its contents at Filin's face. A security camera in the parking lot fixed the time at 23:07.</p>

<p>The liquid was sulfuric acid -- the "oil of vitriol," as medieval alchemists called it. Depending on the concentration, it can lay waste to human skin as quickly as in a horror movie. Scientists working with sulfuric acid wear protective goggles; even a small amount in the eyes can destroy the cornea and cause permanent blindness.</p>

<p>Filin was in agony. The burning was immediate and severe. His vision turned to black. He could feel the scalding of his face and scalp, the pain intensifying all the time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Always good to read Remnick on Russia...he was The Washington Post's Moscow correspondent for a few years in the late 1980s.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/ballet">ballet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Bolshoi Ballet">Bolshoi Ballet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/crime">crime</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/David Remnick">David Remnick</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Russia">Russia</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1968, Richard Nixon, then a candidate for President, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21768668">used backchannel negotiations to scuttle peace talks that may have ended the Vietnam War</a>. Nixon was afraid an end to the war meant an end to his campaign.</p>

<blockquote><p>By the time of the election in November 1968, LBJ had evidence Nixon had sabotaged the Vietnam war peace talks -- or, as he put it, that Nixon was guilty of treason and had "blood on his hands".</p></blockquote>

<p>The war went on for seven more bloody years, most of them under Nixon's watch. Shameful.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Lyndon Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/politics">politics</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/war">war</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://lightsailenergy.com/">LightSail Energy</a>, headed up by 25-year-old Danielle Fong, is <a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?trid=1302">developing technology to store energy as compressed air</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A stumbling block to increasing our reliance on electricity from cleaner energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms has always been figuring out how to efficiently store the energy for use when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. Danielle Fong could make clean energy significantly more practical on a large scale by introducing a novel way to use tanks of compressed air for energy storage. "It could radically reorient the economics of renewable energy," she says.</p>

<p>The idea of using compressed air to store energy is not new. Electricity from solar panels or wind turbines can turn a motor that's used to compress the air in a large tank, and the air pressure can then be converted into power to drive a generator when the power is needed. The problem is that during compression the air reaches temperatures of almost 1,000 ^0C. That means energy is lost in the form of heat, and storage in conventional steel vessels becomes impractical.</p>

<p>Fong stumbled on a possible solution while skimming through a nearly century-old book: water spray is great at cooling air.  She asked, why not spray water into the air while compressing it, so that the air stays cool? To make the process practical, she developed a technique for separating the heated water from the compressed air and diverting the water into a tank, so the heat can be recaptured to minimize energy loss. The process is about as efficient as the best batteries: for every 10 kilowatt-hours of electricity that goes into the system, seven kilowatt-hours can be used when needed.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Fong">Fong</a> sounds like an impressive person; she dropped out of middle school at 12 to attend college, graduating five years later with degrees in physics and computer science.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Danielle Fong">Danielle Fong</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/energy">energy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/LightSail Energy">LightSail Energy</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Excerpted from a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008Z1Q5K0/ref=nosim/0sil8">The Art of Making Magazines</a>, <a href="http://www.cjr.org/critical_eye/fact-checking_at_the_new_yorker.php?page=all">a piece on how fact-checking works at the New Yorker</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>So that was the old New Yorker. The biggest difference between David Remnick's New Yorker today and the Shawn New Yorker is timeliness. During the Shawn years, book reviews ran months, even years out of sync with publication dates. Writers wrote about major issues without any concern for news pegs or what was going on in the outside world. That was the way people thought, and it was really the way the whole editorial staff was tuned.</p>

<p>All this changed when Tina Brown arrived. Whereas before, editorial schedules were predictable for weeks or a month in advance, under Tina we began getting 8,000-, 10,000-, 12,000-word pieces in on a Thursday that were to close the following Wednesday. But something else changed in a way that is more important. Prior to Tina, the magazine really had been writer-driven, and I think this is why they gave the writers so much liberty. They wanted the writers to develop their own, often eccentric, interests.</p>

<p>Under Tina, writing concepts began to originate in editors' meetings, and assignments were given out to writers who were essentially told what to write. And a lot of what the editors wanted was designed to be timely and of the moment and tended to change from day to day. So the result was that we were working on pieces that were really much more controversial and much less well-formulated than anything we had dealt with previously, and often we would put teams of checkers to work on these pieces and checking and editing could go on all night.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/books">books</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/journalism">journalism</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/The Art of Making Magazines">The Art of Making Magazines</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>A nascent trend on YouTube is to take contemporary dramas and imagine what their 1995-style opening credits sequences might look like. The first one appears to be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C6tE4Mblks">this Walking Dead one</a>, followed by Breaking Bad, which is the best of the bunch:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Andy Marx <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/12/the-day-my-grandfather-groucho.html">shares the story</a> of how a lunch with his grandfather, Groucho, and a few of his grandfather's guests ended up helping save every episode of the seminal 50s TV show You Bet Your Life.</p>

<blockquote><p>No longer out of the limelight, my grandfather was enjoying his status as a cultural icon now that such classic Marx Brothers films as "Duck Soup" and "A Night at the Opera" had been discovered by a whole new generation eager for something to go with the free-wheeling attitudes and politics of the late '60s and early '70s. Groucho and his brothers fit the bill perfectly and my grandfather was more than happy to oblige his new-found fans, many of them Hollywood celebrities. Among my favorite celebrity sightings at my grandfather's house in those days were Alice Cooper and Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood.</p>

<p>This particular day, my grandfather asked me to be ready to accompany him on the piano, since he planned to sing for the invited guests: Jack Nicholson, Elliot Gould and the great French mime, Marcel Marceau. As I said, you never knew who would arrive for lunch with Groucho.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But how they play can reveal a lot. "The richest children were more possessive. At the beginning, they wouldn't want me to touch their toys, and I would need more time before they would let me play with them," says the Italian, who would often join in with a child's games before arranging the toys and taking the photograph. "In poor countries, it was much easier. Even if they only had two or three toys, they didn't really care. In Africa, the kids would mostly play with their friends outside."</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p>From Joshua Hammer at Smithsonian magazine, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/ideas-innovations/The-Lost-Tribes-of-the-Amazon-192124351.html?c=y&amp;story=fullstory">an update on the so-called "uncontacted" tribes of people living deep in the Amazon rain forest</a> and what's being done to help them stay isolated.</p>

<blockquote><p>After two hours, we docked at a pier at the Maloca Bar&uacute;, a traditional longhouse belonging to the 30,000-strong Ticuna tribe, whose acculturation into the modern world has been fraught with difficulties. A dozen tourists sat on benches, while three elderly Indian women in traditional costume put on a desultory dance. "You have to sell yourself, make an exhibition of yourself. It's not good," Matapi muttered. Ticuna vendors beckoned us to tables covered with necklaces and other trinkets. In the 1960s, Colombia began luring the Ticuna from the jungle with schools and health clinics thrown up along the Amazon. But the population proved too large to sustain its subsistence agriculture-based economy, and "it was inevitable that they turned to tourism," Franco said.</p>

<p>Not all Ticunas have embraced this way of life. In the nearby riverside settlement of Nazareth, the Ticuna voted in 2011 to ban tourism. Leaders cited the garbage left behind, the indignity of having cameras shoved in their faces, the prying questions of outsiders into the most secret aspects of Indian culture and heritage, and the uneven distribution of profits. "What we earn here is very little," one Ticuna leader in Nazareth told the Agence France-Presse. "Tourists come here, they buy a few things, a few artisanal goods, and they go. It is the travel agencies that make the good money." Foreigners can visit Nazareth on an invitation-only basis; guards armed with sticks chase away everyone else.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Joshua Hammer">Joshua Hammer</a>]]>

<blockquote><p>Babies create strong emotions for the bearer, holder, and observer. I have discovered this holds true even when it is known the baby is not real.</p>

<p>I am photographing dolls that are created to look and feel like living babies. They are constructed and weighted to feel like infants, which includes a head that must be supported while in one's arms. They are the most powerful objects I have ever worked with, I am struck by the strong and palpable emotional reactions they produce. They provoke the dominant biological instinct to nurture and the entire spectrum of human behavior.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of the collectors care for their reborn dolls <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671923/eerie-photos-of-a-subculture-devoted-to-life-like-baby-dolls">as if they were their own children</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many of the women involved have an especially strong passion for the stage of mothering babies and this is a method to keep this stage permanently in their lives. There is a wide range of personal stories and motivations for being involved in this community. Some create or collect these dolls because they cannot continue to give birth to living babies, or have lost a child, or cannot have one of their own. Some women admire the art form and are doll collectors, others create nurseries in their homes and integrate the babies as part of their families and lives.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/motherhood-reborn-and-everlasting">Sometimes literally</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sometimes, women who have lost a newborn have commissioned artists to make a reborn doll that looks exactly like their deceased baby. Modeled after photographs of the real infant, these dolls are called portrait babies.</p></blockquote>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the pages of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereus_Nuncius">Sidereus Nuncius</a>, Galileo described the four large moons of Jupiter in a series of 64 sketches which looked a lot like ASCII art in the text:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/sidereus-nuncius.jpg" width="640" height="648" border="0" alt="Sidereus Nuncius" /></p>

<p>Using an online tool for computing the positions of Jupiter's moons, <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~erniew/astro/sidnunj.html">Ernie Wright compared Galileo's sketches to the moons' actual motions</a>.</p>

Not bad for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_telescope#The_first_known_telescopes">the telescopic state of the art in 1610</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/feb/07/diving-deep-danger/?pagination=false">A fascinating piece by Nathaniel Rich about deep water diving</a>. I had no idea that people building marine oil wells live for weeks at a time at depths of 1000 feet.</p>

<blockquote><p>Not everybody is cut out for the job. A diver cannot be claustrophobic or antisocial, because he must spend much of his time in a tiny sealed capsule with several other divers. He must be well-disciplined and perceptive, for he is likely to encounter a variety of unexpected hazards on the job. Many divers are military veterans, or have worked as roofers or mechanics. "The best are those who have a great deal of confidence in themselves and their abilities," one former diver, Phil Newsum, told me. "You have to be willing to adapt to any situation. Philosophically, when you go out on a dive job, you're expecting something is going to go wrong."</p>

<p>Often, because of the depth, the job is performed in the dark, with only a headlamp to light the way. Divers have told me stories of sudden encounters with manta rays, bull sharks, and wolf eels, which can grow eight feet long and have baleful, recessed eyes, a shovel-shaped snout, and a wide, snaggletoothed mouth. One diver sent me a video, filmed from a camera in the diver's helmet, of an enormous turtle that was playing a game of trying to bite off the diver's feet and hands every few minutes. The diver finally sent the animal swimming away by pressing a power drill to its head. Someone else sent me a photograph of a diver riding a speckled whale shark, as if on a rodeo bronco.</p>

<p>Newsum, who is now the director of an industry group called the Association of Diving Contractors International (ADCI), estimates that only three of every fifteen people who graduate from commercial diving school are able to withstand the rigor of the profession for a full career. Many are enticed by the high salaries, but few can endure the job's physical and psychological toll. Those who stick it out tend to do so out of a passion for the job's eccentricities.</p>

<p>The life of a commercial diver is somewhat less stable than that of a traveling salesman or mercenary soldier. He does not make his own schedule and has little control over his own fate, which is one reason why divers between jobs have a reputation for, as Newsum puts it, "living hard." The diver never knows when his next job will come, but as soon as he gets called for an assignment, he must head directly to the nearest port or helicopter pad. A successful diver will work offshore about 160 days a year, cumulatively. A job might last a day, or two months. Work is most consistent, at least in the Gulf of Mexico, in the warmer months, from late March through November, but hurricane season falls within that period. Hurricanes are a mixed blessing-they disrupt ongoing jobs, but they create new ones.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Nathaniel Rich">Nathaniel Rich</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/oil">oil</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/Roberto-Clemente-bat/enduring-mystery-roberto-clemente-bat">This story</a> by Kevin Guilfoile about his aging father (who worked for the Pirates and the Baseball Hall of Fame) and the mystery of what happened to the bat that Roberto Clemente got his 3,000th hit with is one of my favorite things that I've read over the past few months.</p>

<blockquote><p>[My father's] personality is present, if his memories are a jumble. He is still funny, and surprisingly quick with one-liners to crack up the staff at the facility where he lives. He is exceedingly polite, same as he ever was. He is good at faking a casual conversation, especially on the phone. But if you sit and talk with him for a long time, he gets very anxious. He starts tapping his forehead with his fingers. "Shouldn't we be going?" he'll say. You tell him there's no place we need to be, but 30 seconds later he'll ask again, "Shouldn't we be going?"</p>

<p>What happens to memories when they're collapsed inside time like this? They don't exactly disappear, they just become impossible to unpack. And so my father, who loved stories so much -- who loved to tell them, who loved to hear them -- can no longer comprehend them. The structure of any story, after all, is that this happened and then that happened, and he can't make sense of any sequence.</p>

<p>That is the real hell of this disease. His own identity has become a puzzle he can't solve.</p>

<p>Objects have stories, too. Puzzles that need to be solved. Like a pair of baseball bats, for instance, that each passed through Roberto Clemente's hands before they passed through my father's. One hung on my bedroom wall throughout my childhood. The other is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>These objects never forget, but they never tell their stories, either.</p>

<p>Without a little bit of luck, we'd never hear them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or more than a little luck:</p>

<blockquote><p>My father has lots of old baseball bats given to him by players he worked with over the years. He has Mickey Mantle bats from his years with the Yankees, and Willie Stargell and Dave Parker bats from his days with the Pirates. The one I always loved best was an Adirondack model with R CLEMENTE embossed in modest block letters, instead of the usual signature burned into the barrel. On the bottom of the knob, Roberto had written a tiny "37" in ballpoint pen, presumably to indicate its weight: 37 ounces. It also had a series of scrapes around the middle where someone had scratched off the trademark stripe that encircled all Adirondack bats. Former Pirates GM Joe Brown gave my dad this bat several years after Roberto died. For much of my childhood it hung on the wall of my bedroom, on a long rack with about a dozen other game-used bats.</p>

<p>My dad had been working at the Hall of Fame for more than a decade when, in 1993, his old friend Tony Bartirome, a one-time Pirates infielder who had become their longtime trainer, came to Cooperstown for a visit. Tony and his wife went to dinner with my folks and then came back to our house to chat. The only way to go to the first-floor washroom in that house was through my old bedroom, and on a trip there, Tony noticed that Adirondack of Clemente's hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>Tony carried it into the living room. He said to Dad, "Where did you get this bat?" My dad told him that Joe Brown had given him the bat as a gift, sometime in the late '70s. "Bill," Tony said. "This is the bat Roberto used to get his 3,000th hit."</p>

<p>My father was confused by this. "That's impossible," he told Tony. "The day he hit 3,000 I went down to the clubhouse, and Roberto himself handed me the bat he used. I sent it to the Hall of Fame. I walk by it every day."</p>

<p>"Well," Tony said. "I have a story to tell you."</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a wonderful story, read the whole thing.  Or get the book: the story is excerpted from Guilfoile's A Drive into the Gap, <a href="http://adriveintothegap.com/">available here</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008SC65R4/ref=nosim/0sil8">for the Kindle</a>.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/A Drive into the Gap">A Drive into the Gap</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/baseball">baseball</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/books">books</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Kevin Guilfoile">Kevin Guilfoile</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Roberto Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/sports">sports</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Linus Edwards proposes building <a href="http://vintagezen.com/2013/3/11/the-movie-set-museum">a museum comprised of exacting recreations of famous sets from movies</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thinking about the specifics of this museum, the sets would either be actual sets from the movie (if they still existed), or meticulously recreated sets.  The recreated sets would have to be very exacting, and basically made to look indistinguishable from the real thing.  I realize that even if you had an actual set, many of them are missing things, like ceilings or fourth walls.  Those pieces would all be recreated to match the rest of the set and create an entire room. The key would be every room you enter would be a complete 360 degree environment, and you would feel as if you actually were in the movie.</p>

<p>I imagine a person walking from set to set, at one moment in a 40s noir movie, and the next in an 80s comedy.  It would be a surreal place to visit, as you would enter into these various worlds you've spent your entire life watching.  Each room's set would be lighted to match exactly how it looked on film, and there would be ambient sound playing in the background matched to the reality of the place.  So a set of a New York City apartment would have genuine street sounds, while a set of a space ship might have the hum of the ship's engine.  All the sounds will be taken directly from the movie if at all possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of Edwards' proposed sets include the 7 1/2 floor office from Being John Malkovich, Ferris' bedroom from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Vito Corleone's office from The Godfather.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Linus Edwards">Linus Edwards</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/movies">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/museums">museums</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Well, here's something potentially interesting: researchers at Cardiff University <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/512381/astrobiologists-find-ancient-fossils-in-fireball-fragments/">think they have found fossils in meteorite fragments</a> from Sri Lanka.</p>

<blockquote><p>The most startling claims, however, are based on electron microscope images of structures within the stones (see above). Wallis and co say that one image shows a complex, thick-walled, carbon-rich microfossil about 100 micrometres across that bares similarities with a group of largely extinct marine dinoflagellate algae.</p>

<p>They say another image shows well-preserved flagella that are 2 micrometres in diameter and 100 micrometres long. By terrestrial standards, that's extremely long and thin, which Wallis and co interpret as evidence of formation in a low-gravity, low-pressure environment.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gotta take this with a massive grain of salt, but it will be interesting to see how this one plays out.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Wickramasinghe">One of the authors</a> of this study holds some unusual views about life on Earth.</p>

<blockquote><p>On May 24, 2003 The Lancet published a letter from Wickramasinghe, jointly signed by Milton Wainwright and Jayant Narlikar, in which they hypothesized that the virus that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Wickramasinghe and his mentor Fred Hoyle have also used their data to argue in favor of cosmic ancestry, and against evolution.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like I said, big grain of salt. (thx, onno)</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/biology">biology</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/science">science</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I have no idea how I ever got subscribed to it (automatically?) nor can I find a way on <a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora's site</a> to subscribe to it, but my favorite weekly email newsletter by far is my Quora Weekly Digest. Wren Lanier wrote <a href="http://wrenlanier.com/why-i-love-the-quora-weekly-digest/">an appreciation of their weekly email</a> last January:</p>

<blockquote><p>And yet every week, without fail, the most interesting email that lands in my Inbox is the Quora Weekly Digest. It's a simple email, just 5 Quora questions along with the first hundred words of the "best" answer. But what makes the Quora Weekly Digest so awesome is that those 5 questions were chosen just for me, and every week at least one of them teaches me something I didn't even know I wanted to learn.</p></blockquote>

<p>Topics covered in this week's newsletter include "Could a professional fighter survive an encounter with a fully grown healthy gorilla determined to kill him, without feigning death?", "What is the smartest thing a child has ever said?", and "What can humans learn about fighting/self defense strategy from the other animals and beings?"</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Quora">Quora</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>You've likely seen the graph of the Earth's average global temperature over the past 2000 years...it's mostly a straight line until you get to the industrial revolution and then it shoots up. It looks like a hockey stick. In <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6124/1198.abstract">a study published today in Science</a>, that graph has been extended back 11,300 years and you can really see the scope of the abrupt temperature change.</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/marcott-graph.jpg" width="640" height="438" border="0" alt="Marcott Graph" /></p>

<p>From <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/recent-heat-spike-like-nothing-in-11000-years.php">a summary of the report at TPM</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The decade of 1900 to 1910 was one of the coolest in the past 11,300 years - cooler than 95 percent of the other years, the marine fossil data suggest. Yet 100 years later, the decade of 2000 to 2010 was one of the warmest, said study lead author Shaun Marcott of Oregon State University. Global thermometer records only go back to 1880, and those show the last decade was the hottest for this more recent time period.</p>

<p>"In 100 years, we've gone from the cold end of the spectrum to the warm end of the spectrum," Marcott said. "We've never seen something this rapid. Even in the ice age the global temperature never changed this quickly."</p>

<p>Using fossils from all over the world, Marcott presents the longest continuous record of Earth's average temperature. One of his co-authors last year used the same method to look even farther back. This study fills in the crucial post-ice age time during early human civilization.</p>

<p>Marcott's data indicates that it took 4,000 years for the world to warm about 1.25 degrees from the end of the ice age to about 7,000 years ago. The same fossil-based data suggest a similar level of warming occurring in just one generation: from the 1920s to the 1940s. Actual thermometer records don't show the rise from the 1920s to the 1940s was quite that big and Marcott said for such recent time periods it is better to use actual thermometer readings than his proxies.</p></blockquote>
