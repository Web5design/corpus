        <![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Ms. Fobes, who lives in Raymore, Mo., plans meals around discounts offered at the grocery store and always checks coupon apps on her cellphone before buying clothes. When, a little over a year ago, J. C. Penney stopped promoting sales and offering coupons and instead made a big deal about its "everyday" low prices, Ms. Fobes stopped shopping there. It wasn't that she thought the prices were bad, she said. She just wasn't having any fun.</p>

<p>"It may be a decent deal to buy that item for $5," said Ms. Fobes, who runs Penny Pinchin' Mom, a blog about couponing strategies. "But for someone like me, who's always looking for a sale or a coupon -- seeing that something is marked down 20 percent off, then being able to hand over the coupon to save, it just entices me," she said. "It's a rush."</p></blockquote>

<p>That's from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/business/for-penney-a-tough-lesson-in-shopper-psychology.html?pagewanted=all">an article in the NY Times</a> about J.C. Penney's recent overhaul by Ron Johnson, who sought to apply his Apple Store experience to the mid-range department chain. Being the sort of person who a) doesn't like to shop, and b) doesn't want any nonsense when I do need to shop, I don't often think about shopping as a game. But it clearly is a game for some. As we don't spend so much time on the savana anymore, the hunting of bargains and the gathering of sale items is about as primal as we get these days, aside from Halo and Call of Duty. But not every shopping experience is the same type of game. And maybe that's where Johnson slipped up. The Apple Store game is more aspirational: buying the best products for reasonable prices and feeling part of a place &amp; company that's so minimalist, simple, smart, and cool. Maybe Penneys shoppers didn't want to play that game...not at Penneys anyway.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Apple">Apple</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/J.C.

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/04/22/130422fa_fact_bilger?currentPage=all">Great article</a> by Burkhard Bilger about NASA's Curiosity mission to Mars.</p>

<blockquote><p>The search for life on Mars is now in its sixth decade. Forty spacecraft have been sent there, and not one has found a single fossil or living thing. The closer we look, the more hostile the planet seems: parched and frozen in every season, its atmosphere inert and murderously thin, its surface scoured by solar winds. By the time Earth took its first breath three billion years ago, geologists now believe, Mars had been suffocating for a billion years. The air had thinned and rivers evaporated; dust storms swept up and ice caps seized what was left of the water. The Great Desiccation Event, as it's sometimes called, is even more of a mystery than the Great Oxygenation on Earth. We know only this: one planet lived and the other died. One turned green, the other red.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perfect read if you've been curious about what Curiosity is up to on Mars but needed something a bit more narrative than the mission home page or Wikipedia page to guide you. Also features the phrase "a self-eating watermelon of despair", so there's that. Oh, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s">here's the Seven Minutes of Terror video</a> referred to in the story.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/astronomy">astronomy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Burkhard Bilger">Burkhard Bilger</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Mars">Mars</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/NASA">NASA</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/science">science</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/space">space</a>]]>

<p>One question I always had about the card was: why did Gretzky ever sell it? The Wagner might just have been an investment for him, but if you're rich and a huge sports guy and you own the most pristine copy of the world's rarest and most valuable sports card, why would you ever sell it? One possible answer: you suspected (or discovered) that the card had been doctored and got rid of the damn thing before the truth came out. That Gretzky, always skating to where the puck is going to be.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/baseball cards">baseball cards</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Honus Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/sports">sports</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Wayne Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.rickyjaymovie.com/">Deceptive Practice</a> is a documentary about Ricky Jay which features, among other things, a shaggy-haired Jay playing Three-card Monte with Steve Martin on an 80s chat show.</p>

<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7OlSeOxJmzg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Jay is a fascinating guy, as <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1993/04/05/1993_04_05_054_TNY_CARDS_000362341?currentPage=all">this 1993 New Yorker profile</a> of him by Mark Singer demonstrates.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ricky Jay, who is perhaps the most gifted sleight-of-hand artist alive, was performing magic with a deck of cards. Also present was a friend of Mamet and Mosher's named Christ Nogulich, the director of food and beverage at the hotel. After twenty minutes of disbelief-suspending manipulations, Jay spread the deck face up on the bar counter and asked Nogulich to concentrate on a specific card but not to reveal it. Jay then assembled the deck face down, shuffled, cut it into two piles, and asked Nogulich to point to one of the piles and name his card.</p>

<p>"Three of clubs," Nogulich said, and he was then instructed to turn over the top card.</p>

<p>He turned over the three of clubs.</p>

<p>Mosher, in what could be interpreted as a passive-aggressive act, quietly announced, "Ricky, you know, I also concentrated on a card."</p>

<p>After an interval of silence, Jay said, "That's interesting, Gregory, but I only do this for one person at a time."</p>

<p>Mosher persisted: "Well, Ricky, I really was thinking of a card."</p>

<p>Jay paused, frowned, stared at Mosher, and said, "This is a distinct change of procedure." A longer pause. "All right-what was the card?"</p>

<p>"Two of spades."</p>

<p>Jay nodded, and gestured toward the other pile, and Mosher turned over its top card.</p>

<p>The deuce of spades.</p>

<p>A small riot ensued.</p></blockquote>

<p>Anyway, the film is coming out next week in NYC.

        <![CDATA[<p>Vanity Fair's William Langewiesche takes a behind the scenes look at what drove Felix Baumgartner from being a stunt jumper to stepping out of a capsule 24 miles above New Mexico. Grab a few Red Bulls and <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/05/felix-baumgartner-jump-story">read all about the man who pierced the sky</a> (and the world of brand advertising).</p>

<blockquote><p>His goal now was to break the altitude record for a human free fall, and in the process also to exceed the speed of sound. Otherwise known as Mach 1, that speed varies with temperature but is upwards of 660 miles per hour. Baumgartner was not there to advance mankind. That was for others to claim, if they liked. His own purpose was promotional. He was a showman for the Red Bull company, which had plowed a fortune into this endeavor in order to associate its energy drink with his feats. Baumgartner, who was 43 at the time, is certainly a manly man. He is photogenic. He is fit. His fianc&eacute;e was Miss Lower Austria in 2006. When he furrows his brow he looks determined and intense. On-camera he becomes the very image of a middle-aged action figure, the perfect emblem for an important market segment of middle-aged men. When I drink Red Bull, I go supersonic. I am fearless. I am an &Uuml;bermensch.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Felix Baumgartner">Felix Baumgartner</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/William Langewiesche">William Langewiesche</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kottke.org/03/09/social-force-elevators">Human behavior in elevators</a> is endlessly fascinating and so is this tidbit about social organization in elevators from <a href="http://ethnographymatters.net/2013/04/02/an-uplifting-experience-adopting-ethnography-to-study-elevator-user-experience/">an ethnographic study of elevator users</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Yet, moving back to the interaction with elevator interior design elements, it was noticed that interaction went hand-in-hand with social organisation. As a result of 30 elevator journeys (15 in each building) a clear social order could be seen regarding where people positioned themselves inside the elevators and how they interacted with the design features, such as mirrors and monitors. More senior men in particular seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins. In front of them were younger men, and in front of them were women of all ages. Men watched the monitors, looked in the side mirrors (in one building) to see themselves, and in the door mirrors (of the other building) to also watch others. Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users (unless in conversation) and the mirrors. It was only when the women travelled with other women, and just a few at that, that women elevator users would utilise the mirrors. One interviewee even mentioned that she only looked in the mirrors when there was no one else in the elevator.</p></blockquote>

Case in point: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Mario-series/What-is-the-political-situation-in-the-Mario-universe">What is the political situation in the Mario universe?</a> The top answer starts out:</p>

<blockquote><p>Without going into too much detail, Mario generally lives and works in the Mushroom Kingdom, one of the largest geo-political structures on Mushroom World, in the Grand Finale Galaxy in, yes, the Mushroom Universe.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this answer I will deliberately restrict the terms to discussing Mushroom World, as a comprehensive answer on the entire Mushroom Universe would require covering 20-22 (depending on how you count) Galaxies and frankly, I doubt it would be any more fun to read than it would be to write.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Well, I'm not making the same mistake he did," Campbell continued as he pulled out vinyl copies of Television's Marquee Moon, Miles Davis' Sketches Of Spain, and Big Star's #1 Record, highly influential albums that will in no way help his daughter interact with her peers at a particularly delicate time in her social development. "There's a lot of cool stuff out there, and it's never too early to start learning what's worth your time. I'm just glad I have the know-how to guide her."</p>

<p>Campbell said he has also been vigilant in ensuring Emma develops an increased familiarity with timeless classic films, a parenting strategy that will inevitably hobble her as she attempts to achieve individuation while negotiating an adolescence heavily influenced by the very latest pop culture.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah, our kids definitely do not listen to Philip Glass, Ella Fitzgerald, Edith Piaf, Burl Ives, Joan Jett, and Miles Davis on a regular basis. Or watch Chuck Jones-era Looney Toons shorts. Or Miyazaki films. Oh God, what are kids into these days? Pokebots? Blay blays? Yo-yos?</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/parenting">parenting</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I've spent part of the last couple of days trying to figure out <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672282/thomas-keller-on-why-passion-shouldn-t-drive-you">what Thomas Keller is getting at here</a> with his distinction between passion and desire:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's not about passion. Passion is something that we tend to overemphasize, that we certainly place too much importance on. Passion ebbs and flows. To me, it's about desire. If you have constant, unwavering desire to be a cook, then you'll be a great cook. If it's only about passion, sometimes you'll be good and sometimes you won't. You've got to come in every day with a strong desire. With passion, if you see the first asparagus of the springtime and you become passionate about it, so much the better, but three weeks later, when you've seen that asparagus every day now, passions have subsided. What's going to make you treat the asparagus the same? It's the desire.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Follow your passion" is something you hear really often in tech/design/startup circles, so it's interesting to see Keller take it to task.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Thomas Keller">Thomas Keller</a>]]>

<blockquote><p>ES: In your real life. If you, Michel Gondry, found a time machine and could go anywhere, to any period in history, where would you take it?</p>

<p>MG: I would travel back a few years ago and fix some screw-up I did.</p>

<p>ES: A personal or professional screw-up?</p>

<p>MG: In my personal life.</p>

<p>ES: Can you be more specific?</p>

<p>MG: I would come back and say yes to a girl. That's all. Actually, I find the whole idea of traveling back in time to be profoundly depressing.</p>

<p>ES: Really? Why so?</p>

<p>MG: Because I know the future. Living in the past, it would feel weird to know what's going to happen next. You couldn't escape it. That future's already in your head. You know it doesn't get better.</p>

<p>ES: You'd rather not know about the future?</p>

<p>MG: The future is about hope. If you travel from the present to the past, you don't have that hope anymore. You know how everything turns out.</p>

<p>ES: There are no surprises.</p>

<p>MG: No surprises, exactly! To me, that just sounds so... depressing.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Eric Spitznagel">Eric Spitznagel</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Michel Gondry">Michel Gondry</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/movies">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/The We and the I">The We and the I</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/time">time</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/time travel">time travel</a>]]>

<blockquote><p>Romeo slapped me hard across the face, much harder than I had been slapped all night. Then he shocked me with a stun gun. Then Cody doused me with cold water, which was the worst part by far. When you get hit with a stun gun, it lasts a second. When someone throws cold water on you, it makes you miserable for hours. I hadn't thought about cold water before this. I had thought about guns and billy clubs and knives. It never occurred to me how desperately I would want to stay dry. Now I would have gladly taken another jolt from the stun gun in exchange for a fresh T-shirt.</p>

<p>"I know this was originally meant to be a fake kidnapping," the voice said.</p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p>"And I know that you guys did your homework on me, and that you know I went to prison for a while."</p>

<p>I do know that.</p>

<p>"But there are other things about me that you don't know, Drew. And the reason you don't know them is because you never asked."</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As chess increased in popularity across Europe in the 1800s, the proliferation in the variety of chess sets caused confusion amongst competitors, especially those hailing from different countries. The English typically used Barleycorn sets:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/chess-sets-barleycorn.jpg" width="640" height="480" border="0" alt="Chess Sets Barleycorn" /></p>

<p>or St. George sets:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/chess-sets-st-georges.jpg" width="640" height="347" border="0" alt="Chess Sets St Georges" /></p>

<p>The Germans often used Selenus sets:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/chess-sets-selenus.jpg" width="640" height="385" border="0" alt="Chess Sets Selenus" /></p>

<p>Regence sets were popular in France:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/chess-sets-regency.jpg" width="640" height="480" border="0" alt="Chess Sets Regency" /></p>

<p>Chess set collector Ty Kroll <a href="http://www.tykroll.com/chess/staunton.html">explains the confusion</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>English saw a different design for every chess club: St. George sets with their appearance of stacked disks, Dublin sets with more rounded middles, and Northern Uprights with columns instead, as well as elaborate, easily tipped Barleycorn sets. Germany had delicate Selenus sets, beautiful beyond belief, but fragile, tippable, and problematic for play. To tell which piece is which on some of these sets one must count the stacked crown. France saw elegant Regence style sets with some of the most confusing signatures in history. As in the English sets, queen's were represented by orbs. The king's floral crown closely resembles the modern Staunton signature for the queen. Knights were always taller than bishops the old French sets. Bishops were represented as fools, not clergymen, and therefore lacked the signature miter. What was worse, the knights in these sets were sometimes simple turned designs, not the recognizable horse's head. This lead to common confusion as to which minor piece was which. The confusion of antique French knights and bishops is still a common problem today.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then in the 1849, Nathaniel Cook designed and John Jaques began to sell a set that eventually came to be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_chess_set">the Staunton chess set</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/chess-sets-staunton.jpg" width="640" height="291" border="0" alt="Chess Sets Staunton" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Staunton">Howard Staunton</a> was regarded as the top chess player of his era and organized the first international chess tournament in 1851. Staunton endorsed the set and it soon became the standard in chess competitions and, later, the official standard of the World Chess Federation. The most recent iteration of the official Staunton set is <a href="http://www.designweek.co.uk/news/daniel-weil-redesigns-the-chess-set/3036205.article">Daniel Weil's design</a> for World Chess:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>I'm reading back through <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Roger%20Ebert">my archive</a> of stuff written by and about Roger Ebert and I realized I've never written about my favorite piece of his: <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050501/COMMENTARY/50429001">Dwarfs, Little People and the M-Word</a>. It's nothing particularly earthshattering or insightful, but the piece demonstrates what I really liked about Ebert: humanist, happy to be corrected when in the wrong, not afraid to poke fun at himself, and a lover of both language and knowledge.</p>

<blockquote><p>I had no idea the word "midget" was considered offensive, and you are the only person who has ever written to me about it. In my mind it is a descriptive term, like "dwarf." "Little People" has seemed to me to have a vaguely condescending cuteness to it. If I am now informed that "midget" is offensive, I will no longer use it. What is your feeling about "dwarf?" Is "Little Person" always the preferred term? Our newspaper's style book, based on Associated Press, does not consider "midget" or "dwarf" to be offensive terms, but perhaps we have not caught up.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/language">language</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, I linked to <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2013/04/a_leave_of_presense.html">a post by Roger Ebert</a> announcing his leave of presence. The Chicago Sun-Times <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/17320958-418/roger-ebert-dies-at-70-after-battle-with-cancer.html">has announced that Ebert died today at 70</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ebert, 70, who reviewed movies for the Chicago Sun-Times for 46 years and on TV for 31 years, and who was without question the nation's most prominent and influential film critic, died Thursday in Chicago. He had been in poor health over the past decade, battling cancers of the thyroid and salivary gland.</p>

<p>He lost part of his lower jaw in 2006, and with it the ability to speak or eat, a calamity that would have driven other men from the public eye. But Ebert refused to hide, instead forging what became a new chapter in his career, an extraordinary chronicle of his devastating illness that won him a new generation of admirers. "No point in denying it," he wrote, analyzing his medical struggles with characteristic courage, candor and wit, a view that was never tinged with bitterness or self-pity.</p>

<p>Always technically savvy - he was an early investor in Google - Ebert let the Internet be his voice. His rogerebert.com had millions of fans, and he received a special achievement award as the 2010 "Person of the Year" from the Webby Awards, which noted that "his online journal has raised the bar for the level of poignancy, thoughtfulness and critique one can achieve on the Web." His Twitter feeds had 827,000 followers.</p>

<p>Ebert was both widely popular and professionally respected. He not only won a Pulitzer Prize - the first film critic to do so - but his name was added to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005, among the movie stars he wrote about so well for so long. His reviews were syndicated in hundreds of newspapers worldwide.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rest in peace, Roger. And fuck cancer.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/movies">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/obituaries">obituaries</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>]]>

<blockquote><p>Good Fast Food doesn't need to be vegan or even vegetarian; it just ought to be real, whole food. The best word to describe a wise contemporary diet is flexitarian, which is nothing more than intelligent omnivorism. There are probably millions of people who now eat this way, including me. My own style, which has worked for me for six years, is to eat a vegan diet before 6 p.m. and then allow myself pretty much whatever I want for dinner. This flexibility avoids junk and emphasizes plants, and Lyfe Kitchen, which offers both "chickin" and chicken -- plus beans, vegetables and grains in their whole forms (all for under 600 calories per dish) -- comes closest to this ideal. But the menu offers too much, the service raises prices too high and speed is going to be an issue. My advice would be to skip the service and the wine, make a limited menu with big flavors and a few treats and keep it as cheap as you can. Of course, there are huge players who could do this almost instantaneously. But the best thing they seem able to come up with is the McWrap or the fresco menu.</p></blockquote>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/food">food</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Mark Bittman">Mark Bittman</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sad news from Chicago: Roger Ebert's cancer has returned and <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2013/04/a_leave_of_presense.html">he's taking what he calls a "leave of presence"</a> to focus on recovery and a few different projects.</p>

<blockquote><p>What in the world is a leave of presence? It means I am not going away. My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me. What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am re-launching the new and improved Rogerebert.com and taking ownership of the site under a separate entity, Ebert Digital, run by me, my beloved wife, Chaz, and our brilliant friend, Josh Golden of Table XI. Stepping away from the day-to-day grind will enable me to continue as a film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times, and roll out other projects under the Ebert brand in the coming year.</p></blockquote>

<p>Love that first sentence. Get well soon, Roger.</p>]]><![CDATA[ <strong>Tags:</strong> <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/cancer">cancer</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/movies">movies</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://kottke.org/tag/Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>After an exhaustive search, I have decided this photo most exemplifies life in these United States during the 1980s:</p>

<p><img src="http://also.kottke.org/misc/images/roger-minick-sightseer.jpg" width="640" height="640" border="0" alt="Roger Minick Sightseer" /></p>

<p>And if not that one, then one of several other possible candidates from Roger Minick's <a href="http://sightseerseries.com/">Sightseer project</a>, for which he took photos of tourists at popular US tourist destinations during the early 1980s and into the 2000s.</p>

<blockquote><p>When I approached people for a portrait, I tried to make my request clear and to the point, making it clear that I was not trying to sell them anything. I explained that my wife and I were traveling around the country visiting most of the major tourist destinations so that I could photograph the activity of sightseeing. I would quickly add that I hoped the project would have cultural value and might be seen in years to come as a kind of time capsule of what Americans looked like at the end of the Twentieth Century; at which, to my surprise, I would see people often begin to nod their heads as if they knew what I was talking about.</p></blockquote>
