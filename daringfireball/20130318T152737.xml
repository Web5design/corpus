<p>My thanks to MacUpdate for sponsoring this week&#8217;s DF RSS feed to promote their spring Mac software bundle. It&#8217;s a great deal: for a limited time, you can get over $600 worth of Mac software for just $49.99. Included in the bundle: Parallels Desktop 8 ($80), DEVONthink Pro 2 ($80), Prizmo 2 ($50), MotionComposer ($149), 1000 OpenType fonts ($99), DiskAid 6 ($30), and Mac Internet Security 2013 ($74, 3-Pack).</p>

<p>These are great apps, and if there&#8217;s even one of them that you&#8217;ve had your eye on, buying it through the MacUpdate bundle is like getting all of the other apps for free. You can&#8217;t beat this deal.</p>

<p>My own referrer logs look the same as Buzzfeed&#8217;s &#8212; lots from Google Reader, almost none from Google Plus. But I don&#8217;t know that that means Google made a mistake by shutting down Reader. I don&#8217;t think they want to drive traffic to other sites. Google Plus is like the late-’90s portal mania all over again &#8212; they want you to stay on their site, not go elsewhere.</p>

  <p>One of the interesting ones: the CalDAV API will be removed for

<p>Ian King and Dina Bass, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft Corp. has sold about 1.5 million Surface devices, people
with knowledge of the company’s sales said, a slow start in its
bid to crack the fast-growing tablet market to make up for
slumping personal-computer demand.</p>

<p>Microsoft has sold little more than a million of the Surface RT
version and about 400,000 Surface Pros since their debuts,
according to three people, who asked not to be named because sales
haven’t yet been made public. The company had ordered about 3
million Surface RTs, they said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not good.</p>

<p>Mailbox:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we’ve decided to join forces
with Dropbox and build it out together. To be clear, Mailbox is
not going away. The product needs to grow fast, and we believe
that joining Dropbox is the best way to make that happen. Plus,
imagine what cool things you could do if your Mailbox was
connected to your Dropbox…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should be good news, as it&#8217;s not an acqui-hire (ugh, sorry, let&#8217;s say <em>talent acquisition</em>), but a simple product acquisition. Dropbox wanted the product, not merely the team.</p>

<p>Molly Wood, writing for CNet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The comically alcoholic one, DeeDee, then proceeds to demo how eye
tracking can pause a video when you look away from the screen&#8230;
as she looks away at a hunky gardener type who proceeds to take
off his shirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;While the women are cooling down,&#8221; says the emcee, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you
tell us about S Health?&#8221;</p>

<p>By then, it&#8217;s almost too easy to have there be a joke about
marrying a doctor and then the one about eating too much
cheesecake <em>ohyeahthatoneIshouldhaveseenthatcoming</em>. Of course
those jokes are in there. Why would those jokes not be in
there? We already had a tap-dancing tow-headed kid and a hot
Brazilian girl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d say they went right over the line from sexism to outright misogyny. You really have to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4106268/watch-this-samsungs-complete-and-completely-weird-galaxy-s4">see this thing</a>, especially the second half, to believe it.</p>

<p>So Phil Schiller gave a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/13/schiller-wsj">second</a> eve-of-Galaxy-S4-launch interview, this one to Reuters reporter Poornima Gupta. The headline (&#8220;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/us-apple-schiller-idUSBRE92C1FQ20130314">Apple&#8217;s Schiller Blasts Android, Samsung on Galaxy&#8217;s Eve</a>&#8221;) is spot-on, but here&#8217;s the second paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The marketing chief&#8217;s rare attack on a rival, on the eve of the
Galaxy S4&#8217;s global premier in New York, underscores the extent
of the pressure piled upon a company that once stood the
undisputed leader of the smartphone arena, but ceded its crown
to Samsung in 2012.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before I got to that final clause, I thought Gupta was on the cusp of making a salient point with regard to what&#8217;s going on with Apple and the news media today. Like most first-generation Apple products, the original iPhone was greeted by much skepticism. <em>Needs a keyboard. Needs a removable battery. Costs too much. Only on AT&amp;T.</em> Then, after a few years, it became obvious that the iPhone was in fact the way all modern smartphones should work &#8212; a touchscreen with very few hardware buttons and an app-based system, more computer-with-phone-features than phone-with-computer-features. And Apple had no serious competition. None. This is the period, from 2009–2011 or so, where <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=aapl+market+cap+2006-2013">Apple’s stock rose coincident with its profits</a>, at a steady consistent pace. But as time goes on, I&#8217;m ever more convinced that many observers &#8212; including investors and reporters (especially those in the business press) &#8212; developed three bad assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s lack of serious competition would, or at least might, result in an overwhelming market share advantage for the iPhone.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple&#8217;s market success was primarily because the iPhone had no serious competition.</p></li>
<li><p>If the time ever came that the iPhone <em>did</em> have serious competition, the iPhone (and thus Apple, given the importance of the iPhone to the company) would be in trouble, because Apple&#8217;s magic is in making something so far ahead that no one can compete with it, not in actually competing.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Assumption #1 is bad because the iPhone never had a market share lead, or even close to one, whether you count only &#8220;smartphones&#8221; (where the iPhone sits around 20 percent worldwide) or all phone handsets (where the iPhone, as a premium product being compared to $20 candybar dumb phones, has never had more than single-digit market share). When Steve Jobs announced the iPhone in 2007, his  publicly-stated goal was a humble <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2009/01/iphone-passes-1-percent-goal-for-2008-looking-good-for-2009/">1 percent of the total phone market</a>. Yesterday I linked to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Wide_Smartphone_Sales_Share.png">this chart at Wikipedia</a>, showing that there has always been a market-share dominant smartphone OS &#8212; originally Symbian, and today Android &#8212; that the iPhone ran far behind in terms of sheer units.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority market share has never been Apple&#8217;s plan for the iPhone. A hope, perhaps. But not the plan. (Subscribers to misconception #1 &#8212; those who think the iPhone should have or perhaps even needs a majority share of the phones sold worldwide &#8212; are those clamoring for Apple to create a &#8220;low-cost iPhone&#8221;. See also my &#8220;<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/01/the_church_of_market_share">Church of Market Share</a>&#8221; piece from last year.)</p>

<p>Assumption #2 in and of itself is not overly problematic, although it is wrong. The iPhone would have done just fine, albeit probably not <em>as</em> well as it actually did, even if then-market-leaders such as BlackBerry and Nokia had not faltered so badly. And it&#8217;s certainly the case that Apple would sell some number more of iPhones today if Samsung were doing a worse job designing, manufacturing, and (<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/29/the-cost-of-selling-galaxies/">especially</a>) marketing its phones. But &#8220;iPhone would do better with no serious competition&#8221;, which is true, is very different from &#8220;iPhone would falter if it had any serious competition&#8221;, which is false.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s when combined with #3 &#8212; and the obvious fact that in Samsung Apple does now have a serious competitor &#8212; that these Apple pessimists lose sight of reality. Apple is a great competitor. In the PC industry they&#8217;ve fought back from the brink of bankruptcy to become the most profitable and fastest-growing PC maker in the world. They came in and stole the music player market, and have dominated it for over a decade.</p>

<p>But for some, the fact that Apple and the iPhone now face at least one serious (and successful) competitor somehow means that the iPhone is already losing. This is insane.</p>

<p>By market share alone, one can argue that Samsung is winning, but as I&#8217;ve stated above (and repeatedly recently), the iPhone has <em>never</em> been close to a market share leader. By market share alone, <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/14/google-vs-samsung/">the iPhone is far behind even Nokia</a>.</p>

<p>By profit share, on the other hand, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericsavitz/2013/02/06/applesamsung-101-of-q4-handset-profits-103-for-2012/">according to Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley</a>, last year Apple took 69 percent of the handset industry&#8217;s profits; Samsung took 34. For just the last quarter, the numbers were 72 percent for Apple, 29 for Samsung. You will note that both the annual and quarterly numbers total more than 100 percent; that is because all other handset makers, combined, are losing money. This is rather astounding &#8212; Apple and Samsung have together destroyed the rest of the mobile handset industry.</p>

<p>But this brings us back to Gupta&#8217;s report for Reuters, which I repeat below, this time with emphasis added:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The marketing chief&#8217;s rare attack on a rival, on the eve of the
Galaxy S4&#8217;s global premier in New York, underscores the extent
of the pressure piled upon a company that once stood the
undisputed leader of the smartphone arena, <em>but ceded its crown
to Samsung in 2012</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a statement of fact, in a Reuters news (not opinion) story, about a company with 70 percent (and judging by last quarter, growing) of the industry&#8217;s profits. The same company that runs the best and most popular app store (including the most successful handheld gaming platform), and whose media entertainment ecosystem has, by far, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/mapping-the-entertainment-ecosystems-a-brief-revisit/">the best reach worldwide</a>. The same company whose platform <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/11/26/andoid-ios-bartholomew">disproportionately dominates usage statistics</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung has had a remarkable run over the last few years. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57565757-94/samsung-quarterly-profit-jumps-76-percent-on-galaxy-sales/">They make more money</a> &#8212; profit, not merely revenue &#8212; from selling mobile phones <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100392006">than Google makes</a> for all of its businesses combined. But by any measurable means other than market share what they&#8217;ve achieved is the number two spot, behind Apple. You can reasonably make the argument that they&#8217;re on their way to unseating Apple, that the momentum lead belongs to Samsung. (I would disagree, but cede that it&#8217;s possible.) But no facts today suggest that it has already happened.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s how news reporters increasingly are treating the state of the industry. The desire for the &#8220;<em>Oh, how the mighty Apple has fallen</em>&#8221; narrative is so strong that the narrative is simply being stated as fact, evidence to the contrary be damned. It&#8217;s reported as true simply because they want it to be true. They&#8217;re declaring &#8220;<em>The King is dead; long live the King</em>&#8221; not because the king has actually died or abdicated the throne, but because they&#8217;re bored with the king and want to write a new coronation story.</p>

<p>Phil Schiller, in an interview yesterday:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;And that extends to the news we are hearing this week that the
Samsung Galaxy S4 is being rumored to ship with an OS that is
nearly a year old,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Customers will have to wait to get
an update.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it ends up the S4 is &#8212; to Samsung&#8217;s credit &#8212; <a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-galaxy-s-iv-36261">shipping with Android 4.2.2</a>, the latest available version. Not sure why Schiller would speculate on something like this based solely on rumors.</p>

<p>BBC News, on the launch of the Galaxy S4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Apple suffering from a dipped share price, and a few recent
missteps with product launches, the time is perhaps ripe for
Samsung to pile pressure on the iPhone-maker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What &#8220;recent missteps with product launches&#8221;? The iPad Mini is the best-selling, best-regarded small tablet in the world. The iPhone 5 is the most profitable and best-selling smartphone in the world. The iPad 3/4 is the best-selling tablet in the world, and is single-handedly transforming the entire PC industry. Retina MacBook Pros &#8212; best laptops in the world. MacBook Airs? Better than ever.</p>

<p>The one and only recent product launch you can point to as a &#8220;misstep&#8221; is Apple Maps, and even there, there is now a free Google Maps app available to all iPhone users, and it has seemingly had no ill effect on the sale of iOS devices. Most companies would do well to have Apple Maps be their worst &#8220;misstep&#8221;.</p>

<p>Alan Green, on the Google Reader Blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have just announced on the Official Google Blog that we will
soon retire Google Reader (the actual date is July 1, 2013). We
know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it
go. We’re sad too.</p>

<p>There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Reader has
declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into
fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better
user experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brent Simmons (who knows a thing or two about feed readers), one month ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Part of learning to focus is learning how to shut things down.
Google has done well at that &#8212; but I’m surprised that Google
Reader hasn’t been shut down yet. Better a clean shut-down than an
ungraceful end.</p>

<p>Speaking of Android-vs.-iPhone and the WSJ, here&#8217;s their story on Andy Rubin stepping down from Google&#8217;s Android division (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But Mr. Rubin also leaves with Android at a high point. <em>Android
has leapfrogged Apple&#8217;s iOS mobile operating system to become the
most widely used smartphone operating system worldwide.</em>
Manufacturers shipped 497 million Android-powered smartphones last
year, or 70% of the global smartphone market, up from 246 million
in 2011, or 49% of the market. Apple shipped 136 million iPhones
last year, or 19% of the market, up from 93 million in 2011, which
also accounted for 19% of the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do show that iPhone sales are continuing to grow at a pretty fast clip year over year, but that second sentence rankles. It creates the perception that iOS was previously &#8220;the most widely used smartphone operating system worldwide&#8221;. I don&#8217;t believe that was ever the case.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Wide_Smartphone_Sales_Share.png">Take a look at this chart from Wikipedia</a>, based on numbers from Gartner. Just talking about operating systems, it&#8217;s clear that the OS that Android &#8220;leapfrogged&#8221; to become the most-used in the world is Symbian. iOS has never even been close to being the market share leader for smartphones. Look at <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/14/google-vs-samsung/">this chart from Horace Dediu</a> showing handset sale numbers and you get an even starker picture of how &#8220;market share&#8221; isn&#8217;t a relevant measure of the iPhone&#8217;s success or position in the market, at any point over the last five years.</p>

<p>Ian Sherr and Jessica E. Lessin, writing for the WSJ (headline: &#8220;In Rare Move, Apple Goes on the Defensive Against Samsung&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Inc. is on the defensive.</p>

<p>In a rare interview a day before Samsung Electronics Co. announces
a new flagship smartphone in New York, Apple marketing chief Phil
Schiller on Wednesday played down the expected competition from
the device and discussed how believes such products &#8212; which run
Google Inc.&#8217;s Android software &#8212; are inferior to Apple&#8217;s iPhone.</p>

<p>He shared data on the iPhone&#8217;s popularity and said Apple&#8217;s own
research shows that four times as many iPhone users switched from
Android than to Android during the fourth quarter, according to
company research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It says more about the WSJ than Apple that they call Schiller&#8217;s interview and statements here &#8220;defensive&#8221; rather than &#8220;offensive&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know that either word quite applies, but I&#8217;d say his statements were more of an attack than a defense.</p></li>
<li><p>Those switching numbers are pretty striking. Take them with a grain of salt, given that they come from Apple&#8217;s own research, but, if true, it suggests the iPhone is still &#8212; dare I say it &#8212; winning.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#8217;s clearly no coincidence that Schiller granted this interview the day before the Galaxy S4 launch in New York, and it is an unusual thing for Apple to do. (Usually, when they want to deflate attention from a competitor&#8217;s announcement, they do it by releasing a minor update to an existing Apple product.) Perhaps that&#8217;s what the Journal deems &#8220;defensive&#8221;, but I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s more &#8220;taking the S4 seriously&#8221;.</p></li>

<p>David Pierce, The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go to the Roku home screen, select &#8220;Search,&#8221; and enter in whatever
you want to watch (again, your phone keyboard comes in handy
here). Up comes a list of where you can watch it, and how much (if
anything) it costs. A search through my channels for <em>500 Days of
Summer</em> let me know I could rent it from Amazon, Vudu, or
Blockbuster, for between $2.99 and $3.99. Searching for <em>Jiro
Dreams of Sushi</em> brought up the same results, plus the option to
stream for free on Netflix or Amazon Prime. The more channels you
add, the more options you&#8217;ll get, and search is impressively well
integrated across Roku&#8217;s most popular channels, from Vudu to
Netflix to Crackle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure wish Apple TV had search like this.</p>

<p>Great story by Andy Marx, Groucho&#8217;s grandson, writing at Boing Boing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As Nicholson began telling everyone about his latest movie, “The
Last Detail,” which would be released in a few months, the phone
rang and my grandfather, never one to have his lunch or a good
story interrupted, asked me to answer it.</p>

<p>I walked into the kitchen and picked up the phone.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Marx in?”, the voice at the other end said.</p>

<p>“Who’s calling?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I work at the NBC storage warehouse in Englewood Cliifs, New
Jersey,” the man said. “We’ve got several boxes of 16mm reels of
film from ‘You Bet Your Life’ and we were wondering if Mr. Marx
wants any of it. If not, we’re going to destroy all of it
tomorrow.”</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s put the old &#8220;open beats closed&#8221; axiom to bed.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Wu, writing for The New Yorker &#8220;News Desk&#8221;, has done us all a grand favor by penning a sort of grand unified theory on how the &#8220;open beats closed&#8221; axiom can be true in the face of Apple&#8217;s decade-long success: &#8220;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/does-a-company-like-apple-need-a-genius-like-steve-jobs.html?currentPage=all">Does a Company Like Apple Need a Genius Like Steve Jobs?</a>&#8221; Wu&#8217;s conclusion: yes, Apple is falling back to earth sans Jobs, and the normalcy of open beating closed will return any moment now. Let&#8217;s consider his argument.</p>

<p>Right from the start:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The old tech adage is that “open beats closed.” In other words,
open technological systems, or those that allow
interoperability, always beat their closed competitors. This is
an article of faith for certain engineers. It’s also the lesson
from Windows’ defeat of the Apple Macintosh in the
nineteen-nineties, Google’s triumph in the early aughts, and,
more broadly, the success of the Internet over its closed rivals
(remember AOL?). But is it still true?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Allow me to start by putting forth an alternative rule of thumb for commercial success in any market: better and earlier tend to beat worse and later. That is to say, successful products and services tend to be those that are superior qualitatively and which hit the market sooner. (Consider Microsoft&#8217;s travails in the smartphone market: the old Windows Mobile (née Windows CE) hit the market years before the iPhone and Android, but it sucked. Windows Phone is by all accounts a technically solid, well-designed system, but by the time it arrived the iPhone and Android were entrenched market leaders &#8212; it was too late.) You don&#8217;t have to be best or first, but the winners are likely to be those which fare well in both regards.</p>

<p>There is nothing profound or insightful (<a href="https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/306068527608123394">or original</a>) about this theory; it is simply common sense. My point though, is that open-vs.-closed has very little to do with commercial success, in and of itself. Openness carries no magic.</p>

<p>Consider Wu&#8217;s purported canonical examples:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Windows’ defeat of the Apple Macintosh in the nineteen-nineties</em>&#8221; &#8212; The Wintel duopoly certainly ate the Mac&#8217;s lunch in the &#8217;90s, but this coincided with the nadir of the Mac&#8217;s qualitative superiority. PCs were beige boxes; Macintoshes were slightly better-looking beige boxes. Windows 95 was vastly improved over Windows 3; the classic Mac OS had barely evolved in a decade, whilst Apple squandered its efforts on pie-in-the-sky next-generation systems that never saw the light of day &#8212; Taligent, Pink, Copland. Windows 95 even took to borrowing visual cues not from the Mac but from the best-looking OS of the day, <a href="http://www.guidebookgallery.org/guis/nextstep">NeXTStep</a>.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s and the Mac&#8217;s problems in the &#8217;90s had nothing to do with Apple being more closed and everything to do with the quality of the products. And, as we now know, this &#8220;defeat&#8221; was only temporary. Apple, counting only Macintosh and no iOS devices, is the single-most profitable PC maker in the world, and in the top five in terms of unit sales. For the last six years, Mac sales have outgrown the PC industry as a whole <em>every single quarter</em>. The Mac&#8217;s resurgence had nothing to do with being more open, and everything to do with improved quality: a modern operating system, well-designed software, and hardware designs that the entire rest of the industry now copies <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5836128/samsungs-new-notebooks-are-super-skinny-macbook-clones-and-look-damn-good">slavishly</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/09/hp-apple-laptop-design-similarity/">shamelessly</a>.</p>

<p>The Mac was closed in the ’80s and thrived, much like Apple does today: with a decent but minority market share, and very healthy profit margins. It began to suffer &#8212; both in terms of scarily dwindling market share and unprofitability &#8212; only in the mid-’90s. At this point, the Mac had become no more closed, but had become technically and aesthetically stagnant. And then came Windows 95, which altered the closed/open equation not one bit, but which closed the design quality gap with the Mac significantly. Windows thrived, the Mac withered, and it had nothing to do with openness and everything to do with engineering and design quality. Windows had gotten a lot better, and the Mac had not.</p>

<p>Even more telling, and more damning to Wu&#8217;s use of this as a case study, is that soon after Windows 95, Apple radically opened up the Mac OS, in a use of the word &#8220;open&#8221; that Wu expressly states is what he means by the term: they licensed the OS to other PC makers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_clone">to produce Mac clones</a>. This was the most open decision &#8212; in Wu&#8217;s sense of the word <em>open</em> &#8212; in the entire history of Apple Computer Inc.</p>

<p>And it nearly bankrupted the company.</p>

<p>Mac OS&#8217;s share of the overall PC market remained stagnant, but Apple&#8217;s share of Mac hardware sales, particularly lucrative high-end models, plummeted.</p>

<p>When Jobs and his team from NeXT took control of Apple, they shredded the licensing program, returned the company to its integrated control-the-whole-experience roots, and got to work on one thing: designing better &#8212; but absolutely closed &#8212; hardware and software. It worked.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Google’s triumph in the early aughts</em>&#8221; &#8212; By this Wu surely means Google web search. What exactly is or ever was more &#8220;open&#8221; about Google&#8217;s web search than any of its competitors, then or now? Everything about it is closed: the source code, the ranking algorithms, even the setup and locations of Google&#8217;s vaunted data centers are famously kept secret. Google came to dominate search for one reason: it offered a vastly superior product. It was faster, far more accurate and clever, and visually far less cluttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>The success of the Internet over its closed rivals (remember AOL?)</em>&#8221; &#8212; Here Wu almost makes sense. The Internet truly is a triumph of openness, perhaps <em>the</em> triumph of openness. But AOL wasn&#8217;t really competing against &#8220;the Internet&#8221;. AOL is a service. The Internet is a worldwide communal system. You still need a service to connect to the Internet. AOL lost not to the Internet but to cable and DSL providers. And AOL was crap, badly-written, horribly-designed software that connected you to the Internet via appallingly slow and finicky dial-up modems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The adage has been seriously questioned over the last few years,
primarily because of one firm. Apple, ignoring the ideals of
engineers and the preaching of tech pundits, steadfastly stuck to
a semi-closed strategy &#8212; or an “integrated” one, as it likes to
say &#8212; and defied the rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &#8220;rule&#8221; has been seriously questioned all along by some of us, because it&#8217;s horseshit; not that the opposite is true (that closed tends to beat open), but rather, that open-vs.-closed carries no special weight in determining success as a general rule. Apple is not an exception to the rule; rather, it is a perfect example that the rule is nonsense.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now, over the last six months, in ways little and large, Apple
has begun to stumble. Accuse me of overreading, but I propose a
revision of the old adage: closed can beat open, but you have to
be genius. Under normal conditions, in an unpredictable industry,
and given regular levels of human error, open still beats closed.
Stated a different way, a firm gets to be closed in exact
proportion to its vision and design talent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would not a simpler theory be that companies with visionary leaders and talented designers (or employees in general) tend to succeed? What Wu is arguing here is that &#8220;closed&#8221; companies are somehow more in need of vision and talent than &#8220;open&#8221; ones, which is folly. (Open <em>standards</em> certainly succeed more easily than closed ones, but that&#8217;s not what Wu is arguing here. He&#8217;s talking about companies and their success.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To explain, I need to first be careful about what I mean by “open”
and “closed,” words that are widely used in the tech industry, but
with various meanings. The truth is that no company is completely
open or completely closed; they exist on a spectrum, somewhat like
the one that Alfred Kinsey used to describe human sexuality. Here,
I mean it as the combination of three things.</p>

<p>First, “open” and “closed” can refer to how permissive a tech firm
is, with respect to who can partner with or interconnect with its
products to reach consumers. We say an operating system like Linux
is “open” because anyone can design a device that runs Linux. In
contrast, Apple is very selective: it would never license iOS to
run on a Samsung phone, or sell the Kindle in an Apple store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they likely wouldn&#8217;t sell Kindle hardware in an Apple Store, any more than they would sell Samsung phones or Dell computers. Nor do Dell or Samsung sell Apple products. But Apple does have the Kindle app in the App Store.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, openness can describe how impartially a tech company
treats other firms in comparison to how it treats itself. Firefox,
the browser, treats most Web sites about the same. Apple, in
contrast, always treats itself better. (Try removing iTunes from
your iPhone.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s the entirety of Wu&#8217;s second meaning of &#8220;open&#8221; &#8212; a comparison between a web browser and an operating system. But Apple has its own web browser, Safari, which, just like Firefox, treats all websites the same. And Mozilla now has its own mobile OS, on which, I&#8217;ll bet, there are at least some apps you cannot remove.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Third, and finally, it describes how open, or
transparent, the company is about how its products work, and how
to work with them. Open-source products, or those that rely on
open standards, make their source code available widely.
Meanwhile, a firm like Google might be open in many respects, but
it guards things like its search-engine code very carefully. In
tech, the standard metaphor to describe this last difference is
that of a cathedral versus a bazaar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wu even admits that Google&#8217;s crown jewels &#8212; its search engine and the amazing data centers that power it &#8212; are every bit as closed as much of Apple&#8217;s software and makes no mention of Apple&#8217;s leadership on open source projects like <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit</a> and <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even Apple needs to be open enough not to annoy consumers too
much. You can’t run Adobe’s Flash on an iPad, but you can plug
nearly any kind of earphones into it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flash? What year is it? You can&#8217;t run Flash on Amazon&#8217;s Kindle tablets, or Google&#8217;s Nexus tablets and phone either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that “open beats closed” is a new one. For most of the
twentieth century, integration was widely believed to be the
superior form of business organization. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom began to change in the nineteen-seventies.
In technology markets, from the eighties through the mid-aughts,
open systems repeatedly defeated their closed competitors.
Microsoft Windows defeated its rivals by being more open: unlike
Apple’s operating system, which was technically superior, Windows
ran on any hardware, and ran nearly any software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, the Mac was not defeated, and, looking at the decades-long history of the PC industry, the evidence suggests that openness has little to do with success, and with the Mac in particular, if anything it proves the opposite. The Mac&#8217;s roller-coaster trajectory &#8212; up in the ’80s, down in the ’90s, up in the ’00s and continuing through today &#8212; corresponds exactly to the competitive quality of Apple&#8217;s hardware and software, and not at all to its openness. The Mac has succeeded most when closed, least when open.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, Microsoft also defeated a vertically integrated
I.B.M. (Remember Warp O.S.?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do, but apparently Wu does not, because it was called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2">OS/2 Warp</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If openness is the key to Windows&#8217;s success, whither Linux on the desktop? Linux is truly open by anyone&#8217;s definition of the word, far more open than Windows could ever be. And it has been a nearly complete dud as a desktop operating system, where it has never been all that good, qualitatively.</p>

<p>On the server though, where Linux has long been widely regarded as technically excellent &#8212; fast and reliable &#8212; it has been a tremendous success. If openness were key, Linux should have succeeded everywhere. It has not. It has only succeeded where it is actually good, as a system for servers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google was boldly open in its original design, and sailed past the
selective pay-for-placement design of Yahoo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Describing Google&#8217;s evisceration of the first generation of search engines as having anything at all to do with &#8220;openness&#8221; is absurd. Google search was better &#8212; not just a little better, but way better, like 10 times better &#8212; in every single regard: accuracy, speed, clarity, and even visual design.</p>

<p>Not one person, ever, tried Google search for the first time after years of using Yahoo, Altavista, and the like and said to themselves, &#8220;Wow, this is way more open!&#8221;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the winner firms in the eighties to the aughts,
like Microsoft, Dell, Palm, Google, and Netscape, were open. And
the Internet itself, a government-funded project, was both
incredibly open and incredibly successful. A movement was born,
and with it the rule that “open beats closed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microsoft: Not really open, they just license their OSes &#8212; not for free but for, you know, money &#8212; to any company that will pay.</p>

<p>Dell: Open how? Dell&#8217;s peak success had nothing to do with openness and everything to do with having figured out ways to produce commodity PCs cheaper and quicker than its competitors. When cheap fast production itself became a commodity, with the rise of outsourced Chinese manufacturing and assembly, Dell&#8217;s advantage disappeared, along with its relevance. And, not exactly a shining example of sustained success.</p>

<p>Palm: More open than Apple how? And, uh, out of business.</p>

<p>Netscape: They built browsers and servers for the truly open web, but their software was closed. And what cost them their lead in the browser market was a two-fold attack by Microsoft: (1) Microsoft made a better browser, and (2) in a completely <em>closed</em> (and eventually deemed-to-be-illegal) fashion, they used their control over the closed Windows operating system to bundle and favor IE over Netscape Navigator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The triumph of open systems revealed a major defect in closed
designs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather, Wu&#8217;s examples have revealed a major defect in his entire thesis: it is not true.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which brings us to the aughts, and Apple’s great run. For about
twelve years, Apple successfully beat the rule. But that’s because
it had the best of all possible systems; namely, a dictator with
absolute control who was also a genius. Steve Jobs was the
corporate version of Plato’s ideal: the philosopher-king more
effective than any democracy. The firm was dependent on one
centralized mind, but he made very few mistakes. In a world
without errors, closed beats open. Consequently, for a while,
Apple bested its rivals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wu&#8217;s approach to this entire subject is backwards. Rather than evaluate the facts and draw a conclusion regarding the importance of openness to commercial success, he instead started with a belief in the axiom and attempted to massage the facts to fit the dogma. Thus, Wu argues, Apple&#8217;s success over the past 15 years is not incontrovertible proof that the &#8220;open beats closed&#8221; axiom is false, but rather was the result of Steve Jobs having possessed singular abilities that trumped the power of openness. He, and he alone, could walk on water.</p>

<p>Wu mentioned the word &#8220;iPod&#8221; not a single time in his essay, and &#8220;iTunes&#8221; only once &#8212; in the section quoted above about not being able to delete the iTunes app from an iPhone. Those are convenient omissions from a piece arguing that &#8220;open beats closed&#8221;. These are both canonical examples suggesting that other factors are more important to success &#8212; that better beats worse, integrated beats fragmented, simple beats complicated.<sup id="fnr1-2013-03-01"><a href="#fn1-2013-03-01">1</a></sup></p>

<hr />

<p>There&#8217;s an &#8220;infographic&#8221; that accompanies Wu&#8217;s article, and it is mind-bogglingly vapid. It must be seen to be believed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/02/idea-of-the-week-open-vs-closed.html" class="noborder">
  <img
    src="/misc/2013/03/newyorker-infographic.jpg"
    alt="Vapid chart from The New Yorker, ostensibly showing the correlation between openness and market cap among Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft."
  /></a></p>

<p>Market cap over time, so far so good. But the colors? Nick Traverse explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The infographic here shows the market capitalization of four big
technology companies since 2006 &#8212; Amazon, Apple, Google, and
Microsoft. Wu developed a metric for assessing the “openness” of
companies, scored on three factors: interoperability, integration,
and transparency. With 1 being closed, and 10 being open, here’s
how they rank:</p>

<p>Apple: 2.0 <br />
Microsoft: 5.0 <br />
Google: 5.7 <br />
Amazon: 6.3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s the extent of the work shown to justify these scores. Not only did Wu choose these attributes of &#8220;openness&#8221; arbitrarily and simply make up values for the interoperability / integration / transparency scores for each company, he doesn&#8217;t even reveal what these individual per-attribute scores are. All we get are these ostensibly quantitative overall scores: 2.0, 5.0, 5.7, 6.3. If pseudoscience gobbledygook were toxic, we&#8217;d all be dead having gazed upon this chart.</p>

<p>Traverse continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wu’s theory is that open should generally do better than closed,
unless the closed company is run by a genius. And though this is
just a smattering of data, the chart seems to bear the theory out.
The stock prices of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon more or less
correlate to their openness scores. Apple, the most closed of the
four, does the best &#8212; until about a year after Steve Jobs dies.
Since then, it has plummeted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stock values over time are data; the openness scores are nonsense, a metric Tim Wu pulled out of his ass. But even if we accept everything in this chart as Wu and The New Yorker intend &#8212; that Wu&#8217;s openness scores are meaningful and accurate, and that stock price is a reliable measure of a company&#8217;s success &#8212; this graphic does not show any sort of correlation between openness and success, nor, even, that Apple is suffering without Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>Traverse is correct that Apple&#8217;s stock price has dropped by about 30 percent in recent months, beginning about a year after Jobs&#8217;s death. But he neglects to mention that in the year after his death, the stock price rose so high that, despite the recent drop, it remains up, significantly, from the date of Jobs&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>According to Wu, Apple&#8217;s stock should continue to slide; only time will tell if he&#8217;s right. But what of the other four companies he chose? Microsoft&#8217;s score of 5.0 is the lowest of the three and indeed its stock performance since 2006 (the beginning of the graphic) is the worst &#8212; pretty much completely flat. But Google&#8217;s 5.7 is halfway between Amazon&#8217;s 6.3 and Microsoft&#8217;s 5.0, but their stock price has fared only slightly better than Microsoft. None of these companies&#8217; stock prices show any correlation to the openness scores Wu assigned them, with the exception of Amazon. But how in the world did Amazon get a higher &#8220;openness&#8221; score than Google? Google released Android as an actual open source project; Amazon took Android and created their own closed source branch for the Kindle Fire. The Kindle e-readers are every bit as closed as the iPod. Transparency? Apple releases sales numbers for all of its product categories, each and every quarter. Apple releases numbers regarding how many apps have been downloaded from the App Store, how much money it has paid to developers, how many songs they&#8217;ve sold through iTunes, and how many books have been downloaded through iBooks. Amazon never releases sales numbers for anything &#8212; not for the Kindle, not for apps, nothing. Just <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/12/06/amazon-sells-34-apps-from-its-appstore-in-the-last-year/">bromides</a> about having sold &#8220;the most ever&#8221;, or such and such percent more than an earlier quarter. It&#8217;s hard to think of a reason why Amazon would score as more open than Google other than that their stock has done better in recent years and that Wu assigned the scores to fit the narrative.</p>

<p>Not to mention that if Wu had chosen profitability rather than stock price as the metric for corporate success, the chart would show a <em>reverse</em> correlation between openness and success: Apple first, Microsoft second, Google third, and Amazon a distant fourth at nearly zero. (I&#8217;m not proposing that this would be any less nonsensical than Wu&#8217;s use of stock prices. For one thing, Amazon seemingly turns little-to-no profit <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/29/amazon_q4_profits_fall_45_percent.html">on purpose</a>. But it&#8217;s no less valid than Wu&#8217;s use of stock price, especially when comparing the three companies in the group that <em>are</em> pursuing profitability.)</p>

<p>The dogmatic assumption that openness correlates to success, evidence to the contrary be damned, overcomplicates the argument. &#8220;Wu’s theory is that open should generally do better than closed, unless the closed company is run by a genius.&#8221; Take the open/closed stuff out of that premise, and you&#8217;re left with something like this: <em>Companies run by geniuses should generally do better than those which are not.</em> That sounds about right.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wu concludes his essay with this advice: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the end, the better your vision and design skills, the more
closed you can try to be. If you think your product designers can
duplicate the nearly error-free performance of Jobs over the past
twelve years, go for it. But if mere mortals run your firm, or if
you’re facing an extremely unpredictable future, the economics of
error suggest an open system is safer. Maybe rely on this test:
wake up, look in the mirror, and ask yourself, Am I Steve Jobs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key word here is &#8220;safer&#8221;. <em>Don&#8217;t try to do it all. Don&#8217;t do something different. Don&#8217;t rock the boat. Don&#8217;t question conventional wisdom. Go with the flow.</em></p>

<p>That&#8217;s what bothers people about Apple. Everyone used Windows, why couldn&#8217;t Apple just settle for <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1927885,00.asp">making stylish Windows machines</a>? Smartphones <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/mobile_phone_keyboards">required hardware keyboards</a> and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/166330/iPhone_vs_Palm_Pre.html">removable batteries</a>; why did Apple make theirs with neither? Everyone knew you <a href="http://crackberry.com/breaking-rim-co-ceo-jim-balsillie-responds-steve-jobs-comments-made-during-apple-earnings-call">needed Flash Player for the &#8220;full web experience&#8221;</a>, why did Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">drop it</a>? 16 years after the ad campaign, &#8220;Think Different&#8221; has proven itself to be more than glib marketing. It is a simple, serious motto that serves as a guiding light for the company.</p>

<p>I think what Wu and his brethren believe is not that companies win by being &#8220;open&#8221;, but that they win by offering choices.</p>

<p>Who is Apple to decide which apps are in the App Store? That no phone will have a hardware keyboard or removable battery? That modern devices are better off without Flash Player and Java?</p>

<p>Where others offer choices, Apple makes decisions. What some of us appreciate is what so rankles the others &#8212; that those decisions have so often and consistently been right.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s worse, the content of this piece by Sam Gustin for Time magazine, or the pun in the headline, &#8220;<a href="http://business.time.com/2013/02/26/google-hits-the-glass-pedal-as-apple-falls-to-earth/">Google Hits ‘Glass’ Pedal as Apple Returns to Earth</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, Apple expectations are returning to Earth. “Apple has
had a tremendous run from 2001 until the end of last year,” says
Kessler. “People want the company to invent a new category. In
the past, they’ve done that so frequently and successfully that
when they don’t seem to do it as much or as profoundly,
questions arise.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The iPod in 2001, iPhone in 2007, iPad (which many critics pooh-poohed as &#8220;<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/187888/ipad_first_impressions.html">just a big iPhone</a>&#8221;) in 2010. So, so frequently &#8212; it&#8217;s a wonder how we ever kept up with Apple&#8217;s new category inventions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, Google is hot. For example, Google’s new Chromebook
Pixel laptop is garnering positive reviews. (“Thank you, Google.
For obsoleting my MacBook,” as one CNET writer <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57570862-94/google-laptop-shows-apple-a-thing-or-two/">put it</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/26/obsolete">the aforelinked</a> Brooke Crothers, a CNet opinion columnist. <a href="http://www.cnet.com/google-chromebook-pixel/">Here&#8217;s the official CNet hardware review of the Pixel</a> by Seth Rosenblatt, where it garnered a meager rating of &#8220;OK&#8221; and this bottom line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line: Despite impressive hardware specs and solid
industrial design, the Chromebook Pixel’s high price and cloud OS
limitations make it impossible to recommend for the vast majority
of users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, here are CNet&#8217;s ratings for all of Apple&#8217;s recent MacBooks:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cnet.com/macbook-pro-13-inch-retina-display/">13-inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display</a>: Excellent</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cnet.com/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-with/4505-3121_7-35331572.html">15-inch MacBook Pro With Retina Display</a>: Excellent</li>

</ul>

<p>Nathan Edwards of The Wirecutter <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/2013/02/the-chromebook-pixel-is-not-for-you/">says the Pixel is &#8220;not for you&#8221;</a>. David Pierce at The Verge <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4023830/google-chromebook-pixel-review">concludes his Pixel review thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone should want a Chromebook Pixel &#8212; I certainly do. But
almost no one should buy one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, the Chromebook Pixel is interesting, but it&#8217;s not a well-regarded laptop. But it&#8217;s bad news for Apple, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>

<p>Back to Gustin&#8217;s piece for Time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the company’s Google Glass wearable computing project &#8212;
high-tech Internet-connected specs &#8212; is generating the sort of
buzz usually reserved for Apple products. The futuristic eyewear
will be available to consumers by the end of 2013, just in time
for the holiday shopping season, according to several reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So a product from Google that currently exists only as a pre-announced demo and somewhat-imminent $1500 developer preview &#8212; from the company that brought us the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/07/31/q">Nexus Q</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/07/schmidt-google-tv">Google TV</a> &#8212; shows that Apple has lost its edge? OK, got it.</p>

<p>It should be clear to anyone who pays even half attention to the industry that Google and Apple are polar opposites in numerous regards. The open-vs.-closed thing is tiresome and generally misleading, but here&#8217;s an area where Google really is open (by revealing Google Glass far in advance of it being finished) and Apple really is closed (in that they never reveal anything about products until they are finished or nearly so).</p>

<p>Google Glass absolutely is generating buzz, but it&#8217;s not &#8220;the sort of buzz usually reserved for Apple products&#8221;. Glass has nerds excited; Apple products get the general public excited, and often <em>annoy</em> nerds by being iterative improvements that press the &#8220;<em>familiar but better</em>&#8221; button instead of the &#8220;<em>new and different</em>&#8221; button.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we have actual shipping products from Apple that are critically acclaimed and selling in record numbers (and for record profits); on the other, a $1300 laptop that only runs a web browser and a HUD headset that will supposedly ship at the end of the year from Google. And this somehow shows that Apple is slumping. What Gustin is doing is taking anything and everything &#8212; Apple&#8217;s recent stock slump; the promise of Google Glass; the mere existence of the Chromebook Pixel, regardless of its price or critical ratings; the fact that Apple has spent the last three years doing what it does best, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html">iteratively improving and refining existing products</a> &#8212; and has forced these facts into supporting the narrative that Apple is, as he began arguing back in August, &#8220;<a href="http://business.time.com/2012/08/03/is-apple-losing-its-shine-after-steve-jobs/">losing its shine</a>&#8221; without Steve Jobs.</p>

<p>I sense <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/26/efrati-looking-at-it">a trend</a>.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Something <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/06/real">else</a> caught my eye in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/technology/personaltech/microsofts-surface-pro-works-like-a-tablet-and-a-pc.html?_r=0">David Pogue&#8217;s review</a> of the Surface Pro today &#8212; the use of bounding asterisks for emphasis around the <em>cough</em>s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, Microsoft has subsisted on the milk of its two cash
cows: Windows and Office. The company’s occasional ventures into
hardware generally haven’t ended well: (*cough*) Zune, Kin
Phone, Spot Watch (*cough*).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where by &#8220;emphasis&#8221; I mean &#8220;informing the reader of a shift in style or voice&#8221;, such as how foreign words are italicized in many publications and books. Using asterisks this way strikes me as an <a href="http://www.alsindependence.com/Internet_Slang.htm">Internet-ism</a>. I would think those <em>cough</em>s should be italicized; using bounding asterisks is a substitute in plain text contexts, something we collectively started doing in email, newsgroups, web comments and forums, Twitter, and various other input fields where computer software doesn&#8217;t allow proper italics (or bold, or any other formatting).<sup id="fnr1-2013-02-06"><a href="#fn1-2013-02-06">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Or at least that was my hunch. So <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/299261664568680449">I asked</a> on Twitter, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ironicsans/status/299279307338051584">David Friedman had the clever idea</a> to search <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams/info">Google&#8217;s Ngram Viewer</a> for &#8220;*sigh*&#8221; and &#8220;*cough*&#8221;. <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=%5B*cough*%5D%2C%5B*sigh*%5D&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=5&amp;share=">The results are interesting</a>.</p>

<img
  src = "/misc/2013/02/ngram-sigh-cough-cropped.png"
  alt = "Chart showing the use of *sigh* and *cough* in books over the last 100 years."
/></p>

<p>Neither appeared in print until the mid-’60s, when <em>*sigh*</em> began appearing. But <em>*cough*</em> doesn&#8217;t appear until 1987. Both though, exploded in usage starting in 1997, and have risen steadily ever since. So I think I&#8217;m correct that this use of asterisks has been largely driven by Internet punctuation idioms.</p>

<p>But what explains <em>*sigh*</em>&#8217;s rise in the ’60s? That was a head-scratcher for me. But I suspect <a href="https://twitter.com/ironicsans/status/299281214773284864">Friedman nailed it</a>: it stems from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=charlie+brown+sigh&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xdYSUZO5Dcjo0gGJtIHQDQ&amp;ved=0CC8QsAQ&amp;biw=1271&amp;bih=1019">Charles Schulz&#8217;s <em>Peanuts</em></a>.</p>

<p><img
  src = "/misc/2013/02/charlie-brown-sigh.png"
  alt = "Charlie Brown, sighing, with the word ‘sigh’ surrounded by what look like asterisks."
/></p>

<p>What I wish I could do with Google&#8217;s Ngram Search is look for instances of these words actually italicized, to see if that treatment has dropped as bounding asterisks have risen.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2013-02-06">
<p>Hence my adoption of asterisks-for-emphasis in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>; it was already a widely-used convention for Internet users. The only quibble some have is whether it best translates to italics or boldface.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2013-02-06"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Walt Mossberg, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324900204578285963270503862.html?mod=djemptech_t">reviewing the Microsoft Surface Pro</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s too hefty and costly and power-hungry to best the leading
tablet, Apple&#8217;s full-size iPad. It is also too difficult to use in
your lap. It&#8217;s something of a tweener &#8212; a compromised tablet and
a compromised laptop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303703004577474910029263198.html">From the Surface introduction event</a>, eight months ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr. Ballmer and other Microsoft executives repeatedly use the
words &#8220;no compromises&#8221; to describe the tablet computers they
envision running Windows 8 and Windows RT &#8212; which means that
users will be able to use work-oriented tools like Microsoft Word
and Excel programs, not just be used for watching movies and
surfing the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/31/designing-for-metro-style-and-the-desktop.aspx">Steven Sinofsky, back in August</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our goal was a no compromise design. […] We chose to take the
approach of building a design without compromise. […] You don’t
have to compromise! […] Our design goal was clear: no compromises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joanna Stern, reviewing the Surface Pro for ABC News (headline: &#8220;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/microsoft-surface-pro-review-tablet-laptop-hybrid-requires/story?id=18413678">A Tablet/Laptop Hybrid With Compromises</a>&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a tablet, the Surface Pro is not as strong as its competitors.
It&#8217;s larger, the battery life can&#8217;t compete and still lacks
critical apps. As a laptop it&#8217;s hampered by its smaller screen
size, lack of a good mouse option and the fact that it doesn&#8217;t
really sit on your lap. Putting the two together results in a
breed that&#8217;s simply not as compelling as separate tablets and
laptops.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tim Stevens, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/05/microsoft-surface-pro-review/">reviewing the Surface Pro for Engadget</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, just getting into the tablet takes longer than the
Android or iOS competition. Hit the power button and you&#8217;ll
have to wait for about three to four seconds for the display to
pop on. […]</p>

<p>The Surface Pro comes about as close as we&#8217;ve yet experienced, but
it&#8217;s still compromised at both angles of attack. When trying to be
productive, we wished we had a proper laptop and, when relaxing on
the couch, we wished we had a more finger-friendly desktop
interface &#8212; though more native Windows 8 apps might solve the
problem by keeping us from having to even go there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harry McCracken, <a href="http://techland.time.com/2013/02/05/review-microsoft-surface-pro-the-surface-thats-more-pc-than-tablet/">reviewing it for Time</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft likes to use the phrase “no compromises” when describing
that versatility, but in fact, Surface Pro &#8212; like all computing
devices &#8212; is a study in compromises. It’s bulkier than Surface RT
because its components require more interior space. Microsoft’s
stated battery life is five hours, compared to eight for Surface
RT. Even the AC adapter is portlier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Pierce, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/5/3955130/microsoft-surface-pro-review">reviewing it for The Verge</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s too big, too fat, and too reliant on its power cable to be a
competitive tablet, and it&#8217;s too immutable to do everything a
laptop needs to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/09/compromise">Yours truly, back in September 2011</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft and Apple are going in two very different directions,
especially when you compare iOS to Windows 8. Apple has embraced
compromise. The compromises in iOS are, for many people in many
contexts, what makes the iPad better than a Mac. The compromises
enforce simplicity and obviousness in design, and at a technical
level they lead to iOS’s excellent battery life.</p>

<p>I do work on the road using a MacBook Air, not an iPad, because
I’m one of those users for whom the iPad’s design compromises get
in the way, and slow me down. But I like having the iPad as a
separate device, for reading and video. The marvel of the iPad is
not that it can replace a Mac. It’s that it opened the door to all
sorts of things that a Mac was never all that good for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was wrong to argue that only Apple had embraced compromise. The truth is, <a href="https://twitter.com/stop/status/299019199030886400"><em>all</em> design is about compromise</a>. Where Apple and Microsoft have forked is with regard to <em>what</em> they&#8217;re willing to compromise on.</p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So much stupid. So little time.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Paul Lilly, writing at HotHardware (SFW, I swear), &#8220;<a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Has-the-iPhone-Lost-Its-Luster-The-iPhone-5-Only-Half-of-Verizons-Q4-iPhone-Sales/default.aspx">Has the iPhone Lost Its Luster? The iPhone 5 Only Half of Verizon’s Q4 iPhone Sales</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let&#8217;s look at Verizon&#8217;s fourth quarter results. Verizon sold a
record number of iPhones in Q4, a clear indication that they&#8217;re
still wildly popular. However, only half of them were the latest
iPhone 5 model. Why would so many smartphone shoppers buy an older
model iPhone when the iPhone 5 is a superior device?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the iPhone outsold all Android phones 2-to-1 (the highest percentage to date) at the biggest U.S. carrier, which carries its <em>own</em> brand of Android phones. That amounted to six million units, also a record. And this is bad, because only half were the iPhone 5.</p>

<p>So what should Apple do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Number one, Apple could give users what they apparently want: a
lower cost iPhone. It&#8217;s been rumored that this is already in the
works, though one senior exec at Apple has since insisted that a
lower cost iPhone would &#8220;never be the future of Apple products.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me get this straight. It&#8217;s bad news for Apple that half its sales at Verizon were for the iPhone 4 and 4S, not the new top-of-the-line more expensive iPhone 5. Therefore, Lilly argues, they should make an even cheaper iPhone. OK.</p>

<p>Apple can&#8217;t win by logic like this.</p>

<p>[<strong>Brief interpolation on the low-cost iPhone thing:</strong> I <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/01/22/verizon-iphone">pointed out yesterday</a> that the simplest explanation for the iPhone 5 accounting for &#8220;only&#8221; half of Verizon&#8217;s iPhone activations is that the iPhone 4 is the first free-with-contract iPhone on Verizon; the iPhone 3GS, which had been free-with-contract on AT&amp;T for two years, was a GSM-only phone. This in turn led me to point out that Apple already has a low-cost iPhone: the iPhone 4. That said, there&#8217;s low-cost-with-a-contract, and there&#8217;s low-cost-sans-contract. Apple still lacks a lower-cost iPhone that you can buy without a contract. That&#8217;s not a big deal in the U.S. market, which is dominated by carrier-subsidized pricing, but it is a big deal in much of the rest of the world. An unlocked new iPhone 4 still costs about $450-500. Compare that to Google&#8217;s Nexus 4, which sells for $299, no strings attached. What I&#8217;m saying though, is that something like a $299 no-contract iPhone wouldn&#8217;t be a radical departure for Apple, but rather the next incremental step after free-with-contract iPhones.]</p>

<p>Back to Lilly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Option two, then, is to build a better iPhone, one that trumps the
competition in nearly every way so that buyers will be compelled
to spend more on the latest and greatest. There has to be
significant separation between the next iPhone model and the
iPhone 5, or smartphone shoppers are just going to keep investing
in older hardware. Or jump ship to Android.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what Apple has done every single year since 2007, with the exception that they&#8217;ve never needed nor tried to build new iPhones that compel owners of the previous year&#8217;s model to upgrade. Normal people have the good sense to wait two or more years before upgrading. The iPhone 5 does exactly that &#8212; it&#8217;s a compelling upgrade over the iPhone 4 in every way.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next up, Brett Arends, writing at MarketWatch, &#8220;<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-things-to-watch-for-in-apples-earnings-call-2013-01-23?siteid=yhoof2">10 Things to Watch for in Apple&#8217;s Earnings Call</a>&#8221; (I couldn&#8217;t get through all ten, sorry):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. The balance sheet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to all those companies for whom it&#8217;s not important to pay attention to profits and cash. Oh, wait, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/10/26/amazon_profits_they_don_t_exist_but_the_company_keeps_on_keeping_on.html">maybe he has a point</a> here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2. China sales. Sorry, fanboys, but almost everybody in America
who wants an iPhone has an iPhone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which &#8220;fanboys&#8221; are somehow rooting against Apple selling iPhones in China? And if almost everyone in the U.S. who wants an iPhone has an iPhone, why do U.S. iPhone sales continue to grow?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. The iPhone 17. Okay, okay, so we’re only on iPhone 5. But the
   issue will be when the next upgrade &#8212; to iPhone 6 &#8212; is
   coming. My biggest dislike of this industry for investors is
   the rapid replacement cycle. But that’s the game. What’s next,
   and when?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the last 15 years Apple hasn&#8217;t once revealed the timing of upcoming products in a quarterly analyst call (or anywhere else for that matter), but Arends is looking for news about the iPhone 6 today on the call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4. Any hint about a keyboard. Your correspondent does not have an
   iPhone. I probably wouldn’t own one anyway, but I am precluded
   from even considering one because they do not come with a
   real, physical keyboard, and I absolutely must have one.
   Millions of others are in my shoes. Steve Jobs had an
   obsessive dislike of keyboards, but it was foolish. Apple CEO
   Tim Cook could probably finish off Research In Motion, maker
   of the BlackBerry, by announcing an iPhone with a keyboard.
   Easy. Why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where to start? First, again with the idea of making product announcements during a <em>phone call with financial analysts</em>. Second, 2007 called, and they want their &#8220;Apple needs to make an iPhone with a keyboard&#8221; argument back. (It goes on the shelf next to &#8220;The iPhone needs a replaceable battery&#8221;). This year&#8217;s Apple-needs-to arguments are &#8220;Apple needs to make an iPhone with a big-ass 5-inch display&#8221; and &#8220;Apple needs to make a cheaper iPhone&#8221;.</p>

<p>(Bonus jackass points to Arends for the &#8220;I probably wouldn&#8217;t own one anyway.&#8221;)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5. Plans for Apple TV. So far, sales of these have been
   disappointing. But I remain convinced this could be a huge
   source of future growth for Apple, which could dominate TV, and
   the living room, the way it has come to dominate smartphones.
   Steve Jobs allegedly had an inspiration about how to make it a
   much better experience shortly before he died. I want to hear
   what he saw, and when we’ll see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Read this slowly: Apple does not, and never has (in the modern era starting with the NeXT reunification at least) revealed anything in advance regarding upcoming products. When Arends plays poker, does he ask to see his opponents&#8217; cards?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6. Any hints about an iTunes subscription service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Great idea. Not going to be announced in a conference call.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>7. An iPad Mini HD. […] The flaw of the iPad Mini is that,
despite the famous Apple ease of use, it has a lower-resolution
screen compared with some competitors, and yet a higher price. If
Apple is serious about 7-inch tablets, it needs to get
best-in-class, as usual. When will this happen?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#8217;s consider all 7–8-inch tablets in the world. Which one do you think sold the most units last quarter? Take a wild guess. My guess is the iPad Mini. That the iPad Mini does not have the highest resolution display does not mean it isn&#8217;t the best overall tablet in its class. I&#8217;d argue, in fact, that it is currently the <em>best tablet, period.</em> And whether it is the best or not (subjective, obviously, <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-ipad-mini-is-the-best-tablet/">but I&#8217;m not alone in thinking so</a>), I feel pretty sure it&#8217;s the most popular.</p>

<p>And, the way Apple&#8217;s resolution strategy for iOS works, they couldn&#8217;t go halfway with a 200-ish pixels-per-inch resolution. It&#8217;s either 163 or all the way to 326 &#8212; which would be a lot more expensive, require a much more powerful graphics system, and consume a lot more power, requiring a bigger thicker battery and therefore a thicker heavier form factor. Arguing that the iPad Mini is (a) too expensive; and (b) should have a retina display; makes less sense than anything else Arends has argued so far, and that&#8217;s saying a lot. It&#8217;s like telling a restaurant that their meals cost too much and but they should use more expensive ingredients.</p>

<p>Given that every model of iPad Mini still appears to be supply-constrained &#8212; Apple&#8217;s online store estimates &#8220;7 days&#8221; for shipping new orders &#8212; it&#8217;s hard to take seriously an argument that it&#8217;s overpriced, unless you believe Apple is purposefully sandbagging iPad Mini production. Arends&#8217;s argument, shared by many others, seems to be that because Amazon, Google, and Samsung are selling 7-inch tablets at lower prices than the Mini, Apple is ipso facto losing &#8212; <em>no matter if the iPad Mini, at its current pricing, is the best-selling tablet in the world.</em></p>

<p>We&#8217;ll never know since none of the Amazon, Google, or Samsung triumvirate reveal sales numbers, but I feel pretty good predicting that the iPad Mini outsold all of them last quarter, and I&#8217;d even wager a fiver that the Mini outsold all of them <em>combined</em>. Imagine how well Apple could do in this category if they were &#8220;serious&#8221; about it.</p>
