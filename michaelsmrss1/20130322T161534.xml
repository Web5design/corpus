&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEDIA RELEASE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22 March 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Border Protection Command intercepts vessel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HMAS&lt;em&gt; Bundaberg&lt;/em&gt;, operating under the control of Border Protection Command, intercepted a suspected irregular entry vessel north of Christmas Island this morning.&lt;em&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial indications suggest there are 69 passengers with three crew on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vessel was initially detected by a RAAF maritime patrol aircraft, operating under the control of Border Protection Command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Border Protection Command has now transferred the passengers to Christmas Island, where they will undergo initial security, health and identity checks and their reasons for travel will be established. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People arriving by boat without a visa after 13 August 2012 run the risk of transfer to a regional processing country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Adviser:&lt;/strong&gt; Ryan Hamilton &lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sauce: 3:30pm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only opinion and conjecture (at this stage) however many believe the soap opera witnessed yesterday seems to have &amp;#39;stunt&amp;#39; written all over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Crean made no sense in his press conference(s), he backs Rudd? he doesn&amp;#39;t? he wants to be deputy? whose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition was circulated. &amp;#0160;Some evidence would lie in the signatures on that petition. Were the signatories supporters of Rudd or Gillard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the petition presented to Gillard or did she call the ballot without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crean said that he&amp;#39;d spoken to Rudd. More evidence here, in that meeting did Rudd say he&amp;#39;d challenge or did he stick by &amp;quot;his word&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ballot arrives and no one challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be over analysing but it leaves 4 possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Flush Rudd out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was an attempt to &amp;#39;flush out&amp;#39; Kevin Rudd you would assume a little more time would be given to ensure he nominated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Remove the non-believers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the carnage that has followed it should appear more likely that the spill was designed to flush out those who support Rudd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C. Cover up the failing of the past two weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly likely, but does the damage caused by the spill outweigh the damage caused by the past two weeks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. None of the above&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just another Fail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauce: 2:00pm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last and only time a motion of no confidence was successful was immediately after the 1975 Dismissal. The Governor General had already decided to disolve parliament at this stage so it was not used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9a2eb8e970d-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media speculation suggests Kevin Rudd would have challenged and succeeded if he had more time to secure the numbers.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the same can be said for yesterday&amp;#39;s motion by Tony Abbott and why he has stated publicly that he will make another attempt when the House sits again in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During yesterday&amp;#39;s vote Windsor, Oakshot and Wilke voted with the opposition. While it did get some (me included) rather excited about the propects of success it needs to be understood that all three of these Members have always held firm that they will not support any gag motions and will always support the democratic right of the House and its Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, they were voting to give Mr Abbott the right to move the motion, not the motion itself. Its very unlikely that Oakshot or Windsor would have supported a no-confidence motion and Wilkie&amp;#39;s office seem very tight lipped on everything. (either that or his Media Advisor really doesn&amp;#39;t like Sauce)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig Thompson said yesterday he&amp;#39;d be discussing the planned confidence motion seriously with the other cross benchers over the next six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued (please put your coffee down now)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;But at this point I am not inclined to give my vote to Tony Abbott, because I think as prime minister he would be very damaging for the central coast and for Australia.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;(you can resume drinking)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parliment yesterday had a sense of finality to it. &amp;#0160;If enough MPs believe there is little that can be achieved between now and September we may see the independants support the motion, we may see the opposition finally accept Craig Thompson&amp;#39;s vote and we may even see someone cross the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
