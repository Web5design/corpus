That is the 'Dancing with the Stars' Question</title><link>http://www.buddytv.com/articles/dancing-with-the-stars/to-jazz-or-not-to-jazz-that-is-49673.aspx</link><description>There have been a couple firsts on this season of &lt;i&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/i&gt;. In season 16, Disney star Zendaya Coleman has become the youngest competitor in the show's history. This has turned out to be a great decision, bringing in some younger viewers, while also incorporating a star that has quickly shown to be one of the best dancers this season. ABC also decided to make a small yet significant addition to the show by adding more contemporary dances like Jazz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABC's move may seem like a minor deal to casual fans, but to dance fans, this was a big move. There must of been a reason why it took &lt;i&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/i&gt; 16 seasons to incorporate Jazz into the show right? &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;I wanted to entitle this recap "Devin Velez Goes Home," because let's be honest, that's what is happening this week on &lt;i&gt;American Idol&lt;/i&gt;. Painful as it might be to all the Devin lovers, the guys are just seriously underperforming this season (perhaps with a little selection help from the judges in Hollywood and Las Vegas). And, barring a miracle, Lazaro Arbos is destined to glisten our television screens for at least the next two or three weeks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janelle Arthur and Burnell Taylor are possible candidates for elimination, but seeing as how Janelle is this year's queen of country and Burnell is the best of the guys, either seems like a long shot to go home. Amber Holcomb made a surprising appearance in the bottom three last week, but the judges would surely save her were she to be America's shocking choice.&lt;br /&gt;</description><author>editor@buddytv.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 19:00:43 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.buddytv.com/articles/american-idol/american-idol-recap-the-top-8-49668.aspx</guid><media:group><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="http://images.buddytv.com/articles/idolcover.jpg"></media:content><media:thumbnail type="image/jpeg" url="http://images.buddytv.com/articles/idolcover.jpg"></media:thumbnail></media:group></item><item><title>'The Following' Episode 11 Photos: FBI Finds a Follower Location on 'Whips &amp;amp; Regrets'</title><link>http://www.buddytv.com/slideshows/the-following-episode-11-photos-fbi-finds-a-follower-location-on-whips-amp-regrets-4485.aspx</link><description>After losing Claire to Joe?s followers, Ryan and Parker attempt to recover while the FBI tracks down an undercover location that may have dark ties to Joe?s following.

&lt;i&gt;American Idol&lt;/i&gt; has had many great singers walk onto the stage, but there have also been a few notorious contestants. I?m not talking about bad auditions like William Hung, but rather the ones who made it to the live shows and gave us one bad performance after another, making the judges regret ever putting them through in the first place. Here are my 10 favorite examples of &lt;i&gt;Idol&lt;/i&gt;?s trainwreck contestants.
