				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>OH hello! Remember me? The fairer, red hairer, more romantic of the two lazy travelers? I am alive and well and living in Australia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mean, not living&#8211;just passing through, but you get my drift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, here&#8217;s how the past three weeks have gone:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1278.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9837" alt="IMG_1278" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1278-1024x682.jpg" width="498" height="331" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Arrive on the South Island of New Zealand, have that &#8220;oooh THIS is New Zealand!&#8221; moment, and feel like the luckiest girl in all the land.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Get served a healthy dose of reality when I snap my sunglasses completely in half literally AS my computer crashes and burns, taking almost all of my photos from Fiji and Hawaii with it.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1241.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9836" alt="IMG_1241" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1241-1024x682.jpg" width="491" height="327" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A moment of silence. </strong><br />
<em>October 2009, Canne, France - April 2013, Glentanner, New Zealand</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive in Sydney to meet an angel in the form of Malcolm the Apple Genius.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-align: justify;">Get my computer back to a functioning level&#8211;but still with a collection of prized photos lost and gone forever.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Sigh.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took me about 48 hours to get over myself and find the positives to the whole suicidal hard drive situation, but here they are: iPhones mean we still have photos from the days that disappeared from my DSLR&#8230; they may not be high-res, and there may not be as many, but they are there. (If you want to see a small smattering, get to following me on <a href="http://instagram.com/_theromantic" target="_blank">Instagram</a>! And stat!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally&#8211;and more importantly&#8211;lacking a computer forced me to check out of blogland and focus on the beauty of New Zealand while spending serious quality time with the hubs. All from the back of a van, no less! For those of you who asked &#8220;but won&#8217;t you get sick of each other&#8230; one on one&#8230; for five straight months?&#8221; It&#8217;s a resounding no! I like this guy! Even when I get hungry! (He thinks that last part&#8217;s not true, but it is.) It is officially love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though this brief blogging hiatus was rejuvenating, it feels good to be back and able to resume my recaps. Partially because we have a twelve hour bus ride to Melbourne tomorrow, but mostly because I want to share more from of our lives since we left the Upper East Side&#8230; 48 days ago! We&#8217;ve been pushed well out of our comfort zones, survived, and are genuinely excited for shit to continue to get weirder. Because, to be honest, shit just gets weird for us.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>This photo is a good example:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0718.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9834" alt="IMG_0718" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0718-1024x682.jpg" width="491" height="327" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We look uncomfortable because we are.</p>
<p>This one is probably better:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0658.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9835" alt="IMG_0658" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0658-1024x682.jpg" width="491" height="327" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Oh, just saying whaddup to the hubs through a window in the bedroom&#8230; while he sits in the bathtub fully clothed.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, fellow travelers, I will return soon with tales of angry gods in Hawaii, amazingly welcoming villagers in Fiji, and so much natural beauty in New Zealand that you&#8217;ll be dying for city photos from Sydney. I HAVE IT ALL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys- big news. We&#8217;ve found the Australian version of the romantic &amp; hubs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check it: they&#8217;re a couple who decided to leave behind the doldrums of the normal nine to five in favor of traveling the world! They&#8217;ve been on the road for almost a year, so we&#8217;re thinking the romantic &amp; the hubs may be able to learn a trick or two about round the world travel, couple style. Read on to find out more about their experience leaving the real world behind, and for more travel tales, visit their site, <a href="http://suitcasestories.com/" target="_blank">Suitcase Stories</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite Place:</b> New York City.  The first time I went to NYC it was winter and snow had just started to fall &#8211; It was a winter wonderland! I couldn&#8217;t believe how beautiful it was.  The next time I went it was summer and just as amazing.  I love the energy pulsing through this city. I love the gorgeous architecture. I love that there is so much to do.  And I love the food!  I will be there again in May for a third time!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>More importantly, favorite meal:</b> Pad Thai! I am slightly obsessed with this Thai dish.  No matter which country I am in I will always find a good Thai restaurant to get my fix! I am a big believer in eating the local cuisine wherever I am but Pad Thai is my one weakness and the one meal I eat no matter which country I am in!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The moment you caught the travel bug:</b> I think I was born with it as I was fascinated from a very young age but I didn&#8217;t start traveling (internationally) until I was 29.  After that first trip, we went over seas every year until last year when we decided to just keep on traveling!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>First experience traveling alone:</b> When I was 10 my mother put me on a plane all alone to visit family on the ther side of the country.  I loved it!  Of course, it was the mid 80&#8242;s and things are not like they are now so I was let into the cockpit &#8211; A great thrill for a 10 year old!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ever been (or thought you&#8217;ve been) in imminent danger while traveling?: </b>No not at all.  I have always felt safe while traveling, even in areas we&#8217;ve been told to &#8216;stay safe&#8217;.  To be honest I had thought by now after 13 months of full time travel we would have at least run into something small, but at no times have I felt anything but safe.  I actually wish the media would lay off about &#8216;unsafe travel&#8217; because its unwarranted most of the time and just scares people off from traveling! As long as you are sensible travel is just as safe as staying at home!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Worst hotel/hostel experience:</b> This might not seem like much to most people but for me this was the worst!  We checked into a bungalow which had a cockroach nest in it! So we were welcomes by over a dozen roaches! The princess in me couldn&#8217;t take it so we moved to another bungalow!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Best hotel/hostel experience:</b> My favorite was an apartment style in NYC.  It gave me a real feel what it would be like to live in a studio apartment in NYC and I LOVED it!  I really didn&#8217;t want to leave.  It wasn&#8217;t just the apartment itself, although that was gorgeous, it was also in a great location!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><b>Must-have packing item:</b>  I can travel without most things but the 2 things I can not live without are my camera and laptop.  I love sharing my experiences with the world so they are a must!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Most unbelievable travel experience:</b>  The last 13 months! Being able to live my dreams of full time travel has been extraordinary!  I thank the universe every day for giving me this amazing life!  I have no idea how I am ever going to be able to stop&#8230; Fingers crossed it wont be for a while!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this&#8221; moment:</b> Every single day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t wait to return to:</b> There are so many places I would love to go back to but I would say I am most excited about my return to New York City.  I tried to book that same apartment again but it wasn&#8217;t available!  Im sure I am going to have an amazing time there no matter where I lay my head to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t be paid to return to:</b> I haven&#8217;t been anywhere yet that I wouldn&#8217;t return.  I&#8217;ve been to a couple of places that didn&#8217;t meet my expectations (Rio de Janeiro &amp; Thailand) but we only went to one area in both so I am looking forward to going back and giving them another shot.  I hear such good things about both places so I hope to see it from a different perspective next time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Any exciting trips coming up?:</b> We are permanently traveling so of course there is always something coming up.  After we leave Costa Rica we have NYC, Toronto &amp; Barbados!  For the rest of the year we also have southern Europe, London, Dublin and then we are off to SE Asia for a few months! This year is a huge and exciting year for us!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dream vacation:</b> I have loads to pick from but Ill say Bora Bora!  Its one of those idyllic destinations!  I love the beach so to me that seems like the perfect place for a vacation!  Ive always dreamed of going to this beautiful island &#8211; Ill get there one day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite tourist attraction:</b> <wbr />My answer might be a little cliche but I have to say the Eiffel Tower.  It had been a long time dream of mine to go to Paris and see the Eiffel Tower in person so when I finally got there I had a very emotional &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I am here&#8221; moment. It was a little overwhelming, in a good way <img src='http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite travel photo </b>I am a big fan of sunset photos, taking them and looking at them! This is one of my favorites.  It was taken at Venice Beach in California.  There was no editing, it was an amazing sunset!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Venice-Beach-Sunset.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9826" alt="Venice Beach Sunset" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Venice-Beach-Sunset-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4949" alt="thewino&amp;theromanticsmallXS" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg" width="150" height="93" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re not quite sure how to compose this next introduction, so we&#8217;ll put the fancy prose aside and just say this: if you&#8217;re looking for a New York-based attorney who also happens to excel at singing karaoke around the globe, Harvey from <a href="http://hbombkaraoke.com/" target="_blank">H-Bomb Worldwide Karaoke</a> is your guy. He&#8217;s crooned along in karaoke bars across 27 different countries (that&#8217;s a FACT), with more travel plans in the works. Read on to hear more about his song-filled adventures and how he lost a Chilean girl&#8217;s hand in marriage thanks to a lousy chess game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite Place:</b> A tie between Greece and Italy.  The reasons include the Mediterranean climate, the stunning beauty, the food, and the history dating back to classical times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>More importantly, favorite meal:</b> In Istanbul I had a dish called iskender, which consists of grilled lamb strips, chunks of bread, tomato sauce, yogurt, and melted sheep butter, all mixed together.  The taste of this dish was absolutely incredible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The moment you caught the travel bug:</b> During winter break of my senior year of university, I competed in the World Debating Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to that trip I had never been out of my native United States and had never even been on an airplane. That trip instilled in me a lifelong love of travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>First experience traveling alone:</b> Between my second and third years of law school, I took summer law courses in London and Salzburg. The program was run by a law school other than mine, so I didn&#8217;t know any of the other students beforehand.  Then, after the classes wrapped up, I spent three weeks traveling around Europe on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ever been (or thought you&#8217;ve been) in imminent danger while traveling?: </b>In Mexico City I was robbed by a taxi driver.  He took my smartphone and some of my money, and then he forced me to get out of the vehicle and left me in the middle of nowhere at 2 a.m.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on Easter Island I was chased by a pack of three stray dogs in a deserted area at dusk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the time that I only found out later of the danger I&#8217;d been in.  It happened when I was on safari in South Africa. At about midnight on my first night at the game lodge, I was hungry so I wandered out of my bungalow, hoping to find a staff member to help me out with late-night snack options.  I did end up having the kitchen make me a sandwich.  The following evening I was in the bar, having drinks with staff members.  The staffers casually mentioned that leopards and hyenas frequently roamed the lodge grounds at night, so that it wasn’t safe to leave my bungalow alone after dark. In fact, they told me that just the night before (the same night when I’d stepped out of my bungalow to search for sustenance), a leopard had been running around on the premises!  I shudder to think what would have happened if I&#8217;d encountered that leopard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Worst hotel/hostel experience:</b> Arriving in Johannesburg on a Saturday afternoon, I was exhausted and jet-lagged after having been up all night on a 15-hour flight from New York.  Normally in that situation, I will take a nap.  But when I got to my hotel, I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep because there was a wedding party staying on the same floor and they were being very loud &#8212; slamming doors, screaming, etc.  Eventually the hotel kicked out that rowdy group of guests, but the damage was done.  I ended up not being able to get to sleep until very late that night, and I had problems with insomnia, fatigue and illness for days afterward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Best hotel/hostel experience:</b> The Embassy Suites in Murfreesboro, Tennessee a couple of months ago. I&#8217;m one of those New Yorkers who doesn&#8217;t drive, my license having expired in 2011.  Getting around a town like Murfreesboro, with no mass transit and unreliable taxi service, could therefore have been difficult for me.  But the hotel&#8217;s bellhop staff volunteered to drive me all around Murfreesboro in a shuttle van that&#8217;s normally just used for airport runs and the like.  They took me everywhere from a karaoke bar to a Civil War battlefield &#8212; and didn&#8217;t charge me for any of the rides.  One of the bellhops even gave me an impromptu tour of the city, which included a stop so that I could get out and take photos in the historic downtown.  My suite in the hotel was spacious and had lots of amenities, but it was the outstanding service that really made my stay there memorable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In case you&#8217;re wondering what I was doing in a random place like Murfreesboro, I was there on official World Karaoke Tour business!  I&#8217;d heard that a local bar had a karaoke show hosted by a woman named Heather who calls herself &#8220;H-Bomb&#8221;; so I just had to fly down to Tennessee and meet this other H-Bomb.  But I digress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite family vacation:</b> My parents gave me the opportunities that enabled me to become a frequent traveler in adulthood. However, we didn&#8217;t go on any long-distance vacations when I was growing up in New Jersey. I do treasure my memories of our end-of-summer family road trips to Cape Cod and Atlantic City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Must-have packing item:</b> I <i>wish</i> that I only had one must-have packing item!  But I can&#8217;t go anywhere without taking along all of the following: (1) laptop, (2) DSLR camera, (3) tripod for taking long-exposure photos, (4) Kindle, and (5) smartphone. And that&#8217;s without even getting into the related accessories like chargers and voltage converters.  I&#8217;m not complaining, as these devices have greatly improved the quality of my trips and my ability to document them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Most unbelievable travel experience:</b> On a flight from Santiago, Chile to Easter Island, I was seated next to a Chilean urologist and his college-aged daughter.  Among the offerings on the in-flight entertainment system was a computerized chess game that passengers could play against other passengers.  The doctor told me that I should challenge his daughter to a game of chess, and that if i won the game he would give me his daughter&#8217;s hand in marriage.  I&#8217;ll never know if he was serious, because I lost the chess match!  I swear that I was trying, but I just suck at chess. (Postscript: the father and daughter did not disembark at Easter Island; they stayed on the plane, which was continuing onward to Papeete, Tahiti.  So I never saw them again.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this&#8221; moment: </b>Waking up on Easter Island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t wait to return to:</b> London. I&#8217;ve spent more time there by far than in any other foreign city, but have only been there once in the last six years as I&#8217;ve prioritized seeing places that I haven&#8217;t yet been to. But I miss London and really need to make it back there!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t be paid to return to:</b> There&#8217;s no place I&#8217;ve visited that I wouldn&#8217;t return to. In some cases I would take greater safety precautions, but I would still go back. Every place that I&#8217;ve ever been to has had at least some good qualities.  Also, there are always things that I didn&#8217;t get around to seeing on my first visit to a particular destination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Any exciting trips coming up?:</b> Next month I&#8217;m off to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev, plus a weekend in Chisinau, Moldova. If all goes to plan, the 3 countries that I&#8217;ll be hitting on that trip will become the 28th, 29th, and 30th countries on my World Karaoke Tour. That will give me the distinction of having sung karaoke in more countries than anyone else that I know of! (There&#8217;s an Australian travel writer named Brian Thacker who&#8217;s sung in 29.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just a few days after returning from that trip, I&#8217;ll be heading to Toronto for my first-ever TBEX!  I look forward to meeting lots of my favorite travel bloggers in person for the first time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dream vacation:</b> I want to sing karaoke in Antarctica, the only continent where I have yet to make a karaoke appearance.  So all I have to do is find a way to get to McMurdo station, a scientific base that isn&#8217;t on any cruise ship itinerary, has no hotels, and doesn&#8217;t welcome tourists (but does have a bar with regularly scheduled karaoke nights!)  Of course, getting to Antarctica from North America (or from most places) is expensive and arduous anyway.  My goal of singing there just adds another layer of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite tourist attraction:</b> Going to observation decks at the top of skyscrapers and enjoying the panoramic view of the surrounding area &#8212; especially at night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I&#8217;m trying not to look like a tourist&#8221; attraction:</b> One of the nice things about going to karaoke bars in foreign countries is that in most cases you don&#8217;t see other tourists, and it can be a great opportunity to meet locals (although the loud music isn&#8217;t always conducive to conversation).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also like riding local mass transit systems, and reading on my Kindle, etc., just as if I were commuting to work on the subway in Manhattan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite travel photo:</b> Me on Easter Island with some of the moai.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate to see some pretty amazing things in this world, but those mysterious stone statues have to rank at the top of the list.  Seeing them was definitely worth my run-in with the killer dogs.</p>
