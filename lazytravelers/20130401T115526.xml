				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>Before the hubs and I realized that hiking is more than just casually <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/finding-our-inner-athletes-in-oahu/" target="_blank">strolling about in the wilderness</a>, we took <a href="https://www.kayakkauai.com/" target="_blank">Kayak Kauai </a>up on a day of hiking in the morning and stand-up paddleboard (SUP) rentals in the afternoon. When I told the owner, Micco, that this was how we’d like to spend a random Wednesday, he responded with, “well, you’ll sleep well that night!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Well played, Micco.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4316.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9603" alt="IMG_4316" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4316-1024x770.jpg" width="614" height="462" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We met our guide, Kelly, early in the morning at the Kayak Kauai location in Kapa’a. Though I assumed our tour would involve a small group, the hubs and I were pleased to find that we were the only two hikers that day. After picking out our lunch—sandwiches, drinks, and water are all included in the tour—we hopped in the van to head toward <a href="https://www.kayakkauai.com/cart.php?cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=86" target="_blank">Moalepe Trail</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4328.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9605" alt="IMG_4328" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4328-1024x925.jpg" width="614" height="555" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hike along Moalepe is one of Kayak Kauai’s newer tour options, and is geared more toward people who are interested in navigating trails that are a little off the beaten track, but still boasts stellar views of the Garden Island. As we had already done <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/waimea-canyon-the-grand-canyon-of-the-pacific/" target="_blank">Waimea</a> on our own, this was a perfect option for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4319.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9604" alt="IMG_4319" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4319-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we saw a few other hikers tackling the trail sans guide, having Kelly—who was born and raised on Kauai—meant we got to do things like eat purple flowers that tasted like mushrooms, acquire fancy new rope bracelets made from an extremely durable kind of bark found on the trail, and finally learn why so many parts of Kauai look like what I picture the plains of Africa to look like. Apparently, it’s because a huge number of trees are actually directly FROM Africa. I mean, how obvious?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, as I am directionally challenged and the hubs gets easily confused when his surroundings all look very similar, Kelly’s navigation was 100% required. He tried to teach us a few things about tracking, but I thought all the parts of the trail where people had apparently recently walked looked exactly the same as the parts where they apparently had not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This led to one serious revelation for me: I would have very limited chance of survival in a post-apocalyptic world, a la <i>The Hunger Games </i>or <i>The Walking Dead</i>. This probably should have depressed me, but when you&#8217;re in Hawaii, it&#8217;s pretty hard to get too upset about such things, you know?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4324.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9606" alt="IMG_4324" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4324-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Later, when we heard dogs barking off in the distance, Kelly explained how hunters train teams of dogs to go in and hunt for wild boars. The dogs will corner the boars, and then the hunters will approach and stab them in the chest. Occasionally, a dog will get injured by a boar, but mostly they&#8217;re just rewarded with the extra meat at the end of the hunt. It all sounded terribly violent, so I just imagined it to be the Hawaiian version of <i>Downton Abbey</i> and felt much better. Sidenote: sorry for all the pop culture references in this post?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We eventually made our way toward Kuilau trail, which would eventually lead us to the Kuilau Picnic area, where we would stop for lunch and take in the views.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4338.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9607" alt="IMG_4338" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4338-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Seeing your trail ahead of you when it’s all windy and bendy like that is 1 part cool, 3 parts intimidating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After our tour wrapped, we made our way back to the Kapa’a shop to pick up our car and bid adieu to Kelly. We then made our way up to Hanalei to <a href="https://www.kayakkauai.com/cart.php?cart/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=27" target="_blank">pick-up our SUPs</a> and tackle adventure number two of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4353.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9608" alt="IMG_4353" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4353-764x1024.jpg" width="458" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Stand-up paddle boarding ended up being one of my favorite activities during our time in Kauai, which, honestly, was completely unexpected. Though we each fell once, it was way more relaxing than I had anticipated (except for when the wind was at our front, then I wanted to just ditch the whole thing and go get a beer.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Unlike surfing, once you have it figured out, you&#8217;re pretty set. The learning curve didn&#8217;t take nearly as long as I had expected, which is always a plus for me, as I am very impatient when it comes to learning new things. Good trait, no?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Luckily, even in the midst of my frustrated moments, the views of Hanalei River did not disappoint. It seriously felt like we were on a movie set.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4357.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9609" alt="IMG_4357" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4357-1024x764.jpg" width="614" height="458" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also at the Hanalei location that we were able to meet more of the Kayak Kauai team, including the owner, Micco. I always find it fascinating when we get to chat with people who moved somewhere remote, and after learning that Micco is an American University alum like the hubs, I had even more questions (namely, why didn&#8217;t the hubs take the classes that led us to be tour operators in Hawaii?). Micco had started the company with his brother back in 1984, and like all good businesses, it was based completely in passion. In fact, Micco&#8217;s honeymoon involved a kayaking tour of Croatia. His wife wasn&#8217;t there to offer her opinions on the matter, but this sounds like a serious dedication to the sport to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I tend to feel with most independently owned tour operators, Kayak Kauai was the perfect way to spend our day not only exploring the island, but learning more about the local culture in Kauai. Though I’m sure the local resorts offer rental options and tour hook-ups, the more we travel, the more I realize that these smaller companies are the heart of most local tourism industries, and getting to know the faces behind these companies is just as much a part of the experience as the actual tour itself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you find yourself in Kauai, definitely give Micco and Kayak Kauai a shout and see which tour or rental option would be the best fit for you. Considering we managed to do everything but actually kayak, it’s safe to say they offer something for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the romantic</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>- Though Kayak Kauai did host us for the day, all opinions are, as always, my own. I really did enjoy all the physical activity! I swear!</em></p>

What kind of winos would we be if we didn&#8217;t have favorite dishes to wash down with our nightly glass du vin? Since our photos of delicious dishes are abound, we figured we&#8217;d pick a New York favorite and leave it at that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best New York dish is a paper dish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wino.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-105" alt="wino" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/wino-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>Remember the time we told you its not about the length of the trip, its about the <a href="http://bit.ly/WpYO8c" target="_blank">length of the journey</a>? Or&#8230;the experience of the journey? Anyway, it was something extremely profound (I&#8217;m sure) about the importance of getting away, even if you can only manage a few days. That sounds right!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The point is, I&#8217;ve been in New York without any form of escape for over a month, which is way too long by Lazy Travelers standards. So, this weekend I&#8217;m packing my bags and going about four hours south to the city of crabs and <a href="http://nationalbohemian.com/" target="_blank">Natty Bo</a>: Baltimore, Maryland. It&#8217;s just far enough south to hope for sunny, spring weather, but not far enough away that it requires purchasing a plane ticket.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since I&#8217;ve been to Baltimore many times before, I&#8217;ll be skipping the touristy bits like the Inner Harbor and the Aquarium and focusing on the more important things.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/320097_10100119506300264_1987893900_n1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9578" alt="320097_10100119506300264_1987893900_n" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/320097_10100119506300264_1987893900_n1.jpg" width="604" height="453" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Make your own Bloody Mary at <a href="http://www.ryleighs.com/" target="_blank">Ryleigh&#8217;s Oyster</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can follow along on my trip via <a href="http://instagram.com/_thewino" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, where I promise to post many pictures of my Bloody Marys and crab-related dishes. Stay tuned!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

And how appropriate that is, seeing as how the romantic has been spending the past few days touring vineyards in New Zealand and the wino will be toasting to herself this evening following a very hectic work week. Our lives are apples and oranges right now, but at least the wine still brings us together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aaand sticking with our #winewednesday theme&#8230; <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/446210/20130314/south-african-adventure-blog.htm" target="_blank"><strong>My South African Adventures: Grape Expectations in a Land of Wine</strong></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>On the morning of our trip to Waimea Canyon, we woke up prepared. We had learned our <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/finding-our-inner-athletes-in-oahu/" target="_blank">lesson in Oahu</a> and this time, we were stocking up on granola bars and wearing sneakers and staying hydrated and showing this island who’s boss!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let me tell you what: we totally owned that canyon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outside of our own personal responsibilities, there were a few other factors we had to consider before embarking on our quest to visit Mark Twain’s “Grand Canyon of the Pacific.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0168.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9527" alt="IMG_0168" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0168-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Time.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Number one way we just took this little daytrip and showed it who’s boss? Sneak attack. We woke up BRIGHT and EARLY. This is something I only do whilst traveling, but I do it well. We were told to get there by 10 AM and be finished with the whole shebang by noon, and you know what? We were there by 9:57 and done by 11:30. BOOM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Suck it, canyon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No, but like, seriously—get there early. Less people, less cloud coverage, more all around fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Weather.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were told repeatedly that if the weather is crappy, it’s not worth the drive. The issue with this advice? Weather on Kauai—like on most islands—can change in fifteen minutes or less. Luckily, we woke up to a big yellow ball of sunshine, but the real point here: be flexible with when you plan to see the canyon. I’d schedule it for the beginning of the trip, and leave room to move your visit back a few days if the weather is being a little bitch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>The Drive.</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, so. Everyone told us to drive all the way to the very, very end of “the road.” When they say this, they mean Kokee Road, but Kauai doesn’t really do street signs? So, you know. Just follow “the road.” Anyway, drive all the way to the end, hike around, and then hit the Waimea lookout on the way back. The weather can change in an instant, you don’t want to miss views of the Na Pali Coast, blah de blah de blahhhh.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0176.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9528" alt="IMG_0176" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0176-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">OMG LOL, we totes didn’t do that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m sure that’s wonderful advice and exactly how you should do things, but we also just got really excited by all the signs. Sorry, Waimea. We didn’t mean to do you a disservice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They tell you this because at the end of the trail, you can hike along the Na Pali Coast a bit. Later, when we went rafting up the Na Pali Coast, we learned that this is where clouds can really come in and literally rain on your parade—weather there changes faster than anywhere else on the island, it would seem. Somehow, everything worked out for us even though we broke all the rules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Don’t worry, we were eventually caught in a monster rainstorm in Fiji in the middle of the Pacific while transferring between islands in a (broken) aluminum rowboat. The weather gods brought our big egos back down to where they belong.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But Waimea? WE OWN YOU.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0190.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9529" alt="IMG_0190" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0190-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><b>The hike.</b><b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yeeeahhh, so. I get really cranky if I don’t eat every, say, two hours or so? So we had granola bars and we ate breakfast (more granola bars) (we’re on a budget) (this trip is making me so skinny), but this can only get a girl so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got out of our car after breaking the NO LOOK OUT rules, and started the hike. And it was so EASY!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0184.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9530" alt="IMG_0184" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0184-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was like we were on the MOON! All bouncy and big and flat! … And then all of a sudden it was very, very narrow and very, very steep and why is it so hot? And when is the last time I ate? Omg, I haven’t eaten in DAYS! I don’t know when my last meal WAS!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, we reached the coast, I smiled for this photo:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2023.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9531" alt="IMG_2023" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_2023-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And then we had to make a mad dash for food immediately. This hike was hard!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, Waimea? Worth it.  We saw tons of tour buses in all the parking lots along the way, but I’d honestly recommend driving so you can do everything at your own pace (i.e. BREAK ALL THE RULES).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the whole &#8220;Grand Canyon of Pacific&#8221; thing, this I can’t confirm. Has anyone else been to both who can speak to the comparison? Based on photos, I understand, but based on dimensions, it sounds like a stretch. Waimea clocks in at only 10 miles long and 3,000 feet deep…. while the Grand Canyon is 277 miles long and 5200 feet deep. I feel like there’s an obvious winner here, but I’ll have to make it out to Arizona someday to see it for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For now, I’ll just consider Waimea to be my own version of canyon training wheels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4949" alt="thewino&amp;theromanticsmallXS" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg" width="150" height="93" /></a>With the romantic &amp; the hubs three weeks into their RTW and the wino chin deep in real-life work, we haven&#8217;t had much time to think about our summer plans to take Eastern Europe by storm. When we realized this week that we were less than 3 months out until our scheduled rendezvous, we had a mild panic attack. It&#8217;s so close! It&#8217;s so far! What do we WEAR?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, <b>g</b><strong>ood news, everyone.</strong> The wino&#8217;s airfare (at least one leg) is officially purchased, and the planning for our ultimate European reunion can recommence!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you may recall, we were named runners-up in Go with Oh&#8217;s most recent contest thanks to <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/we-want-to-go-with-oh-to-vienna/" target="_blank">this post</a>. During our one week stay at our (presumably fancy) apartment in Vienna, we&#8217;re tackling a custom <strong>Lazy Travelers Go With Oh Bucket List</strong> full of traditional&#8211;and not so traditional&#8211;Austrian experiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have some surprises up our sleeves, but as for our Viennese adventure, we&#8217;re declaring the below our first bucket list item.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>#LTGoWithOh Bucket List Item #1</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Host an American barbecue for fellow expats, bloggers, and friends on the deck of our apartment.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sausage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9486" alt="sausage" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sausage.jpg" width="720" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we mentioned in our entry, we want to use this opportunity to really, truly live like locals. We&#8217;ve since noticed that Go with Oh has taken this on as their current campaign, and we ask&#8230; what&#8217;s more local than hosting a dinner party? And, more importantly, who doesn&#8217;t love a good BBQ?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re inviting all of our travel-loving friends who will be in Vienna at the time for a night of food, wine, and good old American fun. With one stipulation &#8212; you teach us some un-American drinking games. <strong>So guys, who&#8217;s up for a party in Vienna this June?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stay tuned over the next few months as we reveal all the items on our #LTGoWithOh Bucket List. And, if you&#8217;re so inclined, we&#8217;re now taking suggestions for things to add. What would you do with one full week in Vienna? Where would you go? What do you want us to do and see (and eat and drink)? Send us a tweet, facebook post, or comment with your idea, and your item could end up on our Bucket List!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And seriously: if you&#8217;re based in Austria, have plans to come to Vienna, or want to add a new trip to your summer itinerary that involves joining our drunken reunion, let us know! <strong>the lazy travelers [at] gmail [ dot] com.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">xo!</p>
