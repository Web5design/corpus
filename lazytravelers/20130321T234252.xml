				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>At first, booking a trip to Hawaii can be overwhelming. Each island has its own personality, and anyone who has visited Hawaii has a personal preference that they love to make very, very clear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though we were flying in and out of Honolulu, we knew we wanted to visit at least one other island during our ten days. After careful research (i.e. asking, like, four other people where they recommend), we decided to add Kauai—the garden island—to our itinerary.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0078.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9406" alt="IMG_0078" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0078-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we picked up our rental car from Argus, we set off to explore this new island. We already had a pretty strong impression of <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/rtw-rookies-the-north-shore-kick-off/" target="_blank">Oahu</a>, but I fell almost immediately in love with the scenery of Kauai.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0069.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9411" alt="IMG_0069" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0069-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Opaeka&#8217;a Falls. I mean, quintessential Hawaii up in here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon my first impression? Kauai felt a little bit more manicured and refined than Oahu—but again, we had only visited the North Shore at this point, which is definitely more au naturale in comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We spent the majority of our first day in Kauai driving around the southern coast of the island, seeing all the reasons they call this the garden island. It was definitely much more lush and green than the North Shore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’ll let the photos speak for themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0074.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9413" alt="IMG_0074" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0074-682x1024.jpg" width="409" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Waiemea River OR Jurassic Park?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0167.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9431" alt="IMG_0167" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0167-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Random lookout point we found during sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0113.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9432" alt="IMG_0113" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0113-682x1024.jpg" width="409" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Tree Tunnel on our way to Koloa (over 100 years old and formerly 3 miles long!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0137.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9433" alt="IMG_0137" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0137-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">You can thank views like this for keeping me awake, like, 80% of the time we were in the car. Serious accomplishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0132.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9434" alt="IMG_0132" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0132-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Poipu Beach!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0148.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9435" alt="IMG_0148" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0148-682x1024.jpg" width="409" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">A quick stop to see the Spouting Horn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0161.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9436" alt="IMG_0161" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0161-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Without ever having been on an African safari, these trees made me feel like Giraffes should have been roaming around in the distance. We later found out that they were imported from Africa and thrive in Kauai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also on our first day in Kauai? An afternoon pitstop at the Koloa Rum Tasting Room…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4949" alt="thewino&amp;theromanticsmallXS" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg" width="150" height="93" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well hello, fellow travel enthusiasts! It&#8217;s that time of the week again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet Marysia of <a href="http://www.mytravelaffairs.com/" target="_blank">My Travel Affairs</a>. She&#8217;s fairly new to the travel circuit, having only just discovered her love for travel in 2008. Since then, she&#8217;s built up an impressive (read: atypical) roster of travel destinations. She may have traveled alone to Brazil&#8211; something we&#8217;re not sure we have the courage to do&#8211; but the girl never leaves home without a hairdryer, and that&#8217;s something we can get behind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite Place:</b>  My favorite place is Tel Aviv. I think it is the best city in the whole world, or at least among all those places I have travelled to. It is the closest to perfect I have ever experienced. We all know that big international cities on the beach are everybody’s favorite, and I like Barcelona or Rio, but Tel Aviv has this special vibe I love. A perfect mix of beach culture, superb restaurants, vibrant nightlife, rich heritage, big art focus and more that 300 days of fantastic weather!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>More importantly, favorite meal: </b>I do not have an exact meal but I love Japanese cuisine. I’m actually addicted to sushi! Seriously! Can’t live without it, maybe that is why I want to travel to Japan so much. To have sushi for breakfast, lunch, dinner and as snacks ha ha ha</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The moment you caught the travel bug:</b> It was back in 2008 while two months trip in Asia (Cambodia, Laos and Thailand). I travelled a lot before, but at the end of the trip, on the plane back to Poland I have understood it is what I want to do in life. And I’m easy going person but extremely stubborn when I decide upon something in my head. And here we are in 2013 and I’m still traveling extensively <img src='http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>First experience traveling alone: </b>It was back in April of 2008, right after I have decided to travel full time. I went on my own to Brazil. Oh my God, it was so much fun, such an amazing country and welcoming people. I landed in Sao Paulo and took a taxi to my hotel, on the way I was trying to find out from the driver how long it is gonna take and no matter how I tried I couldn’t understand him. Take in consideration that I speak Spanish so I though that Portuguese won’t be that hard. It took me about two days to get used to the accent and people need to speak very slowly ha ha ha But back in the taxi, I though to myself: ‘Does it really matter? When I will get there I will get there’, I start smiling to myself and watched neighborhoods we drove by.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ever been (or thought you&#8217;ve been) in imminent danger while traveling?:</b> No, I’m very lucky in this sector. I have never really felt in danger while traveling. But I as well think that as a solo woman traveling some amount of common sense is required. Even though I have nothing against crazy things, I have sneak into Taj Mahal in India during Muslim prayers on Friday. I visited favela in Rio, entered Lebanon with Israeli stamp in my passport and many more but I always stay cautions for unnecessary danger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Worst hotel/hostel experience:</b> There are not many of those, but I would have to say King George Palace in Athens. Generally nice decor, great location with windows on Parthenon, roof top swimming pool and bar to spend a lazy afternoon but the worst services I have ever experienced. Generally stuff didn’t care, ordering a taxi or booking a table in the restaurant was a challenge above concierge abilities, 300euros extras on the bill they claimed we have to pay (room service we didn’t use). And all that in Greece which struggle with financial crash! You would think they would care more for returning customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><b>Best hotel/hostel experience:</b> I have stayed in many outstanding hotels in my life like Four Seasons (Istanbul &amp; Budapest), Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai, Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra. The Peninsula in Bangkok or Dolder Grand in Zurich but there was nothing like a stay in La Mamounia in Marrakech this NYE when I was traveling in Morocco.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite family vacation:</b> Annual skiing trips with my parents and sisters, I love this tradition, doesn’t matter if it is Italy, Poland or Austria. My parents are cool people and I wouldn’t mind travel more often with them but I’m always somewhere on the go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Must-have packing item:</b>  Ok, I know it may sound a bit silly for a traveller like me who often go to really unusual countries like Benin or Kazakhstan but I do not move from home without my hair dryer, even though majority of hotels offers them to guest, I need to have mine. I have a bad hair day if I’m not able to use my hair dryer. Silly as it comes, but it is! ha ha ha</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Most unbelievable travel experience:</b> Meeting ‘an angel’ called Rebecca in Shauildir in Kazakhstan, where nobody spoke Russian or English or any language I speak. I was very close to giving up on seeing ruins of ancient Silk Road city of Otrar when she appeared out from nowhere asking how can she help me. In this forgotten by God town, where you would never expect meeting any tourist, she was teaching English to Kazakh kids. Oh and breaking into UNESCO site an hour later is pretty high on my list as well ha ha ha</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this&#8221; moment:</b> I didn’t have such one yet, simply because I can imagine myself doing anything, but I precisely know when I will experience one. It will be just before I will bungee jump from the Border Bridge above Victoria Falls in Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b></b><b>Place you can&#8217;t wait to return to: </b>San Sebastian! I have felt in love with this city last summer and can’t get it out of my head. I must go again soon! It doesn’t happen to often to me. Although I have many cities I constantly return to like Tel Aviv, Madrid, Zurich, Paris, London or Oslo. San Sebastian charmed me up and I can’t stop thinking about it. What can I say? Love from the first sight <img src='http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t be paid to return to: </b>At first let me tell you, I’m awfully optimistic and easy going person so it take a lot for me to dislike any place to the level I wouldn’t travel there even when being paid. But there is one place like that, Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt! It is the worst place I have even been in my life. I went there for diving holiday with my best friend and it was the worst experience in my life, people  &#8211; men were sleazy and rude, even in the employees of supposed to be 5-star hotel were making distasteful comments about our look. After a day we have moved to the boat to avoid those situations. Even though diving was great there I will never again go back there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Any exciting trips coming up?: </b>Oh, I have many of them, my list for 2013 is really long ha ha ha But the closest one will be Georgia Armenia Azerbaijan Trio, can’t wait. I think I will love it. I always adore travels that allow me to sink into authentic atmosphere of the countries, interfere with locals and feel like in the other world, so different from jet-setting Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dream vacation:</b> That is quiet hard to decide, I’m having dream vacations all the time, every trip I go ha ha ha But to be honest, I have this dream to travel whole Africa by car, ideally with an amazing boyfriend, but if he won’t come along than alone. Like a year, totally switched off from my Europe life. I will do it one day!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite tourist attraction:</b> All modern and contemporary art museums, wherever I go, I always visit them. I’m a big modern art lover and no matter how common-touristy it is and how other travelers always claim that museums are for tourist I will keep on paying visits to those.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I&#8217;m trying not to look like a tourist&#8221; attraction:</b> I like to think about myself as a traveller, but don’t we all? Ha ha ha Sometimes you can’t avoid those touristy stuff, like a boat trip on Lago Maggiore, Bosphorus in Istanbul or the Blue Lagoon in Malta, but I kind of always mange by going with a private boats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite travel photo: </b>I have so many. I have quiet weird and quirky tastes when it comes to photography (picture of the empty chair under a tree in Almaty or two cans of Beef Luncheon Meat &#8211; Mortadel de Vaca taken on the Jewish cemetery in Fez). My weird taste is quiet hard to explain therefore I have chosen this great picture from Amman in Jordan which is more about actual travel experience. I like this picture because it is a superb memory holder and because it shows a phenomenon I love to experience. I love to travel to places where I seem to be a bigger attraction to locals than they are to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>I’m not sure when it happened, but shortly after arriving in Oahu, the hubs and I found ourselves surprisingly—and sometimes accidentally—active.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to Hawaii, I had only been on an actual hike once before. It was in Italy, it was between the five villages of Cinque Terre, and there was the promise of gelato or a glass of wine (or both) in between each trail. Other people had walking sticks, so I considered this serious hiking business (never you mind that they were all also over the age of 60.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of that, I’ve never really been able to relate to people who “go hiking.” Usually I just think “ok, but it’s like… walking, right? Because I probably walk about 10 miles a week in NYC, so I’m pretty much a hiker.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yeah, no.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hawaii, above all else, taught me that I have never really hiked before.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On our first day of driving around the North Shore of Oahu, we decided to just drive towards the mountains we saw in the distance. Eventually, we came to Ka’ena Point. I learned later that this area is very close to where many key scenes of Lost were filmed, but alas: Jack Sawyer was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9942.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9396" alt="IMG_9942" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9942-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, we learned one very important lesson: <b>always have a change of shoes.</b> One day in and we found ourselves on an accidental six mile hike, thoroughly unprepared. However, it all proved to be totally worth it—even if our feet are still kinda pissed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0019.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9398" alt="IMG_0019" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0019-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9397" alt="IMG_0005" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0005-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></span><span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">You would think this would encourage us to give our bodies a break, but instead, thanks to the </span><a style="text-align: justify; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;" href="http://www.smartdestinations.com/oahu-attractions-and-tours/_d_Hio-p1.html?pass=Hio_Prod_Go" target="_blank">Go Oahu Card,</a><span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> we spent the next day exploring Kualoa Ranch and the Anahulu River.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These cards are offered in major cities all over the US and variations can be found worldwide, so chances are, you’re pretty familiar with the concept—for $54.99 you have access to over 36 sites throughout Oahu. In some cases, I’ve found similar cards to offer access to things I’d never cared about seeing in the first place, but that was totally not the case with these cards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My one bit of advice? If you get a one-day card, pick activities that are all within driving distance of one another—or at least have easy public transit access.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4248.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9399" alt="IMG_4248" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4248-1024x678.jpg" width="614" height="407" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our self-guided kayak tour of the Anahulu River was a surprisingly relaxing way to spend an afternoon!<br />
(read: I&#8217;m paddling for show in this photo and the rest of the time the hubs did all the work.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though I loved both options, next time I would probably dedicate my card to Pearl Harbor and things in the Waikiki area that were a little more expensive. Still, this just shows how many options there are on the card&#8211;even if the touristy stuff is really not your thing, you can just rent kayaks, bikes, or mopeds and make your own fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with exploring the grounds of Kualoa, we also took a separate ATV tour of the ranch. YOU MUST DO THIS. Also, don&#8217;t be wimps like us and book the 60 minute tour&#8211;go all out and do the full two hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1965.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9400" alt="IMG_1965" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1965-1024x500.jpg" width="614" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1968.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9401" alt="IMG_1968" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1968-1024x577.jpg" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Look familiar, Lost fans?? Hurley&#8217;s golf course is just slightly to the right.<br />
Also, the hubs would like me to give him proper photo credit on the above two photos. Edited in Snapseed. He&#8217;s a regular Ansel Adams, this one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The North Shore brought out the best of us, and spending three days <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/rtw-rookies-the-north-shore-kick-off/" target="_blank">driving around</a>, windows down, put us in the perfect laid-back groove, ready to take on the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>Aloha, travelers! RTW is officially underway and somehow, magically, there are already things to recap? I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean time is flying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starting our trip in Hawaii was, honestly, one of our better ideas. We didn’t even do it intentionally—we just knew we wanted to go west, and flying direct to Fiji sounded like a terrible plan. Thus, a ten-day tour of Hawaii was born.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to our summer traipse through Costa Rica, the hubs and I hadn’t spent more than a long weekend somewhere tropical. However, our love for <a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/category/true-life-tamarindo/" target="_blank">Tamarindo</a> set something in motion, and I have to say:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>For two non-surfers, we really adapt to surf towns.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0063.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9361" alt="IMG_0063" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0063-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Immediately upon landing in Honolulu on March 1<sup>st</sup> (after a direct, 11-hour flight from NYC, my GOD), we headed to pick up our Thrifty Car Rental, as arranged for us by <a href="http://www.arguscarhire.com" target="_blank">Argus Car Hire</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9917.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9362" alt="IMG_9917" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_9917-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though renting a car can feel superfluous, I will say that it’s almost necessary to explore the North Shore and other parts of the island. You can, of course, traverse the island via public transit (<a href="http://www.thebus.org/" target="_blank">TheBus</a>, in particular), but as Honolulu is second in the world for traffic, I wouldn’t recommend it if you plan for a visit to the North Shore. We met someone at our hostel who faced a three house bus ride from Honolulu to Haleiwa immediately upon landing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yeah, no thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0065.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-9363 aligncenter" alt="IMG_0065" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0065-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">An added bonus? The access to a car led to many seriously stellar drives along the coast.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though our time in the North Shore was brief, it was easily one of my favorite parts of Hawaii. The laid-back culture and general friendliness of the locals put me immediately at ease—even our super hippie hostel situation didn’t wear on me after the first night. (I mean, our room didn’t have a door… communal living is a real stretch for me.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hawaii&#8211;and particularly the North Shore&#8211;was just enough of a change to get me out of my New York state of mind, without completely throwing me out of my comfort zone (we can thank Fiji for that, but more on that to come.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Longer isn&#8217;t always better.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With the romantic &amp; the hubs officially on their round the world journey, we got thinking about the benefits of long-term travel. In an ideal world, we&#8217;d be traveling non-stop forever and always and we&#8217;d have ample time in every place we visit. But let&#8217;s be real: most people our age have full-time jobs and lives outside of our love for travel that often take priority over long vacations and extended travel plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When it comes down to it, longer isn&#8217;t always better. A weekend getaway, no matter how short or how far, can fulfill our sense of wanderlust just as well as a week abroad.  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to us to make time for traveling on the weekends as much as we can.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And, if weekend travel isn&#8217;t enough, no matter how many trips you plan, there&#8217;s always the option of planning and saving like the romantic &amp; the hubs to make your long-term travel plans a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">xo!</p>
