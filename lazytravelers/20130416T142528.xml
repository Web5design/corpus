				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4949" alt="thewino&amp;theromanticsmallXS" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/thewinotheromanticsmallXS.jpg" width="150" height="93" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#8217;re not quite sure how to compose this next introduction, so we&#8217;ll put the fancy prose aside and just say this: if you&#8217;re looking for a New York-based attorney who also happens to excel at singing karaoke around the globe, Harvey from <a href="http://hbombkaraoke.com/" target="_blank">H-Bomb Worldwide Karaoke</a> is your guy. He&#8217;s crooned along in karaoke bars across 27 different countries (that&#8217;s a FACT), with more travel plans in the works. Read on to hear more about his song-filled adventures and how he lost a Chilean girl&#8217;s hand in marriage thanks to a lousy chess game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite Place:</b> A tie between Greece and Italy.  The reasons include the Mediterranean climate, the stunning beauty, the food, and the history dating back to classical times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>More importantly, favorite meal:</b> In Istanbul I had a dish called iskender, which consists of grilled lamb strips, chunks of bread, tomato sauce, yogurt, and melted sheep butter, all mixed together.  The taste of this dish was absolutely incredible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The moment you caught the travel bug:</b> During winter break of my senior year of university, I competed in the World Debating Championships in Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to that trip I had never been out of my native United States and had never even been on an airplane. That trip instilled in me a lifelong love of travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>First experience traveling alone:</b> Between my second and third years of law school, I took summer law courses in London and Salzburg. The program was run by a law school other than mine, so I didn&#8217;t know any of the other students beforehand.  Then, after the classes wrapped up, I spent three weeks traveling around Europe on my own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ever been (or thought you&#8217;ve been) in imminent danger while traveling?: </b>In Mexico City I was robbed by a taxi driver.  He took my smartphone and some of my money, and then he forced me to get out of the vehicle and left me in the middle of nowhere at 2 a.m.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And on Easter Island I was chased by a pack of three stray dogs in a deserted area at dusk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was the time that I only found out later of the danger I&#8217;d been in.  It happened when I was on safari in South Africa. At about midnight on my first night at the game lodge, I was hungry so I wandered out of my bungalow, hoping to find a staff member to help me out with late-night snack options.  I did end up having the kitchen make me a sandwich.  The following evening I was in the bar, having drinks with staff members.  The staffers casually mentioned that leopards and hyenas frequently roamed the lodge grounds at night, so that it wasn’t safe to leave my bungalow alone after dark. In fact, they told me that just the night before (the same night when I’d stepped out of my bungalow to search for sustenance), a leopard had been running around on the premises!  I shudder to think what would have happened if I&#8217;d encountered that leopard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Worst hotel/hostel experience:</b> Arriving in Johannesburg on a Saturday afternoon, I was exhausted and jet-lagged after having been up all night on a 15-hour flight from New York.  Normally in that situation, I will take a nap.  But when I got to my hotel, I couldn&#8217;t get to sleep because there was a wedding party staying on the same floor and they were being very loud &#8212; slamming doors, screaming, etc.  Eventually the hotel kicked out that rowdy group of guests, but the damage was done.  I ended up not being able to get to sleep until very late that night, and I had problems with insomnia, fatigue and illness for days afterward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Best hotel/hostel experience:</b> The Embassy Suites in Murfreesboro, Tennessee a couple of months ago. I&#8217;m one of those New Yorkers who doesn&#8217;t drive, my license having expired in 2011.  Getting around a town like Murfreesboro, with no mass transit and unreliable taxi service, could therefore have been difficult for me.  But the hotel&#8217;s bellhop staff volunteered to drive me all around Murfreesboro in a shuttle van that&#8217;s normally just used for airport runs and the like.  They took me everywhere from a karaoke bar to a Civil War battlefield &#8212; and didn&#8217;t charge me for any of the rides.  One of the bellhops even gave me an impromptu tour of the city, which included a stop so that I could get out and take photos in the historic downtown.  My suite in the hotel was spacious and had lots of amenities, but it was the outstanding service that really made my stay there memorable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In case you&#8217;re wondering what I was doing in a random place like Murfreesboro, I was there on official World Karaoke Tour business!  I&#8217;d heard that a local bar had a karaoke show hosted by a woman named Heather who calls herself &#8220;H-Bomb&#8221;; so I just had to fly down to Tennessee and meet this other H-Bomb.  But I digress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite family vacation:</b> My parents gave me the opportunities that enabled me to become a frequent traveler in adulthood. However, we didn&#8217;t go on any long-distance vacations when I was growing up in New Jersey. I do treasure my memories of our end-of-summer family road trips to Cape Cod and Atlantic City.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Must-have packing item:</b> I <i>wish</i> that I only had one must-have packing item!  But I can&#8217;t go anywhere without taking along all of the following: (1) laptop, (2) DSLR camera, (3) tripod for taking long-exposure photos, (4) Kindle, and (5) smartphone. And that&#8217;s without even getting into the related accessories like chargers and voltage converters.  I&#8217;m not complaining, as these devices have greatly improved the quality of my trips and my ability to document them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Most unbelievable travel experience:</b> On a flight from Santiago, Chile to Easter Island, I was seated next to a Chilean urologist and his college-aged daughter.  Among the offerings on the in-flight entertainment system was a computerized chess game that passengers could play against other passengers.  The doctor told me that I should challenge his daughter to a game of chess, and that if i won the game he would give me his daughter&#8217;s hand in marriage.  I&#8217;ll never know if he was serious, because I lost the chess match!  I swear that I was trying, but I just suck at chess. (Postscript: the father and daughter did not disembark at Easter Island; they stayed on the plane, which was continuing onward to Papeete, Tahiti.  So I never saw them again.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m doing this&#8221; moment: </b>Waking up on Easter Island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t wait to return to:</b> London. I&#8217;ve spent more time there by far than in any other foreign city, but have only been there once in the last six years as I&#8217;ve prioritized seeing places that I haven&#8217;t yet been to. But I miss London and really need to make it back there!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Place you can&#8217;t be paid to return to:</b> There&#8217;s no place I&#8217;ve visited that I wouldn&#8217;t return to. In some cases I would take greater safety precautions, but I would still go back. Every place that I&#8217;ve ever been to has had at least some good qualities.  Also, there are always things that I didn&#8217;t get around to seeing on my first visit to a particular destination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Any exciting trips coming up?:</b> Next month I&#8217;m off to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev, plus a weekend in Chisinau, Moldova. If all goes to plan, the 3 countries that I&#8217;ll be hitting on that trip will become the 28th, 29th, and 30th countries on my World Karaoke Tour. That will give me the distinction of having sung karaoke in more countries than anyone else that I know of! (There&#8217;s an Australian travel writer named Brian Thacker who&#8217;s sung in 29.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just a few days after returning from that trip, I&#8217;ll be heading to Toronto for my first-ever TBEX!  I look forward to meeting lots of my favorite travel bloggers in person for the first time there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dream vacation:</b> I want to sing karaoke in Antarctica, the only continent where I have yet to make a karaoke appearance.  So all I have to do is find a way to get to McMurdo station, a scientific base that isn&#8217;t on any cruise ship itinerary, has no hotels, and doesn&#8217;t welcome tourists (but does have a bar with regularly scheduled karaoke nights!)  Of course, getting to Antarctica from North America (or from most places) is expensive and arduous anyway.  My goal of singing there just adds another layer of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite tourist attraction:</b> Going to observation decks at the top of skyscrapers and enjoying the panoramic view of the surrounding area &#8212; especially at night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite &#8220;I&#8217;m trying not to look like a tourist&#8221; attraction:</b> One of the nice things about going to karaoke bars in foreign countries is that in most cases you don&#8217;t see other tourists, and it can be a great opportunity to meet locals (although the loud music isn&#8217;t always conducive to conversation).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also like riding local mass transit systems, and reading on my Kindle, etc., just as if I were commuting to work on the subway in Manhattan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Favorite travel photo:</b> Me on Easter Island with some of the moai.  I&#8217;ve been fortunate to see some pretty amazing things in this world, but those mysterious stone statues have to rank at the top of the list.  Seeing them was definitely worth my run-in with the killer dogs.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>It&#8217;s ok if everything goes wrong.</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Last week, the romantic broke her second camera lens cover in two weeks, snapped her favorite sunglasses completely in half, and found out her new MacBook Air is a complete and total lemon with a useless hard drive&#8230; leading to lost photos from the first two weeks of their RTW.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Clearly, any one of these things causes stress, and while you&#8217;re traveling, having them happen all at once could lead to a full blown meltdown. Instead, look at the bright side. Frustrating things are going to happen wherever you are in the world, and a bad day while traveling is still better than an ok day at work&#8230; right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>To be honest, dessert is just not the way to my heart. Flowers are better than chocolates and mozz sticks are better than cupcakes. It’s just a fact.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lucky for you, in the name of research, the hubs and I still tested out our fair share of sweets while in Oahu &amp; Kauai.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Ted’s Bakery, North Shore, Oahu</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4174.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-9671 aligncenter" alt="IMG_4174" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4174-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ah yes, another Oahu staple: Ted’s Chocolate Haupia Pie. If I am forced to eat dessert, I’ll always go pie over cake. I even tried to implement a pie bar at our wedding instead of a traditional wedding cake, but our venue was all “psh, extra $$ please” and we were all “well, cake it is!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best way I can describe this? A more solid version of a chocolate and vanilla Jello pudding cup with a yummy flaky crust and a top layer of coconut cream. Usually coconut makes me want to die (IT TASTES LIKE SUNSCREEN), but I didn’t even mind it here. It was a miracle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Shave Ice, Matsumoto’s, Haleiwa, Oahu</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wanted to like shave ice. I wanted to LOVE shave ice. I wanted it to replace Rita’s Water Ice as my summer dream treat and change my life forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps it was my absurdly high standards, but it did not do that. It did the opposite of that. And the worst part? It was my own fault.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4181.jpg"><img class="wp-image-9673 aligncenter" alt="IMG_4181" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4181-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Apparently, blue = pineapple?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let’s review:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>When picking up our rental car, our extremely helpful attendant said Matsumoto’s is the place to go, and you HAVE to get ice cream and you HAVE to get beans. Beans? Beans. Ice cream, sure. But beans?! When we placed our order, I asked about said beans… and the girl said they were sweet and frozen. I assumed they would be, like, the Hawaiian version of adding nuts or pretzels to a sundae. Just a little added crunch and maybe some salt. HA, yeah, no. They’re like… straight up burrito beans. In a beany flavored sauce. With ice cream and a snow cone on top? Does not compute.</li>
<li>Wanting to go with a tropical treat of a flavor, I picked pineapple. When it came out, it was BRIGHT BLUE. I’m sorry, mind of matter and all that, but I am physically incapable of tasting something that color and thinking “ah, yes, pineapple!” Instead, it tasted like bubblegum. Bubblegum with black beans.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, later I heard “no no, ice cream and sweet milk on top.” I think that maybe I would have liked it better this way… or at least enjoyed a different flavor and sans beans but? I don’t know. Sorry, shave ice. I don’t think it’s going to work out between us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, I kept calling it “shaved ice.” Apologies if you saw that on Instagram or Twitter and it made you twitch. The correct name was just the least of my problems, but I now know: shave ice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, Rita’s, I’ll be paying you a visit come July. It’s a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Leonard’s Bakery, Waikiki, Oahu</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’d read about Leonard’s a ton before Hawaii was even a glimmer in our eye—it’s one of the biggest things that pops up when you look into food in Oahu—and they’re most famous for their malasadas. If, like me, you have no idea what a malasada is other than a fun new word to say (especially when you elongate all the vowels… maaassaaalaaadaaaaaaa), they are basically Portuguese donuts… and they. are. heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0328.jpg"><img class="wp-image-9670 aligncenter" alt="IMG_0328" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0328-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hubs felt differently—he didn’t think they were anything particularly revolutionary. But he also finds joy in donuts of the Dunkin variety and they’re not really my jam, so to each his own. My own just happens to come in the more refined, fancy version as offered by Leonard’s. It doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m better, it just means I&#8217;m cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We got one original, which is just a big, doughy piece of heaven covered in sugar, and one malasada puff. This is confusing as they’re both puffs, really, but the ones that are specifically called puffs are filled with happiness. There are a few flavor options, and we decided to go with dobash… don&#8217;t be scared, it&#8217;s just fancy speak for chocolate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Kountry Kitchen, Kapaa, Kauai</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we first arrived in Hawaii, we saw macadamia nuts all over the place. I knew they’d be at the top of the hubs’s list of things to try, as macadamia nut cookies are his fave. I, on the other hand, could take or leave that nonsense. I&#8217;m actually starting to think that maybe my indifference to sweets stems from the fact that the hubs and I like ZERO of the same kind of treats?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ANYWAY, upon landing in Kauai, we took our ravenous selves to Kountry Kitchen in Kapaa (owned by Kris Kardashian) (I KID) (see what I did there?) (travel fatigue may be kicking in) (ok, I’m done). Macadamia nut pancakes called out to the hubs like a beacon from heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4263.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9674" alt="IMG_4263" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4263-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center">Why hello, pancake the size of the moon!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, first of all, at our table was a bottle of coconut syrup. Seriously, I don’t know what happened to me but I also found this delicious!! Maybe my coconut-hating days are over? I don’t know, but these pancakes + that syrup = giant cookie from above. My eggs were a giant disappoint in comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All in all? Thanks for the pleasant food surprises, Hawaii! You’re ok in my book, and someday I’ll be back to do shave ice RIGHT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-101" alt="romantic" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/romantic1-150x150.jpg" width="90" height="90" /></a>As we counted down to our ten day tour of Hawaii, I was surprised by how little I concerned myself with what we&#8217;d be eating. Usually, this is my #1 travel priority, but for some reason, I brushed Hawaii&#8217;s culinary options off from the start.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To be honest, I just figured it’d be a lot of expensive seafood and familiar “high-end” chain restaurants that two backpackers would never be able to afford. In Waikiki, that was pretty much spot on. However, one thing I didn’t expect? The plethora of budget-friendly food trucks and roadside stands with seriously delish offerings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Giovanni’s Shrimp Truck, North Shore, Oahu</b><b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you ask around the North Shore for recommendations on where to eat, shrimp trucks are usually at the top of the list—especially for lunch. Apparently, these trucks have popped up over the years and you get a plate of garlic shrimp and two scoops of rice. We later learned that this is a Hawaiian standard and referred to by shrimp trucks and cafes alike as a “plate lunch.” We did our research and decided that if we were going to try a shrimp truck, we were going to try THE shrimp truck.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1935.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9660" alt="IMG_1935" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_1935-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Giovanni’s is, apparently, the very first shrimp truck to ever exist in all the land… or at least on the island of Oahu. Once this little mobile establishment took off, billions popped up all over the place—but most people will insist that Giovanni’s is still the best.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4173.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9659" alt="IMG_4173" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4173-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">We didn’t try any other shrimp trucks, but we can’t imagine anything being better than this: garlic shrimp with garlic on top of garlic stuffed with garlic. Limited smooching after this lunch.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Kono’s Big Wave Cafe, Haleiwa, Oahu</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4254.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9665" alt="IMG_4254" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4254-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About four years ago, I read way too much about the US farming industry and decided I wanted to seriously cut back on my meat intake. As it’s a complicated and divisive issue, I don’t feel the need to get into it here, but I made a few simple changes to my diet, including the elimination of pork.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, it was super easy. I’m not a huge fan of bacon (blasphemy, I know), and I never really cooked pork at home. However, it was when we were traveling that I faced a new dilemma. I didn’t want to miss out on cultural experiences, and I wasn’t looking to go completely veggie. I soon decided that, if we were visiting a country where pork was a main food focus, I wouldn’t give up the chance to experience something important to the local culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kono’s was my time to try Kalua pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4253.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9664" alt="IMG_4253" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4253-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="center">Like all of our meals, the hubs and I split the Old Fashioned BBQ Pork Sandwich. It was sooo good. The sauce, the slaw, the bread. Everything. This was the only pork we ate while in Hawaii, and even though my tum was a little confused, I’m pretty ok with breaking my pig-free streak for this (if not still feeling just a little guilty).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Ahi Poke, Everywhere</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you eat one thing and only one thing in all of Hawaii, eat poke (pronounced poke-ey). You can get it at all over the place, but we were told time and again that the little markets around the islands were the #1 place for poke.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>POKE #1: Kahuru Superette, North Shore, Oahu</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4178.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9662" alt="IMG_4178" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4178-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our first poke experience took us to Kahuru Superette in Oahu. If I had gone into this place elsewhere, I would have laughed, turned right around, and walked back out the door. It wasn’t particularly… clean. Flies buzzed around, all the groceries looked a little dusty, and the fear of food poisoning lurked around every corner. However, reviews and locals said this was the best, so we put away our reservations and gave it a try.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4180.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9663" alt="IMG_4180" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4180-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Shoyu Poke was the owner’s recommendation—as handwritten everywhere on neon orange signs—so we went with that. The hubs was a bigger fan than me, but by no fault of the poke. I’m just not that into soy sauce in large quantities. The tuna itself was top notch and I loved the addition of scallions, sesame seeds, and warm white rice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>POKE #2: Pono Market, Kapaa, Kauai</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4475.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-9666" alt="IMG_4475" src="http://thelazytravelers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4475-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The hubs was against this one from the beginning because he was worried it was mayo-based, and he has a fear of mayo. Wimp. Personally, I thought that was about one bajillion times better than the shoyu, and only wished that I had asked for rice as well. The sauce also reminded me less of mayo and more of what you find in spicy tuna rolls (which we also got from Pono, SO GOOD). Still, the hubs is a texture eater and he decided the shoyu was more up his alley.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though I expected to declare one island the poke winner, these were each so different and the hubs and I both liked them for different reasons, so I just can’t! Man, is diplomacy a sign of growing up?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you noticed that Oahu is better represented here, you would be correct. Our room in Kauai had its own little kitchenette area. This meant a lot of super low-budget meals at home, which was surprisingly nice. One notable was huli huli chicken from the local grocery store, but it wasn’t much different from the roasted chickens you see at stores on the mainland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next up: the sweets to our savories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xo!</p>
