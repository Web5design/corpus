				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Centrica has struck a £10bn gas supply deal that could see US shale gas heating British homes by 2018.</strong></p>
<p>Centrica said the 20-year deal with Cheniere Energy Partners would allow it to export enough liquefied natural gas from the US to supply 1.8m British homes each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This landmark agreement represents a significant step forward in our strategy, enabling Centrica to strengthen its position along the gas value chain and helping to ensure the UK&#8217;s future energy security,&#8221; said Sam Laidlaw, Centrica&#8217;s chief executive.</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the deal, claiming: &#8220;Future gas supplies from the US will help diversify our energy mix and provide British consumers with a new long-term, secure and affordable source of fuel.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Centrica is under no obligation to sell the gas to the UK and analysts said that at current market prices it would be more likely to deliver the gas to Asian markets, where prices are higher.</p>
<p>With the first shipments not due from the Louisiana-based plant until 2018, the deal will do nothing to relieve the current strained gas supplies caused by a colder than expected winter.</p>
<p>A faulty pump at the Interconnector, one of Britain&#8217;s main gas pipelines, caused an eight hour shutdown last Friday. The closure led to a 50pc spike in gas prices, and analysts warned that higher energy bills for consumers or even gas rationing for big businesses were possibilities if the cold weather continued.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Japanese scientists have found vast reserves of rare earth metals on the Pacific seabed that can be mined cheaply, a discovery that may break the Chinese monopoly on a crucial raw material needed in hi-tech industries and advanced weapons systems.</h2>
<div>
<div id="mainBodyArea">
<div>
<p>&#8220;We have found deposits that are just two to four meters from the seabed surface at higher concentrations than anybody ever thought existed, and it won&#8217;t cost much at all to extract,&#8221; said professor Yasuhiro Kato from Tokyo University, the leader of the team.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>While America, Australia, and other countries have begun to crank up production of the seventeen rare earth elements, they have yet to find viable amounts of the heavier metals such as dysprosium, terbium, europium, and ytterbium that are most important.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>China has a near total monopoly in the heavier end of the spectrum, though it is also the dominant supplier of the whole rare earth complex after driving rivals out of business in the 1990s. It still accounts for 97pc of global supply.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Beijing shocked the world when it suddenly began to restrict exports in 2009, prompting furious protests and legal complaints by both the US and the EU at the World Trade Organisation. China claimed that it was clamping down on smuggling and environmental abuse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;Their real intention is to force foreign companies to locate plant in China. They&#8217;re saying `if you want our rare earth metals, you must build your factory here, and we can then steal your technology,&#8221; said professor Kato.</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8236899/Japan-creates-synthetic-version-of-rare-earth-metal-palladium.html"><img alt="" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02518/japan_2518670a.jpg" width="322" height="194" name="japan" /></a></div>
<div id="tmg-related-links" style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #888888;"><sup style="color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;">Yasuhiro Kato, an associate professor of earth science at the University of Tokyo, displays a mud sample extracted from the depths of about 4,000 metres (13,123 ft) below the Pacific ocean surface where rare earth elements were found. – Reuters</sup></span></div>
<div>
<p>The team of scientists from Japan&#8217;s Agency for Marine-Earth Science and the University of Tokyo first discovered huge reserves in the mid-Pacific two years ago. These are now thought to be 1000 times all land-based deposits, some of it in French waters around Tahiti.</p>
<p>The latest discovery is in Japan&#8217;s Exclusive Economic Zone in deep-sea mud around the island of Minami-Torishima at 5,700 meters below sea level. Although it is very deep, the deposits are in highly-concentrated nodules that can be extracted using pressurised air with minimal disturbance off the seafloor and no need for the leaching.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02518/japan-rare-earth_2518676e.jpg" width="300" height="320" name="japan-rare-earth" align="right" /></p>
<p>Professor Kato said exploration will continue for another two years before scaling up towards production. Over 50pc of the metal in the deposit is the heavier end of the spectrum, twice the level of China&#8217;s key mines and without the radioactive by-product thorium that makes the metals so hard to mine.</p>
<p>Japan consumes half the world&#8217;s rare earth metals in its cars, electronics, and environmental industries, and has accused China of withholding supplies as a pressure tool. The country has been scrambling to find other sources under its &#8220;Strategy for Ensuring Stable Supplies of Rare Metals&#8221;, but a joint venture in Vietnam that once looked promising has so far yielded only lighter rare earths.</p>
<p>Professor Kato said a single ship drilling in the target zone at Minami-Torishima could supply Japan&#8217;s needs for a year, breaking strategic dependence at minimal cost. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need to mine it intensively. All we need is enough to force China to lower its prices.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Met Office 3-Month Outlook 20 December 2012:</strong> For January as a whole below-average UK-mean temperatures are somewhat more likely than above-average, although there is considerable uncertainty. Similarly, snow and ice may occur more often than they do in an average January.</p>
<p>For February and March the range of possible outcomes is also very broad, although above-average UK-mean temperatures become more likely.</p>
<p>Overall, the probability that the UK-mean temperature for January-February-March will fall into the coldest of our five categories is around 15% whilst the probability that it will fall into the warmest of our five categories is around 20% (the 1981-2010 probability for each of these categories is 20%).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It is time for the Coalition to tear up its energy policy before the lights go out. The first priority must be to repeal the Climate Change Act of 2008.</strong></p>
<p>With the worst snow conditions in the country since 1981, it’s worrying, to say the least, that gas supplies are running low. A month ago, The Sunday Telegraph warned in this column of the problems of an energy policy that puts expensive, inefficient green power before coal-fired and nuclear power. There have been a few signs that the Coalition is at last turning its attentions to the issue but, still, not nearly enough has been done. Now we are reaping the consequences. Because of a misguided faith in green energy, we have left ourselves far too dependent on foreign gas supplies, largely provided by Russian and Middle Eastern producers. Only 45 per cent of our gas consumption comes from domestic sources. All it takes is a spell of bad weather, and the closure of a gas pipeline from Belgium, to leave us dangerously exposed, and to send gas prices soaring. Talk of rationing may be exaggerated, but our energy policy is failing to deal with Britain’s fundamental incapacity to produce our own power.</p>
<p>Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, may have granted planning permission this week to a new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point in Somerset. But one nuclear power station, with two new reactors, isn’t nearly enough. Moreover, it will take a decade to build and, even then, will only provide seven per cent of the country’s energy needs.</p>
<p>It is time for the Coalition to tear up its energy policy before the lights really do go out. The first priority must be to repeal the Climate Change Act of 2008, with its brutal, punishing targets: reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, and 26 per cent by 2020. These targets have already had a disastrous effect, forcing the closure of coal-fired power stations, and increasing tax-funded subsidies on wind power. Next month, electricity bills will soar even higher, thanks to a new tax on carbon dioxide produced by coal-fired and gas-fired power stations.</p>
<p>There are good intentions behind a green energy policy, and no one would wilfully want to damage the environment. But green technology – in its current incarnation, anyway – is just too inefficient and expensive to meet our energy needs. In some of the worst weather for more than 30 years, green power still only provides a tiny fraction of our energy needs. Solar power is of limited use in our cold, dark, northern climate. And wind power isn’t much better – cold weather doesn’t necessarily mean windy weather.</p>
<p>At last, the Coalition – or the Conservative part of it, anyway – is beginning to recognise these painfully obvious truths. In this week’s Budget, the Chancellor backed the policy of domestic fracking – the extraction of shale gas – with the promise of tax breaks for companies involved in the industry. He will know that American gas prices have plummeted, thanks to the US embracing the shale gas revolution. Britain must do the same. George Osborne also announced in the Budget that ceramics businesses would be exempt from the Climate Change Levy on energy costs. By making that exemption, he is acknowledging that green taxes are a significant drag on industry. He should make the exemption universal.</p>
<p>Our energy problems have been deepened by the greener-than-green Liberal Democrats, with their seeming stranglehold on the Cabinet post of Energy Secretary. When Chris Huhne took on the job in 2010, he swore Britain would become more independent of energy imports. Yet the country remains just as dependent, and Huhne’s Liberal Democrat colleague, Ed Davey, is still wedded to green power. Last year, he publicly slapped down his junior Tory energy minister, John Hayes, for calling for an end to more wind farms.</p>
<p>There is some good news, however. As we report today, government sources have said that wind power subsidies are to be cut again. This is a move in the right direction and we very much welcome it. It is to be hoped that there will be more such announcements, and concrete actions, from a government that has neglected a fundamental duty – to keep the lights on, energy affordable and our houses warm.</p>

<p>Director general Michelle Mitchell said: &#8216;Colder, harsher winters tend to lead to an increase in life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks and strokes which in turn leads to a high rate of excess winter deaths.</p>
<p>&#8216;For every one degree drop in average temperature, there are around 8,000 extra deaths.&#8217;</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Office for National Statistics said the extra death rate &#8216;could be to do with the prolonged period of cold weather we&#8217;ve been experiencing.&#8217; But it cautioned that it was too early to make an absolute link. The March figures are still provisional.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Malcolm Booth, chief executive of the National Federation of Occupational Pensioners, said that last month almost 700 of his members had died, compared with 250 last year.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8216;If our membership is a representative sample that was replicated across the general population, then we could be looking at a horrendous number when all the figures are in,&#8217; he said.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can we stop weather hyperbole? I am so staggeringly bored of waking up each morning to headlines which insist we’re all going to be killed – on the roads, or through freezing to death, or in a flood. There have been four weather hyperboles already so far this year; warmest January, or warmest day in January ever, wettest February, coldest March. There are so many criteria for awarding a hyperbole sticker that almost every day of the year could qualify. So, snow in March? An unheard of experience? Nope, it happens every other year, more or less – and that’s in the south of the country. Last year at this time we were just entering a very mild and rather pleasant phase – warmest April on record! Global warming! We’re all going to die!</p>
<p>There’s been nothing remotely strange about the weather this week or for that matter any week I can remember. I do recall one year – I think it was 1971 – when, up in Middlesbrough, we had a snowfall in every month from October to June. But that was interesting, or odd, only in a statistical sense. I suppose weather hyperbole enables journos to write long articles entitled: why are we experiencing such extreme weather phenomena? We’re not, though. You’re just writing about it more. And I suppose, as a consequence, I am too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“God Almighty has a quarrel lately with all Mankind,” lamented the Welsh historian James Howell in 1647, “for within these 12 years there have been the strangest Revolutions and horridest things happened, not only in Europe but all the world over.” The world, he thought, was “off the hinges”. He was not alone. As civil strife raged in the British Isles, rebellion tore holes in the empires of the Ming and the Ottomans, and central Europe bled in the Thirty Years’ War, other commentators sank into despair. Every day, recorded the Oxford scholar Robert ­Burton in 1638, brought news of “war, plagues, fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets, spectrums, prodigies, apparitions; of towns taken, cities besieged in France, ­Germany, Turky [sic], Persia, Poland etc”. Four years later, a Spanish tract suggested a terrifying but increasingly popular explanation: “This seems to be one of the epochs in which every nation is turned upside down, leading some great minds to suspect that we are now approaching the end of the world.”</p>
<p>For decades, historians havebeen gripped by the extraordinary ­agonies of the 17th century, from the civil wars in Britain and Ireland and the ­terrible ­suffering of war-torn Germany to the ­collapse of China’s Ming dynastyand the dismemberment of the hugePolish-­Lithuanian commonwealth. Eric ­Hobsbawm, probably the first historian to argue that there had been a worldwide “general crisis”, insisted that the causes were economic. By contrast, Hugh ­Trevor-Roper diagnosed a wider social breakdown, based on the conflict between court and country and driven by radical intellectual energy.</p>
<p>Now a third brilliant historian, the American-based British scholar Geoffrey Parker, has thrown a new element into the mix. In this vast, superbly researched and utterly engrossing book, Parker shows how climate change pushed the world towards chaos. This was, after all, the Little Ice Age, in which temperatures dipped across the world. The data, he insists, are “clear and consistent”, and he thinks the crisis began in the last years of the 1610s, at around the time of the outbreak of Europe’s Thirty Years’ War. Snow fell in subtropical Japan; sub-Saharan Africa suffered a five-year drought; the rivers of modern Mexico and Virginia dried up; and across Europe, harvests failed and thousands starved.</p>
<p>But this was merely a taste of what was to come. The first months of 1621 were so cold that people walked across the frozen Bosphorus from ­Constantinople to Asia. In the early 1640s, violent winds and rain destroyed harvests across northern Europe, and in Germany soldiers reported seeing people frozen to death on the roads. England lost its king and the Peace of Westphalia brought the Thirty Years’ War to an end, but still the winds blew cold. Winters between 1654 and 1667 were, on average, more than 1C cooler than they are today. Indeed, throughout the second half of the century, the world was literally a colder place, as well as an emptier one. In China, Poland, Russia and the Ottoman Empire, the population fell by about a third, while in some parts of Germany the population fell by half. In 1651, Thomas Hobbes warned that without a strong state, life would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short”. For many people, it was like that already.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>An obsession with CO2 has left us dangerously short of power as coal-powered stations are forced to close</h2>
<div>
<div id="mainBodyArea">
<div>
<p>As the snow of the coldest March since 1963 continues to fall, we learn that we have barely 48 hours’ worth of stored gas left to keep us warm, and that the head of our second-largest electricity company, SSE, has warned that our generating capacity has fallen so low that we can expect power cuts to begin at any time. It seems the perfect storm is upon us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The grotesque mishandling of Britain’s energy policy by the politicians of all parties, as they chase their childish chimeras of CO2-induced global warming and windmills, has been arguably the greatest act of political irresponsibility in our history.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Three more events last week brought home again just what a mad bubble of make-believe these people are living in. Under the EU’s Large Combustion Plants Directive, we lost two more major coal-fired power stations, Didcot A and Cockenzie, capable of contributing no less than a tenth to our average electricity demands. We saw a French state-owned company, EDF, being given planning permission to spend £14 billion on two new nuclear reactors in Somerset, but which it says it will only build, for completion in 10 years’ time, if it is guaranteed a subsidy that will double the price of its electricity. Then, hidden in the small print of the Budget, were new figures for the fast-escalating tax the Government introduces next week on every ton of CO2 emitted by fossil-fuel-powered stations, which will soon be adding billions of pounds more to our electricity bills every year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Within seven years this new tax will rise to £30 a ton, and by 2030 to £70 a ton, making it wholly uneconomical to generate any more electricity from the coal and gas-fired power stations that last week were still supplying two thirds of our electricity. Put all this together and we see more starkly than ever the game the Government is playing. It knows that no company would build wind farms unless it is given subsidies that, in effect, nearly double or treble the price of its electricity.</p>
<p>The Government will only get CO2-free nuclear power if it promises it an equal subsidy. And now the Coalition is also hell-bent on driving our much cheaper and more reliable coal and gas-fired plants out of business, by imposing a carbon tax that will not only eventually double the cost of their electricity, but also make it impossible for them to survive. So mad is this policy of “double-up all round” that it is driving even the largest and most efficient power station in the country, Drax, capable of supplying seven per cent of all the power we use, to switch from burning coal to wood chips, imported 3,000 miles across the Atlantic from the US. And how has the Government forced Drax to do this? By giving it a subsidy on wood chips that doubles the value of its electricity, while putting an increasingly prohibitive tax on coal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is all insane in so many ways that one scarcely knows where to begin, except to point out that, even if our rulers somehow managed to subsidise firms into spending £100 billion on all those wind farms they dream of, they will still need enough new gas-fired power stations to provide back-up for all the times when the wind isn’t blowing, at the very time when the carbon tax will soon make it uneconomical for anyone to build them.</p>
<p>So we are doomed to see Britain’s lights going out, all because the feather-headed lunatics in charge of our energy policy still believe that they’ve got to do something to save the planet from that CO2-induced global warming which this weekend has been covering much of the country up to a foot deep in snow. Meanwhile, the Indians are planning to build 455 new coal-fired power stations which will add more CO2 to the atmosphere of the planet every week than Britain emits in a year.</p>
