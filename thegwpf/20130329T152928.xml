				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>DEBATE about the reality of a two-decade pause in global warming and what it means has made its way from the sceptical fringe to the mainstream.</strong></p>
<p>In a lengthy article this week, The Economist magazine said if climate scientists were credit-rating agencies, then climate sensitivity &#8211; the way climate reacts to changes in carbon-dioxide levels &#8211; would be on negative watch but not yet downgraded.</p>
<p>Another paper published by leading climate scientist James Hansen, the head of NASA&#8217;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, says the lower than expected temperature rise between 2000 and the present could be explained by increased emissions from burning coal.</p>
<p>For Hansen the pause is a fact, but it&#8217;s good news that probably won&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chairman Rajendra Pachauri recently told The Weekend Australian the hiatus would have to last 30 to 40 years &#8220;at least&#8221; to break the long-term warming trend.</p>
<p>But the fact that global surface temperatures have not followed the expected global warming pattern is now widely accepted.</p>
<p>Research by Ed Hawkins of University of Reading shows surface temperatures since 2005 are already at the low end of the range projections derived from 20 climate models and if they remain flat, they will fall outside the models&#8217; range within a few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The global temperature standstill shows that climate models are diverging from observations,&#8221; says David Whitehouse of the Global Warming Policy Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have not passed it already, we are on the threshold of global observations becoming incompatible with the consensus theory of climate change,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Whitehouse argues that whatever has happened to make temperatures remain constant requires an explanation because the pause in temperature rise has occurred despite a sharp increase in global carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The Economist says the world has added roughly 100 billion tonnes of carbon to the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010, about one-quarter of all the carbon dioxide put there by humans since 1750. This mismatch between rising greenhouse gas emissions and not-rising temperatures is among the biggest puzzles in climate science just now, The Economist article says.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it does not mean global warming is a delusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact is temperatures between 2000 and 2010 are still almost 1C above their level in the first decade of the 20th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mismatch might mean that for some unexplained reason there has been a temporary lag between more carbon dioxide and higher temperatures in 2000-2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or it might mean that the 1990s, when temperatures were rising fast, was the anomalous period.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magazine explores a range of possible explanations including higher emissions of sulphur dioxide, the little understood impact of clouds and the circulation of heat into the deep ocean.</p>
<p>But it also points to an increasing body of research that suggests it may be that climate is responding to higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide in ways that had not been properly understood before.</p>
<p>&#8220;This possibility, if true, could have profound significance both for climate science and for environmental and social policy,&#8221; the article says.</p>
<p>There are now a number of studies that predict future temperature rises as a result of man-made carbon dioxide emissions at well below the IPCC best estimate of about 3C over the century.</p>
<p>The upcoming IPCC report is expected to lift the maximum possible temperature increase to 6C.</p>
<p>The Research Council of Norway says in a non-peer-reviewed paper that the best estimate concludes there is a 90 per cent probability that doubling CO2 emissions will increase temperatures by only 1.2C to 2.9C, the most likely figure being 1.9C.</p>
<p>Another study based on the way the climate behaved about 20,000 years ago has given a best guess of 2.3C.</p>
<p>Other forecasts, accepted for publication, have reanalysed work cited by the IPCC but taken account of more recent temperature data and given a figure of between 1C and 3C.</p>
<p>The Economist says understanding which estimate is true is vital to getting the best response.</p>
<p>&#8220;If as conventional wisdom has it, global temperatures could rise by 3C or more in response to a doubling of emissions, then the correct response would be the one to which most of the world pays lip service; rein in the warming and the greenhouse gases causing it,&#8221; the article says.</p>
<p>&#8220;If, however, temperatures are likely to rise by only 2 degrees Celsius in response to a doubling of carbon emissions (and if the likelihood of a 6 degrees Celsius is trivial) the calculation might change,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the world should seek to adjust to (rather than stop) the greenhouse-gas splurge.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no point buying earthquake insurance if you don&#8217;t live in an earthquake zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to The Economist, &#8220;given the hiatus in warming and all the new evidence, a small reduction in estimates of climate sensitivity would seem to be justified.&#8221; On face value, Hansen agrees the slowdown in global temperature rises can be seen as &#8220;good news&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he is not ready to recalculate the Faustian bargain that weighs the future cost to humanity of continued carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>Hansen argues that the impact of human carbon dioxide emissions has been masked by the sharp increase in coal use, primarily in China and India.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Met Office&#8217;s temperature forecasts issued in <strong>12 out of the last 13 years </strong>have been too warm.  None of the forecasts issued ended up too cold.  That makes the errors systemic and significant.</strong></p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #800000;" data-mce-mark="1">Met Office 2008 Forecast:</span> Trend of Mild Winters Continues</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080925.html">Met Office, 25 September 2008</a>: The Met Office forecast for the coming winter suggests it is, once again, likely to be milder than average. It is also likely that the coming winter will be drier than last year.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Reality Check:</span> Winter of 2008/09 Coldest Winter For A Decade</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/2009/winter.html">Met Office, March 2009</a>: Mean temperatures over the UK were 1.1 °C below the 1971-2000 average during December, 0.5 °C below average during January and 0.2 °C above average during February. The UK mean temperature for the winter was 3.2 °C, which is 0.5 °C below average, making it the coldest winter since 1996/97 (also 3.2 °C).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #800000;" data-mce-mark="1">Met Office 2009 Forecast:</span> Trend To Milder Winters To Continue, Snow And Frost Becoming Less Of A Feature</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2009/pr20090225.html">Met Office, 25 February 2009</a>: Peter Stott, Climate Scientist at the Met Office, said: “Despite the cold winter this year, the trend to milder and wetter winters is expected to continue, with snow and frost becoming less of a feature in the future. <strong><em>“The famously cold winter of 1962/63 is now expected to occur about once every 1,000 years or more, compared with approximately every 100 to 200 years before 1850.”</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Reality Check:</span> Winter Of 2009/10 Coldest Winter For Over 30 Years</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2010/pr20100301.html">Met Office, 1 March 2010</a>: Provisional figures from the Met Office show that the UK winter has been the coldest since 1978/79. The mean UK temperature was 1.5 °C, the lowest since 1978/79 when it was 1.2 °C.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #800000;" data-mce-mark="1">Met Office July 2010:</span> Climate Change Gradually But Steadily Reducing Probability Of Severe Winters In The UK</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/215087">Ross Clark, Daily Express, 3 December 2010</a>: ONE of the first tasks for the team conducting the Department for Transport’s “urgent review” into the inability of our transport system to cope with snow and ice will be to interview the cocky public figure who assured breakfast TV viewers last month that “I am pretty confident we will be OK” at keeping Britain moving this winter. They were uttered by Transport secretary Philip Hammond himself, who just a fortnight later is already being forced to eat humble pie… If you want a laugh I recommend reading the Resilience Of England’s Transport Systems In Winter, an interim report by the DfT published last July. It is shockingly complacent. Rather than look for solutions to snow-induced gridlock the authors seem intent on avoiding the issue. <strong><em>The Met Office assured them “the effect of climate change is to gradually but steadily reduce the probability of severe winters in the UK”.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #800000;" data-mce-mark="1">Met Office 2010 Forecast:</span> Winter To Be Mild Predicts Met Office</strong></h2>

The Met Office, using data generated by a £33million supercomputer, claims Britain can stop worrying about a big freeze this year because we could be in for a milder winter than in past years… The new figures, which show a 60 per cent to 80 per cent chance of warmer-than-average temperatures this winter, were ridiculed last night by independent forecasters. The latest data comes in the form of a December to February temperature map on the Met Office’s website.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-mark="1">Reality Check:</span> December 2010 “Almost Certain” To Be Coldest Since Records Began</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coldest-december-on-record-puts-brakes-on-start-of-the-big-getaway-2163615.html">The Independent, 18 December 2010</a>: December 2010 is “almost certain” to be the coldest since records began in 1910, according to the Met Office.</p>
<p><strong>Met Office Predicted A Warm Winter. Cheers Guys</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/john-walsh/john-walsh-met-office-predicted-a-warm-winter-cheers-guys-1871928.html">John Walsh, The Independent, 19 January 2010</a>: Some climatologists hint that the Office’s problem is political; its computer model of future weather behaviour habitually feeds in government-backed assumptions about climate change that aren’t borne out by the facts. To the Met Office, the weather’s always warmer than it really is, because it’s expecting it to be, because it expects climate change to wreak its stealthy havoc. If it really has had its thumb on the scales for the last decade, I’m afraid it deserves to be shown the door.</p>

<h2><strong>BBC Analysis: A Frozen Britain Turns The Heat Up On The Met Office</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulhudson/2010/01/a-frozen-britain-turns-the-hea.shtml">Paul Hudson, BBC Weather, 9 January 2010: </a>Which begs other, rather important questions. Could the model, seemingly with an inability to predict colder seasons, have developed a warm bias, after such a long period of milder than average years? Experts I have spoken to tell me that this certainly is possible with such computer models. And if this is the case, what are the implications for the Hadley centre’s predictions for future global temperatures? Could they be affected by such a warm bias? If global temperatures were to fall in years to come would the computer model be capable of forecasting this?</p>

<h2><strong>A Period Of Humility And Silence Would Be Best For Met Office</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/dominic_lawson/article6982310.ece">Dominic Lawson, The Sunday Times, 10 January 2010</a>: A period of humility and even silence would be particularly welcome from the Met Office, our leading institutional advocate of the perils of man-made global warming, which had promised a “barbecue summer” in 2009 and one of the “warmest winters on record”. In fact, the Met still asserts we are in the midst of an unusually warm winter — as one of its staffers sniffily protested in an internet posting to a newspaper last week: “This will be the warmest winter in living memory, the data has already been recorded. For your information, we take the highest 15 readings between November and March and then produce an average. As November was a very seasonally warm month, then all the data will come from those readings.”</p>

But all the errors are on the warm side, with none of the forecasts that have been issued in the last 12 years ending up too cold.  And, in my opinion, that makes the error significant.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>David Cameron’s new energy minister has attacked an “absurd” new green tax brought in by the Coalition for wasting people’s money.</strong></p>
<p>In a meeting with business leaders, Michael Fallon laid into the Treasury’s Carbon Floor Price, which will start driving up the price of electricity for households and businesses from Monday.</p>
<p>Official figures suggest it will add around £5 to energy bills this year and about £50 a year by 2020.</p>
<p>On top of this, the taxpayer will have to give £150 million in compensation to factories that could be put out of business by the high costs of the levy – the equivalent of £6 per household.</p>
<p>Mr Fallon, a business minister who was yesterday given extra responsibility for energy, suggested this situation was &#8220;absurd&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the Centre for Policy Studies event last month, he said everyone “would have to pay” for the unintended consequences of the tax.</p>
<p>A recording obtained by the Telegraph shows he told businesses: “We’ve inherited this Carbon Floor and I am now to find, thanks to the Treasury, over £150 million to design a compensation scheme for energy-intensive industries precisely to compensate from this arrangement which we’ve inherited from our predecessors.</p>
<p>“This is a fairly absurd waste of your money, this situation we’re now in. Governments intervene in markets they don’t understand and there are consequences and we all have to pay for those consequences.”</p>
<p>The introduction of the Carbon Floor Price was a Conservative policy championed in the party&#8217;s election manifesto, the Coalition agreement and this year&#8217;s mid-term review .</p>
<p>The point of the tax is to persuade energy companies to produce their electricity from green sources, like wind power and nuclear plants, rather than high-carbon fossil fuels.</p>
<p>At the moment, industrial companies in Europe have to buy a permit for every tonne of carbon dioxide they produce under the EU emissions trading scheme.</p>
<p>However, the Treasury is going one step further with an extra supplementary tax per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted.</p>
<p>Energy companies will not swallow the extra costs of the Carbon Floor Price themselves, but will pass them on to households and businesses through electricity bills.</p>
<p>Because the tax only applies to British companies, there are fears that heavy industry will leave the UK and move abroad.</p>
<p>This is why ministers have announced their £150 million scheme to subsidise the energy bills of some factories that are in danger of being put out of business.</p>
<p>Asked whether Mr Fallon now backs the Carbon Floor Price, a spokesman for the Department of Energy said that he “wants Britain to lead the way to a low carbon economy whilst making sure that the UK&#8217;s energy intensive industries remain competitive”.</p>
<p>Caroline Flint, Labour&#8217;s shadow energy secretary, said it is a &#8220;huge embarrassment for David Cameron that the man he has just appointed as energy minister is criticising his own energy policy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse still, Michael Fallon does not even seem to realise that the Carbon Price Floor was a Tory manifesto pledge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Michael Fallon needs to make clear whether he still thinks the policy he is now in charge of is an &#8216;absurd waste of your money&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img id="5982201" title="" alt="Unconventional energy supply to triple by 2030: BP" src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/attachement/jpg/site1/20130329/f04da2db112212bf20a709.jpg" align="center" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;"><strong>A natural gas facility in Puyang, Henan province. China is expected tobenefit from US exports of shale oil and shale gas due to their impact onglobal energy prices. Hu Qingming / For China Daily</strong></span></p>
<p>Global energy demand will rise 36 percent by 2030 compared with 2011 with almost all of the growth coming from emerging economies, it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unconventional sources &#8211; shale gas and light oil together with heavy oil and biofuels &#8211; will play an increasingly important role and transform the energy balance of the United States,&#8221; said Zhang Chi, head of the Asian economics department at BP.</p>
<p>Growing production from unconventional sources is expected to contribute more than 70percent of the net growth of the global oil supply by 2030.</p>
<p>Increasing production and weaker demand will result in the US being 99 percent self-sufficient in net energy by 2030, while it was only 70 percent self-sufficient in 2005.</p>
<p>And although the US is the biggest beneficiary of the shale gas &#8220;revolution&#8221;, China will benefit from it to some extent, experts said.</p>
<p>Exports of US shale oil and shale gas will help cap international oil prices, which is good news for oil importers, said David Robinson, senior research fellow with the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.</p>
<p>He told China Daily on Thursday that because the geological conditions of US shale gas blocks are favorable, shale gas companies there will be able to adjust their production plans according to international crude oil price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Christopher Allsopp, director of the institute, said, &#8220;The increasing shale gas supply from the US cannot promise cheap energy, but it has its impact on the natural gas pricing mechanism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natural gas prices in Asia are now linked to international crude oil prices, but that link is set to blur as natural gas is more likely to be priced, as in other markets, on supply and demand, he said.</p>
<p>For China, the increasing output of US shale gas has given the country a bigger say during talks with Russian natural gas suppliers, said Keun-Wook Paik, another senior research fellow at the institute.</p>

<p>The poor Easter Bunny deserves our sympathy. Whereas in recent years he has grown used to dodging daffodils, lilies and tulips as he carries his cargo of eggs and chocolate to homes across northern Europe, this year the rabbit will find himself confronted with ice slicks, snow drifts and bundled up humans in foul moods.</p>
<p>Easter, after all, may be upon us. But spring weather most definitely is not. Biologists are warning that the Easter Bunny&#8217;s wild brethren, European hares, are having trouble keeping their broods warm and healthy in the unseasonable chill. Meteorologists are keeping close tabs on thermometers to determine whether this March will go down as the coldest ever &#8212; since records began in the 1880s. And wiseacres on the streets of Berlin have not yet tired of noting that Easter promises to be colder than last Christmas.And it&#8217;s not just the northern regions of Continental Europe where the Easter Bunny will encounter problems. Great Britain and Ireland are likewise suffering through unseasonable weather, with power outages threatening the roast lamb and snow drifts making hopping difficult. Russia and Ukraine are also suffering.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Rupert Darwall’s history of the idea of global warming shows how the belief in an impending man-made apocalypse emanated from the top of wealthy Western societies.</strong></p>
<p>Long before there was climate change, there was environmentalism. As Rupert Darwall explains in his new book, <em>The Age of Global Warming: A History,</em> environmentalism had for decades proposed that humans were a blight on the planet. ‘During the course of the twentieth century’, he writes, ‘mankind’s relationship with nature underwent a revolution. At the beginning of the last century, human intervention was regarded as beneficient and a sign of the progress of civilisation. By century’s end, such interventions were presumed harmful unless it could be demonstrated they were not.’&#8230;</p>
<p>While environmentalism is certainly an obsession of many rich people, and a natural fit for many conservatives, one of the major factors that Darwall cites in the rise of environmentalism is the collapse of the left. But interestingly, this is not the usual argument about disillusioned ex-Communists turning from red to green, although such people have indeed often been the brains behind the development of these ideas. Rather, it was the collapse of a left-wing opposition to eco-notions about lowering growth that was crucial. Darwall notes the strong tradition on the left, from Marx onwards, in support of the need to increase the material wealth of society….</p>
<p>The elitist idea of environmentalism could only become dominant because of the exit of working-class politics from the Western political stage and the shrivelling of the political voice of the mass of Western populations. The failure of socialist and social-democratic parties meant there were no longer critics of environmentalism from the left. The declining membership of all political parties deprived the bulk of the population of an important means to hold politicians to account. To criticise the science and politics of global warming now meant you were a lackey of big business or some kind of ‘flat Earther’ who denied the importance of science. What remains is weariness of the modern world among those &#8211; from the middle classes upwards, and most particularly among the elites &#8211; who can afford such self-indulgence….</p>
<p>Reining in development in the name of the planet was always a rich man’s fancy. The Age of Global Warming should certainly become a touchstone for anyone interested in examining this issue seriously.</p>

<section>Though the clocks go forward tomorrow night, marking the start of British Summer Time, there is no end in sight to the bitter weather.This has already been the coldest March since 1962, the Met Office confirmed yesterday, and the fourth coldest since records began.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Image Attachment" src="http://climaterealists.com/attachments/ftp/Daily%20express%20422.jpg" /></p>
<p>Instead of spending the four-day Bank Holiday pottering in the garden or driving to the coast, people are being advised to wrap up warm and stay indoors.</p>
<p>Millions have given up hope of spring arriving and are jetting off for some much-needed sun. And some are still digging themselves out after being marooned by 20ft snowdrifts.</p>
<p>Parts of the UK are likely to see a white Easter with wintry showers forecast for eastern areas, though these are likely to be isolated and the snow should be fairly light.</p>
<p>By Sunday and Monday much of Britain may look sunny and spring-like but will still feel unseasonably chilly. And the snowdrifts could remain well into April.</p>
<p>Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel, said: “With these sorts of temperatures those drifts aren’t going to melt much at all.</p>
<p>“Because of the easterly winds there have been drifts that have left areas up to 20ft deep in snow. This is why farmers have really struggled.</p>
<p>“They have lost many of their sheep and there’s no good news for them, other than that the winds will die down. The actual drifts will melt only very slowly, even if the temperatures do lift above normal.</p>
<p>“Sea temperatures are now well depressed so temp­eratures are going to struggle to get anywhere near normal.</p>
<p>“There’s a risk of severe frost and some places could see temperatures as low as -10C.</p>
<p>“Anyone hoping to do a bit of gardening this Easter is out of luck. There’s no possibility of putting out early plants. I should think people will need to wait until late April before they can plant anything outside.”</p>
<p>The record lowest Easter temperature of -9.8C was set at Lagganlia, Inverness, on Easter Monday 1986.</p>
<p>Temperatures hit -8.8C early yesterday in Aonach Mor, Inverness, and -6.7C at Great Dun Fell, Cumbria.</p>
<p>That is much colder than parts of Greenland in the Arctic Circle which will see Easter lows of 1C.</p>
<p>Government cold weather health warnings have been extended until Monday – the first time the system has been used in April.</p>
<p>Channel 4 forecaster Liam Dutton said: “BST starts on Saturday night but the weather hasn’t noticed. Recent cold is remarkable and even weathermen are sick of it.”</p>
<p>Statistics from the Met Office show that from March 1 to 26 the UK mean temperature was 2.5C, which is three degrees below the long-term average. This made it the joint fourth coldest March in the UK since records began in 1910.</p>
<p>Around 1,200 homes in the west of Scotland remained without power for a sixth day yesterday following a problem with mobile generators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>No one seems upset that in modern Britain, old people are freezing to death as hidden taxes make fuel more expensive. Instead of making sure energy was affordable, ministers have been trying to make it more expensive, with carbon price floors and emissions trading schemes.</strong></p>
<p>A few months ago, a group of students in Oslo produced a brilliant spoof video that lampooned the charity pop song genre. It showed a group of young Africans coming together to raise money for those of us freezing in the north. “A lot of people aren’t aware of what’s going on there right now,” says the African equivalent of Bob Geldof. “People don’t ignore starving people, so why should we ignore cold people? Frostbite kills too. Africa: we need to make a difference.” The song – Africa for Norway – has been watched online two million times, making it one of Europe’s most popular political videos.</p>
<p>The aim was to send up the patronising, cliched way in which the West views Africa. Norway can afford to make the joke because there, people don’t tend to die of the cold. In Britain, we still do. Each year, an official estimate is made of the “excess winter mortality” – that is, the number of people dying of cold-related illnesses. Last winter was relatively mild, and still 24,000 perished. The indications are that this winter, which has dragged on so long and with such brutality, will claim 30,000 lives, making it one of the biggest killers in the country. And still, no one seems upset.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the release of the 1984 Band Aid single and Al Gore’s 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, political attention shifted away from such problems. The idea of people (especially old people) dying in their homes from conditions with which we are all familiar now seems relatively boring. Much political attention is still focused on global warming, and while schemes to help Britain prepare for the cold are being cut, the overseas aid budget is being vastly expanded. Saving elderly British lives has somehow become the least fashionable cause in politics.</p>
<p>The reaction to the 2003 heatwave was extraordinary. It was blamed for 2,000 deaths, and taken as a warning that Britain was horribly unprepared for the coming era of snowless winters and barbecue summers. The government’s chief scientific officer, Sir David King, later declared that climate change was “more serious even than the threat of terrorism” in terms of the number of lives that could be lost. Such language is never used about the cold, which kills at least 10 times as many people every winter. Before long, every political party had signed up to the green agenda.</p>
<p>Since Sir David’s exhortations, some 250,000 Brits have died from the cold, and 10,000 from the heat. It is horribly clear that we have been focusing on the wrong enemy. Instead of making sure energy was affordable, ministers have been trying to make it more expensive, with carbon price floors and emissions trading schemes. Fuel prices have doubled over seven years, forcing millions to choose between heat and food – and government has found itself a major part of the problem.</p>
<p>This is slowly beginning to dawn on Ed Davey, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. He has tried to point the finger at energy companies, but his own department let the truth slip out in the small print of a report released on Wednesday. The average annual fuel bill is expected to have risen by £76 by 2020, it says. But take out Davey’s hidden taxes (carbon price floor, emissions trading scheme, etc) and we’d be paying an average £123 less. His department has been trying to make homes cheaper to heat, and in a saner world this would be his only remit: to secure not the greenest energy, but the most affordable energy.</p>
<p>By now, the Energy Secretary will also have realised another inconvenient truth – that, for Britain, global warming is likely to save far more lives then it threatens. Delve deep enough into the Government’s forecasts, and they speculate that global warming will lead to 6,000 fewer deaths a year, on average, by the end of the decade. This is the supposed threat facing us: children would be less likely to have snow to play in at Christmas, but more likely to have grandparents to visit over Easter. Not a bad trade-off. The greatest uncertainty is whether global warming, which has stalled since 1998, will arrive quickly enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>It’s daft to draw any conclusions from this freakish, frozen spring. But in general, the computer-generated predictions do not seem as reliable as they did when Al Gore was using them to scare the bejesus out of us. A few weeks ago, scientists at the University of Washington found that man’s contribution to global warming may have been exaggerated – by a factor of two. The natural cycle of heating and cooling, they discovered, plays a far bigger role than they had imagined. Mr Davey’s fuel bill taxes may do nothing for the planet. But they will certainly lead to poorer, colder homes and shorter lives.</p>
<p>Our understanding of climate science may be weak, but our understanding of basic medicine is not. Low temperatures increase blood pressure and weaken the immune system, making everyone more vulnerable to bugs. For the elderly, this can be fatal. People don’t actually die of frostbite, as the Norwegian video teasingly suggested. They die of flu, or thrombosis, or other conditions they would not have acquired if their house had been warmer. Far fewer Scandinavians die in winter, because they have worked out how to defeat the cold: keep the heating on; insulate houses. It really is that simple.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Protests against high electricity bills and poverty toppled the government of Boyko Borissov on Feb. 20. Now </strong><strong style="font-size: 13px;">Bulgaria may suspend as much as 40 percent of wind and solar power capacity as part of its effort to stem oversupply and stabilize electricity generation. </strong></p>
<p>About 40 percent of wind and solar power producers aren’t providing real-time information to the country’s central electricity dispatcher, jeopardizing the safety of Bulgaria’s transmission network, Energy Minister Asen Vasilev said in a document posted on the ministry’s website. They will be temporarily disconnected, he said.</p>
<p>Bulgaria’s grid is suffering from power overloads caused by a rapid increase in wind and solar capacity coupled with decreasing domestic consumption in the face of a weak economy. The government wants to relax the restrictions on electricity trading with neighboring Turkey, according to the document.</p>
<p>Protests against high electricity bills and poverty toppled the government of Boyko Borissov on Feb. 20. President Rosen Plevneliev appointed an interim government led by Prime Minister Marin Raikov on March 12 to organize and hold early elections on May 12.</p>

<p>The Department of Energy released its <a href="http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/index.cfm?src=email" target="_blank">Monthly Energy Review</a> today for March, with all energy statistics now updated through the end of 2012. Based on today’s updates, here are some highlights of America’s amazing energy statistics for 2012:</p>
<p>1. The US produced an average of 6.574 million barrels of oil per day in 2012, which was the highest average annual crude oil output since 1995 (see blue line in top chart above). US oil output has been accelerating, and during the first two months of 2013 crude oil production averaged 7.046 million barrels of oil per day, which is the highest production level since 1992, twenty years ago.</p>
<p>2. In 2012, several states set new production records for crude oil output including North Dakota, New Mexico and Colorado. Other states set mult-decade production highs for crude oil output including Oklahoma (highest since 1994), Texas (highest since 1989), Utah (highest since 1988), Wyoming (highest since 1999) and Kansas (highest since 1995).</p>
<p>3. As a result of the boom in shale oil production in the US, America  produced domestically more than 60% of the oil consumed last year, and net oil imports fell below 40% in 2012 for the first time since 1991, more than twenty years ago (see red line in top chart above). Just seven years ago, it was exactly the opposite – American relied on foreign sources of oil for 60% of the oil consumed and produced only 40% before the oceans of unconventional oil were accessed using the breakthrough technologies of fracking and horizontal drilling.</p>
<p>4. Natural gas production in the US last year reached a new record high of almost 30 trillion cubic feet, an increase of 5% over 2011, following increases of 7.4% in 2011 and 3.4% in 2010.</p>
<p>5. Largely as a result of the surging production of domestic natural gas being substituted for coal to generate America’s electricity, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell in 2012 to the lowest level since 1994, eighteen years ago (see middle chart above). Since the 2007 peak, greenhouse gas emissions in the US have fallen by more than 12%, which is one of the largest reductions in CO2 recorded over that period by any country in the world.</p>

<p>6. As a result of natural gas production reaching an all-time high and oil production hitting a 17-year high last year, America was more energy self-sufficient in 2012 than in any year since 1991, more than 20 years ago (see bottom chart above).  Last year, the US produced domestically 83.2% of the total energy consumed, which was the highest level of energy self-sufficiency since 1991, when the US produced a slightly higher 83.3% of the energy consumed.</p>

<p><strong>MP</strong>: America is in the early stages of an amazing energy revolution that represents a seismic shift in the energy landscape that has very rarely happened with such great magnitude in such a short period of time. The new Department of Energy data released today confirms that America is experiencing an amazing, game-changing energy bonanza that is truly revolutionary – natural gas production is at record levels, crude oil output is the highest in 20 years, C02 emissions have fallen precipitously to 20-year lows, and America is more energy self-sufficient than at any time since 1991 when George H.W. Bush was president. In terms of America’s energy, we’ve come a long way in short period of time, and the energy revolution is just getting started.  America’s economic future looks much, much brighter because of the shale revolution, which will continue to support and energize the US economy for decades to come.</p>
