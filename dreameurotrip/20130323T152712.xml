<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t believe that my relatively new <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com" target="_blank">eurotrip travel blog</a> is nominated as one of the <strong>Best European Weblogs</strong> at the <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/#european" target="_blank">13th Annual Weblog Awards</a> aka 2013 Bloggies.</p>
<p><strong>This is kind of major.</strong></p>
<p>Well, to begin with, the Bloggies is the longest running blog awards on the Internet and every year they recognize amazing blogs in many different categories. There are many fantastic blogs on the Internet, and the Bloggies is here to honor them. So this is like the Oscars of the blogverse. It&#8217;s such an honor to be nominated.</p>
<p>I am quite flattered and happy since I really don&#8217;t know how I got there. There was a nomination process and then a voting process from the most-nominated blogs and then the top 5 best blogs of each category was revealed which is how I came to know about it.</p>
<p>I suddenly had a surge of traffic from the Bloggies website and only after a few days did I realize that my blog was nominated as top 5 Best European Weblog. *confetti confetti*</p>
<p>To those who nominated me, thank you thank you.</p>

		</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-3006 aligncenter" title="Paris Spring" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2641.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audrey Hepburn once remarked that <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/france/paris/" target="_blank">Paris</a> is always a good idea. Judging by the millions of people who travel there every year, that statement is true.</p>
<p>Like any city, some times of the year are better than others for visiting. One of those times is the month of May for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">1. Fewer Crowds</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to its reputation as one of the most romantic cities in the world, the month of February, specifically Valentine’s Day, sees an influx of visitors. In the summer months, when children are out of school and families take their annual vacations, the city is overrun by tourists angling for the best view of the Mona Lisa and the Eiffel Tower. While May marks the beginning of summer, and crowds increase throughout the month, on most days you’ll be able to enjoy the city sights without long waits or large crowds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">2. Pleasant Weather</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parisian weather in May tends to be on the cooler side. The average temperature is 57 degrees Fahrenheit, but it’s generally sunny. You might encounter a stray rain shower or two, but overall the days are sunny and mild with cooler nights. This means that when you are walking the streets or traipsing up the many stairs of the Metro, you’ll be comfortable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3007" title="Gare du Nord Paris" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2733.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">3. Festivals and Events</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/france/" target="_blank">France</a> observes two national holidays in May. May 1 is Labor Day, honoring workers, and May 8 is Victory Day, marking the end of World War II. On these days most of the major tourist attractions and many businesses are closed, but visitors can still experience events and ceremonies commemorating the holidays. Paris is alive with activity throughout the month, hosting several major festivals and events. Tennis fans flock to Paris every May for the French Open tennis tournament and it’s possible to purchase same-day tickets to watch some of the world’s best tennis players.</p>
<p>Paris also celebrates Museum Night each May. On one night, all of the museums in the city are free to the public and offer special exhibits and events as well as extended hours, often well past midnight. Music lovers will enjoy the Saint-Germain-des-Pres Jazz Festival, a two-week celebration of jazz that takes place in clubs and venues around the city, with a number of free or low-cost concerts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">4. Relatively Cheaper</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris is one of the more expensive European cities for tourists, but rates in the month of May tend to be lower than average. Flights and hotel prices are lower in the earlier part of the month than later, when the crowds start to build. Overall, May tends to be a cheaper month for travel. You can always find <a href="http://www.expedia.com/Cheap-Flights-To-Paris.d179898.Travel-Guide-Flights" target="_blank">cheap flights to Paris</a> during this month as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3008" title="Yummy food Paris" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_9470.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">5. Paris at its Best</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paris is a beautiful city at any time of the year, but in May the landscape is truly spectacular. The gray and dreary days of winter give way bright sunshine, and the many parks and gardens burst with color. It’s possible to pack a picnic lunch — picking up a bottle of wine, some bread and cheese at one of the many markets — and spend an afternoon soaking up the atmosphere. In fact, a leisurely afternoon in one of Paris’ gardens is arguably Paris at its finest.</p>
<p>While a true Francophile can make a case for visiting Paris at any time, for a first-time visitor, it’s hard to beat Paris in May. From the pleasant temperatures and lower crowds to the festivals and flowers, it is an ideal time to visit and soak up the beauty, culture and romance that is distinctly Paris.</p>

<p>I just recently finished a <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/how-to-plan-a-euro-trip-itinerary-strategy/" target="_blank">3-month eurotrip</a> and went to Spain for a week as my first stop. I went to <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/spain/valencia/" target="_blank">Valencia</a> for 3 days, <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/spain/albacete/" target="_blank">Albacete</a> for 2 days and <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/spain/madrid/" target="_blank">Madrid</a> for 3 days. How much does it cost to travel in Spain for a week?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2881" title="Budget Spain 1 week" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Picture-4.png" alt="" width="582" height="319" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much does it cost to travel in Spain for 7 days? Mine came down to 163.70 euros or 23.38 euros per day. The detailed explanation follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Spain Food Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much does it cost to eat out in Spain? Around 10 euros. Good deals can be had at lunch if you eat the menu del dia or menu of the day. It can be higher if you eat more stuff. There are other cheaper options like buying ready-to-eat food in the supermarket or in the mercado or buying stuff and preparing your own food. For me, I spent 64.6 euros for food in my one-week trip in Spain. It’s not that expensive because I ate out and prepared my own food as well. There are so many <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/alt-spain-gypset-guide-spain-most-underrated-food-and-drinks/" target="_blank">amazing and delicious tapas and drinks in Spain</a>.</p>
<p>You can also try going to the mercato (or the local market) to buy your jamon and cheeses!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Spain Transportation Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transportation in between cities by train in Spain can be quite expensive. Sometimes, it’s even cheaper to travel by plane. Other alternative way is to do <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/ridesharing-in-spain-the-blablacar-experience-infographic/" target="_blank">carpooling in Spain</a>. I’ve tried this on my trip to Valencia from Madrid and I’ve saved a lot of money. You can also check out the buses because they are usually cheaper than the train. But if you are pressed for time then choose between flying or taking the train.</p>
<p>As for city transport cost, you’re looking at 1 euro for a ride in the train. You can save a bit by buying the daily pass or 3-day pass tickets. If you’re in the center anyway, walk. It’s good for your health and your pocket.</p>
<p>I spent around 61.6 euros for my bus tickets and carpooling in between the cities and also for my city transport. It’s also important to note that I walked a lot that’s why I also didn’t spend more for transportation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Spain Accommodation Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accommodation in Spain would cost you around 20-50 euros if you’re staying in backpacker hostels. If hotels is your thing then be ready to pay more. I was visiting friends during my entire trip so I didn’t really spend anything for accommodation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Spain Party Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not that expensive to go out in Spain. A glass of beer with tapas would cost you between 1.5 &#8211; 2.5 euros. Spanish people also love to have a botellon which is basically a group of people drinking outside in public, usually in parks. It’s cheap because you get to buy your drinks from the supermarket or beer store. People then head out to the bars and club around 2am or so.</p>
<p>Parties usually start late in Spain. I recommend you to go out around 1am or 2am. In some places that’s even early! I spent 31.50 for going out and drinking when I was in Spain. It’s mostly hanging out in bars and parks with my friends. No crazy partying for me in this trip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Spain Miscellaneous Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me this includes the cost of using my phone to contact my friends which cost me around 6 euros. This can also include your travel insurance and shopping. You can compare prices of travel insurance at <a href=" http://www.insurancetown.com/" target="_blank">insurance town</a>. Shopping cost, meanwhile, will vary person to person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See all the <a href="http://dreameurotrip.com/category/budget-report/">travel budget reports</a>.</p>
<p>Next up, budget expenses for a week in Norway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy travels!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;">
		<img src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Warsaw-Old-Town.jpg" width="240" />
		</p><p><img class="aligncenter" title="Zygmunt's Square" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_1639.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I love about Europe is the beautiful twilights in autumn. The sun sets earlier than usual and the cities are cloaked in a nice hue, the buildings and shops all lighted in warm yellow.</p>
<p>Twilights in <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/poland/warsaw/" target="_blank">Warsaw, Poland</a> during the fall is no exception. It feels great to walk around the Old Town (Stare Miasto in Polish) with the crisp autumn chill on your face and then drinking some home-brewed beer in places like Browarnia. Or pig out on Polish pierogi and hearty zurek soup at Zapiekanka restaurant in the corner.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What&#8217;s so special about the Old Town of Warsaw?</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all fake! If you didn&#8217;t know, Warsaw was one of the most destroyed cities in Europe during World War II. The city was almost flat and bombed into nothingness. So the Old Town you&#8217;re looking at right now is just a post-war reconstruction&#8230;of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:POL_Krakowskie_Przedmieście_Street_in_War" target="_blank">painting of the original Old Town</a> by this Italian dude better known in this parts as Canaletto. Crazy no? But it&#8217;s true!</p>
<p>And look how beautiful it is!</p>

		</p><p>Europe has an undeniable reputation for being a backpacker’s paradise. Whether you are looking to immerse yourself in the culture of the region, gaze upon historical artefacts or embark on the party of a lifetime, you’ll find it all in the cities and countries of Europe. For some great inspiration, when planning your next backpacking adventure, be sure to check out these four top European destinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Berlin, Germany</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2751" title="Berlin Dom" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Berlin-Dom.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favorite cities in Europe. It has everything you&#8217;ll ever need: rich history, vibrant culture, amazing parties, local and international cuisine, and interesting residents. If you really want to visit a city that just won&#8217;t tell you when to sleep, head to Berlin. The city is big, beautifully scruffy and unbelievably cheap. It is super hyped up but for good reasons. So go and have your own adventures in one of the coolest cities in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Rome, Italy</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2754" title="Rome" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rome.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For backpackers who are looking to immerse themselves into the rich culture and history of Europe, Rome will be your chosen destination. A day tour to the Colosseum will see you embarking on a journey of discovery, as you gaze down into the chambers where ancient warriors prepared for battle. St Peter’s Basilica is another major point of interest for many travellers, with the unique architecture of this Roman Catholic Church enabling you to take a step back in time to the early 1500s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Amsterdam, Netherlands</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2750" title="Amsterdam Canal" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Amsterdam-Canal.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="455" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/essential-guide-amsterdam-budget/" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> is the place to go when you want to party all day and all night – there is no rest for the wicked in this city. Famed around the world for being the destination where ‘anything goes’, backpackers will be thrown into a world of all things elicit and out of the ordinary. Party goers will find that Amsterdam is like heaven, with some of the world’s best DJs calling the clubs and bars home. If you are looking for a holiday to remember, <a href="http://www.flightcentre.com.au/flights/product/amsterdam" target="_blank">find flights to Amsterdam</a> and get the party started today!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Paris, France</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2753" title="Paris Montmarte" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Paris-Montmarte.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it may be a little more on the pricey side for some backpackers, Paris is the epicentre for culture in Europe. From a day at the Louvre to discovering the Arc de Triomphe and everything in between, your money is well spent in this captivating city. Photo opportunities are endless with the Eiffel Tower being visible from most areas of the city, whilst dining on delectable pastries is sure to be a treat from the regular backpacking food.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see that Europe truly is one of the best places for backpackers to visit. Whether you are travelling on a shoestring budget or have a little extra cash to spend, there is an abundance of free sightseeing options available, that will truly take your breath away.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my travel expenses breakdown for my <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/spain/madrid/" target="_blank">3-day trip in Madrid</a>, Spain in my <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/how-to-plan-a-euro-trip-itinerary-strategy/" target="_blank">3-month summer eurotrip adventure</a>. I hope the information helps in budgetting your trip to Madrid! I also keep a record of my actual travel costs in various European cities. Click the link below to see all the other reports.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Madrid Travel Cost Breakdown" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Picture-6.png" alt="" width="584" height="321" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much does it cost to travel in Madrid for 3 days? Mine came down to 65.85 euros or 21.95 euros per day. The detailed explanation follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Madrid Food Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of my cost of food in Madrid was spent in the supermarket where I bought most of the stuff I ate in Madrid. I was visiting my Brazilian friend, Fabio, who is based in Madrid so he prepared dinner for me and I&#8217;ve also prepared dinner for him. My travel partner, Michael, came to Madrid to meet me before we headed to Norway. Sharing the cost of food definitely lowered down this part of my travel expenses. Eating out in Madrid would cost you around 10 euros. Menu del dia (menu of the day) is a cheaper, popular option at lunch in restaurants and would save you significant amount of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Madrid Transportation Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This cost includes the cost of going from Madrid Barajas Airport to the center of Madrid (4.50 euros), bus tickets from Albacete to Madrid (17.85 euros) and all the single metro tickets I used in the city which cost 1.50 euros each. I walked alot in Madrid so I didn&#8217;t spend much on transportation cost in the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Madrid Accommodation Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was visiting my friend Fabio who hosted us in Madrid so I didn&#8217;t really spend anything for accommodation. But I don&#8217;t have friends in Madrid, you say. You can <a href="http://www.trivago.com/madrid-32027/hotel" target="_blank">compare prices and find cheap hotels in Madrid</a> instead. There are many accommodation options to choose from. You can budget between 20-100 euros per day for your accommodation cost depending on where you stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Madrid Party Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/watching-spain-versus-france-euro-cup-2012/" target="_blank">watched Spain versus France in Marca sports bar</a> in the city center and paid 5 euros for the entrance. The cost also includes our beers and our expenses when we were out having botellon (Spanish culture wherein people drink outside in groups) in the park which was actually forbidden or something. Fabio was saying that we should hide our beer every time we see police coming. It was funny because it was so obvious that 90% of the people in the park where drinking and all the cans and bottles disappear once a policeman was in sight. Haha. Fun times!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Madrid Miscellaneous Cost</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is mostly the prepaid cost of my cellphone which I used to communicate with Michael and Fabio. I didn&#8217;t spend money when we went to the amazing Musel del Prado because students are free (although I&#8217;m not a student anymore haha but it worked when I showed my student ID).</p>

<p>Next budgeting post will be my total travel expenses from my one-week trip in Spain. Watch out for that!</p>

		</p><p>There are many ways to get a Schengen visa and there are definitely different offices where you can apply for one. I have previously written how to apply for a <a href="http://dreameurotrip.com/how-to-apply-for-a-schengen-visa-7-days/" target="_blank">tourist Schengen visa at the German Embassy</a> and <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/how-to-apply-schengen-visa-french-embassy-get-in-5-days/" target="_blank">French Embassy</a>.</p>
<p>To continue this Visa Series, I interviewed one of my good friends, Angel, who is now based in the Netherlands to help us out on the intricacies of applying for a tourist Schengen visa at the Dutch Embassy in Manila for Philippine passport holders. If you&#8217;re not a Filipino, no worries, the process is pretty much almost the same wherever you apply so read on.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article will focus only on tourist Schengen visa application. If you&#8217;re going to the Netherlands to study or marry, you need to prepare a set of other documents. Please check the <a href="http://philippines.nlembassy.org/services/consular-services/visa" target="_blank">Dutch embassy website</a> for more info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2693" title="schengen visa netherlands" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/schengen-visa-netherlands.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401.5" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">When can I apply for a Schengen visa at the Dutch embassy?</span>
<p>You can apply as early as 3 months before your planned entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How do I apply for a Schengen visa in the Dutch Embassy?</span>
<p>You need to make an appointment through a call centre before applying for a visa at the Embassy in Manila. An appointment can be arranged not earlier than 3 months before your planned date of departure. Make sure to allot some time for gathering and preparing the required documents, this requires some planning in advance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What are the requirements for a Schengen visa?</span>

</ul>
</ul>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How much is the Schengen visa processing fee?</span>
<div>
<p>60 Euros converted to Philippine Pesos, depends on the current exchange rate. Bring the exact amount.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What should I wear to the interview?</span>
<p>Be yourself but the best, “most respectable” version of you. Perhaps think of the visa interview as a job interview, but skip the stiff tie and the formal blazer! Wear something that makes you feel confident about yourself. You should be relaxed on that day. Usually, wearing something that you particularly like (your favorite dress or your lucky shirt) makes you feel more confident. <img src='http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How is the interview like?</span>
<div>
<p>First, the security guard will ask for your details and lead you to the waiting room (which is super cold, so bring a jacket!) Be prepared to wait long, one time I waited for more than 2 hours for my turn. I recommend bringing a book or some magazines (you&#8217;re not allowed to use your phone in the waiting room). During the interview, be prepared to answer questions regarding your application. They usually double check if the answers you gave on the form/supporting documents are true (for example, how much your salary is, where will you be staying in Holland, how did you meet your host, where you work, etc.) Know your facts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Are the interviewers really scary?</span>
<div>
<p>Depends on the person who is interviewing you. Some of them can be a bit intimidating, but it&#8217;s all just part of their jobs. As long as you have your facts straight, and you&#8217;re not planning on not coming back, then you have nothing to be afraid of. Breathe in, smile and answer their questions as best as you can!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How long does it take for the Schengen visa to be released?</span>
<p>15 calendar days but some exceptional cases may take up to 30 or 60 days. You will receive a letter anyway to inform you about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">My Schengen visa application is denied. What can I do next?</span>
<p>“If the visa-granting authority refuses your application, it will send you a copy of the decision explaining why. You may object to this decision in writing (not email) within four weeks of its issue (details of where to send your objection are enclosed with the decision). You may also authorise a person to object to the decision on your behalf or to represent you in any hearing. This person must have written authorisation (in Dutch, French, German or English) to do so, signed by you.</p>
<p>The visa-granting authority will then decide on your objection. If it decides in your favour, it will authorise the mission to issue you with a visa. If it decides against you, it will send you a copy of its decision, explaining why your objection has been denied. The objection procedure usually takes some months.”</p>

		</p><p>I consider myself a gourmand and I oftentimes travel to certain European destinations to pig out on their culinary offerings. This week I interviewed one of the food and travel bloggers I have been following and admire, Sage of <a href="http://foodpilgrimage.com/" target="_blank">Food Pilgrimage</a>.</p>
<p>Learn what food pilgrimage is, how to discover Europe through food and different food stories on the road from Scotland all the way to Bordeaux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Meet Sage Russel, food and travel writer</span>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2638" title="Sage" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sage.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sage Russell is a food and travel writer, Cookery instructor and private chef. In 2010, he left his job as an architect to set sail on a quest to travel the world to learn everything he could about ingredients, techniques and traditions from the great food cultures of the world. He talked his way into restaurant kitchens, hung out with home cooks, and convinced chef’s and street-food vendors to show him their secrets. Follow his food-seeking travel adventures, and you’ll be inspired to eat better, cook more, and live a better life through travel, food, and feeding friends with fabulous feasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">1. You said that &#8220;I love making food my destination&#8221;. How does your intimate relationship with food shape your travels in Europe?</span>
<div>From my very first trip to Europe, I realized how much more fun people were having with food: The markets of fresh food where real people did real shopping, the 2-hour lunches, the cafe culture, and of course the epic family meals. Now when I travel around Europe, I start my adventure by simply asking a local &#8220;What&#8217;s the quinticential food of the area?&#8221; and then follow up with &#8220;where can I find the best version?&#8221;. The Food Pilgrimage adventure takes off from there.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">2. Have you been a foodie for a long time? If not, how did you end up being one?</span>
<div></div>
<div>I was raised in the kitchen, doing my homework at a big kitchen island, where I was either helping cook, watching cooking, or eating. But it was really my ex-wife Christy (who happens to hail from Spain) that altered my passion for food travel. We were standing in line at yet another &#8220;must see&#8221; tourist site in Italy, and she pointed out how much nicer it would be to simply Gelato hop for the rest of the afternoon. We skipped the tourist bit, spent the day in cafes and gelataria and I&#8217;ve never looked back. Food is now the reason I travel and the end-game of all of my adventures.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2636" title="Sage Russel Food Pilgrimage" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sage-Russel-Food-Pilgrimage.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">3. Explain your idea of a food pilgrimage and how to create a personalized one?</span>
<div></div>
<div>A Food Pilgrimage is simply a travel adventure &#8211; near or far -  where food is the focus. Like any good pilgrimage, it is simply making a fuss of the destination that makes the whole experience special, whether it&#8217;s finally making it to a world-class restaurant or street market, visiting a vineyard or farm, or simply setting out to find the freshest ingredients for a pizza party or catch up with a local food truck. The magic is in the intention. The concept for me was born of wanting to visit the olive farm in Italy where I had adopted an olive tree. Anyone can set out on a food pilgrimage simply by picking a food or meal to track down.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">4. If you are to take us on a food pilgrimage in Europe, where would you take us and what would we be eating?</span>
<div>The sky is the limit. Europe is so diverse, with such an storied food history.The passion that comes from every food culture is staggering.  My recent obsessions would have us hop to the Veneto for Prosecco and fresh Lagoon seafood then to Bordeaux for a good terrine and a bottle of Margaux and finally to Scotland for Shetland Mussels and a pint of Belhaven.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">5. Can you please share us your favorite restaurants or hole-in-the-wall places where we can have some of the best food that you have enjoyed immensely in your European travels?</span>
<div>Where to start and what to divulge? They&#8217;d almost all be street food: Vietnamese at Tre Viet and Caribbean at Granny&#8217;s in Hackney, London, The random crepe window or the falafal joint on Rue Mouffetard in the Latin Quarter of Paris, Robbie&#8217;s restaurant in Estepona, Spain, La Cantina in Venice to name but a recent few.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">6. How do you get in contact with people whose lives revolve around food? Do you even contact them in advance or it&#8217;s more a spontaneous thing wherein you meet them in restaurants or farms as you travel?</span>
<div>I&#8217;ve learned to rely on two very powerful forces: Firstly, putting out the call, telling my fwllow foodies where I&#8217;m going, and asking what to explore. Second is simply asking once I&#8217;m on the ground &#8220;What is the best, and where can I find it?&#8221;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">7. Personally, I sometimes find it difficult to find good food when I&#8217;m traveling. Do you have any system or secret technique on how to find good food in a new city?</span>
<div></div>
<div>Walk into the nearest cafe and ask the barista, where they would go to lunch if you were going to treat them.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2637" title="Sage Russel" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Sage-Russel.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">8. You have been based in London for awhile now, why did you choose London?</span>
<p>London is positively the most cosmopolitan food city in the world. I landed here Primarily because of a girl, but in the end, because it is simply the center of the world, an epic melange of cultures and cuisines and is less than three hours away from anywhere in Europe, not to mention Africa.</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">9. What are you future plans with the food pilgrimage website?</span>
<p>Besides hosting my short food-centirc stories and articles about my Food Pilgrimage adventures, it is now the contact point for my cookery classes, private chef bookings and food tours.</p>

		</p><p>I interview some of the <a href="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/category/interesting-people/" target="_blank">coolest people in the world</a> to pick their brains and share how they make their travel dreams happen. I ask them how they plan and budget their Euro Trips, tips and tricks on how not to break the bank and other insightful words of wisdom to get you inspired for your next trip to Europe. This week&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Meet Rory Cummins, world traveller</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2602" title="Rory Cummins" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Cover4.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="393" /></p>
<p>In August of 2011, Rory left home to fulfill a dream of world travel. He has been on the road now for more than 14 months and his blog, <a href="http://www.TravelingRoundTheWorld.com" target="_blank">Traveling Around the World</a>, is a journal of his experiences, a bit of photography and some crazy times. As he continues to share his stories and offer travel advice, he hopes to inspire others to travel behind in his footsteps. He says he is a  living proof that if you dream of world travel, you can turn that dream into reality! Rory is currently in Siberia.</p>
<p>Learn why you should go to Eastern Europe, why Iceland is amazing and what you must do if you go there and he reveals the one thing you shouldn&#8217;t do on your eurotrip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ:  How do you normally plan your Euro Trips? Do you have your own system? Any specific guidebooks or websites you use?</span>
<p>When I start planning out destinations in Europe, I usually think of all the places I have always wanted to see or experience and then consider how much time I have and my budget and then I start to map out a rough travel path through countries. It is at that point I&#8217;ll start to research the areas I&#8217;ll be passing through and will do most of that research online as well as talking with other travelers.</p>
<p>I have to admit though, I&#8217;m a big fan of Lonely Planet guidebooks even though just about everything within those books is heavily traveled. One of the best sources of information I&#8217;ve found online though is Lonely Planet&#8217;s Thorn Tree Forum. Its an excellent resource to find information on where you want to go and get recommendations and advice from fellow travelers that have been to the destinations you want to go to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: Most of the readers who email me express that their #1 obstacle is money. Almost all of them think they can&#8217;t afford Europe. So how did you budget for your trip? How much did you spend daily on average?</span>
<p>Ah yes, the all encompassing budget plan. I think its best to start out asking yourself how long you have to travel away from home and even more so, <em>how</em> you want to travel. If you want to live it up in London and stay in guesthouses or hotels, your days will be numbered if you&#8217;re on an average backpacker&#8217;s budget.</p>
<p>However, on the flip side, if you try to plan most of your time outside of the most expensive cities and also utilize cheaper transportation and lodging, your money will go much much farther. Using Couchsurfing as a way to save money and taking the most inexpensive trains and buses will keep you on the travel path much longer.</p>
<p>For me, I budgeted around $70-80 USD per day for areas in Western Europe while in Eastern Europe, I budgeted around $50-60 per day. However, I was not Couchsurfing at time since I was having so much fun in the hostels so I&#8217;m sure you could get by on less per day, especially if you&#8217;re watching your budget in regard to the money spent on food and drinks. However, of all the times I exceeded this budget in each country, it was almost always a result of drinks in the bar! Something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: Any tips and tricks on how to make a Euro Trip affordable?</span>
<p>Transportation will always be your biggest cost. If you must fly, do you best to find affordable plane tickets. On my blog, I&#8217;ve dedicated an entire article on <a href="http://www.travelingroundtheworld.com/travel-advice/save-on-flights-rtw-using-bonus-miles/"><strong>how to fly on the cheap</strong></a> by accumulating free bonus miles as well as utilizing buddy passes and other ways to save. As for land transportation, do your research. The trains are not always the cheapest option depending on which country you&#8217;re in. For instance, it was far cheaper for me to take buses throughout Spain than it was to take the train so do some research to find out what will be the best option for where you want to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: How do you fund your Euro Trips or travels in general?</span>
<p>I&#8217;m a saver and a planner. When I first got out of college, I knew I wanted to backpack Europe and simply saved every dollar I could while working and then took off for two months. Fast forward almost ten years and I had the same desire yet this time, I wanted to take on the world, starting my travels out in Europe. This again, was saving and also selling what I could at home to build up the funds.</p>
<p>It is also helpful to be sure no money will have to come out of your pocket to pay for things at home while you&#8217;re away so this could mean selling your car, renting out your place, etc. which is exactly what I had to do since I&#8217;ve been gone more than 14 months now… Of course, if you can rent out your place for more than you pay on a mortgage and do such things, this will help to keep you on the road but what is most important is planning a daily budget for your trip and then sticking to it once you&#8217;re on the road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: What are the things you wish you knew before traveling to Europe?</span>
<p>First off, I wish I knew just how incredible traveling in Europe would be. Had I known this, I would have stayed longer in every country I visited! My point in this is the fact that most people (myself included) have planned to see too many places in too short of time. Try to make it a habit to spend 2 if not 3 days minimum in every place you visit. You&#8217;ll have a much greater time!</p>
<p>Aside from that, I wish I knew how interesting and amazing the countries are in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, they never seem to get as much attention as the countries in Western Europe but after making my second trip to Europe in which I traveled through 4 countries in Eastern Europe, I realized just how much I was missing on my first trip.</p>
<p>Another thing I wished I&#8217;d known more of was the full history of Europe. Of course, there was a lot I&#8217;d learned in school regarding the formation of Europe and its countries to present day however, your experience there will be even greater if you can learn as much as you can before you travel there. This includes picking up as much as you can in languages. It will only add to having a great experience and will be even more fun with the locals you&#8217;ll interact with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: What are your favorite European cities or destinations and what makes them your top choices?</span>
<p>Tarifa, Spain was one of the places I spent more than a week last time I was in Europe. It&#8217;s a very small city in Europe&#8217;s southern most point and you can actually see Morocco from its shores. It&#8217;s a great place to unwind if beaches, seafood, and sun interest you. I went there originally to kite surf (kite board) as its known to be the best location in Europe but you can also go scuba diving, wind surfing, party in the bars at night, lounge on the beaches and even take day trips to Morocco. I&#8217;d have been happy spending 2 more weeks there.</p>
<p>Iceland is another of my favorites. I write more about this below but all in all, its an amazing country with one of the most stunning landscapes I&#8217;ve ever seen. I spent a week there and wish I&#8217;d seen more. The city of Reykjavik has a lot to offer but the rest of the country offers so much more. Go there if you have the chance! You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<p>Another of my favorites is Italy. It extremely hard to narrow it down by cities for this one. Maybe I&#8217;m a bit biased being half-Italian however with such delicious foods, friendly people, interesting culture, an extensive and dynamic history, beautiful weather and stunning landscapes, what&#8217;s not to love? What more is there? You can head out to the beaches, take part in the history that lies in every city or ski in the Italian Alps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2597" title="Kiteboarding Tarifa Spain" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Kiteboarding-Tarifa-Spain.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="397" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: Any favorite events or festival in Europe that you&#8217;ve attended?</span>
<p>I have never been one to be very good at catching events, concerts or holiday celebrations on specific dates when I&#8217;m traveling. The following three listed were each missed by about 2 or 3 days when I was traveling. However, if I get the chance, I&#8217;ll not miss them again!  They were: The Love Parade in Berlin, the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain and Tomatina (the tomato fight) , also held in Spain.  I had friends that attended each of them and they said it was one of at the most incredible experiences they&#8217;d had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: One amazing thing you&#8217;ve seen or done in Europe</span>
<p>The most amazing thing I’ve done in Europe was drive the Ring Road in Iceland. It was a road trip I took with a friend for a week in which we drove the only road in Iceland which circumnavigates the entire country. It was an amazing journey and after more than 25 countries I&#8217;ve been to, Iceland still stands as my favorite destination I&#8217;ve ever traveled. It is one of the most exotic countries on the planet where you can walk on black sand beaches and glaciers in the morning , visit volcanic areas and mud pools in the afternoon and swim in a geothermal hot spring by nightfall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2598" title="Rory Cummins Iceland" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Rory-Cummins-Iceland.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="187" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2596" title="Iceland" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Iceland.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: If you have the chance to go back, what are your dream European destinations? </span>
<p>I definitely want to return to Iceland but want to spend at least 3 weeks traveling there on my next trip. As for others, I&#8217;d love to return to Italy too but to head south of Rome this time and also travel through Sicily where I supposedly have relatives I&#8217;ve never met! I&#8217;d also like to travel through more areas in Eastern Europe including Romania, Slovenia, Montenegro, Slovakia and others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; color: #FDEC4E;">DJ: Give ONE advice to people who dream of going to Europe or those currently planning to go to Europe.</span>
<p>Don&#8217;t rush around and try to see too much in too little time! This was a mistake I made when I first went to Europe by covering 9 countries in just under 2 months. Instead, try to spend more time in each place you visit. You&#8217;ll have more fun, be less stressed and save a lot more money in terms of transportation costs. Don&#8217;t worry, Europe will always be there and you can always go back!</p>

		</p><p>Many readers have been asking me about Schengen visa application so I decided to do a series of posts about getting one from the different European embassies.</p>
<p>I previously wrote a piece on <a href="http://dreameurotrip.com/how-to-apply-for-a-schengen-visa-7-days/" target="_blank">how to apply for a Schengen visa at the German Embassy</a> which includes a brief intro about Schengen visa and the different types of Schengen visa.</p>
<p>This time I interviewed a fellow travel blogger, <a href="http://www.cheaptravelforwomen.com/" target="_blank">Shawi</a>, to enlighten us about how to apply for a tourist Schengen visa at the French Embassy in Manila for Philippine passport holders. Note that Schengen visa application is pretty standard so you can learn a thing or two here if you’re applying for one soon regardless of where the French Embassy is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="schengen visa france" src="http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/schengen-visa-france.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="349" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent study published in The Economists shows that France is one of the easiest countries when it comes to Schengen visa application approval. So you might want to apply at the French embassy when you&#8217;re planning a major eurotrip to have higher chances of bagging that seemingly elusive Schengen visa.</p>
<p>Shawi wants to add quickly though that applying for a Schengen visa at the Austrian Embassy was more relaxing, and the staff friendlier.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article will only focus on tourist visa application.  If you&#8217;re going to France to study or marry, you need to prepare a set of other documents. Please check the <a href="http://www.ambafrance-ph.org/-Embassy-of-France-in-Manila-">French embassy website</a> for more info.</p>

<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What are the requirements for a Schengen visa application at the French Embassy?</span>
<p>WARNING: Applicants submitting incomplete files are at a high risk of denial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">1. Application Form</span>
<p>Signed Schengen visa application form with photo (35mm x 45mm, white background)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">2. Your Identity</span>
<p>Valid passport (3 months&#8217; validity from the end of intended stay) and photocopy of valid and former visas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">3. Purpose of Travel</span>
<p>Write a cover letter explaining the purpose of your trip and proposed day-to-day itinerary. Interestingly, meticulous as they are, they did not actually look for my cover letter, which I did not have in hand should&#8217;ve they asked. (<em>Editor&#8217;s note: Always have it!</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">4. Details Of Your Trip</span>
<p>− Proof of accommodations</p>
<p>For tourists: hotel vouchers (for your entire stay in the  Schengen area). I had a friend (who&#8217;s working in a travel agency) book me a hotel stay (which they call &#8220;dummy booking&#8221;) for two weeks. We agreed to have it canceled once I got my visa. My hotel booking was in France only.</p>
<p>If staying with a French resident: “Attestation d’accueil” (delivered by the City hall where the host is residing – the original must be presented) + copy of that host’s national ID or residence permit (if citizen of a country outside the EU)</p>
<p>− Round trip flight booking (please do not purchase your ticket unless your visa is granted; you can get a flight itinerary from most travel agencies for visa purposes)</p>
<p>− For family visit, proof of relationship with the host (birth certificate, marriage certificate…)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">5. Proof of Employment</span>
<p>− Certificate of employment with monthly salary and leave of absence approved by employer</p>
<p>− If self employed: official business registration for current and previous year</p>
<p>− For priests, nuns and missionaries: certificate from the Apostolic Nunciature and guarantee letter from French and Filipino congregation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">6. Proof of Income</span>
<p>− Income tax return from previous year, if applicable</p>
<p>− Recent bank certification</p>
<p>− Photocopy of the last three months statement of account of the same bank account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">7. Identity / Marital Status</span>
<p>− If married: photocopy of your marriage contract and birth certificate</p>
<p>− If single: photocopy of your birth certificate</p>
<p>− For minors not travelling with either parent, a copy of the DSWD permit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; color: #FDEC4E;">8. Travel Insurance</span>
<p>An international travel insurance (medical expenses and repatriation) covering the entire period of the  person’s intended stay  and valid for all Schengen states. Minimum coverage should be EUR 30,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How much is the Schengen visa processing fee?</span>
<p>The visa fee processing fee is 60 euros (prevailing peso equivalent), payable in cash. Please ask the exact amount to bring when you book your appointment via their call center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What should I wear to the interview?</span>
<p>Anything presentable. I only wore a pair of jeans with a nice blouse. The other applicants dressed to the nines. <em>(Editor&#8217;s note: Agree. Look very presentable. Bawal ang mukhang yagit!)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How is the interview like?</span>
<p>The embassy has 3 windows. First, they will ask for your passport, flight and hotel bookings. Secondly, they will take your biometrics, fingerprint and a digital photo.</p>
<p>The third window is where the actual interview takes place. The interviewer is a Filipino who takes a look at your documents, makes sure they are in order, and asks the questions.</p>
<p>During my interview, he only asked about my previous international trips, where I&#8217;ve been the past few months. He also asked how long I intended to stay in France, to which I replied 2 weeks (which concurred with my flight and hotel bookings).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">Are the interviewers really scary?</span>
<p>In fairness to the interviewers, theirs is a tough job. With the voluminous applications they receive each day, I think it takes quite a skill to foresee whether an applicant will overstay or not.</p>
<p>If you do not really intend to overstay, then the interview should just be a breeze. Just be your natural self and they&#8217;ll see right through your sincerity. Once you clam up, you might be giving away hints that you have other motives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">How long does it take for the Schengen visa to be released?</span>
<p>From the day of the interview (May 2), mine took 7 working days before my visa was released. UPDATE: The French Embassy website states that processing time can be as fast as 5 working days unless further verification is needed. (Download the document <a href="http://www.ambafrance-ph.org/IMG/pdf/Short_stay_-_visit_EN.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span class="shortcode-typography" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; color: #FDEC4E;">What if I get denied? What can I do next?</span>
<p>I am grateful that I have never been denied visas.</p>
<p>Like most embassies I guess, you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you intend to come back to your homeland, and not overstay in their country. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to follow the old proverb, &#8220;Try and try until you succeed.&#8221; <img src='http://www.dreameurotrip.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
