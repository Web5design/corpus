				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In June we are off to Toronto to rub elbows with the travel blogging industry!</p>
<p>Being a relatively young blog, we debated for a little bit whether we should attend this year&#8217;s North American TBEX, but after some encouragement from fellow bloggers we decided to go!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tbex.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3024" alt="tbex" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tbex.jpg" width="600" height="300" /></a></p>
<h1>New kids on the block (or Blog!)</h1>
<p>Our blog has only been alive for about 6 months, so what do we have to offer potential tourism boards and other advertisers? Well a lot, we think. The advantages we have are that our flights are already paid for, so we will not be asking for a large investment of a comped flight. Another thing we have going for us is that our dates are specify, yet not set in stone. We have found our greatest success in requesting freebies is when we request specific dates. On our trip we are going to 30+ countries, so we have a ton of people to pitch. So hopefully our trip will be worth our while, and we can make a bunch of new relationships.</p>
<h1>Getting to Toronto</h1>
<p>Luckily Milwaukee isn&#8217;t terribly far from Toronto, so we have the option to drive or fly. The drive is about 9 hours and we have some friends along the way where we could break up the drive. Option 2: Fly, recently <a title="WestJet" href="http://www.flighthub.com/airlines/westjet" target="_blank">WestJet</a> started to offer some new cheap flights for us. Flying would give us a lot more time at the convention, but there is something appealing about a good old fashioned road trip! Decisions, decisions&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MKE-TRO.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3023" alt="MKE-TRO" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MKE-TRO.jpg" width="990" height="591" /></a></p>
<p>How ever we chose to get there we will definitely be staying in a hostel for the social aspect (and the cost too!). The city and conference will be filled with a bunch of awesome, like minded people that we are excited to meet!</p>
<p>Super excited! If anyone else plans to attend we would love to split a ride or a room,  or at least for a happy hour to swap travel stories!!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Double Digit Day!</h1>
<p>OMG!!! Can&#8217;t believe we are in double digits already. I remember first looking at our countdown until we leave, and it reading over 365. Back then it felt like forever, like it was never going to come, but now its almost scary how fast its coming!</p>
<div id="attachment_1561" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0163.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1561" alt="Aaahhhhhhh! There is so much to do before we leave!!!!!!!!!" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DSC_0163-1024x678.jpg" width="1024" height="678" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aaahhhhhhh! There is so much to do before we leave!!!!!!!!!</p></div>
<h1>I got 99 Problems&#8230;</h1>
<p>There is at least 99 things to do before we leave, and no matter how many things we tick off we find something else to do! Sure 99 days sounds like a long time, but when we look at a calendar March is just about gone, and April is extremely busy with work trips, plus we have almost every weekend booked. May is when we need to get everything finalized, cause there is not a single day open weekend in June, then we leave! Sorry for the mini freakout everyone, but stuff is starting get real (I guess in a good, but stressful way).</p>

<h1>Transportation</h1>
<p>We ended up spending more in this category than we normally would because <a title="Limping across 6 continents" href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/2012/11/01/limping-across-6-continents/" target="_blank">Adam&#8217;s knee is still recovering</a>! The town is very walkable, the beach however is about 7km from the center so bikes or taxis are the way to go. Below is a list of some common destinations via taxi &amp; collectivo (collective taxi vans).</p>
<p>Taxi:</p>
<ul>
<li>City Center to the beach -  $50 each way (add $10-20 on the way back)</li>
<li>Trip with in the Tulum Pueblo (town) &#8211; $20-30 each way</li>
<li>City Center to The Ruins &#8211; $60-70 each way</li>
<li>City Center to Casa Cenote &#8211; $120 each way (You can usually arrange for pick up and pay on your return trip)</li>
</ul>
<p>Collectivo: Best for longer trips, if traveling as a group taxis might be the same or cheaper, and definitely quicker</p>
<ul>
<li>City Center to Ruins &#8211; $25 per person each way</li>
<li>City Center to Akumal &#8211; $30 per person each way</li>
<li>Trips with in town &#8211; $10 per person each way</li>
</ul>
<h1> Not on the cheap!</h1>
<ul>
<li>$130-$160 &#8211; Sunscreen (Make sure to bring your own from home!)</li>
<li>$40 &#8211; Beers on the beach (Nearly Double restaurants in town)</li>
<li>$35 &#8211; 3 pack of Pens (Yes pens, the writing impliment) &#8211; No one in the town has ever has a pen they are too expensive</li>
<li>$25 &#8211; Paper Notebook Office &amp; School Supplies very high priced (so if you plan to take a Spanish class don&#8217;t forget this stuff like we did)</li>
<li>$40-$50 &#8211; Pack of cigarettes (Cheaper than home)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0188.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2449" alt="Mexico Beer 3" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0188-198x300.jpg" width="198" height="300" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York City is one of the most romantic places in the world. Some might think an exotic beach is the epitome of romance, but there are many romantic aspects of this city. This brings to mind the scene in &#8220;Sleepless in Seattle&#8221; when Tom Hanks&#8217;s and Meg Ryan&#8217;s characters met at the top of the Empire State Building at sunset. It doesn&#8217;t get much more romantic than that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB1-e1363648532994.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2952" alt="NYC HB1" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB1-e1363648532994.jpg" width="296" height="454" /></a>The Empire State Building is a very romantic start to a weekend in New York. Go up as high as possible and view the city at sunset before a romantic dinner at some cosy little cafe or bistro. It might be good to go back to the hotel after dinner to take advantage of the alone time it affords.</p>
<p>There are many luxurious and romantic hotels from which to choose, but if this is a budget weekend, the check out HostelBookers as they have a great range of <a title="Cheap Hostels in the centre of New York" href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/usa/new-york-city/" target="_blank">cheap hostels in the centre of New York</a>. If seeing NYC is the objective, the accommodation does not have to cost an arm and a leg, but it should be pleasant for a romantic weekend.</p>
<p>At some point, a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge may be fun. It only takes 15 minutes or so, and it is a New York City icon. Unfortunately, the River Cafe is closed because of storm damage, or that would be the destination. Walk back across and cab it down to Little Italy. Almost anything there is romantic, but try Onieal&#8217;s, site of &#8220;Scout&#8221; on &#8220;Sex in the City.&#8221; Reservations are necessary at just about restaurant in New York.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB2-e1363648628931.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2954" alt="NYC HB2" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB2-e1363648628931.jpg" width="606" height="454" /></a><br />
Always a romantic notion, a carriage ride through Central Park is leisurely and relaxing. Visitors can see the park from a good perspective, and this saves energy for walking around the city. If the ride ends up near 5th Avenue and 57th Street, walk by Tiffany&#8217;s and window-shop like Holly Golightly in &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s.&#8221; A girl can dream.</p>
<p>Consider a ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty, a must see for first-time visitors to New York City. Many visitors return to let their children experience it as they did years before. The ferry ride is windy and romantic&#8211;couples can cling to each other for warmth. It is also a nice view of The Battery and the south end of Manhattan. The statue is open Thursday through Sunday.</p>
<p>Way back up on the north side of Manhattan, the Metropolitan Museum is a visitor magnet, and rightly so. The Impressionist wing on the second floor is certainly romantic, and there is a special exhibit of Monet&#8217;s lilies. All parts of the museum are accessible with admission, of course, so find out what is romantic to you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB3-e1363648590413.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2953" alt="NYC HB3" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NYC-HB3-e1363648590413.jpg" width="560" height="418" /></a><br />
Many visitors want to be kissed in Times Square as a nod to the famous &#8220;Life Magazine&#8221; picture of the sailor kissing the girl in white on V-J Day. That was on August 14, 1945, and over 60 years later, we still re-enact it. Now that is romantic!</p>
<p>The best way to have a romantic trip to New York City is to make your own romantic memories. Feeding each other fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate from Godiva or just walking along a beautiful stretch of Central Park together can be as romantic as anything else. Have a champagne toast to each other at a romantic little cafe like The Place in Greenwich Village. There is nothing like a gourmet dinner and champagne to cap off a romantic trip to the big city.</p>

<h1>Meet Jonny from Don&#8217;t Stop Living</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN26471.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2829" alt="DSCN2647(1)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCN26471-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<h1>The who are you ?&#8217;s</h1>
<p>1. Who are you and where do you hail from?</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;m Jonny Blair, a traveling Northern Irishman. I grew up in the town of Bangor in Northern Ireland in the 1980s. But I left there a decade ago to see the world and have now been to every continent and run a highly informative travel blog called <a href="http://dontstopliving.net" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t Stop Living</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>2. How did you meet your partner in crime? How long have you known each other? or What are the pros &amp; cons of solo travel?</p>
</div>
<p>I have traveled the world for 10 years, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends, sometimes with girlfriends. I met my current girlfriend, Panny Yu (<a href="http://www.travellinghongkonggirl.com" target="_blank">Travelling Hong Kong Girl</a>) in Antarctica in 2010 on a cruise. The pros of traveling with her is I always someone to share the joys of travel with. The cons are having to adapt to her ways and culture. The pros always outweigh the cons. The advantage of solo travel is you end up meeting more people as you interact with strangers more.</p>
<div>
<p>3. What job did you kick to the curb in order to travel?</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve had over 20 different jobs in the last 15 years so I can&#8217;t really say I jacked in a job to see the world, as I work as I move. Though when I left Northern Ireland in 2003 I was working behind a butchery counter and writing a football fanzine. My passion for writing never left me&#8230;in the meantime I have worked in PR for Apple, in a bar on ferries, in farms, pubs and offices as well as doing some teaching. I don&#8217;t have a set career and always see myself as simply a traveler and a writer.</p>
<div>
<p>4. Explain your website name, where did it come from/how did you come up with it?</p>
</div>
<p>Good question! My website is called Don&#8217;t Stop Living. It&#8217;s my motto in life, but I must admit I stole it! It comes from Toronto, Canada where I visited first in 2001. The words were graffiti-ed onto a wall in the city and I jotted them down and noted them for future reference. The biggest irony of all is that I started my travel blog by coincidence also in Toronto in Canada in 2007 (on my second visit), yet I have spent less than 2 weeks of my life in that city! For these reasons, Toronto probably has a place in my heart somewhere. I didn&#8217;t have a digital camera in 2001 so I don&#8217;t have a photo of the graffiti of Don&#8217;t Stop Living which inspired my site&#8217;s name. I actually have a separate site called <a href="http://www.travellingnorthernirelandflag.com" target="_blank">Travelling Northern Ireland flag</a> which is just for my photos of my flag!</p>
<div>
<h1>The fun ?&#8217;s</h1>
<p>1. What&#8217;s the most under-estimated country &amp; why?</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ll pick 3 &#8211; Paraguay and Belarus because nobody else ever goes there. I loved the experiences I had there and they were bereft of tourists!<br />
And thirdly China because the amount of travel you can do in China is endless and totally underestimated! China has over 1000 cities that you have probably never heard of, some of them over 5 million people live there. My recent China exploits have taken me to Kunming, Luoping, Gaobei, Yao Tang and Shuhe. I never get tired of visiting China and I&#8217;m off to Shenzhen and Hangzhou next!</p>
<div>
<p>2. What&#8217;s your biggest travel mishap?</p>
</div>
<p>Escaping a mugging in Venezuela. Getting ripped off in Venezuela. Getting strip searched at the Colombia to Venezuela border. Pretty much Venezuela. A horrible country to visit.</p>
<p>Aside from that in Laos I lost my wallet and camera in the Nam Song river while tubing and in Australia my broken laptop was nicked from our flat while I was out at work &#8211; whoever stole it got a laptop which didn&#8217;t work and was password protected!</p>
<div>
<p>3. What luxuries did you forgo in order to save for your travels?</p>
</div>
<p>I have owned 2 cars in my lifetime so they had to go. Other than that my CD collection turned into my iPod playlist and off I went with a backpack!! I was working 7 days a week in 2 jobs before I left so I can save well when I need to, it wasn&#8217;t a case of selling lots of stuff.</p>
<div>
<p>4. What country has the best $1usd menu? What can one expect to get for $1usd?</p>
</div>
<p>China. Without a doubt! In Jin Ji Cun last week I got 3 beers for $1. Or I got breakfast including a tea for the same price. Or a bus to a waterfall for 50 c. China wins hands down. Though Belarus and Swaziland were also extremely cheap places for me.</p>
<div>
<h1>Quick &amp; Dirty (1-2 word answers)</h1>
<p>1. Favorite beach</p>
</div>
<p>I can&#8217;t just pick one!! Ballyholme Beach, Bangor, Northern Ireland is my favorite but a close runner up is the beach at Neko Harbor in Antarctica. Penguins and icebergs replace sand and surfers. Bliss. Kenting beach on the south tip of Taiwan is also a top spot for sunset.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCF0496.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2831" alt="DSCF0496" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSCF0496-1024x768.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a></p>
<div>
<p>2. #1 must have travel items</p>
</div>
<p>My Passport. My passport is always my number one. Wallets, cameras and clothes can be replaced. A passport (and especially the dated stamps on it) can never be replaced. Camera is a close second as some photos you can never take again.</p>
<div>
<p>3. Zip-off pants or no zip-off pants</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve never owned zip off pants! I carry two pairs of trousers with me &#8211; one tracksuit bottoms, one jeans.</p>
<p>4. Favorite beer</p>
<p>Guinness. Hands down winner! But my hat goes off to Sibebe in Swaziland, Beerlao in Laos, Bintang in Indonesia, Sokol in Slovenia and Kokanee of Canada. I&#8217;ll try any beer and it&#8217;s a big part of traveling to me!</p>
<p>5. Favorite ice-cream flavor</p>
<p>Funny you ask that, as I used to work as an ice cream salesman too. My favorite is caramel.</p>
<div>
<p>6. How many stamps in your passport?</p>
</div>
<p>I just had to replace my last passport as it had no empty pages. It had 86 stamps/visas on it. My latest one is getting full now too! I&#8217;ve had it less than a year but filled 15 pages. I also carry a spare passport as I have dual nationality so if you can get dual nationality, take it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>A</b>hh, the airport. What a relaxing start to the perfect holiday. With each flight you have such a great opportunity to take advantage of the best services, all in one convenient location!</p>
<p>To ensure maximum relaxation this holiday, always fly to your destination!</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t get enough of the convenient airport services that make for such a relaxing holiday. When I book my airline ticket, I like to take advantage of all the great add-ons that make for a worry-free trip. First, I always reserve <a title="Airport Parking from HolidayExtras.co.uk" href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk/airport-parking.html" target="_blank">Airport Parking from HolidayExtras.co.uk </a>in advance to save time and precious money on expensive airport taxi fees. Why waste my money when I can save and secure a stress-free start this holiday. You can always look at doubling up your parking with an airport hotel &#8211; many companies offer great package deals. Check out <a title="Holiday Extras for Birmingham Airport hotels" href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk/birmingham-airport-hotels.html" target="_blank">Holiday Extras for Birmingham Airport hotels</a>, you could save a fortune! On that big day of travel it could possibly get quite hectic, especially when traveling with the family. Between numerous bags, checking in lines, airport security and a mob of anticipating travelers, it is essential you arrive on time to keep the whole family cool amidst the crowds and chaos. With the many sources of entertainment at the airport these days, earlier is better than later. So, just relax and let the airport work its magic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo15.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2931" alt="photo(15)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo15-e1363605235629.jpg" width="1936" height="2592" /></a></p>
<p>The airport is a perfect way to utilize everything you need this holiday, all in one place. Upon arrival, leave plenty of time to get everyone checked in at the desk, before you take off in the mini-mall wonderland of duty-free shopping! Enjoy fantastic finds and great prices that are sure to keep everyone busy before finally taking off. What a great opportunity to pick up anything you missed before heading out to your destination! I always like to relax to my favorite classical music for the longest flights. I remember one time, I left my headphones at home, and it seemed I would be without my music the entire trip. What a bummer. Don&#8217;t let this be you! The airport saved me from my own pesky travel amnesia, so if you are like me and forget those essential items, you can always pick them up at the airport before you fly!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2933" alt="photo(16)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo16-e1363605285573.jpg" width="1936" height="2592" /></a></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t board that plane until everyone has sat down for a delicious family meal within the airport&#8217;s many restaurants and cafes. I just love to sit down and have a drink before the flight to keep the nerves to a minimum before jetting off at such great height! It pains me to say, I&#8217;m always anxious to leave the ground. If you are like me, you will enjoy the benefits of sitting down to a relaxing family diner before taking to the sky. With this, you should have no problem finding peace of mind this holiday. Just be sure to start with simple time management and book your <a title="parking at Gatwick" href="http://www.holidayextras.co.uk/gatwick-airport-parking.html" target="_blank">parking at Gatwick</a> in advance to ensure your smooth transition arrives on time.</p>
<p>Save your money and relax at the airport this holiday. It&#8217;s as simple as that!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes opening a beer without an opener can be done! This was a talent I mastered out of necessity! Have you ever gotten a beer when heading to the beach, only to sit down on your towel and realize you don&#8217;t have an opener?!?!?</p>
<p>I have put together this tutorial for anyone that finds themselves in this same situation. It&#8217;s good to practice before you are stuck, so feel free to follow along with me!</p>
<h1>Step 1: The Grip</h1>
<p>Grip the bottle at the neck, with the side of your thumb against the bottle (meaning your nail facing up). If you grip it with your nail facing out it&#8217;s more likely you are going to pinch your skin when you pry the cap off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo14.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2777" alt="photo(14)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo14-1024x764.jpg" width="1024" height="764" /></a></p>
<h1>2.) The setup</h1>
<p>Adjust your thumb to fit the cap of a bottle, you can position your index finger under your thumb for support if you need it. Also, always use a bottle that is more than half full, empty bottles can work but the flex while you are prying and make it tougher.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2775" alt="photo(7)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo7-1024x764.jpg" width="1024" height="764" /></a></p>
<h1>Step 3: Pry!</h1>
<p><iframe id="_ytid_53950" width="480" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/jiPYsKeX7sU?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=0&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=1&#038;showinfo=1&#038;theme=dark&#038;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen type="text/html" class="__youtube_prefs__"></iframe></p>
<h1>Improvise!</h1>
<p>There are many objects that can do the same thing, another item commonly available while drinking is a lighter. The lighter is a bit trickier, I learned with a plastic bottle, and then progressed to the lighter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2773" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1034px"><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo9.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2773" alt="photo(9)" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo9-1024x764.jpg" width="1024" height="764" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Notice the interesting lighter we brought home from Mexico</p></div><br />
<iframe id="_ytid_93638" width="480" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cHCsuMD07l8?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=0&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=1&#038;showinfo=1&#038;theme=dark&#038;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen type="text/html" class="__youtube_prefs__"></iframe><br />
As you can see the cap comes off with some force so be a good friend and yell &#8216;Heads up&#8217; prior to popping.</p>
<h1>Practice</h1>
<p>A word of warning: this may look easy, but it will take a night of drinking to get it right. You may end up a blister on the thumb region after a night of popping, but it is a small price to pay to be <strong>the hero who can open a bottle without an opener!!!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>More Than Just Refreshing Mojitos: Rediscovering the Best of Cuba&#8217;s Attractions</strong><br />
Cuba is a well-known island state, yet conversely not many people consider as a first choice for a holiday destination. This is because of the severe impact that politics has had on the country, and possibly also because of the trade embargo placed on Cuba by the United States, which forbids their citizens to visit the country. However, visitors from other parts of the world are becoming aware of this large Caribbean island archipelago and Cuba is once more becoming a popular holiday destination. It is suspected that Americans do find their way to Cuba, avoiding the embargo by flying to another country, such as Canada, then on to Cuba from there.</p>
<p>Cuba was claimed for Spain by Christopher Columbus in 1492 and only became independent in 1902. Tourism took off in Cuba, reaching a peak between 1915 and 1930 when tourists flocked to Cuba to escape the rigours of Prohibition. Cuba was a very relaxed place, being open-minded, and there was plenty of alcohol for the visitors to indulge in. At the end of the Great Depression, when Prohibition was repealed, visitor numbers began to fall away slightly, but visitors still came in such numbers that the island was known as the Latin Las Vegas in the 1950s. An oppressive political regime saw tourism dramatically decline, a state of affairs that continued even after the revolt and overthrow of the Batista regime.</p>
<p>It was only in the 1990s that the government decided to push tourism to the forefront in Cuba, needing an income stream to bring in much needed foreign currency. To this end, they restored many of the old hotels and streets, bringing them back to full glory, as well as building many beach resorts. However, there was an isolationist policy in play, aimed at keeping the tourists apart from the locals. This policy was finally abolished in 1997, although many local people cannot afford to visit the resorts and hotels anyway.</p>
<p>The country has year-round warmth and pleasant breezes blowing in from the sea. It does sit across the hurricane belt though, so do be sure to choose your holiday time well!</p>
<p>Havana, the capital city, is a bustling city, with a lively nightlife, perfect for letting your hair down and partying the night away! The Malecon is a fabulous sea-side walk during the day, but at night is the work station for prostitutes, and is best avoided after sundown. Walking the streets of Havana is like stepping back into time to the fifties, even to the &#8216;Yank Tanks&#8217;, huge American cars, that are painstakingly maintained by the locals. The upbeat rhythm of the salsa is heard throughout the town, infusing it with life and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Cuba&#8217;s best known and most notorious export is its fabulous cigars. Find out about Cuba&#8217;s tobacco industry by touring the village of Vinales and its surrounds. You can explore the tobacco fields on foot, or on horseback for an authentically Cuban experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0413.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2885" alt="DSC_0413" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0413-1024x678.jpg" width="1024" height="678" /></a></p>
<p>But of all that the country has to offer, <a title="the beaches and mojitos are a must-try in Cuba " href="http://www.dealchecker.co.uk/cheap-holidays/cuba.html    " target="_blank">the beaches and mojitos are a must-try in Cuba</a>! Santiago de Cuba is a coastal town with a strong Caribbean influence. It has a rich history and there are many interesting sights in Santiago de Cuba, including UNESCO status for both the citadel of San Pedro de la Roca, and for the Baconao Park. To all this is added a wonderful beach where the whole family can laze in the sun and swim in the blue Caribbean sea.</p>
<p>The beach side town of Baracoa is the island&#8217;s former capital. The town offers a tranquil and peaceful getaway, with an ambiance of old-fashioned charm and elegance. The fabulous beaches lie very close to one of the last untouched rainforests on the planet, and guides can take you to marvel over this wonderful sight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cuba.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2880" alt="cuba" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cuba.jpg" width="999" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>Varadero beach lies to the east of Havana and is very popular with tourists. Varadero lies on a peninsula and therefore offers an unprecedented 20 kilometers of white sandy beaches. As well as a wide range of excellent hotels in the 4 and 5 star category Varadero also has a host of natural features to explore; hidden coves and bays, and even mysterious caves!</p>
<p>For those looking for a little thrill, there is the Tropicana, an ex-mafia hangout, or the Cayo Largo – a small island with nudist facilities for those who like to &#8216;let it all hang out&#8217;, so to speak!</p>
<p>Cuba has a wide range of public transport options, including a very good, comprehensive bus service. In fact, there are two major bus operators, one aimed more at the tourist trade, with air-conditioned comfortable buses which boast televisions and built-in washrooms, the other more for the use of the locals, still comfortable, but without quite so many amenities. The local service has a wider network, and is useful for getting to the more out of the way destinations.</p>
<p>Cuba is a beautiful island, in a beautiful setting. The government is working on encouraging visitors to come to Cuba, to explore, interact and learn about the country. Why not consider Cuba when planning your next holiday in the sun.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the many things on our<a title="to-do list" href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/2013/03/08/4-months/"> to-do list</a> was to find a new home for my wedding ring.   As many of you may know her name is &#8220;Bertha.&#8221; Deciding not to wear Bertha <a title="Our Route" href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/our-trip/our-rout/">on our RTW trip </a>was an easy decision!  Ever since we got engaged I have not worn Bertha on almost all of our vacations, except of course to <a title="Our Wedding – One year ago today!" href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/2013/02/12/our-wedding-one-year-ago-today/">Our Wedding</a>.  I typically just wear my wedding band, it is not nearly as flashy and is quite simple.</p>
<div id="attachment_2392" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0849-Version-2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2392 " alt="The rings!" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_0849-Version-2-1024x682.jpg" width="614" height="409" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bertha &amp; her band!</p></div>
<p>For our RTW it was decided it would be best to have no diamonds at all, so we decided to purchase me a &#8220;travel ring.&#8221;  So now I would like to introduce you to &#8220;Aaron.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_2769" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 442px"><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/travelring.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2769  " alt="Aaron has landed!" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/travelring.jpg" width="432" height="576" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aaron has landed!</p></div>
<p>Aaron is actually a men&#8217;s ring, and happens to be the same ring as Adams but not nearly as thick! I really like Aaron, it doesn&#8217;t knock on anything, get in the way, and can fit in all my gloves.</p>
<p>Most of our vacations to date involve a  beach, and beach means water, and water means I will be taking off my ring.  Finding a safe place for a ring can be tricky while traveling.  Where do you put this ring when you travel, in your bag on the beach? In your room? In your room safe?  And if you haven&#8217;t noticed already, we don&#8217;t tend to stay at all-inclusive 5 star hotels.  We also mainly take public transportation buses/trains/subways and sometimes we are the only tourists.  We are also known for finding ourselves in some interesting situations!  So for us, it&#8217;s best not to bring any diamonds at all.</p>

<h1>Why not to travel with diamonds</h1>
<ul>
<li>Draws attention to yourself and potentially making yourself a victim of robbery</li>
<li>Makes you look like you have $$ therefore potentially driving up prices of items when you ask, &#8220;How much is this?&#8221;</li>
<li>You will probably be taking it off for many outdoor activities (pool, snorkeling, swimming, etc.)</li>
<li>Hotel safes are not always safe, have heard toooo many stories of items disappearing in hotel safes</li>
<li>If you ever plan on a night of heavy drinking, I advise leaving the diamonds at home, you never know what can happen (or you might not be able to remember what happen&#8230;&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
<p>So next time you travel think about leaving the diamonds at home, and investing in a travel ring.  Your time on the beach &amp; in the water will be worry free! No more stressing about your ring if it is safe in sound.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On our recent trip to Tulum we forfeited our mornings at the beach to learn some Spanish. This is in effort to be better prepared for our 4+ months in Central and South America later this year. Hannah only had one semester of Spanish in high school, and then whatever she learned from our online class, which we had kinda slacked on. I had two semesters in College, but that was going on 7 years ago. So needless to say we need some help if we plan to get off the tourist tract!</p>
<p>Here were our thoughts of our class and what we will consider next time we book a similar class.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1225.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2510" alt="DSCN1225" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1225-1024x768.jpg" width="717" height="538" /></a></p>
<h1>How Many Hours per Day</h1>
<p>We found that our brains were just about fried by time we completed 5 hours per day of Spanish. It was also the general consensus among our class mates too. Everyone headed to the beach for some quite relaxing time after class, that&#8217;s all we had the brain power for. We plan to take at least two more weeks of similar Spanish classes while traveling and we were considering taking 8 hours a day, but after this week we decided there is no way we could have taken 3 more hours per day!</p>
<div id="attachment_2506" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 471px"><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1133.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2506 " alt="DSCN1133" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1133-e1363055084109-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After 5 hours we needed a nap!</p></div>
<h1>Real life practice</h1>
<p>An important part of helping the new language sink in is to use it in normal everyday situations. We took a daily trips to the markets, talking with vendors and local people to work on developing &#8216;on-the-fly&#8217; thinking and speaking. The only way I would want to have any longer than 5 hours per day is if it were used outside the classroom in real life situations.</p>
<h1>1 on 1 vs. Groups</h1>
<p>Another thing to consider when selecting a school is to see what format you will be taught. There are advantages to both being on your own or learning in a group, but it depends how you learn. When you are paired with just the instructor you are able to ask all the questions you need to understand a topic. On the other hand having the pressure of other students and making sure you keep up, servers as motivation and keeps you learning. Hannah really preferred one on one time, while I found it to be a good challenge learning in a group of slightly more advanced students.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_03211.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2576" alt="DSC_0321" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_03211-678x1024.jpg" width="407" height="614" /></a></p>
<h1>Learning without using English</h1>
<p>I never really understood how travelers could teach English in foreign countries without knowing the local language, until now. In our class we spoke virtually no English all week. The instructors at the school did speak some English, but for the most part did not use it unless it was really necessary. Challenging yourself to ask a question about something you don&#8217;t understand with other Spanish words really helps to drive it in to your brain. By using words we had already learned to describe new things, along with lots of visual props we were able to get by without the use of our first language. It might have looked funny from the outside looking at a group of adults pointing at objects in a pre-schooler&#8217;s book, but it gets the point across.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130215_130801.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2505" alt="20130215_130801" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/20130215_130801-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<h1>Great space</h1>
<p>Since we were still on vacation it was important to us to still be outside with a nice relaxing environment. Our School fit the bill here. All the group tables were under thatched umbrellas, set in a nicely kept garden, all of which helped remind you were still somewhere tropical. Our Tulum School also had a few pets which added to the feel of the place. Hannah being the cat lover she is, had a few study sessions with her gato!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1227.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2513" alt="DSCN1227" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1227-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1230.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2517" alt="DSCN1230" src="http://www.gettingstamped.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSCN1230-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p> We can&#8217;t wait for our next Spanish school sessions.  We will be taking a week of Spanish in Antigua, Guatemala in July  Then one final week of lessons in San Juan del Sur, Nicaragua.  We plan on doing homestays our next time around, we hope living with a local family will only enhance our skills and emerse ourselves in culture.</p>
<p>Have you ever taken any language classes abroad? Any reccomendations?</p>
