			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;What am I supposed to do when I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;m feeling? Ever. I&#8217;ve tried writing, but I don&#8217;t even know how to start.&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3281"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>omg. You are literally me. I have so many journal entries with phrases like “I guess I don’t really feel anything, but that’s the situation” OR “Everyone is making it seem like I should be super emotional right now, but I’m just not” … And I think that’s okay? I guess, I don’t know. I just have always been this way, stuff doesn’t affect me the same way it affects others?!</p>
<p>I’ve been in a situation where someone will say or do something and a friend will ask, “aren’t you so pissed?!” and I will literally be like, “No, I mean, I don’t really care…” and everyone thinks I’m so weird. But I DON’T THINK I AM, I think i just dont get mad/sad/whatever as easily as some people.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I do think about my experiences and write about them. Regardless of the emotion that comes along with it, writing down what is going on in your life can still be wonderful and peaceful and helpful in figuring out who you are as you grow into the human you will be for the rest of your life. I suggest you continue to write, don’t over think it, just treat your journal like an old friend, say what’s going on in your life and if you feel something SO BE IT, feel it, write it, analyze it, but if you don’t, who cares?! Just keep swimming*</p>
<p>*writing</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>I have to agree on the whole “just keep swimming / writing” part of Dannielle’s advice —- I think that the first part of this is just to stop expecting your writing to be any one thing. Your writing could be a list of facts or events or dates or feelings or thoughts or anything you want it to be, and I think that in allowing it to take any shape it wants you will also find that you get more out of the experience.</p>
<p>Insofar as not quite knowing what you are feeling, well that is a huge part of being a human. I am not sure how old you are, but I can tell you that my progression with feelings has been something like this:</p>
<p>12 &#8211; 17: I AM YELLING I AM CRYING THAT IS SO FUNNY SHUT UP WHY AM I CRYING WHO NEEDS SLEEP SHUT UP MOM DOOR SLAM HAHAHAHAHA CRYING AGAIN LIFE IS AWESOME EVERYTHING IS WHEEEEEEE</p>
<p>17 &#8211; 29: I have a lot of thoughts and a lot of feelings and let’s make out okay sure let’s make out again ugh life is so complicated and confusing now I am crying but I am also thinking and writing and hahahahahahaha who needs a job anyway ughhhhhh i need money i hate everything everything is unfair but life is so beautiful i wonder who i am.</p>
<p>30 &#8211; 32: Oh, well shit. I think I know why I get so upset about this thing and why this bothers me so now I can connect those things sometimes but UGH OMG EVERYTHING IS TOO MUCH AND OVERWHELMING AND I DON’T UNDERSTAND ANYMORE AND WHY IS ohhhhhhh right, that thing happened and so then the other thing happened and that’s why I got overwhelmed. I should save money for the future. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the best.</p>
<p>What that all means is, as you grow you start to learn and understand more about your feelings and develop a greater appreciation for 90s television. It is okay if you are confused and overwhelmed by your feelings and not quite understanding them… that happens to all of us, and the best thing that you can do is just be aware of yourself and allow that confusion alongside all of the other experiences.</p>
<p>You are already paying attention to what is happening in your brain and heart, and that is the best thing you could ever do. Not unlocking it all is okay. Be patient, and enjoy the ride.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I think when people cheat it’s selfish to tell the person they cheated on. If you want to stay with them isn’t it just better to shut up and not hurt them?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3279"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>I think the act of cheating is selfish. Besides, aren’t most cheaters found out anyway?</p>
<p>I mean, really, not telling the person is just kind of cowardly. If you want to be in a relationship with someone, don’t cheat on them. Period. There is no “cheat on them, but don’t say anything” rule because cheating isn’t a thing that should happen in the first place. If you <em>want</em> to be in a relationship with someone and they want to be in a relationship with you, you build a trust that you hope will not be broken. Cheating breaks that trust and lying about it breaks that trust even further.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, if you do cheat on someone, the only way the two of you will be able to work through that is if you tell them. The action was bad, yes, but lying about it is worse. There are second chances in life, people can work through things, but NONE of that is possible if you’re not being honest. Talk about it, be open, admit your mistakes, try to work together. Lying never solves problems, communication does.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>A. GREE.</p>
<p>I certainly do not think it is selfish to be honest with your partner about a mistake that you’ve made. I think the reason that people generally <em>don’t </em>tell their partner about cheating is because they don’t want to lose their relationship… and that, in my opinion, is the selfish act.</p>
<p>I understand that what you are trying to communicate is, “If I know it meant nothing and I know they won’t understand, then why put them through all of the hurt when it won’t happen again,” but… honestly, f**k that. You mess up, you own it. Sure, they might not understand, sure you might lose a relationship or have some serious issues to work through because of those actions &#8211; but if a person goes so far as to <em>take </em>those actions, they need to own them and be honest.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what: if you cheat on a person and you are super upset about it and it was a one time thing and you messed up and you will never do it again and you TALK to your partner, you might lose them, but you might also be able to work through it. If you cheat on a person and never tell them and some day, down the line, they find out… then you aren’t just a cheater. You’re a liar, too.</p>
<p>Short answer: No, it’s not selfish. If you cheat, you own up to that. End of story.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;So, I love your blog and I read it all the time, and I am a straight female and sometimes I will talk to my boyfriend about it&#8230; and he says &#8220;your a lesbian because you read a website called everyone is gay&#8221; i explain to him over and over how you guys give advice to EVERYONE&#8230; anyways my point is how do I get my boyfriend to stop calling me a lesbian?!?!?!?!&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3277"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>I would prolly just say “SHUT YOUR MOUTH HOLE THEY ANSWERED MY QUESTION AND I’M STRIAGHT BUT ‘EVERYONE IS STRAIGHT’ LOOKS STUPID ON A T-SHIRT AND ALSO THAT’S NOT THE POINT AND ALSO YOU OWE ME A PRESENT” and then he’ll be like “they answered your question?” and you’ll be like “oh…yea, wanna see” and he’ll be like “yea” and you’ll be like CLICK CLACK TYPE BOOKMARK CLICK CLACK and you’ll show him and he’ll be like “holy crap that’s so cool” and you can be like “you’re gay now”</p>
<p>and then walk away.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>ALSO, Boyrfriend, if you are still reading even after your gf just walked out of the room I have more to tell you:</p>
<p>Gay people and trans people and straight people and bi people and pan people and asexual people and ALL THE PEOPLE feel lots of feelings about love and sex and life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and there are a whole ton of occasions where you might be reading the advice we gave to someone who is real different from you but you find commonality and you learn something. That doesn’t mean that all of a sudden you like penises on your butt, it means that you are a human and I am human and we have hearts and brains and emotions and stuff. Life experiences overlap.</p>
<p>Your girl loves you and she loves our advice. If her taste in advice is anything like her taste in men YOU MUST BE ONE FLY MOTHAF*CKA… so cut the narrow-minded nonsense, eh?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I tried to host a party and nobody came. I&#8217;m terribly humiliated, but I don&#8217;t want to throw in the towel on having a social life. Also, I&#8217;m reasonably confident that many of the people I invited actually like me and would be fine spending time with me. How can I be a more successful host in the future?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>- Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3265"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>I vote start small.</p>
<p>I hosted my first party last fourth of July and I WAS TERRIFIED. I had just moved back to Chicago and I was sooooo nervous that no one would show up. It’s like what if everyone already has plans and they like other people better than me? WHAT IF YOU GUYS WHAT IF!?!?</p>
<p>Anyway, it was totally fine, but I did this trick where I invited my besties first and said “I’m gonna have some snacks and invite some more people, but like, if it’s just the five of us I won’t be mad.” My besties were basically like ‘lol, yea who cares.’ And that calmed me down A LOT.  Partly because I knew at least a few people would be there and partly because they were obligated by best friendship and could not crap out on me.</p>
<p>ALSO, if it’s event focused, people are more likely to come. So, if you have like a ‘BACHELOR SEASON FINALE PARTY’ and people are ALREADY planning to celebrate the Bachelor Season Finale (who isnt??!) then they will be like ‘oh yea lets go to JamieLynn’s house!!’ you know?</p>
<p>And… I promised caprisun at my party… so that was a thing, too.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>Dannielle covered most everything, in my opinion. So, what I have to add is the following:</p>
<p>I like you. I like that you are like, “You know, I know these people like me so I know that it is just something that needs to change in the formula.” You aren’t like, “UGH NO ONE CARES EVERYTHING IS STUPID,” which I think would be a common response &#8211; and wouldn’t be correct in the least. So. This is me asking for an invitation because I like POSITIVE PEOPLE.</p>
<p>Apart from starting small, having a central theme, and providing Capri Sun, I believe that having the invitation look similar to this would also be very helpful:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;Hi Kristin and Dannielle, Do you guys have any suggestions on what to write as a first message to girls on online dating sites? I usually try and pick something specific in their profile and ask something or comment about it (let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s usually about one of their favorite tv shows), but girls hardly ever respond. I guess I&#8217;m trying to treat it as a conversation starter, but maybe that&#8217;s not the right way to go? Thanks!&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>- Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3263"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>This is SO HARD YOU GUYS. I think the absolute best suggestion I can give is BE YOUR SELF. I know it sounds stupid, but if I were to get a message that said “hey I think you’re attractive and we should meet up” I would roll my eyes and click ‘delete’ immediately. BUT HOWEVER THO, If I got a message that said “Hey I noticed you also cry while listening to Taylor Swift, so we have that in common…” I would giggle like an idiot and respond within four seconds.</p>
<p>It’s super important that you’re the same human online as you are in real life. If you message someone ‘hey sexy’ and they respond ‘letz hook up’ and then you hang out and you hide your face the whole time and giggle, it’s just GOING TO BE WEIRD. SO, be you. Be exactly the type of human you’re going to be WHILST dating someone.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, you wanna find someone who will like you for being nervous and uncomfortable and awkward. So, if you’re messaging someone and you say “hi, so … you like Pretty Little Liars…” and they roll their eyes and don’t respond, WHO CARES, why would you want them to respond anyway!? You know? You want the girl who will be like “LOL YEA I DO, OMG I’M SO AWKWARD AND YOU’RE AWKWARD LETS DATE.” Keep. Being. You.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>Yeah… I think my advice would be to be yourself (as touted by the lovely Dannielle Owens-Reid) and also to let things evolve slowly.</p>
<p>If I got a message from someone that was like, “Hey, I’m also in Season 4 of Buffy OMG IT’S SO INTENSE RIGHT.” I would be like “AHHHH YES HOLY SHIT.” However, if the message was, “Hey, I totally watch Buffy, too, we should get together and watch it!” I would be like… I DON’T EVEN KNOW YOU STEP OFF.</p>
<p>Do you see what I mean? Let the point of your first contact be simple, to the point, and real.</p>
<p>Also, also &#8211; dating sites are not the best way to reflect on your abilities in getting dates. I know that sounds a little weird, but like, it is VERY difficult to get a grasp of someone’s personality through just a few sentences, a list of thoughts, and some pictures. So, when you don’t get a response from people &#8211; try to remember that it doesn’t reflect negatively on you as a person. Most times it has to do with a million other factors that are impossible to know through a computer screen.</p>
<p>All we can do is put ourselves out there and be nice. You are doing everything right &#8211; just be you, give it time and space, and you will find the people who share common interests and who are in the headspace to connect.</p>

<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>VACATIONZZZZ!!! I mean, it sounds so silly, but take vacations together and I don’t mean anything extravagant, I just mean take one or two days every once in a while where the two of you are just TOGETHER.</p>
<p>You’re in kind of an awesome place where you absolutely want to be getting down and your boo wants to get down, but you don’t have time. So now literally all you have to do is make time! Which is so easy. I mean, I understand not being able to make time ALL THE TIME, but you have to take a day or two. OR you could just switch things around so you have a few days where you both start work later or take a half-day or something. There are so many ways to work around schedules.</p>
<p>It seems so silly to make a schedule together, but you totally should. ALSO, you could make an actual paper calendar where your sexy days have pictures of sexy things. That way it’ll be fun and also you’ll remember because the calendar on the wall will have a giant picture of boobs?</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>Sexy calendar for the win.</p>
<p>I know this is likely a more simple answer than you were after… but you just have to <em>make </em>the time. Right now you have to make time for work, and it sounds like you are making time for other people &#8211; which, like you said, is important. However, making time for sex is also important.</p>
<p>Sure, spontaneous sex is wonderful and great and awesome, and I am sure that here and there it is a thing that will still happen. What you are asking about, though, is staying intimate with your boo when your lives are super busy. That requires dedication and work, and even though spontaneous sex is totally awesome… usually planned sex only feels “planned” for the first nanosecond.</p>
<p>Twice a week, mark off a time on your calendars that works for both of you (and please use Dannielle’s suggestion of marking those calendars with boobs and stuff). Look at it like any other commitment and push forward into the land of sexy. Take it a step further and if you’ve blocked off 7pm-8pm, text her a few times during the day with some idea of things you might do…</p>
<p>I believe in you.<br />

<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3258"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>1. Turn on a Tegan and Sara song.<br />
-If you went to iTunes and had trouble choosing, you are a lesbian.<br />
-If you went to YouTube and had to look up how to spell “tegan” you are not.</p>
<p>2. Answer: What is your favorite season of The L Word?<br />
-If you say, “It’s a tie between Season 3 and Season 5,” you are a lesbian.<br />
-If you say, “Oh, I’ve been meaning to watch that,” you are not.</p>
<p>3. Answer: Flannel or converse?<br />
-If you thought, “LOL you can’t have one without the other,” you are a lesbian.<br />
-If you thought, “for what?” You are not.</p>
<p>4. Whitney.<br />
-If you thought “Slice me off a piece,” you are a lesbian.<br />
-If you thought “Houston?” You are a gay man.</p>
<p>5. Answer: Do you wanna bone womenz only?<br />
-Yes? You are a lesbian.<br />
-No? You are not.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>First I’d like to take the above quiz:</p>
<p>(1) I didn’t have trouble choosing, but I knew how to spell Tegan / (2) Season Carmen. / (3) Both, always. / (4) Houston. / (5) Who knows. Probably.</p>
<p>I think this means I am a mostly-lesbian-partial-gay-man.</p>
<p>Next, I’d like to give you my one hint:</p>
<p>Say aloud: “Hi my name is {your name}, and I am a lesbian.”</p>
<p>- If you want to make out with girls and you love the way that sounds &#8211; good for you, you are a lesbian.</p>
<p>- If you love to make out with girls and you hate the way that sounds &#8211; good for you, you can be whatever you want or you can just be {your name}.</p>
<p>- If you don’t love to make out with girls, YOU SHOULD TRY HARDER.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;So, I got offered the perfect internship this summer but, if I take it, I would be far away from my serious boyfriend. I&#8217;m studying abroad right now, so we&#8217;ve already been apart since November and it&#8217;s really hard for both of us. So do I choose love or career? Decisions are so hard guys!&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3256"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>You have, like, 80 years of life left and you can be in love for all of those, but this internship will happen ONCE for TWO MONTHS. I always, always, always vote career in these situations.</p>
<p>I sound like the biggest asshole, but the thing is, you want to be with someone who will support your success and who loves when you’re offered cool shit. I mean, love is love you guys and if it’s supposed to work it, it absolutely will. I have friends who were long distance for 6 years, but they made it work and now they’ve been married and in the same home for 5 years. So, IT WORKED OUT.</p>
<p>The bottom line: If you don’t take the internship ONLY because of love, you’ll end up resenting your booboo for holding you back. I didn’t go on tour with Katy Perry bc of someone I was dating and I’m STILL PISSED.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>YOU COULD HAVE GONE ON TOUR WITH KATY PERRY?!<br />
**calls Dannielle for details*</p>
<p>Personally, I do not think Dannielle sounds like an asshole at all. You take the internship. If this were something where you would be away for an exceptionally long period of time then perhaps I would say, “talk it over with your boo, weigh the pros and cons, etcetera,” but this is NOT a long period of time. I know, I know, I am aware of how long even a few days feels without the person you love &#8211; but a few months where you are doing something brilliant will fly by. Trust. Me.</p>
<p>What’s more, I have found that time away from your boo can actually be really wonderful for your relationship. Missing someone is healthy. Planning Skype dates and sending pictures of your adventures or your boobs to each other &#8211; those are fun things that don’t happen as much when you are in the same city.</p>
<p>Take the internship.</p>
