			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I came out when I was 15, and I&#8217;ll be 23 soon. I&#8217;ve only dated 1 girl in that time, and I&#8217;m not really attracted to other girls as much as I used to be. I feel like I&#8217;m a bad gay. I hate cats and softball. I don&#8217;t listen to any &#8220;gay&#8221; bands; I don&#8217;t hook up and think uhauling is silly. Am I still gay if I don&#8217;t fit the stereotype?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>- Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3321"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>Stereotypes are so interesting because we all fight and fight and fight to NOT be judged based on our labels, but then WE JUDGE EVERYONE ELSE BASED ON THEIR LABELS.</p>
<p>It makes no sense. I am totally a gay, but people think I’m so weird bc I’ve only seen 3.5 seasons of The L Word, I have no interest in The Real L Word, I only own 4 Tegan &amp; Sara songs, I don’t go to gay bars, I’ve never been good at any sport, I would rather shave my entire head than just half of it, and I don’t own a pair of converse. BUT SO WHAT!?</p>
<p>The other day someone asked me if I owned the new Tegan &amp; Sara album and I said “No, but I’ve heard good things, do you like it?!” and they LAUGHED AT ME….this human literally thought I was ridiculous for having not heard A MUSICAL SONG… Are you kidding me??</p>
<p>We are all so different and these differences need to be celebrated not judged. I don’t know what happens in our heads that makes us decide, “oh! we’re attracted to the same types of people THEREFORE, you must be exactly like me or you are kicked out of the club” … STOP THIS RIGHT NOW. If you are disappointed when someone is different from you, you are doing an injustice to yourself and everything we are fighting for: equality.</p>
<p>You, anonyMOUSE, are perfect just the way you are, anyone who says that’s not true is an idiot.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>This whole situation drives me mad but also fascinates me to no end. So let me talk about it in two parts:</p>
<p>1) It drives me mad. This has most everything to do with what Dannielle said above; we shouldn’t require that other people behave just like us in order to fit any particular identity. When you like boobs it doesn’t automatically mean you like flannel. GET OVER IT, PEOPLE.</p>
<p>2) It fascinates the hell out of me. This has most everything to do with the fact that, as people who often feel “othered” in mainstream society, we have a tendency to create our own societal norms and touchstones. It is a means of saying, “Hey, I know this thing and you know this thing and we all know this thing and we have a COMMUNITY.” In that sense, I think it is pretty badass. It’s nice that Dannielle and I can make a joke about converse sneakers and lesbians and most everyone laughs hysterically &#8211; it makes all those people who are laughing feel safer, more supported, more understood, and less isolated.</p>
<p>So, based on those two feelings I will now move on to my CONCLUSION. No, Anonymous(e)… you are absolutely not weird or abnormal or anything except for a totally unique and brilliant person whose sexuality makes up one facet of a much larger individual. Own what you like and do not feel pressured to listen to music or wear clothes that you don’t like &#8211; we are<em>all </em>different and that is so important to remember. To all of you out there who love the cultural touchstones that exist out there for the identity that you claim, that is awesome and wonderful &#8211; but that does not make it OBLIGATORY. I am no less gay than you if I don’t understand the joke you made about Shane and Carmen. Stop putting up walls and making others feel like they don’t belong if they don’t identify the exact way you do. CAPISH?!</p>
<p>Thanks, byeeeeee.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I grew up as the youngest of four girls&#8230; All my life I&#8217;ve just wanted to be the best at something. I was never the smartest, or the prettiest, the most compassionate. I was always just the youngest. I struggle in my current life and relationships because I always feel like someone is out performing me. I never feel like I&#8217;m the best, I never feel like I&#8217;m number one. How do I settle for second best?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>-Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3318"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>What I suggest is going to sound impossible, but I promise it is not. Stop comparing yourself to others. We are all incredible in our own ways, we are unique, talented, and incredible. If there are certain skills you want to hone, YOU CAN, you can take classes, look up youtube videos, try again and again and again. You could be the greatest vegan baker in your family, the most talented kayaker, the fastest knitter. There is always something at which you can be the best in a small group of people.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I want to put this in perspective for you. This year Meryl Streep has been nominated for 17 oscars, she only won 3. THREE. MERYL STREEP HAS BEEN NOMINATED SEVENTEEN TIMES AND ONLY WON THREE. Parks and Recreation has been nominated for 10 Emmys, AND WON ZERO. They have won no Emmy, ever. Mean Girls WASN’T EVEN NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR OR GOLDEN GLOBE.</p>
<p>The world is weird, super weird, we have a weird way of putting certain people or things on a pedestal based on real dumb shit.</p>
<p>You are incredible. You are the only you in the entire world. THE ONLY ONE. No one will ever be able to compare to you because you are the number one most beautiful, compassionate and brilliant you in the world. Be proud of who you are and who you will be in the future. When you get down because someone is “better” than you at something, appreciate that you have incredible people in your life and strive to make them proud of you. Beyonce says you get one day to feel less than amazing, ONE DAY, and then you use that shit as motivation to be even more incredible.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>How about this, though? You aren’t second best. Your mind <em>thinks</em> it is second best, but that is only because of the way you are positioning things. There are a hundred gabillion people on this planet, which means that there are a ton of humans that might excel past you and a ton of humans that you will excel past. The thing about that fact, though, is that it shouldn’t lead you to want to be “better” than any specific person. It should lead you to want to achieve the things <em>you </em>want to achieve the way <em>you </em>want to achieve them… because being better than other people doesn’t mean jack shit unless you are literally going for a gold medal.</p>
<p>I am certainly not the best advice giver on the planet. I am not the best writer. I am not the funniest person. I don’t know how to knit. I am really bad at running. I am really good at watching old episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I am certainly not the best. The thing is… none of the matters to me, because I focus as much of my energy as I can on not comparing myself to others, but rather setting goals and standards for myself.</p>
<p>I know when I answer an advice question and it could have been better. I know that there are a lot of papers I wrote in college that deserved more attention. I know that the work we do creating webcasts is the absolute BEST that I can do given the circumstances. I am proud of the things that I achieve for myself.</p>
<p>When you have that itch in your middle that says, “I just wish I could be as good as that other person,” take a moment. Stop in your tracks. Remember  that there is always someone we can compare ourselves to and that those comparisons get us nowhere. Reflect on what you want for yourself. Keep your focus there.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;Ok, so. My girlfriend is totally hot. She has the perfect body and the perfect boobs and i&#8217;m just like, blehhhhh. Is it weird that im kind of jealous of her?! And how do i stop this feeling and just enjoy her body instead of envy it?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>- Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3316"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>What an AWESOME PROBLEM TO HAVE.</p>
<p>“Hi i’m anonymous and my girlfriend is super hot and i love her body, HEEEELLLLP”</p>
<p>K, I’m done making fun of you.</p>
<p>I think you should talk more out loud about all the things you love about your girlf. AAAANNND talk to her about the parts of your body she loves. BECAUSE HERE IS THE THING, you’re jealous that her body is perfect for you, but your body is probably also perfect for her. Does that make sense? She loves your thighs, your back dimples, your stomach, your clavicle, etc. and you’re not even thinking about how awesome those parts of you are, because you’re too busy loving every part of her.</p>
<p>Look at yourself, appreciate yourself, love yourself. We are all so perfect in our own little ways. BTW if you do have this conversation with her, and the two of you talk about all the things you love about one another’s bodies… YOU WILL FEEL SO GREAT ABOUT YOU… aaaaaand you’ll probably end up making out AND STUFF.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>Hear, hear.</p>
<p>I think that you should absolutely have those above conversations, and I think that your girlfriend’s image of you is crucial to understanding how beautiful you truly are —- but I also think that you should think more about why you are unhappy with your own body.</p>
<p>If you just love the way her waist bends and the way her boobs boob, then you are viewing specific parts of her body’s form which you can’t necessarily achieve for yourself (because you have your own waist bends and your boobs boob in their own unique way), but if you are like, “Man, her waist is a little flatter than mine and I like that,” or “I wish my thighs were a little more firm,” then this might also be about you wanting to start exercising or eating better or becoming more active so that you can feel <em>healthier</em> instead of aiming to look “as good as” your boo.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>If this is about how your curves and bends make you appealing to her &#8211; then all you need to do is express those feelings you have and use conversation (and making out) to help you build on that confidence for yourself. If you think that part of that jealousy is coming from you wanting to be more motivated in the path toward being healthy &#8211; then this is a combination approach: talk to her about your feelings, and also make positive changes in your own life (and perhaps you can make them together!) so that you begin to also feel more centered for yourself.</p>
<p>Tadaaaaa.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a relationship last this long &#8211; how is it supposed to feel when that initial honeymoon everythingisawesomeandyouaretotallyflawless phase wears off?&#8221;</h6>
<p><em>- Question submitted by Anonymous</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3310"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says:</strong></h2>
<p>I think it feels different for every human? I’ve only made it past the honeymoon phase, like, once in my entire life. I haven’t had many relationships make it past 6 or 7 months, TO BE HONEST.</p>
<p>For me, the one time I got past the honeymoon phase, it didn’t really stop. Sure, things were more routine, we got in a few fights, things were a little more serious, etc. BUT I would still be like ‘omg you’re so cute’ and I would think she was a funny little idiot and I wanted to hear about her day and I wanted to giggle and I loved seeing movies and none of that ever went away.</p>
<p>I think your feelings become deeper and they mean something more, but I don’t think the honeymoon feelings are every supposed to go away? Maybe I’m wrong, but technically it’s an opinion so I CAN’T BE WRONG. BOOM.</p>
<p>Your feelings will mean different things. Instead of thinking your boo is perfect, you love her because of her imperfections. Instead of thinking she does nothing wrong, you talk through the mistakes you’ve both made and come to a compromise that makes you both happy. Instead of going out to dinner, you start to love when she cooks for you. Instead of her watching the shows you love, you watch the stupid shows she loves. Things change, but it’s for the better. The honeymoon phase is over, but everything is still the greatest.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>I agree and I think that a lot of people have an opinion of what is “supposed to happen” after the initial falling-in-love-and-getting-googly-eyed part of a relationship is over. A lot of us think it’s okay if some of the magic goes away or if we don’t keep up with date nights or if we start to talk less about our feelings or the love notes taper, etc…</p>
<p>I whole-heartedly disagree.</p>
<p>I think that as the honeymoon stage wears off, a relationship definitely requires more work and more attention &#8211; but I think that those feelings of overwhelming love should remain, and I also think that every effort should remain to keep the little (but huge) elements of care and love present.</p>
<p>What <em>should</em> it feel like? I don’t know how to answer that since we all process things differently, but I can tell you what it has felt like for me and you can take from it what you will. For me, it feels like a love that is so much more nuanced and so much deeper than an initial honeymoon phase, but with those elements of EEEEILOVEYOU woven in to the overall picture. It feels like something that is fragile in places that need care, and strong as hell in the places that keep us together. It feels like a journey that is filled with certainty, though also peppered with doubts and confusions that comes with life’s ups and downs.</p>
<p>It feels good to wake up together and good to go to sleep together and good to make breakfast together and good to buy new shoes together, and sometimes you cry and maybe sometimes you yell… but the overall and underlying feeling should be wonderful, challenging, and ever-changing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I do this thing where I date people and make them really happy but then one day I get bored and walk away. Its not out of malice but I keep on leaving people heartbroken after being treated so well for no better reason than I got bored. I feel like such a shitty person because of this but I don&#8217;t know what to do to change it. HELP?!&#8221;</h6>
<p>- Question submitted by <a href="http://fluffy-noodle.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">fluffynoodle</a></p>
<p><span id="more-3308"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>It’s so weird because my instinct is to let you know you’re not a jerk and you can’t help how you feel. I mean, what are you supposed to do?? You can’t fake feelings and you can’t continue a relationship wherein you’re not happy!</p>
<p>I think, if I were you, I’d be as honest as possible. We all know there’s a point in a new relationship where you talk about past relationships. WHEN THAT MOMENT COMES, BE HONEST. Instead of saying ‘yea it just didn’t work out,’ tell the truth. Your feelings faded and you have no idea why, things weren’t fun and exciting anymore, you didn’t see yourself with the person and it seemed unfair to continue dating.</p>
<p>In some cases, people will be like, “wait, you got bored and gave up” and then they’ll make judgements about you based on your past. Anytime someone makes a judgement about you based on something in the past, things don’t turn out well. In other cases, people will be like, “that’s happened to me before, here’s to hoping we’re not one of THOSE couples” and then you’ll giggle and make out and maybe that relationship will last a lot longer than you thought.</p>
<p>If you’re totally over a relationship and you’re being kind and thoughtful, you’re doing all the right things. If you’re at the beginning of a relationship and you’re being totally honest, you’re also doing all the right things.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>I think there might be a little more going on here than just “all of a sudden getting bored.” I mean &#8211; if you had this happen once, then I would have different advice… but you are explaining this as a pattern that continues to happen, so I think that this warrants some self-reflection.</p>
<p>I agree with Dannielle’s advice on what to do when you are <em>in </em>that situation &#8211; be honest, be honest, be honest.</p>
<p>However, what kind of factors lead you into those relationships in the first place? Are you considering the things that you like and want in a relationship when you first enter into one? Are you more concerned with having SOMEBODY to snuggle / makeout / etc with and so therefore putting a little less focus on the longterm things that keep love going? What, exactly, <em>makes</em> you feel bored? Is it the conversations? The sex? The attraction? All of it?</p>
<p>Here’s something to notice: When you described your relationships you said you always “make them really happy,” but… you didn’t say anything about <em>you</em> being happy.</p>
<p>I know that you don’t often turn to an advice site to get asked more questions… so I apologize. However, this is a situation that is bigger than simply being honest with others &#8211; this is a situation where you should challenge yourself to be honest with… yourself. Reflect on things. Journal at the start, the middle, and the end of your next relationship. Pay attention to the specifics and start to really pull them apart.</p>
<p>Relationships are an incredible way to get insight into some of the things happening in your brain and heart and head. Be honest. Be kind. Reflect. Work. You will figure it out and things will become a lot clearer and easier to navigate over time.</p>

<p><span id="more-3305"></span></p>
<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>Everyoneisbi.com</p>
<p>Ugh… that does not look cute, but you guys, WHATEVER. I would like to, on behalf of the entire community, apologize to you. I am so sorry that ANYONE ON EARTH has made you feel like being who you are is anything less than perfect. I am sorry that people in YOUR OWN community, have made you feel like you must ‘choose.’ I am sorry that the very world which tells you to accept everyone, has made you feel completely unaccepted.</p>
<p>You, my dear friend, are not cheating on anything. You’re not cheating the gays, you’re not cheating the straighties. You’re not cheating.</p>
<p>You’re literally just recognizing a piece of yourself. I think that’s awesome. If anyone looks you in the eye and says something negative about the way you identify, give them a good solid punch in the throat and say it’s from me. ******</p>
<p>You are perfect. You are bi. You are going to fall in love with the greatest human.</p>
<p>******everyoneisgay.com doesn’t want you to punch people.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>Cheating on what?<br />
You know?!</p>
<p>People like people like people like PEOPLE. It’s like… just because I happen to bone ladies and have exclusively mashed mouths with ladies for the past howevermany years doesn’t mean that I don’t think some boys are SUPER FINE, and doesn’t mean that if presented with the right opportunity I wouldn’t have mashed my mouth on another boy’s mouth. So what even makes me gay and not bi or pan or {insert newest term used to describe something that I might be}? Me thinking some boys are cute doesn’t mean that I am any less attracted to ladies. You liking whoever you like doesn’t make you any less of anything.</p>
<p>You aren’t cheating. You are saying that you are attracted &#8211; romantically, sexually, or otherwise &#8211; to various human beings and that those attractions are not solely dependent on one form of gender presentation. You are being honest with yourself and with others about those attractions. You have decided that those attractions align you with the identity known as “bisexual.” You are a real person. Your feelings are real and valid and fucking amazing.</p>

<h2><strong>Dannielle Says:</strong></h2>
<p>HI I AM YOUR PROM EXPERT, DANNIELLE, NICE TO MEET YOU.</p>
<p>I think you should wear a nice pair of pants, a fitted button-up, a nice vest OR BLAZER DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE, a good pair of shoes and a bow tie.</p>
<p>Now, if the bow tie is overboard, go without! You want to feel confident. There are some outfits SLASH clothing items that I really want to wear, but I just can’t because I feel dumb and, YOU GUYS, if you feel dumb, you won’t have a good time and you’ll hate all of the pictures. SO MAKE SURE YOU FEEL GOOD. Wear bright colors and fun ties and just FEEL AWESOME.</p>
<p>Prom is a fancy night, so you want to get in the fancy mood with some fancy clothes (but you guys spending 500$ is a tiny bit silly). Find diff pieces at diff stores. Sign up for email lists so you know when stuff is on sale. Don’t go overboard, get stuff you’ll wear again!</p>
<p>Suggested shops: J Crew Factory, Top Shop, ASOS, THRIFT STORES.</p>
<p>Try to match these looks!! <a href="http://www.x17online.com/zac_efron/Zac_GQ_Cover.jpg" target="_blank">PICTURE ONE</a>, <a href="http://www.thefollowfashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/jcrew-spring-summer-2013-1-630x486.jpeg" target="_blank">PICTURE TWO</a>, <a href="http://i702.photobucket.com/albums/ww30/theurbangent/0915016c.jpg" target="_blank">PICTURE THREE</a>,<a href="http://www.ifiwereaguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jcrew-men.jpg" target="_blank">PICTURE FOUR</a>, <a href="http://images0.chictopia.com/photos/Akudosochim/5537862730/velvet-topman-shoes.jpg" target="_blank">PICTURE FIVE</a></p>

<p>I very much feel that Dannielle has advised you properly along your prom non-dress hunt, and so in lieu of further advice I would like to contribute a few pictures of what I would look like as your prom date in some of the above suggested outfits.</p>
<p>You are welcome in advance.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m always saying no when my friends ask me to go on road trips with them, but I can&#8217;t stand long car rides. They bond and come back closer than I am with them. Should I go on trips with them even though I don&#8217;t really feel like it, just to be a good friend?&#8221;</h6>
<p>-Question submitted by <a href="http://knifefullofknots.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">knifefullofknots</a></p>

<h2><strong>Dannielle Says: </strong></h2>
<p>I have two very different answers for this question. My first reaction was NO, you shouldn’t have to do something you hate just to hang out with your friends. I haaaate bars and going out to drink, etc. THEREFORE, I don’t do it, I instead plan other events. I’ll reach out to all my friends and be like “ladies night? dinner and a movie” and they’re almost always like ‘OMG YES’ because we are friends who love each other. Your friends want to hang out with you, they don’t ONLY want to do the things they like, you know?</p>
<p>My second answer has to do with loving your friends and doing whatever they want because you know you’ll get to spend time with them. I’ve been in quite a few situations where my friends are like ‘BAR THE BAR LETS BAR THE BAR’ and I roll my eyes, but I go anyway because I love them so much. What happens, EVERY TIME, WITHOUT FAIL…I have a blast. We get there and it’s horrible and it’s loud and it smells and I hate it. BUT THEN after they get their drinks and we find a place to sit, we end up talking for HOURS, we make stupid jokes and laugh and learn things about one another and leave giggling so hard.</p>
<p>So, this is totally up to you. I would NEVER tell you to do something you hate, but you might have fun. AND, If you’re like ‘nope never’ just be sure to plan a few extra friend times so your friends know how much you want to hang out with them AND SO you don’t feel left out.</p>
<h2><strong>Kristin Says:</strong></h2>
<p>I am going to elaborate a little on the “go on getcha some car ride fun” option, because I think there might be a little you can do to try this out one more time. You hate long car rides, fine. Understandable. You don’t want to go on trips. That is your prerogative, and totally fair. HOWEVER, I think that you should try going on one adventure with them <em>without </em>thinking to yourself, “I am going to totally hate this.”</p>
<p>I am not trying to challenge your knowledge of yourself, but I do know that sometimes &#8211; when we allow for it &#8211; life surprises us. The next time they plan a trip, go with them and tell yourself, “You know what, self? We are going to just try this out and see what happens and like THE WORST THING that could happen is I’m not thrilled but it’s a few days and there’s a chance that I’ll laugh so much that I will forget I am in the car.” See what happens!! If you do, in fact, have a blast &#8211; THEN GREAT. If you feel yourself getting edgy, just take a deep breath and be patient with the experience.</p>
<p>If you do discover that you just cannot have fun on trips, then perhaps you can find a way to feel more included. Set up a night when they return where each person recounts their favorite story and re-enact it to see what would have happened if you were there. Skype with them from a different city and when they show you the seashells they collected you can show them your cat sleeping on your pillow. Remember that they want you there, so even if you aren’t present for the making of <em>all</em> the memories, you can certainly still be a part of the experience itself.</p>
