This past weekend, Chris was in tech rehearsals all day on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.  Which left me to fend for myself with two wee ones that weekend.  Luckily, they are getting to great ages that make getting out and going lots of fun, so we did a fair amount of running around town to keep us entertained.</p>
<p>There were a few hours on Sunday, though, when I really needed to get some work done, and Gracie was having none of it.  She followed me around the house whining.  She sat beside my desk whining.  She was bored and clingy and driving me crazy.  I tried giving her all her favorite things &#8211; crayons and paper on her art easel.  Stickers.  Magnets.  Baby Tut Tut.  She wanted to play in the sink, but I just didn&#8217;t have time.  Finally, with nothing left to offer, I hit up my go-to place to find random toys in a pinch &#8211; my kitchen.  Pots for carrying things, baking pans for magnets, colanders for pipe cleaners, you name it and it&#8217;s in my kitchen.  On this particular Sunday, I happened to find a half empty pack of cupcake liners.  Perfect!  Now all I needed was something she could put in them.</p>
<p>A few months ago, one of my co-workers brought me a bag full of over 500 pogs.  That&#8217;s right.  Pogs, my friends.  Straight out of 1992, and complete with slammers.  She thought my kids might want to play with them.  I have brought them out a few times for the kids to play with, and they love them because they are small and easy to manipulate.  They make a big mess, so those stay in our toy closet where I keep all the toys that require supervision.  So, I busted out the pogs and Gracie went to town!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5726 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8656905346/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8656905346_5ffe8a71da.jpg" alt="IMG_5726" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5727 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8656904916/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8126/8656904916_b6b83de1cb.jpg" alt="IMG_5727" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>She had trouble at first with the cupcake liners standing up, so I also gave her a muffin tin to put them in. She sat there for almost an HOUR, people. An HOUR! She sorted and re-sorted and stacked and re-stacked.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5729 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8655799527/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8119/8655799527_71e8cd1170.jpg" alt="IMG_5729" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>I knew she was going to her <a title="My Spirited Child" href="http://marriageconfessions.com/2013/04/02/my-spirited-child/">little introvert place</a> because she really didn&#8217;t want me to help or play at all. She wasn&#8217;t showing me things or asking for help. She just immediately sat down and played intently and quietly for almost an hour. Bean came downstairs a few times and tried to play along with her, but I asked him if he could find something else for a while to give Gracie some time by herself. Normally, she only gets the pogs when he thinks to ask for them, so this was her first time having total control and I didn&#8217;t want her to have to share at that moment. She was taking a little break to play by herself, and I wanted to make sure that we all gave her that space. Bean was a good sport and played with the crayons and art easel that I had set up earlier for Gracie instead.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5730 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8655799139/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8655799139_d3a1b9b7ce.jpg" alt="IMG_5730" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>For almost an entire hour, there was peace and quiet in my house. And I think we all enjoyed it, but especially Gracie. The more I observe her, the more I am keenly aware of her need for personal space. I love that about her, and I&#8217;m having a great time helping her figure out what kinds of different activities she can do when she needs some time to herself.</p>

If you&#8217;ve been around the internets for very long, particularly in the bloggity blog world, then you&#8217;ve probably heard of a wildly popular blog called, &#8220;<a href="http://www.younghouselove.com/">Young House Love</a>.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a blog started by a young married couple (see why I like it already???) who started chronicling their home DIY projects around their house.  I had heard of the blog before because it has exploded in this age of Pinterest and DIY-ing.  And I had also heard they published a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Young-House-Love-Paint-Update/dp/1579654789/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366325944&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=young+house+love">super awesome book</a> about their projects, too, which I am dying to get my hands on.  But I had never actually read their blog.</p>
<p>This past week, though, I have discovered the actual &#8220;<a title="Preschooler Thoughts" href="http://www.younghouselove.com/">Young House Love</a>&#8221; blog and I am in love.  Their house is beautiful.  Their style is beautiful.  Their family is beautiful.  I adore it all.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5468 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8660882547/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8660882547_bc49cbf7c5.jpg" alt="IMG_5468" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>There have been two unfortunate side effects of my new love interest.  First, I now want to make over our house.  Like, right now.  We are in the oh so very, very slow process of redoing our house.  I love it, but everything in it is outdated.  In the two years we&#8217;ve been in the house, we&#8217;ve been working on it bit by bit, but home renovations are a slow process.  Take our deck, for example.  Chris has been tearing down our horrid back deck for a couple weeks now, and is finally starting to rebuild this weekend.  But it will probably be another month before it&#8217;s finished.  Since seeing <a title="Big Beds and Tuttle Shirts" href="http://www.younghouselove.com/">YHL</a>, though, I want results and I want them NOW.</p>
<p>The second unfortunate side effect of my new love interest is that now I believe I can do home projects myself.  I went through this phase when I first fell in love with Pinterest, too.  Seeing other people be handy and crafty makes me think I can be handy and crafty, too.  And that is a false statement.  Oh, I know, I know.  All you handy and crafty people out there are going to argue, &#8220;Oh, Katie!  You can do it!  It&#8217;s easier than you think!&#8221;  Trust me.  It&#8217;s not, and I can&#8217;t.  I have about as much luck with craftiness as I have with the ability to filter what I say.  It just ain&#8217;t gonna happen.  Lucky for me, though, I have a handy dandy husband who can tackle all the projects that I dream up for him.  Like this massive deck renovation.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5477 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8661983048/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8264/8661983048_067b886940.jpg" alt="IMG_5477" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And so, for now, I will continue to read &#8220;Young House Love,&#8221; and look around my house through jealous eyes. I will pine away at other people&#8217;s good fortunes.  I will covet thy imaginary neighbor&#8217;s house.  I will wish and hope and think and pray about what our house will look like one of these day.  Like, in twenty years.  I will wallow in my materialism and jealousy.</p>
<p>Cause that&#8217;s always healthy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5162 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8546017787/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8546017787_f1e60c446c_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5162" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
Last night around 11:00, I went in to check on the kids before I went to bed. When I went into Bean&#8217;s room, though, he was no where to be found. And neither were the sheets on his bed, his pillow, his comforter, and all his stuffed animals. It was just his mattress laying there.</p>
<p>He has done this before. He moves his bedding to some other part of his room and camps out there. But I checked all over his room, and he wasn&#8217;t in there. I went to look in Gracie&#8217;s room because I&#8217;ve also caught him camping out on her floor before, but he wasn&#8217;t in there either. Now I started to get nervous. I noticed the bathroom light was on, and I peeked in there to see if he was set up in there for some reason, but no luck. I searched that house from top to bottom. No Bean.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to check his room one more time, just to be sure he wasn&#8217;t in his closet and I just hadn&#8217;t seen him (I&#8217;ve found him in there before, too). As I passed the guest bedroom on my way down the hall, though, something caught my eye. Buzz Lightyear was hanging off the guest bed. I didn&#8217;t have the lights on because I didn&#8217;t want to wake Bean, wherever he was, but I quickly flipped the hall light on so I could see better.</p>
<p>There he was. Sprawled out on the guest bed, snoring. He had brought all of his bedding and stuffed animals with him, and recreated his bed on top of the guest bed. He laid his bottom sheet down, had his comforter on top of him, Mr. Bear tucked in next to him, and all his favorite stuffed animals lined up along the headboard. It was too cute to move, so I let him sleep there.</p>
<p>This morning, Chris and I called Bean up to the guest bedroom after breakfast. I was ready to get on to him and tell him he had to move all his stuff back to his room, but instead Chris led the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, buddy,&#8221; he said gently. &#8220;How come you moved in here last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just more comfortable than my bed,&#8221; Bean said. &#8220;I like this bed better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah? You like being able to spread out like this on this bigger bed?&#8221; Chris said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, all my guys fit up here with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it&#8217;s time we got you a big boy bed,&#8221; Chris said. &#8220;You want a big bed like this in your room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;YEAH!&#8221; Bean shouted.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5162 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8546017787/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8546017787_f1e60c446c.jpg" alt="IMG_5162" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I knew the day would come when we would move him out of his toddler bed. In fact, I knew it would come soon. He still fits in his little race car bed, but he&#8217;s not a toddler anymore. I just hadn&#8217;t gotten around to taking the next step yet. And I never dreamed that Bean would be the one to ASK for a big bed. I really didn&#8217;t think he knew the difference!</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, I went into Gracie&#8217;s room to get her dressed for the day. I took down one of her shirts that had a pig with sunglasses on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;NO PIGGY!&#8221; Gracie shouted, stamping her foot.</p>
<p>Well, this was new. Gracie never said anything about her clothes!</p>
<p>&#8220;No piggy?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NO PIGGY! WANT TUTTLE!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to wear your turtle shirt instead of the piggy shirt?&#8221; I repeated, just to clarify. This had never happened before, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure I was ready for it to happen now. Was Gracie getting PREFERENCES??????</p>
<p>&#8220;YES! TUTTLE SHURT!&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5625 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641830394/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8641830394_66a2389c4b.jpg" alt="IMG_5625" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>So, this morning, both my kids grew up within about 10 minutes of each other. I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THIS! I THOUGHT I HAD MORE TIME! We are having a yard sale in a couple weeks, and I have been pumping myself up to sell our baby crib then. I thought I had WEEKS left to prepare for my kids to grow up????</p>
<p>I CAN&#8217;T HANDLE THIS!</p>
<p>I am not ready for big beds and tuttle shirts!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="166419_10100634854957391_5901188_n by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8656916694/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8656916694_eddc7328a4_m.jpg" alt="166419_10100634854957391_5901188_n" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
Chris and I are coming out of rough patch that we&#8217;ve been battling for a couple months. Those are never any fun to be in, but they are even LESS fun to come out of because in order to get out of a rough patch, you have to speak to each other. Without fighting. And you have to agree. Without holding resentment. And, in my experience, being in a rough patch by definition means I don&#8217;t really want to get along with my husband, much less AGREE with him on anything. So, the working through it part is often much harder than the going through it part.</p>
<p>Being an adult sucks.</p>
<p>For a few months now, I have felt judgment from Chris. I felt like he was angry and irritated, but just wasn&#8217;t saying anything to me about it. Which made me do two things. First, it made me feel guilty all the time. I kept asking him if he was mad about something, but he never gave me a reason. I knew there was more going on, so I spent all of the month of March walking around with the weight of the world on my shoulders, all because I felt like my husband was mad at me for any and/or all of the following reasons:</p>
<p>a) I wasn&#8217;t doing enough around the house<br />
b) I was going out on week nights too often, leaving him home with the kids too much<br />
c) I wasn&#8217;t taking care of myself and so I looked like crap and gained a bunch of weight<br />
d) I was nagging him<br />
e) I was spending too much money</p>
<p>March was not a fun month for me.</p>
<p>By April, though, I began to get pissed off. I was tired of being silently punished, and so I began to silently punish back. Chris wasn&#8217;t talking to me? No problem. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to him. So, we didn&#8217;t. We took care of the household responsibilities, we took care of the kids, we took care of our family obligations, we took care of our jobs, but we decided we didn&#8217;t care enough to take care of our marriage. So, we sat in front of the television at night or we came to bed at different times or we planned fun activities with other people instead of with each other. And, quite frankly, we just didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, we had The Great Fight of 2013. We usually have one big, giant blow out fight about once a year. They aren&#8217;t usually this early in the year, but it was about time. The subject of this particular fight was money. How we made it, how we spent it, how we saved it, and how we budgeted it. Money, money, money.</p>
<p>But, here&#8217;s the thing. The fight wasn&#8217;t really about money. How do I know that? Because we ended up screaming at each other, only we were saying things like, &#8220;YOU&#8217;RE RIGHT, DAMMIT!&#8221; and &#8220;I COMPLETELY AGREE, YOU ASS!&#8221; We weren&#8217;t even arguing right. We were actually agreeing with each other more than we were disagreeing. We just needed an outlet for our frustration with each other. We needed a reason to just let it all out. And, yes, to yell.</p>
<p>The Great Fight of 2013 ended with Chris storming off to work, and me storming off to take it out on the dishes in the kitchen sink. While he was gone, I called my sister (isn&#8217;t that what you&#8217;re supposed to do when you fight with your husband?), who validated how I felt like a good sister should, but then who prompted me to share some deeper things with Chris. Like, about how I felt like he was angry at me all the time, and how I was tired of feeling guilty and not even knowing what I felt guilty for. And she said I needed to give him a hug. I started laughing, but she stayed completely serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to hug him for at least 30 seconds. And then you need to sit down and fix this. It will be awkward. It will feel forced and uncomfortable, but that&#8217;s what you need to do. Because you need to remember that you&#8217;re fighting because you love each other, and you&#8217;re working through it because you love each other even more.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a smart cookie.</p>
<p>So, I did what I do best and I wrote some things down. I made a list of the things that I thought were wrong with us. Some of them were things that I thought I had done wrong and some were things that I thought Chris had done wrong. Some were things that we needed to work out together. And I made a list of the three things I could sacrifice in order to make our marriage more of a priority again.</p>
<p>And then I put the list in my bedside table drawer, and haven&#8217;t looked at it since.</p>
<p>I thought about getting it out and sharing it with Chris. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what a good marriage counselor would tell me to do. But the truth is that I&#8217;d rather TALK TO him than WRITE AT him. The writing just helped me get my talking thoughts together. And so when Chris came home from work that night, I gave him a 30 second hug like Ginny suggested (freaked him out and I think pissed him off&#8230;), but then we sat down and talked.</p>
<p>And that talk was harder than the fighting. Fighting is easy and weak because you can say whatever you want in the heat of battle. You aren&#8217;t prepared or planned, your ideas aren&#8217;t courteous or polite. You just push it all out there all ugly-like. And I do believe there is a place for that in a marriage. But if you&#8217;re going to fight it out, you&#8217;ve also got to be willing to take the next step, and that is talking it out.</p>
<p>Fighting it out involves lots of &#8220;you&#8221; statement. &#8220;You never do this&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;You always do that&#8230;&#8221; But talking involves thought and planning. It involves lots of &#8220;I&#8221; statement, &#8220;I hear what you are saying, but&#8230;&#8221; and &#8220;I will try to do better.&#8221; Talking is about your actions and how you can change. And that&#8217;s really when a marriage moves ahead.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s what we did. And it was hard for Chris. When I first started talking, I explained how I felt and then asked him what he was so angry about. I must have asked 5,000 times in a variety of ways, and the response was always the same, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t anything. I&#8217;m not angry about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which made me want to punch him in the face. Really. How the heck was I supposed to fix a problem if he wouldn&#8217;t tell me what the problem was????</p>
<p>But then I realized that I needed to LISTEN. I needed to hear what he was telling me. I was waiting for an ADMISSION from him, but that isn&#8217;t the same as listening. Listening is hearing what you haven&#8217;t planned to hear. And what I hadn&#8217;t planned to hear was that Chris wasn&#8217;t mad at me. I hadn&#8217;t planned to hear that the problem was not me. Chris was having a hard time with something else, and it was coming out as anger and frustration directed at me. I had created a problem in my head, become angry about that problem, reacted to that problem, only to discover that that wasn&#8217;t actually the problem at all.</p>
<p>We talked about how Chris can get better at dealing with this issue. We talked about how I need to stop making everything personal and about me. Mostly, though, we talked about how we could both work to make our home a place where we wanted to be. A place where God, our marriage, and our family were the top priorities. We set some new guidelines and rules (i.e. no house guests without warning, no purchases over $100 without planning, etc.) and we put our family in time out.</p>
<p>This weekend, we are in family time out. We aren&#8217;t allowed to leave, to travel, to make plans &#8211; nothing. We are in lock down until we get ourselves stable again. We can&#8217;t grow our marriage if we&#8217;re always on the go. Sometimes we need to stop and reset. So, that&#8217;s what we are doing this weekend. And in the next few months, we are wrangling in our obligations. I&#8217;m not committing to anything else, we&#8217;re not traveling anywhere, Chris isn&#8217;t hiding behind house projects to avoid having to hang out with me. We are here at home, and we are together.</p>
<p>AND WE&#8217;RE GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT, DAMMIT!</p>
<p>Marriages aren&#8217;t built in the land of unicorns and good lighting and perfect parenting. Good, solid marriages are built in the land of &#8220;YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME!&#8221; and runny noses and never quite making it to church on time (or at all&#8230;). Because good, solid marriage are not about where they are built. You can build good, solid marriages in whatever surroundings you have. All you need is a willing spirit, a whole lot of patience, a determined attitude, and more love for your spouse than you think you have inside of you.</p>
<p>I mean, how hard is that?</p>

<p>I was teaching my 7th period class today when the bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.  My phone started ringing the instant classes ended.  We have several friends who live in Boston that we were worried about, and my mother-in-law is a race trainer and she always has a group or two of people running in major marathons.  Immediately, Chris and I touched base with everyone we knew and we relieved to hear they were all safe and sound at home or back in their hotel rooms.</p>
<p>I came home tonight and sat around our little kitchen table with my family.  We blessed our food, and prayed for peace and comfort to those effected by the tragedy today.  It was hard to explain to Bean.  At three, he doesn&#8217;t need to know of senseless violence.  But what he does need to know is that sometimes people get hurt, and that we can help them by bowing our heads and praying for them.</p>
<p>Later, I hope he and Gracie both know that <strong>God dwells in places of senselessness</strong>.  I hope they know that kind words to hurting people can make a difference.  I hope they know that sometimes it isn&#8217;t our place to know why, but it is always our place to ask what we can do to help and how we can prevent things like this from happening again. Mostly, I hope they know enough love that they are not numb to these horrific experiences.  I hope their hearts are full of compassion and empathy, even for those they don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I also hope that however you were effected by the tragedy today, you are finding comfort and peace in whatever or whomever you seek to find it through.  Because I think <em>that</em> is at the root of senselessness.  I think it is people who haven&#8217;t found what they are seeking.  The world is senseless to them because they are missing something, and so they return senselessness to the world.  So, seek what you are looking for today.  And then tomorrow be the light that helps others find what they seek, even if that looks different than what you found.</p>
<p><strong>If the world had more torches of kindness, perhaps we would no longer be victims of such dark days.</strong></p>

Bean has been cracking us up lately with his little comments.  He will say some of the funniest things, but it&#8217;s not just what he says that is funny.  It&#8217;s how his mind processed information to get to those comments.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5628 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8640727153/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8640727153_063ba4c3cc.jpg" alt="IMG_5628" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>We have been talking a lot about Sarah and her new baby.  So, yesterday as we were leaving the house to meet Bean&#8217;s BFF, Elle, and her mommy for a play date at Chuck E. Cheese (germy, I know, but their tokens and prize exchange are GOLD for my kids, so judge away&#8230;), Bean says to me, &#8220;Elle has a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean she has a baby doll?  Like Gracie does?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, her mommy is going to have a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, then I sat there and thought about this because I am friends with Elle&#8217;s mom and I was 99.9% sure she wasn&#8217;t pregnant.  But maybe she was and she hadn&#8217;t said anything yet?</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, her mommy has a baby doll?&#8221; I asked for clarification.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mom!&#8221; Bean gasped, cleared frustrated with my lack of understanding about the birds and the bees.  &#8220;Elle&#8217;s mommy has a baby in her belly.  Like, a REAL baby.  And it&#8217;s going to come out in&#8230;&#8221; (this is when he checked the watch he wears around) &#8220;&#8230;ten minutes!&#8221;</p>
<p>I later clarified with Danielle that she was not, in fact, expecting a baby at all, much less in ten minutes.  And then we had a good laugh.  Or, maybe I was the only one laughing.  (Point of order: Danielle is tiny and thin and does not in the least way resemble a pregnant woman.  I thought I should clarify.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5637 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641828460/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8641828460_ec9eaafdc1.jpg" alt="IMG_5637" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Last week, he and I were snuggling on the couch and he casually says, &#8220;Mom, you need a leg hair cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>The week before that, he put Gracie in time out because she &#8220;was being widiculous.&#8221;  And, shocker of all shockers, SHE STAYED IN TIME OUT!</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Bean understands my job.  He knows I go to school every day, but I don&#8217;t think he understands that I&#8217;m the teacher.  Why do I think that, you ask?  Because he asks me every day if I had fun at my centers and what books I read in circle time.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5632 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641829262/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8641829262_60fc8abcd0.jpg" alt="IMG_5632" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Every time Chris and I kiss or hug, Bean comes up and pushes between us, saying, &#8220;Hey, hey, hey!  Break it up!  Break it up!&#8221;</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half can be tough.  Those little curious minds process, like, EVERYTHING.  And that spawns a thousand and one questions.  Including the dreaded, &#8220;Why?&#8221; over and over and over again.  But it&#8217;s a great age, too, because you get to hear them communicate ideas they are creating using all that information they are processing.  Sometimes, they process just how they should and you suddenly think you have a little genius in your family.  And then sometimes they come up with these crazy funny comments that probably sound &#8220;widiculous&#8221; to anyone but their momma.  But as his momma, I understand.  I know where he is getting the ideas and I can follow his train of thought, though it sometimes seems to outsiders to be erratic and random.  And I love that.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite parts of being a momma.</p>

Last weekend we went to Atlanta for all kinds of festivities.  As a tribute to my Dad, my mom took everyone to the practice rounds of the Masters at Augusta National.  As a family, we decided to take something special of Dad&#8217;s and bury it under one of the pine trees at Amen Corner, his favorite part of the course.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5669 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641816254/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8641816254_d52ef46e8d.jpg" alt="IMG_5669" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>The place where they decided to bury Dad&#8217;s item was under the pine trees right there the 13th hole dog-legs up to the green. For his 50th birthday, we all gave him a painting of the view from that very pine tree. I thought everyone did a great job finding the perfect spot.</p>

<p>While the family was at the Masters, I decided to stay home with the three wee ones. We had a blast, but three under the age of four is INSANE. I don&#8217;t know how some parents do it! I was exhausted by the end of the day! But it was a huge success! We got up and played in the living room for a bit while I cleaned up breakfast.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8648659994/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8396/8648659994_78f8e83511.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>After an hour or so, we moved upstairs and played while I got them all dressed. My kids loved playing with all of Tillman&#8217;s books and toys. They climbed up into his crib with him and read books (well, Tillman chewed on them&#8230;) while I got dressed. They all had a ball! Tillman makes this loud, long, happy wail when he is having fun, and you could hear him all over the house! It was hysterical!</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8647556347/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8647556347_2dca119ddb.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>After Tillman&#8217;s morning nap, we had a quick lunch and then headed up to this fantastic park in my sister&#8217;s neighborhood. It has bikes and playhouses and pretend kitchens and playground equipment and sandboxes and swings&#8230; It is amazing. We played there for over two hours!</p>

<p>When we got home, we napped and then hung out and waited for everyone to get back. I loved every minute of it, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the kids did, too. Well, maybe Gracie didn&#8217;t enjoy EVERY minute&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8648676644/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8543/8648676644_9ea8f7311b.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As if the Masters and enormous neighborhood parks weren&#8217;t enough, we also went to a Braves game that weekend. We&#8217;ve taken the kids to one before, but Gracie was in her crying all the time phase, so it wasn&#8217;t very enjoyable. This game, though, was perfect! I had so much fun with the kids, and we had awesome seats. We were in the outfield and sat on the first row of a section, which meant that we had a little extra leg room to move around. Critical when you&#8217;ve got two little ones. I was worried about the sun because we were going to be sitting directly in it all afternoon. But I slathered the kids up pretty good and made them both wear hats, and nary a sunburn was found!</p>

<p>(Can we talk for a minute about how big Bean looks in this picture. I&#8217;m having distinct images of him as a high schooler, and I do not like it. Not one little bit. He&#8217;s a stud, though, that boy.)</p>

<p>When we weren&#8217;t doing super fun things at Aunt Ginny and Uncle John Michael&#8217;s house, we were hanging around on their front porch and taking family walks around their neighborhood.  And we are quite the motley crew when we&#8217;re traveling in a herd!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5647 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8640723967/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8640723967_2792872323.jpg" alt="IMG_5647" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>I have to tell you this little story.  We were walking by a house that was having some renovations done.  While we were passing by, the workers threw a huge piece of something into the dumpster and it made a loud boom.  Bean didn&#8217;t see it happen, and didn&#8217;t even look up.  But he took off running straight ahead without saying a word at the instant of the noise.  He was mid-sentence and just BOLTED, arms pumping at his side, eyes fixed in front of him.  He was a man on a mission, and  I swear I could hear him saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m out!&#8221;  We all cracked up, even Bean when he realized what the noise was.  Funny bunny.</p>
<p>It was a really great weekend. It is always a great weekend when we get to see family. Especially my sister and her family. Little T-Man is growing up so happy, and I love being around their family. It is always a joy to see your family growing and thriving, especially while we remember those that aren&#8217;t here with us anymore. I know my dad would have gotten a kick out of this weekend, and not just the Masters. I think he would have been really proud of his family. I know I am.</p>

Hello?  Is anyone still out there?</p>
<p>I took a spontaneous little blogging break this week on accident.  Part of the break was because I have been busy, part of the break was because I have been exhausted and not quite feeling like myself, and part of the break was because I was in need of some time away.  Do you ever feel like that?  Like you just need some space from everyone?  Even imaginary people?  Well, that&#8217;s the kind of week I have been having, and so I took some time to myself to take care of some things that needed taking care of.  Like me.</p>
<p>While I have been away this week, here are the highlights of what&#8217;s been going on around these parts:</p>
<p>- We headed to Atlanta last weekend for a few family things.  We rode up with my mom and hung out with Ginny and her family for a couple of days.  I&#8217;ll post next week about our trip, but for now let me just say that it is always nice to be with family.  And let me also say that my nephew T-Man is the happiest little stinker in the world.  I got to take care of him, Bean, and Gracie one day all by myself and we had a hoot!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5616 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641831042/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8397/8641831042_ebf7b27ec0.jpg" alt="IMG_5616" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>- I had one of two big annual evaluations this week. During these evaluations, my principal comes in and observes me teaching. It involves not only an observation, but a pre-conference meeting to discuss how and why I created my lesson, and then a post-conference that analyzes how both my principal and I thought my lesson went. It isn&#8217;t that stressful when I&#8217;m actually teaching, but the preparation and leading up to it really weighed on me. I kept second guessing my lesson, which I would not have done had I not been under observation. And second guessing drives me nuts. My observation was on Wednesday, and it went really well. I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s over!</p>
<p>- My BFF, Sarah, had her beautiful baby girl on Saturday! I was so bummed to be out of town, and I had to wait until Tuesday before I could get over to sniff her wittle newborn head, but it smelled just as fresh as I imagined when I finally got there! Honestly, I have never seen Sarah so happy. She has this whole new smile that I&#8217;ve never even seen before. She seems so satisfied and complete. I am so incredibly happy for her and her husband, Scott. I have been sneaking over to their house before I pick my kids up from daycare this week just to hold sweet little Baby Love. (That&#8217;s not what her name is &#8211; that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m calling her on Blog Land to keep all the crazies away. No offense, imaginary friends&#8230;)</p>

<p>- I went with a few teachers that I work with to see a local high school&#8217;s production of &#8220;Annie&#8221; last night. There were several of my former students in the show, but my all-time favorite student had one of the leads and she was fantastic! It was so great to see all of them in their own element. As a teacher, you sort of picture your student&#8217;s entire life as existing within the walls of your classroom. But seeing them out in places where they choose to be and doing things they love to do is such a joy. Kids are awesome. Little baby kids, grown up high school kids, awkward middle school kids &#8211; they are just good for your soul.</p>
<p>- We have had a stomach virus rip through our family, so that&#8217;s been fun. Gracie started out with it, and that was just sad and pathetic. I felt so bad for her! Then, my mom came down with it while we were in Atlanta this weekend. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, we came home today and Big Molly had&#8230; well&#8230; our house was destroyed. It wasn&#8217;t her fault, but her stomach was just terrible. I feel like I&#8217;ve been cleaning up poop and throw up for weeks now.</p>
<p>- Chris and I have started watching &#8220;The West Wing&#8221; together. Every year, we pick one series that we never watched when it was on television and we watch it through Netflicks or on DVD&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve seen &#8220;Weeds,&#8221; &#8220;Arrested Development,&#8221; &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; and &#8220;Friday Night Lights&#8221; so far. This year we picked &#8220;The West Wing,&#8221; and it might be my favorite so far. We are still in season one, and I can&#8217;t stop watching. At night when I should be blogging, I&#8217;ve been kicked up on my couch watching Martin Sheen rule the free world. AND I LOVE IT!</p>
<p>- Last, but not least, I have started straightening my hair. I know that doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but when your hair is as thick and curly as mine, it is a MASSIVE ordeal. I only have a few weeks here called &#8220;spring&#8221; in Florida before the 90 degree temps and insane humidity turn my hair into a Pomeranian, so I&#8217;m trying to take advantage of that. But it is taking up, like, a LOT of time, and it reminds me why I don&#8217;t do anything to my hair usually. Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that!</p>
<p>- The fun continues this weekend as Chris is working tech Friday until Monday. I have a long overdue date with my washer and dryer, and we&#8217;ve got two play dates scheduled this weekend.</p>
<p>Things have gotten a little out of control around here lately, and both Chris and I are feeling the strain of this go, go, go schedule right now. We had a little chat last night and decided for everyone&#8217;s sanity (mostly mine) we were going to dial it back a bit starting next week. I&#8217;m looking forward to that, really. Going is a lot of fun, but sitting still is sometimes just what you need.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;all have a good weekend! Regular blogging resumes Monday!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_4918 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8356236362/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8356236362_dcd98ab651_m.jpg" alt="IMG_4918" width="160" height="240" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m having one of those weeks.  You know the ones.  They are the weeks when every traffic lane you change into on your drive home comes to a complete stop.  The ones where you look forward to having tacos for dinner all day, only to come home and discover you forgot to buy the meat.  The ones where you finally remember to go by the post office, only to realize you forgot the package you need to mail at home.  The ones where your hair gets frizzier as each day goes on, and your legs are hairy simply because you don&#8217;t have an extra five freaking minutes to shave them in the shower.</p>
<p>Yeah.  One of those weeks.</p>
<p>I feel overwhelmed, but it&#8217;s actually been a pretty underwhelming week.  There are some things I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting, and that always puts me on edge a bit.  I have three big events and/or projects happening this week at work, and I foolishly left each of them until the very end to plan.  Which means that I have spent each day this week frantically trying to pull together these projects and events in a matter of hours &#8211; sometimes minutes.</p>
<p>But more than those things, I have this impending disappointment in myself hanging over my head.  I&#8217;m trying to let go of the disappointment so that I can move past it and start to fix the problem, but right now I&#8217;m in the wallowing phase.</p>
<p>I am just not taking very good care of myself right now.  I&#8217;m eating terrible, I&#8217;m only getting 4-5 hours of sleep every night, and I&#8217;m not exercising at all.  I look about as run down as I feel, and I am starting to drive myself crazy.  Truly, there just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day sometimes.  I hate to use that excuse, but it is true.  Sometimes, you just need more time to do what&#8217;s good for you.</p>
<p><a title="22668591ab1835eb0f732a669a301f2e by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8619950643/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8619950643_9299845d99.jpg" alt="22668591ab1835eb0f732a669a301f2e" width="500" height="357" /></a></p>
<p>I feel like I am having to make choices that you shouldn&#8217;t be making:</p>
<p><strong>Bible study or school work</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time with my kids or time with my husband</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eating quickly or eating healthy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sleeping more or exercising more</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading a book or writing a blog post</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spend time with family or spend time with friends</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to choose between those things.  I want to do them all, but there just isn&#8217;t time.  So, I sacrifice things, and I end up feeling frustrated about that.  I start to resent what I chose and miss what I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I came to school this morning after only about four hours of sleep, already worrying about two big things I had to get done today.  I didn&#8217;t know how I was going to manage doing both of them AND teaching&#8230; which is, like, my JOB.  And in the middle of my car ride to school, just as I&#8217;m worrying and wondering and feeling that anxiety rise, my best friend, Sarah, called and told me she was heading to the hospital to have her baby.</p>
<p>Instantly, things snapped into focus.  Funny how babies do that, isn&#8217;t it?  Even babies that aren&#8217;t our own.  Everything I had to do that day would just have to wait.  There was a baby whose head I had to sniff and whose dimples I had to nibble.  Everything else could be rescheduled.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4918 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8356236362/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8356236362_dcd98ab651.jpg" alt="IMG_4918" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>It turned out that it was a false alarm for Sarah and the hospital sent her home, but I realized that with or without a baby, things could still wait.  Taking care of myself should not add to my stress.  It should not be one of the things on my to-do list that weighs me down.</p>
<p>So, I didn&#8217;t go running this morning.  I can go tomorrow instead.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me lazy.</p>
<p>So, I ate like crap all day.  Again.  I&#8217;ll eat a good, healthy dinner tonight.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me fat.</p>
<p>So, I didn&#8217;t finish my school projects.  I&#8217;ll finish them tomorrow.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me a slacker.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s the view from where I sit today.  Slightly frazzled because of my commitments.  Slightly frizzy because of the rain.  But completely ready to make the time to take better care of myself.  Completely ready to quit feeling guilty and blaming myself.  No good comes of guilt, but before you can move past it, you have to let go of it.  And I&#8217;m ready to do that.  Because I&#8217;m driving myself crazy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5498 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596793290/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8596793290_1550702b56_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5498" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
A couple months ago, I asked all of you imaginary friends for some advice on how to handle Gracie and her sassy self.  You all gave us some great advice, a lot of which we have followed in our house.  I think the most common suggestion from readers, though, was to read the book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Your-Spirited-Child-Perceptive/dp/0060739665/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364774922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=raising+your+spirited+child">Raising Your Spirited Child</a>.&#8221;  It took me a while to get around to it, but I finally picked up a copy a few weeks ago.  A lot of you asked me to report back on what I&#8217;d learned and thought about the book, so here I go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What the book is about: </strong> The book is about raising children who are just more intense than other children.  &#8220;Spirited children&#8221; have higher highs and lower lows than others their age.  They are easily excitable, but also easily frustrated.  Based on the back of the book, Gracie fit the description perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>What I liked about the book: </strong> I loved getting to know the characteristics of a spirited child.  The book teaches you about why most children react strongly, and then explains how that is just part of who they are as a person.  The author also focuses intensely on the fact that being a spirited child is never a bad thing.  In fact, the traits that a spirited child possesses are often seen as assets in adults.  It&#8217;s our job as parents to find out how to use those traits to model them as children.</p>
<p><strong>What I didn&#8217;t like about the book:</strong>  While I loved learning about what makes a spirited child, there were some parenting suggestions for spirited children that I didn&#8217;t see working in our house.  For example, the author says that time outs are really ineffective for spirited children because it can rev them up and take their frustration to a new level.  The author does advocate giving your child a break when they become upset, but she suggests that you go with them and help them calm down.  I totally understand this perspective.  In fact, we use this method frequently with Gracie.  She does sometimes just need time and space to herself, and so we&#8217;ll go sit in her room with her and play quietly until she calms herself down.</p>
<p>But we do use time outs in our house, too.  Our time outs are not for instances when Gracie is having one of her meltdowns, though.  Those meltdowns are real instances of her having trouble getting herself under control, and we try to remember they are not discipline issues.  What we do use time outs for are for blatant rule breaking.  Throwing, hitting, kicking, screaming, etc.  Those will all land you in the slammer at our house &#8211; spirited child or otherwise.</p>
<p>Another thing I disagreed with was negotiating with spirited children to get something that both the child and the parent are happy with.  Perhaps this would work better with older children, but at this age neither of my kids are in negotiating positions.  In fact, I highly doubt we will ever be a negotiating family.  Chris and I were raised in loving homes with parents who set firm limitations.  Negotiating was not part of the process.  If mom said no, then the answer was no.  And that&#8217;s how we are raising our children, too.  Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Chris and I abuse that situation by making outrageous demands or even difficult demands.  But we don&#8217;t expect every decision we make to be negotiated with a toddler or preschooler.  Perhaps when they are older, and firm lines of authority have been established, but for now we are not in the position to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>What we are currently using from the book:</strong>  Though the time out and negotiation approaches don&#8217;t really jive with our family, there are two practices that we have instantly started using in the book.  The first is understanding what type of child Gracie is.  The book says that you need to understand if your child is an introvert or an extrovert before you begin anything.  This will determine what their needs are when they are feeling over stimulated or frustrated.  I had never really thought about this before, but when I read the criteria for each, Gracie was a clear introvert and that has impacted so many ways that we interact with her now.  Actually, after reading the descriptions, everyone in our family are introverts, except Bean, who is an extrovert.</p>

<p>The book talks about introverts and extroverts not necessarily as personality traits, but as ways that different children draw their energy.  Introverts draw their energy from taking time for themselves, while extroverts draw their energy from being with others.  This would explain why traveling totally unwinds Gracie.  She is around people almost the entire trip, and for an introvert, that means she never gets the chance to recharge her batteries.  That also explains why she sometimes wanders up to her room and plays by herself for a little bit when we have people over.  But mostly, it explains why she is so clingy to me.  The author says that for little kids that are Gracie age, they can&#8217;t really go off by themselves completely because they are too small, so they instead might need just a few minutes of being held by a &#8220;safe person&#8221; (a.k.a. Momma) to take a break from the action for a while.  This is totally Gracie.  She will sometimes come over and sit with me when we are out somewhere.  She&#8217;ll sit for just a minute, and then go back to playing with other people.  She just needs that time to recharge her batteries.</p>
<p>What this has meant for parenting Gracie is that we have started giving her breaks in her bedroom when she is having meltdowns.  Like the book suggests as alternatives to time out, when she is melting down, we walk her up to her bedroom very calmly and then we start playing with one of her toys while she screams until she calms down and realizes that she isn&#8217;t in trouble and that we are just playing in a different place now.  It is amazing how quickly she calms down when we go to a quiet, secluded place without other children or people.  Eventually, she starts playing with us and after a few minutes we sneak out and she continues by herself, which is what her little personality needs.  We could never have done that successfully with Bean.  He would always want us to hang with him.  But Gracie is content and even needs some space and time to herself, so this has worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>Another thing we are using is water play.  The book says that one of the things that spirited children typically love is sensory activities, especially water play.  We now use water play a LOT with Gracie.  When she&#8217;s having a meltdown in the kitchen while I&#8217;m cooking dinner, I put her up on the counter and turn the faucet on.  She just runs her hands through the water over and over and over again, and it instantly calms her down.  Now, she will even ask for water when she is upset in our kitchen.  We also use baths when things are really tough.  On days when she just can&#8217;t get herself together, we go take a bath.  Maybe it&#8217;s 11:00 in the morning, or 4:00 in the afternoon.  Doesn&#8217;t matter.  We take a bath.  Bean, too.  And it calms her down right away.  We let her play and splash, and it doesn&#8217;t take long at all before her whole attitude is changed.</p>

<p>Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who has a spirited child.  Actually, I would recommend it to anyone with kids.  It is a great way to look at the psychological make up of our children.  If you happen to be able to pull out some parenting strategies from the book, then that&#8217;s a bonus, too.  The book seems to be written for kids that are a little bit older than Gracie (elementary age and above), but even with that age issue, the book is still very interesting and has proven to be highly effective for our family.  Like with all parenting books, read it for what it does offer and just move past parts that don&#8217;t work for your family.  I think that&#8217;s the best way to handle any parenting philosophy.  You&#8217;re still the parent and you still know better than any parenting expert, but use what they offer if you can make it work for your child.  We&#8217;re really enjoying the philosophies of this book in our family.</p>
