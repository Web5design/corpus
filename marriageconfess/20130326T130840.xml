I should wait until tomorrow to post our annual birthday video for Gracie, but I just can&#8217;t do it! I can&#8217;t believe our sweet Gracie is two years old on Monday! Where has the time gone?!?!</p>
<p>We love you so much, Gracie! You&#8217;re our little firecracker that keeps this family on its toes. You bring us sunshine and happiness every day, sweet girl. We love watching you grow, and can&#8217;t wait to see what the world has to offer you.</p>
<p>We love you to pieces,<br />
Mommy, Daddy, and Beanie</p>

So, I casually mentioned in a blog post last week that I signed up for a 10k. And no one is freaking out about it, so I thought I would say it again to give people ample time to die laughing.</p>
<p>I SIGNED UP TO RUN A 10K THIS WEEKEND.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3571 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7289992180/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7082/7289992180_6925389510.jpg" alt="IMG_3571" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is funny and terrifying on several levels.</p>
<p>Level One &#8211; I have never run a 10k before. Ever. In fact, the farthest distance I have ever run was 8 miles. And that was at my peak last year.</p>
<p>Level Two &#8211; I haven&#8217;t run regularly since August. I get out maybe once or twice a week now.</p>
<p>Level Three &#8211; The farthest I have run in the past seven months has been 3.5 miles.</p>
<p>And so, CLEARLY, I am in the best position possible to run my farthest race yet.</p>
<p>(Go ahead and laugh now.)</p>
<p>(And while you&#8217;re at it, laugh at this picture. Especially Bean.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3592 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7290066694/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7229/7290066694_701bafdff4.jpg" alt="IMG_3592" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Seriously, I don&#8217;t know what happened. All I know is that I ran 3.5 miles last week (which is my favorite distance to run &#8211; just long enough to get the runner&#8217;s high, but short enough that I can still function for the rest of the day), came home, jumped on the computer, and signed up for the first race I found in my area.</p>
<p>This is what happens, people, when you make decisions while on a runner&#8217;s high. Or any kind of high, I would imagine. Things seem totally doable and fun and like the right thing to do. And then you wake up the next morning and think, &#8220;What the heck just happened?!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst (or best?) part is that I immediately texted my friend, Dawn, and convinced her to sign up.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s Dawn on the left of me in this picture. We sometimes run races together. And we sometimes run away from our problems together. That&#8217;s the best kind of friend to have.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3946 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7509003094/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/7509003094_6b90a1efef.jpg" alt="IMG_3946" width="500" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Then I emailed my mother-in-law, who will be in town this weekend, and got her to sign up, too. And then I texted my sister-in-law and convinced her to run, too. So, now, I couldn&#8217;t even back out if I wanted! I&#8217;ve got PEOPLE! I have a TEAM!</p>
<p>WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME, IMAGINARY FRIENDS????? WHY WEREN&#8217;T YOU ALL HERE TO STOP ME FROM MAKING NO GOOD, VERY BAD CHOICES?!?!?!?</p>
<p>You really dropped the ball on this one, imaginary friends. I&#8217;m very disappointed in you.</p>

<p>One of the first baby products I ever received was a big, giant tub of <a href="http://goo.gl/epJOa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boudreaux&#8217;s Butt Paste</a>. I remember it so well. Ahhh&#8230;memories&#8230; It was at my very first shower when I was pregnant with Michael, and a girlfriend gave it to me as a joke because it had &#8220;butt paste&#8221; in the name. (You know you&#8217;ve had children too young when phrases like &#8220;butt paste&#8221; make you explode in fits of giggles!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #0074bd;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/3523699998/"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3566/3523699998_3b40171a7e.jpg" alt="" name="graphics2" width="503" height="378" align="BOTTOM" border="0" /></a></span></span></p>
<p>Michael hardly ever had diaper rash. Like, ever. In fact, I don&#8217;t think he had it once. And so my giant tub of Butt Paste sat unused in his closet. By the time Gracie was born, it had disappeared in one of our moves. Gracie was a completely different story when it came to diaper rash. That poor child hardly ever DOESN&#8217;T have diaper rash. One good diaper and her poor little bottom looks like a 17-year-old face with acne. Oh, it&#8217;s terrible! Big ol&#8217; welts all over! I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a girl thing or a Gracie thing, but girlfriend has some issues! We tried several different methods of fighting diaper rash, but one of the most effective methods we have found is using diaper cream before diaper rash is a problem. We use it every night for Gracie, or any period of time when I know it might be a bit longer between regular diaper changes (ex. out running errands and on trips). This is preventative and helps us avoid the situation in the first place most of the time. I also use it any time there&#8217;s the slightest hint of red on her bum. My goal is to prevent the welts by using it before they show up. And that has worked really well.</p>
<p>The next step was figuring out which diaper cream to use. Since we use it so often, it has to be something that is gentle enough for her sensitive skin, but still really darn effective. That&#8217;s why we use Boudreaux&#8217;s Butt Paste. You may think this is a product review, but I think of this post as more of a consumer report. Because we consume Boudreaux&#8217;s Butt Paste. We consume much. I love that it comes in a tub, too. It fits in the drawer of Gracie&#8217;s changing table, and I can literally scoop out handfuls of the stuff to cover her toosh. More than the convenience, though, I love that it is actually what the silly name says. It is a BUTT PASTE, y&#8217;all. I&#8217;m talking full coverage, you-might-be-able-to-spackle-your-dining-room kind of coverage. That might sound too harsh for a baby, but if you&#8217;ve ever seen your child suffer from severe diaper rash, you know that that thick, creamy coverage is exactly what you want. <em>Ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; gettin&#8217; through that Butt Paste</em>. Gracie&#8217;s tooshy stays dry and welt free, which is exactly what you want. While I found <a href="http://goo.gl/epJOa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boudreaux&#8217;s Butt Paste</a> when I was a new mom, it really wasn&#8217;t until I was a more seasoned mom that I realized what a gold mine it was. We are hardly ever without it around my house. As their very entertaining video says, &#8220;Our butts are saved!!!&#8221; </span></p>

This weekend has been another gorgeous central Florida day. Mid-seventies and not a cloud in the sky. I have crazy bad spring fever right now, and this weather isn&#8217;t helping at all! Luckily, I have spring break the week after next, so I&#8217;ll get a little taste of summer living soon, but it won&#8217;t be enough. I&#8217;m ready for summer dresses, flip flops, bathing suits, beach bags, pool floats, and little drinks with umbrellas in them.</p>
<p>This afternoon, we decided to take full advantage of the weather by playing outside in our backyard. During the spring and summer, we live out back. We have a pool and lots of yard toys, so we pretty much wake up, put on bathing suits, and head outside. In the next month or two, Chris is going to be tearing down our back deck (which is horribly warped and falling apart) and building us a new deck that meets our family&#8217;s needs a little better. I&#8217;ll definitely blog about that process because it has been crazy cool to watching Chris design it. In preparation of that awesomeness that is coming, we decided to clean out our back yard while we were out there today.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5217 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8564950985/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8564950985_cc9762bf9f.jpg" alt="IMG_5217" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5219 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8566049918/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8511/8566049918_7f8f1a4edd.jpg" alt="IMG_5219" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>As I said, we live outside in the spring and summer, but fall and winter we aren&#8217;t really out there too much. That means that our backyard quite literally goes to the dogs, who are the only inhabitants out there. At the first hint of spring every year, we head outback to survey the damage done all winter and set up for another year of summer fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5211 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8566045430/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8566045430_57b0f75b46.jpg" alt="IMG_5211" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5213 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8566046410/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8566046410_00c89f0db7.jpg" alt="IMG_5213" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5240 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8566060000/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8566060000_ec9af7eee9.jpg" alt="IMG_5240" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing we do is drag all the kids&#8217; outside toys into the yard and clean them off. We scrub them down with dish soap and water, and then spray them all off to get the cobwebs and bugs all cleared away. If the kids weren&#8217;t helping, I might put a little bleach in the water to help with that extra clean, but since they are old enough to want to help this year, I skipped this step.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5218 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8566048930/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8566048930_095fe2b7a5.jpg" alt="IMG_5218" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>While I was cleaning toys with the kids, Chris tackled the yard. He cut back the trees that hang over our playground area, picked up all the dog droppings, repaired part of the fence that was sagging, raked up leaves, picked up sticks, and then mowed. The grass hasn&#8217;t grown well this fall/winter because, quite frankly, we had other stuff going on and just didn&#8217;t care. But now that we&#8217;ve gotten all the dead leaves and junk off of it, we&#8217;ll start watering it regularly again and adding some fertilizer to help it grow. By summer, we&#8217;ll hopefully have a nice green cushion under the playground where the kids will be playing.</p>

<p>During our outdoor spring cleaning, we are usually able to salvage most of our big outdoor equipment. We bring most of it into the garage during the cooler months, and that helps. Plus, after a good bath, most of it seems to hold up really well all on it&#8217;s own, whether it&#8217;s in the garage or not. But, we spend this time accessing what needs to be thrown out, too. This year, we had to finally say goodbye to Bean&#8217;s water table. I love that thing, and so do the kids. But it accidentally got left out this fall/winter, and it was pretty rough when I cleaned it out today. Even after a good wash and several rinses, it was still full of residue and crap. Also, Gracie&#8217;s birthday is coming up and I hear a certain Nana is might be getting her a new water table of her very own.</p>

<p>We also get rid of any pool and beach toys. These are fairly cheap, and worth the little expense of replacing every year. I tossed out old sand buckets, diving rings, and sand sculptors. I also threw out all of the kids balls. They were mildewy and gross and running out of air anyway. At only $2 or $3, I&#8217;ll happily replace those. This year, we tossed a couple beach chairs, too, because they were rusted. We usually only have to replace beach chairs about once every two years or so.</p>

<p>In one short afternoon, our backyard is ready to play again. It is much easier to keep it up on a daily basis while the weather is warmer because we&#8217;re out there every day, so this will probably be one of the only all-day yard work days. But it was actually a lot of fun for all of us. The kids were super happy to be outside and use all their toys again. For Gracie, this is the first year she&#8217;ll be big enough to use some of these toys. It was great for Chris because we hung out with him while he did yard work, which he usually does by himself. And I was more than happy to clean and refresh while I dreamed about spending mornings at the splash part and nap time by the pool.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5200 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8564943747/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8564943747_bc3d86445a_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5200" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
Gracie has been showing signs of being ready for potty training for about a month now.  She can hold it for a while, sometimes even all night.  She tells us when she has to go potty, and she tells us when she needs a diaper change.  She loves panties, and has a healthy interest in the potty happenings of all our family members.  She&#8217;s been interested, but any time I would actually put her on the potty, she wasn&#8217;t happy.  She&#8217;s squirm or cry, and so I would immediately take her down.  I didn&#8217;t want to force her to sit on the potty because I didn&#8217;t want her to be any more scared or unwilling than she already was.</p>
<p>In our house, we take potty training in a few long-term steps.  Step One has been happening for the last month.  We buy a potty seat (we use potty seats on the big potties and not little potty chairs just out of personal preference) in a favorite character and sit it on the potty.  We start reading books about going potty.  We start talking about going potty during diaper changes.  We buy a pair of underwear in a favorite character print.  Step One is all about getting them used to the idea of a potty, and beginning to associate potty with potty business.  In our house, this step can last a short while or a long while, and is completely led by the child.  Michael was in this phase for only a couple weeks.  Gracie has been in it for a little over a month.</p>
<p>With Gracie&#8217;s second birthday coming up on March 25 (WHAT!?!??!!??!??), we have slowly started entering Step Two.  Part of the reason we are entering this phase is because Gracie has started talking about going potty all by herself without us prompting her.  She takes her babydoll (named Baby Tut Tut after Cousin Tillman) into the bathroom a lot now and I can hear her telling Baby Tut Tut about going potty.  It sounds like this, &#8220;Baby Tut Tut (babble, babble, babble) potty (babble, babble, babble) big girl&#8230;(babbe, babble, babble).&#8221;  But we&#8217;ve also started Step Two because we are preparing for a big change coming up for Gracie in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>When they move into the two-year-old room at her daycare, they begin potty training.  It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m opposed to letting someone else potty train my kids, but that time frame will line up really nicely with my spring break, so I figured I&#8217;d try to potty train her myself that week before sending her back to school into her new classroom.  She will probably have some regression (if it&#8217;s even called that this early on in the process), but at least she will have had one solid week of potty training at home with mommy.  So, spring break this year will be Potty Camp 2013 for our family, with the hope that Gracie will be ready to go by the time she&#8217;s back in school and heading into her new classroom.  Honestly, there is not a reason in the world for me to do this myself instead of just waiting for her daycare, except that I&#8217;m her mommy and I want to do it myself and my way.  I done birthed her, and I can teach her to pee pee in a potty, too.</p>
<p>Because Potty Camp 2013 will begin week after next, this interim week has been our Step 2.  In this phase, we start actually sitting routinely on the potty at specific times of the day.  I&#8217;m not actually expecting anything to happen in the potty, and if it does &#8211; great!  What this phase is for is to start getting used to being on the potty and connecting bodily functions with the potty itself.</p>
<p>So, this weekend, I&#8217;ve been taking Gracie to the potty whenever she wakes up, whenever I change her diaper, before she takes a nap, after she gets up from a nap, and before bath time and bedtime.  She&#8217;s getting really good at it now.  She likes to pull her stool up to the potty all by herself, and she always brings Baby Tut Tut with her each time.  And then &#8211; suddenly &#8211; this afternoon it happened!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5200 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8564943747/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8564943747_bc3d86445a.jpg" alt="IMG_5200" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>I started squealing, Gracie started clapping, Bean and Chris came running &#8211; it was wonderful! She was so excited! She got her first Skittle (which we are using as potty treats because Gracie isn&#8217;t an M&amp;M fan) and got to put her first sticker up on her potty paper. She was so stinking proud of herself, and I was so proud of her!</p>
<p>GO, GRACIE, GO!</p>

Oh, imaginary friends!  What a week!  Am I still awake?  It&#8217;s quite possible that this week has exhausted me to the point that I am blogging with my eyes closed while I catch a few winks.  I have been busy with church obligations, school projects, requirements for my teaching certificate, and a couple big looming deadlines at work.  In addition to these things on my mind, I&#8217;m in the middle of reading three books at the same time (&#8220;Bitterblue&#8221; by Kristin Cashore, &#8220;Raising Your Spirited Child&#8221; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka, and &#8220;American Sniper&#8221; by Chris Kyle), and my two Bible study classes are overlapping a bit, so I&#8217;m actually participating in two devotionals at once this week.  And did I mention that I signed up today for a 10k race that is in (gulp) TWO WEEKS?  I feel like my brain is in 100 places at once!  Right now, I am the definition of spread too thin, but I&#8217;m loving it all!  Thank goodness we somehow make room for things we love.</p>
<p>Today I got ahead at school for the first time all week, which took a huge weight off my shoulders.  Last night I did a few loads of laundry, which took another weight off my shoulders.  And I finished one of my books this afternoon, which oddly took more weight off my shoulders.  (You know you are addicted to reading when books begin to weigh on you!)  Things are shaping up and I&#8217;m heading into the weekend ready to get some more things checked off my to do list.  I&#8217;m also making a to do list for Chris, which includes things like finish painting the last small side of our house and mowing our yard so that we don&#8217;t lose the kids in the grass when they are playing.</p>
<p>You know what is sitting the heaviest on my shoulders right now, though, Imaginary Friends?  Come close because I don&#8217;t want to say it too loudly.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m working on my book.  With a publisher.  And have been for a couple months.  </em></p>
<p><em></em>Nothing is in stone yet.  Trust me, you&#8217;ll know as soon as I know.  In fact, no matter what corner of the world you are reading this blog from, I guarantee that you will hear me squeal and hoot and holler if a book deal is actually ever really signed.  But I have been talking with a publisher for a couple months now, and I&#8217;m in the middle of getting a few more sample chapters to them this week.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, I wrote <a title="Meant To Be… Or Not To Be." href="http://marriageconfessions.com/2012/06/27/meant-to-be-or-not-to-be/">this blog post</a> about God shutting the door on my book.  I said that I thought sometimes God closed doors because it was what was best for you.  And I believe that.  But not very long after I wrote that post, I felt that tug again on my heart to write a book.  I just couldn&#8217;t get away from it.  Everywhere I went, book publishing was in my face.  It was what I literally dreamed about at night (one time I dreamed that my book came out and I was standing in Barnes and Noble, but wouldn&#8217;t let anyone pick it up off the bookshelf&#8230; ???).  And I prayed.  And I prayed.  And I prayed.  And I thought, &#8220;Lord, if this is your will, then put your hand on this book and I will be your servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not long after, my agent at the time called.  We had parted ways for a while after the first book deal fell through so I could go lick my wounds.  But several months had gone by and she wanted to check in to see if I was ready to try again.  And I was.  So, I wrote.  And I wrote.  And I wrote.  And publishers called and called and called.  I spoke with so many editors that I couldn&#8217;t keep them all straight.  My cup runneth over with publishers.</p>
<p>But not one of them worked out.  Every single deal I thought was in the bag passed me by.  And every time it broke my heart, but bolstered my spirit.  &#8220;I know your hand is on this, Lord, and I will wait for your perfect timing.&#8221;  Occasionally, my prayers were more like, &#8220;WHAT THE CRAP, GOD?!?!?!?&#8221; but more often than not, I was as patient as possible.  And still, no book deal.</p>
<p>This whole process has been going on for almost three years.</p>
<p>People have asked why I don&#8217;t self publish this sucker and get it over with.  I self publish every day on this blog.  Every day, I put my writing out there to be judged, criticized, embraced, laughed at, laughed with, shared, cultivated, and improved.  I don&#8217;t want to self publish because that&#8217;s an accomplishment I&#8217;ve already made.  I want something more.  I feel called to be something more.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, nothing has given me nerves of steel like trying to get a book published.  I&#8217;ve kept quiet about it because disappointment is so <em>disappointing</em> when it&#8217;s this personal.  When you want something this badly, the disappointment reaches all the way down to your toes and all the way to the core of your spirit.  And it can BREAK you.  It can break your heart into many, many pieces.  But every time it doesn&#8217;t work out, I learn to fill that broken heart with prayer and confidence that this has been put on my heart by a God who is big enough to fill that hole.</p>
<p>And so I am continuing to wait.  It might be this publisher.  It might not.  It might be this year.  It might be next.  It might be five years from now.  But I&#8217;ll be here, writing my heart out.  Pouring my heart out.  Because that&#8217;s the heart I&#8217;ve been given.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_4987 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8547083362/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8547083362_ee49a044f2_m.jpg" alt="IMG_4987" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Chris and I started moving Gracie from her nursery into her big girl room.  It&#8217;s been a process.  We bought her a toddler bed that we initially intended to give her at Christmas, but we weren&#8217;t quite sure she was ready for that when Christmas came around.  So, we held on to the bed and thought we&#8217;d give it to her for her 2nd birthday, but then we decided that a) that would be a pretty sucky present and b) she was ready now and so why wait?  Before we could move her into her new bed, though, we had to get the room ready.</p>
<p>We actually moved Grace into a whole new room.  We switched her into our guest bedroom because her nursery gets direct sunlight all day long and ends up being really hot at night.  This was very helpful when it came time to change her room because we could work on it without having to work around her things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before that the inspiration for Gracie&#8217;s big girl room came from two prints I found on Etsy.  I loved what these said and I loved how they looked, so I decided to decorate Gracie&#8217;s room in a garden theme.</p>
<p><a title="il_570xN.372163235_7myc by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8486580818/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8486580818_116128c630.jpg" alt="il_570xN.372163235_7myc" width="400" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="173529391861607075_ODkixAOa_c by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8342082343/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8081/8342082343_ffee350efa.jpg" alt="173529391861607075_ODkixAOa_c" width="400" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>We decided to paint her room green and accent with bright floral colors. We thought about pastels, but Gracie just isn&#8217;t a pastel personality. Girlfriend is bold, and her room should be, too. But I didn&#8217;t want to use colors that were TOO bright. She is still a little girl, after all. We ended up choosing the color, &#8220;Celery Bunch,&#8221; by Behr.</p>
<p>In order to keep the room from having plain, flat painted walls, Chris had this great idea to raise a chair rail to about three feet from the ceiling. And then I thought maybe we should paint stripes in the top portion of the room, just to give it some zip. It ended up being really cute!</p>
<p>First, Chris measured the stripes out using a level and a tape measure. Then he marked it all out with painter&#8217;s tape.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4983 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8545984819/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8545984819_52bc806c96.jpg" alt="IMG_4983" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_4984 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8545985447/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8545985447_9e7e826850.jpg" alt="IMG_4984" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Next, he painted the green stripes and let that dry before pulling the painters tape off. Once he pulled the tape off, he went back and hung it again on the other side of each stripe so that he could put a coat of white paint on the white sections. This gave it a really fresh, clean look. (NOTE: If you&#8217;re going to attempt stripes, be sure that you mark which boxes you are going to paint different colors with a pencil ahead of time. Otherwise, you might end up with stripes that don&#8217;t line up at the end.)</p>

<p>After we pulled the paint tape off the second time, I was so excited! It looked beautiful!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4986 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8545986729/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8088/8545986729_8a2dcf6b1d.jpg" alt="IMG_4986" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_4987 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8547083362/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8547083362_ee49a044f2.jpg" alt="IMG_4987" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Chris did all the painting in one weekend, which was amazing. I can&#8217;t believe he got that all up at once. Later that week, he hung a new white fan in her room. The old one was&#8230; old. And ugly. So, we got her a small little white fan to complete the fresh look.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4988 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8545987993/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8545987993_851a48b9e0.jpg" alt="IMG_4988" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_4989 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8547084812/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8087/8547084812_b63224e15f.jpg" alt="IMG_4989" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Fun fact: Chris can install or change out a ceiling fan faster than anyone on earth. It&#8217;s a fact.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4992 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8547087130/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8547087130_c87d25a547.jpg" alt="IMG_4992" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>On a different night, Chris hung a new door on her room. We are in the very slow and expensive process of switching all the doors in our house over to white doors, instead of the dark brown that they were when we bought it. Each time we make over a room, we change the door, including adding new matte silver hardware. You wouldn&#8217;t believe what a difference that can make in updating a room.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4991 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8545990247/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8513/8545990247_bf6ca69541.jpg" alt="IMG_4991" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Our last step was hanging the chair railing. Chris measured it and cut it on an angle (apparently a hard thing to do? I don&#8217;t know of these things, but he was pretty proud&#8230;) with this new saw he got for Christmas. He was really excited to use the saw. I was really excited to finish Gracie&#8217;s walls. We call that a win/win in marriage.</p>
<p>With the chair rail hung and painted, the room finally came together. We are still waiting for the curtains and duvet cover that my mom is making. The fabric for that is a tiny pink and green roses print. It is really, really pretty. Both the curtains and the duvet are lined in a matching pink and white striped fabric, which looks adorable in the green room. I can&#8217;t wait to get that last piece in. I think it is really going to make the room pop.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I am still searching for the perfect thing to hang above Gracie&#8217;s bed. Right now, I&#8217;ve moved some fairy prints from her nursery that sort of match, but are too small for that big wall. My mom and I have tossed around the idea of a huge fabric colored bulletin board to hang artwork, photos, and keepsakes on. We&#8217;re thinking about maybe covering it in that same pink and white stripe that is the lining of her duvet and curtains. I&#8217;ve also thought about some kind of mini picket fence back there, but I&#8217;m not quite sure how that will work with her headboard. I could also go back and get a much larger print from the same artist as her other prints. I think that might be beautiful and so very in theme. So, we&#8217;re going to keep thinking about that big wall space for now.</p>

<p>There will be a few more additions to the room as we have time to add them. Underneath the window we are putting a padded bench seat with toy storage. The seat will be padded in that same pink and white striped fabric from the duvet and curtains.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5194 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8557591869/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8557591869_bf32a697c1.jpg" alt="IMG_5194" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Also, as soon as Gracie is potty trained (hopefully over spring break in a couple weeks??? Fingers crossed!), we will take her changing table out and move her little table and chairs to that corner of her room to make space for the bench seat. Once the table and chairs are there, we will turn this little corner into a reading nook with better shelving for her. Still working on that.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5195 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8558700492/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8558700492_feb13fde61.jpg" alt="IMG_5195" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I love her new room, but more importantly, Gracie loves her new room! She and Bean play in there all the time now. Just like his room, I love that she can reach everything in there. Nothing is off limits for her, which I really love because it&#8217;s HER room. As we make more changes, I&#8217;ll be sure to update here so you all can follow along. I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s big enough for a big girl room! Stop growing, little wildflower!</p>

Yesterday was seven months since my dad passed away.  I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s already been seven months.  I feel like I just saw him yesterday.  I think that&#8217;s part of coping for me.  I always feel like he was just here.  Like I just got off the phone with him.  Didn&#8217;t I just talk to him on the phone?  Wasn&#8217;t he just here sitting on my couch?  Wasn&#8217;t he just laughing in the other room a few minutes ago?  How can it have been seven months if I can still smell him like he&#8217;s standing right next to me?</p>
<p>In the grand scheme, I&#8217;m doing pretty good.  I have gotten to the point where I actually really like thinking about my dad.  Something will remind me of him, and instead of it upsetting me or me trying to ignore it, I find myself more and more relishing those memories.  I ran my first long run in a long time this week, and my first thought was that I wish I could call my dad and tell him.  Normally, when thoughts like that come, I try to move past them quickly.  But this week, I gave myself some time to sit and think about that.  What I would say to him, what he would say to me.  I thought about past conversations we&#8217;d had about how proud he was of me running, and I knew he would be really proud of me for getting back out there on a long run again.</p>
<p>Thinking about my dad now is actually very calming and sometimes even joyful, but sometimes it can still catch my breath.  Usually, it&#8217;s when something jumps out at me that I&#8217;m unprepared to see.  One of my neighbors just bought the same Mercedes convertible that my dad drove.  He loved that little car, and coming out of my house this morning and seeing it sitting in a driveway next door caught me completely off-guard and undid me a bit.  Takes me a while to shake that off.</p>
<p>No, seven months isn&#8217;t long enough to take away all the pain.  But time has healed my heart, that much is true.  I don&#8217;t feel empty without my dad anymore, and I think that&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve learned how to bring him with me where I go.  Which is probably why it seems like he was just here, why I can still hear him laugh, still feel his hug, still smell him on a golf course.  I don&#8217;t believe my dad&#8217;s spirit is still here.  I think he has gone on to be with our Lord, and that&#8217;s how it is supposed to be.  Just as Christ said he has gone before us to prepare a place, I think my dad has gone on and is waiting for us there.  But I sometimes wonder if those moments when my dad seems so near to me, if perhaps my dad isn&#8217;t thinking about me, too.  If maybe in that moment while I am here thinking about him, if maybe he is there, thinking about me.</p>
<p>And that closeness to him in those moments seems to bridge the gap that seven months can leave behind.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5023 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8547095672/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8547095672_531ecd5832_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5023" width="160" height="240" /></a><br />
I am sitting on my couch fighting either a terrible low pressure headache because a big storm is rolling in, or an oncoming migraine.  Either way, I feel like my head is being squeezed in a juicer.  While I lay here on the couch, moaning and trying to get Chris to have mercy and rub my feet (which I am convinced solves all of life&#8217;s problems), I&#8217;m going to leave you with these pictures from this weekend.</p>
<p>We went to my sweet cousin, Abby&#8217;s, wedding in Atlanta.  It was beautiful, and she was a radiant bride.  The only person who glowed as much as she did was her handsome groom, Joey.  They are just the kindest, down to earth couple and their wedding felt just like them.  I love that at weddings.  My two favorite parts were that Abby&#8217;s brother, Jake, stood with her (in lieu of bridesmaids) when she stood at the alter.  I absolutely LOVED that.  They are so close, and it just seemed perfect that he would be the one standing there with her.</p>

<p>My other favorite part was that Abby and her dad, my Uncle Tim, danced to &#8220;My Girl.&#8221;  So stinking sweet!!!  And they rocked the dance floor!  I loved that!</p>

<p>We had a great time at the wedding. The kids were on their best behaviors, my mom and Grandma were not, and Ginny, JM, and Baby Tillman were looking good. It was really a great weekend for all of us!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8312027369/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8504/8312027369_a407aafe06_m.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="179" height="240" /></a><br />
It is widely known in my family that I am a last minute person. I&#8217;m never late when I attend something, but I&#8217;m last minute when it comes to preparations. And, honestly, nine times out of ten, I&#8217;ve done little to no preparation for whatever it is we are doing anyway. This is completely opposite from my mom and sister, who both plan lightyears in advance and have often been known to send out color-coded spreadsheets to organize family weekends.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite understand this about myself, really. I&#8217;m a very organized person. I hardly ever lose anything. Except my cell phone&#8230; and my debit card&#8230; and my wallet&#8230; and my sunglasses&#8230; and my entire purse&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay. Nevermind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just not one of those people who have it all together ahead of time. I can get it together as we go, but I&#8217;m not going to be that person who shows up having done lots of research and preparation for something. This has blown up in my face a few times.  Like that we went to a pumpkin patch and I had dressed my kids in fall clothes thinking we&#8217;d take a few pictures and leave, only to discover this was, like, the Pumpkin Capitol of the Universe and the lines were incredibly long and there were corn mazes and lots of action and it was 9,000 degrees and so my kids were sweaty and miserable and I hadn&#8217;t even packed a water bottle or an extra diaper. Fail&#8230;  But for the most part, I can wing it pretty well.</p>

<p>My family is used to me, though. Which is why before I leave for a family trip somewhere, my mom will call me for days in advance saying things like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget diaper wipes,&#8221; or &#8220;Did you pack socks?&#8221; They don&#8217;t trust me. And I don&#8217;t blame them.</p>
<p>Usually, the reason I forget things when we travel is because I don&#8217;t pack until about ten minutes before we leave. <em>That&#8217;s right, friends</em>. I pack four people in one SUV for a three-day trip in about ten minutes. Quite frankly, it&#8217;s a miracle I don&#8217;t forget MORE things.</p>

<p>BUT TONIGHT! Tonight is the night! We are heading to Atlanta this weekend for a family wedding. Currently, I have not even thought about what our family is going to wear. I&#8217;m just crossing my fingers it&#8217;s warm in Atlanta right now because Gracie only has summer dresses. And I hope Bean has enough clean underwear for a three day trip.</p>
<p>BUT TONIGHT! Tonight is the night! I am going to get us ready A WHOLE DAY before we are supposed to leave! I&#8217;m so excited! I sent Chris the following email, just to make sure he was on the same page as me. I titled the email, &#8220;A List of Demands:&#8221;</p>
<p>Demand #1: I demand that you come home early-ish from work.<br />
Demand #2: I demand that we go get you a sports coat for the wedding.<br />
Demand #3: I demand that we grab a quick dinner at chick-fil-a on our way home.<br />
Demand #4: I demand that we pack for Atlanta tonight so that for once in our lives we actually arrive before 2:00am.</p>
<p>That is all.<br />
~ Management</p>
<p>Tonight &#8211; A FULL DAY EARLY! &#8211; we are going to make sure everyone has what they need, we are going to go buy what we will need that we don&#8217;t have, and we will be packed and ready to go as soon as we get home from work tomorrow, instead of three hours later like we normally do.</p>
<p>TONIGHT, PEOPLE!</p>
<p>TONIGHT!</p>
<p>I will get my shit together. TONIGHT.</p>
