<p>I was teaching my 7th period class today when the bombs exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.  My phone started ringing the instant classes ended.  We have several friends who live in Boston that we were worried about, and my mother-in-law is a race trainer and she always has a group or two of people running in major marathons.  Immediately, Chris and I touched base with everyone we knew and we relieved to hear they were all safe and sound at home or back in their hotel rooms.</p>
<p>I came home tonight and sat around our little kitchen table with my family.  We blessed our food, and prayed for peace and comfort to those effected by the tragedy today.  It was hard to explain to Bean.  At three, he doesn&#8217;t need to know of senseless violence.  But what he does need to know is that sometimes people get hurt, and that we can help them by bowing our heads and praying for them.</p>
<p>Later, I hope he and Gracie both know that <strong>God dwells in places of senselessness</strong>.  I hope they know that kind words to hurting people can make a difference.  I hope they know that sometimes it isn&#8217;t our place to know why, but it is always our place to ask what we can do to help and how we can prevent things like this from happening again. Mostly, I hope they know enough love that they are not numb to these horrific experiences.  I hope their hearts are full of compassion and empathy, even for those they don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I also hope that however you were effected by the tragedy today, you are finding comfort and peace in whatever or whomever you seek to find it through.  Because I think <em>that</em> is at the root of senselessness.  I think it is people who haven&#8217;t found what they are seeking.  The world is senseless to them because they are missing something, and so they return senselessness to the world.  So, seek what you are looking for today.  And then tomorrow be the light that helps others find what they seek, even if that looks different than what you found.</p>
<p><strong>If the world had more torches of kindness, perhaps we would no longer be victims of such dark days.</strong></p>

Bean has been cracking us up lately with his little comments.  He will say some of the funniest things, but it&#8217;s not just what he says that is funny.  It&#8217;s how his mind processed information to get to those comments.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5628 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8640727153/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8640727153_063ba4c3cc.jpg" alt="IMG_5628" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>We have been talking a lot about Sarah and her new baby.  So, yesterday as we were leaving the house to meet Bean&#8217;s BFF, Elle, and her mommy for a play date at Chuck E. Cheese (germy, I know, but their tokens and prize exchange are GOLD for my kids, so judge away&#8230;), Bean says to me, &#8220;Elle has a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean she has a baby doll?  Like Gracie does?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, her mommy is going to have a baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, then I sat there and thought about this because I am friends with Elle&#8217;s mom and I was 99.9% sure she wasn&#8217;t pregnant.  But maybe she was and she hadn&#8217;t said anything yet?</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, her mommy has a baby doll?&#8221; I asked for clarification.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mom!&#8221; Bean gasped, cleared frustrated with my lack of understanding about the birds and the bees.  &#8220;Elle&#8217;s mommy has a baby in her belly.  Like, a REAL baby.  And it&#8217;s going to come out in&#8230;&#8221; (this is when he checked the watch he wears around) &#8220;&#8230;ten minutes!&#8221;</p>
<p>I later clarified with Danielle that she was not, in fact, expecting a baby at all, much less in ten minutes.  And then we had a good laugh.  Or, maybe I was the only one laughing.  (Point of order: Danielle is tiny and thin and does not in the least way resemble a pregnant woman.  I thought I should clarify.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5637 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641828460/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8641828460_ec9eaafdc1.jpg" alt="IMG_5637" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Last week, he and I were snuggling on the couch and he casually says, &#8220;Mom, you need a leg hair cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>The week before that, he put Gracie in time out because she &#8220;was being widiculous.&#8221;  And, shocker of all shockers, SHE STAYED IN TIME OUT!</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Bean understands my job.  He knows I go to school every day, but I don&#8217;t think he understands that I&#8217;m the teacher.  Why do I think that, you ask?  Because he asks me every day if I had fun at my centers and what books I read in circle time.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5632 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641829262/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8641829262_60fc8abcd0.jpg" alt="IMG_5632" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Every time Chris and I kiss or hug, Bean comes up and pushes between us, saying, &#8220;Hey, hey, hey!  Break it up!  Break it up!&#8221;</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half can be tough.  Those little curious minds process, like, EVERYTHING.  And that spawns a thousand and one questions.  Including the dreaded, &#8220;Why?&#8221; over and over and over again.  But it&#8217;s a great age, too, because you get to hear them communicate ideas they are creating using all that information they are processing.  Sometimes, they process just how they should and you suddenly think you have a little genius in your family.  And then sometimes they come up with these crazy funny comments that probably sound &#8220;widiculous&#8221; to anyone but their momma.  But as his momma, I understand.  I know where he is getting the ideas and I can follow his train of thought, though it sometimes seems to outsiders to be erratic and random.  And I love that.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite parts of being a momma.</p>

Last weekend we went to Atlanta for all kinds of festivities.  As a tribute to my Dad, my mom took everyone to the practice rounds of the Masters at Augusta National.  As a family, we decided to take something special of Dad&#8217;s and bury it under one of the pine trees at Amen Corner, his favorite part of the course.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5669 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641816254/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8641816254_d52ef46e8d.jpg" alt="IMG_5669" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>The place where they decided to bury Dad&#8217;s item was under the pine trees right there the 13th hole dog-legs up to the green. For his 50th birthday, we all gave him a painting of the view from that very pine tree. I thought everyone did a great job finding the perfect spot.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5687 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8640719329/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8539/8640719329_67e9b34bc8.jpg" alt="IMG_5687" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>While the family was at the Masters, I decided to stay home with the three wee ones. We had a blast, but three under the age of four is INSANE. I don&#8217;t know how some parents do it! I was exhausted by the end of the day! But it was a huge success! We got up and played in the living room for a bit while I cleaned up breakfast.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8648659994/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8396/8648659994_78f8e83511.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>After an hour or so, we moved upstairs and played while I got them all dressed. My kids loved playing with all of Tillman&#8217;s books and toys. They climbed up into his crib with him and read books (well, Tillman chewed on them&#8230;) while I got dressed. They all had a ball! Tillman makes this loud, long, happy wail when he is having fun, and you could hear him all over the house! It was hysterical!</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8647556347/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8647556347_2dca119ddb.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>After Tillman&#8217;s morning nap, we had a quick lunch and then headed up to this fantastic park in my sister&#8217;s neighborhood. It has bikes and playhouses and pretend kitchens and playground equipment and sandboxes and swings&#8230; It is amazing. We played there for over two hours!</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8648664938/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8263/8648664938_3df114f38f.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>When we got home, we napped and then hung out and waited for everyone to get back. I loved every minute of it, and I&#8217;m pretty sure the kids did, too. Well, maybe Gracie didn&#8217;t enjoy EVERY minute&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8648676644/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8543/8648676644_9ea8f7311b.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>As if the Masters and enormous neighborhood parks weren&#8217;t enough, we also went to a Braves game that weekend. We&#8217;ve taken the kids to one before, but Gracie was in her crying all the time phase, so it wasn&#8217;t very enjoyable. This game, though, was perfect! I had so much fun with the kids, and we had awesome seats. We were in the outfield and sat on the first row of a section, which meant that we had a little extra leg room to move around. Critical when you&#8217;ve got two little ones. I was worried about the sun because we were going to be sitting directly in it all afternoon. But I slathered the kids up pretty good and made them both wear hats, and nary a sunburn was found!</p>

<p>(Can we talk for a minute about how big Bean looks in this picture. I&#8217;m having distinct images of him as a high schooler, and I do not like it. Not one little bit. He&#8217;s a stud, though, that boy.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5663 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641824362/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8260/8641824362_bd86efaaa8.jpg" alt="IMG_5663" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>When we weren&#8217;t doing super fun things at Aunt Ginny and Uncle John Michael&#8217;s house, we were hanging around on their front porch and taking family walks around their neighborhood.  And we are quite the motley crew when we&#8217;re traveling in a herd!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5647 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8640723967/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8640723967_2792872323.jpg" alt="IMG_5647" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5652 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641826154/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8538/8641826154_d2f855b032.jpg" alt="IMG_5652" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>I have to tell you this little story.  We were walking by a house that was having some renovations done.  While we were passing by, the workers threw a huge piece of something into the dumpster and it made a loud boom.  Bean didn&#8217;t see it happen, and didn&#8217;t even look up.  But he took off running straight ahead without saying a word at the instant of the noise.  He was mid-sentence and just BOLTED, arms pumping at his side, eyes fixed in front of him.  He was a man on a mission, and  I swear I could hear him saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m out!&#8221;  We all cracked up, even Bean when he realized what the noise was.  Funny bunny.</p>
<p>It was a really great weekend. It is always a great weekend when we get to see family. Especially my sister and her family. Little T-Man is growing up so happy, and I love being around their family. It is always a joy to see your family growing and thriving, especially while we remember those that aren&#8217;t here with us anymore. I know my dad would have gotten a kick out of this weekend, and not just the Masters. I think he would have been really proud of his family. I know I am.</p>

Hello?  Is anyone still out there?</p>
<p>I took a spontaneous little blogging break this week on accident.  Part of the break was because I have been busy, part of the break was because I have been exhausted and not quite feeling like myself, and part of the break was because I was in need of some time away.  Do you ever feel like that?  Like you just need some space from everyone?  Even imaginary people?  Well, that&#8217;s the kind of week I have been having, and so I took some time to myself to take care of some things that needed taking care of.  Like me.</p>
<p>While I have been away this week, here are the highlights of what&#8217;s been going on around these parts:</p>
<p>- We headed to Atlanta last weekend for a few family things.  We rode up with my mom and hung out with Ginny and her family for a couple of days.  I&#8217;ll post next week about our trip, but for now let me just say that it is always nice to be with family.  And let me also say that my nephew T-Man is the happiest little stinker in the world.  I got to take care of him, Bean, and Gracie one day all by myself and we had a hoot!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5616 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8641831042/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8397/8641831042_ebf7b27ec0.jpg" alt="IMG_5616" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>- I had one of two big annual evaluations this week. During these evaluations, my principal comes in and observes me teaching. It involves not only an observation, but a pre-conference meeting to discuss how and why I created my lesson, and then a post-conference that analyzes how both my principal and I thought my lesson went. It isn&#8217;t that stressful when I&#8217;m actually teaching, but the preparation and leading up to it really weighed on me. I kept second guessing my lesson, which I would not have done had I not been under observation. And second guessing drives me nuts. My observation was on Wednesday, and it went really well. I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s over!</p>
<p>- My BFF, Sarah, had her beautiful baby girl on Saturday! I was so bummed to be out of town, and I had to wait until Tuesday before I could get over to sniff her wittle newborn head, but it smelled just as fresh as I imagined when I finally got there! Honestly, I have never seen Sarah so happy. She has this whole new smile that I&#8217;ve never even seen before. She seems so satisfied and complete. I am so incredibly happy for her and her husband, Scott. I have been sneaking over to their house before I pick my kids up from daycare this week just to hold sweet little Baby Love. (That&#8217;s not what her name is &#8211; that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m calling her on Blog Land to keep all the crazies away. No offense, imaginary friends&#8230;)</p>

<p>- I went with a few teachers that I work with to see a local high school&#8217;s production of &#8220;Annie&#8221; last night. There were several of my former students in the show, but my all-time favorite student had one of the leads and she was fantastic! It was so great to see all of them in their own element. As a teacher, you sort of picture your student&#8217;s entire life as existing within the walls of your classroom. But seeing them out in places where they choose to be and doing things they love to do is such a joy. Kids are awesome. Little baby kids, grown up high school kids, awkward middle school kids &#8211; they are just good for your soul.</p>
<p>- We have had a stomach virus rip through our family, so that&#8217;s been fun. Gracie started out with it, and that was just sad and pathetic. I felt so bad for her! Then, my mom came down with it while we were in Atlanta this weekend. As if that wasn&#8217;t enough, we came home today and Big Molly had&#8230; well&#8230; our house was destroyed. It wasn&#8217;t her fault, but her stomach was just terrible. I feel like I&#8217;ve been cleaning up poop and throw up for weeks now.</p>
<p>- Chris and I have started watching &#8220;The West Wing&#8221; together. Every year, we pick one series that we never watched when it was on television and we watch it through Netflicks or on DVD&#8217;s. We&#8217;ve seen &#8220;Weeds,&#8221; &#8220;Arrested Development,&#8221; &#8220;Mad Men&#8221; and &#8220;Friday Night Lights&#8221; so far. This year we picked &#8220;The West Wing,&#8221; and it might be my favorite so far. We are still in season one, and I can&#8217;t stop watching. At night when I should be blogging, I&#8217;ve been kicked up on my couch watching Martin Sheen rule the free world. AND I LOVE IT!</p>
<p>- Last, but not least, I have started straightening my hair. I know that doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but when your hair is as thick and curly as mine, it is a MASSIVE ordeal. I only have a few weeks here called &#8220;spring&#8221; in Florida before the 90 degree temps and insane humidity turn my hair into a Pomeranian, so I&#8217;m trying to take advantage of that. But it is taking up, like, a LOT of time, and it reminds me why I don&#8217;t do anything to my hair usually. Ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that!</p>
<p>- The fun continues this weekend as Chris is working tech Friday until Monday. I have a long overdue date with my washer and dryer, and we&#8217;ve got two play dates scheduled this weekend.</p>
<p>Things have gotten a little out of control around here lately, and both Chris and I are feeling the strain of this go, go, go schedule right now. We had a little chat last night and decided for everyone&#8217;s sanity (mostly mine) we were going to dial it back a bit starting next week. I&#8217;m looking forward to that, really. Going is a lot of fun, but sitting still is sometimes just what you need.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;all have a good weekend! Regular blogging resumes Monday!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_4918 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8356236362/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8356236362_dcd98ab651_m.jpg" alt="IMG_4918" width="160" height="240" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m having one of those weeks.  You know the ones.  They are the weeks when every traffic lane you change into on your drive home comes to a complete stop.  The ones where you look forward to having tacos for dinner all day, only to come home and discover you forgot to buy the meat.  The ones where you finally remember to go by the post office, only to realize you forgot the package you need to mail at home.  The ones where your hair gets frizzier as each day goes on, and your legs are hairy simply because you don&#8217;t have an extra five freaking minutes to shave them in the shower.</p>
<p>Yeah.  One of those weeks.</p>
<p>I feel overwhelmed, but it&#8217;s actually been a pretty underwhelming week.  There are some things I&#8217;m anxiously awaiting, and that always puts me on edge a bit.  I have three big events and/or projects happening this week at work, and I foolishly left each of them until the very end to plan.  Which means that I have spent each day this week frantically trying to pull together these projects and events in a matter of hours &#8211; sometimes minutes.</p>
<p>But more than those things, I have this impending disappointment in myself hanging over my head.  I&#8217;m trying to let go of the disappointment so that I can move past it and start to fix the problem, but right now I&#8217;m in the wallowing phase.</p>
<p>I am just not taking very good care of myself right now.  I&#8217;m eating terrible, I&#8217;m only getting 4-5 hours of sleep every night, and I&#8217;m not exercising at all.  I look about as run down as I feel, and I am starting to drive myself crazy.  Truly, there just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day sometimes.  I hate to use that excuse, but it is true.  Sometimes, you just need more time to do what&#8217;s good for you.</p>
<p><a title="22668591ab1835eb0f732a669a301f2e by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8619950643/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8619950643_9299845d99.jpg" alt="22668591ab1835eb0f732a669a301f2e" width="500" height="357" /></a></p>
<p>I feel like I am having to make choices that you shouldn&#8217;t be making:</p>
<p><strong>Bible study or school work</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time with my kids or time with my husband</strong></p>
<p><strong>Eating quickly or eating healthy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sleeping more or exercising more</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reading a book or writing a blog post</strong></p>
<p><strong>Spend time with family or spend time with friends</strong></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to choose between those things.  I want to do them all, but there just isn&#8217;t time.  So, I sacrifice things, and I end up feeling frustrated about that.  I start to resent what I chose and miss what I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I came to school this morning after only about four hours of sleep, already worrying about two big things I had to get done today.  I didn&#8217;t know how I was going to manage doing both of them AND teaching&#8230; which is, like, my JOB.  And in the middle of my car ride to school, just as I&#8217;m worrying and wondering and feeling that anxiety rise, my best friend, Sarah, called and told me she was heading to the hospital to have her baby.</p>
<p>Instantly, things snapped into focus.  Funny how babies do that, isn&#8217;t it?  Even babies that aren&#8217;t our own.  Everything I had to do that day would just have to wait.  There was a baby whose head I had to sniff and whose dimples I had to nibble.  Everything else could be rescheduled.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_4918 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8356236362/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8356236362_dcd98ab651.jpg" alt="IMG_4918" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>It turned out that it was a false alarm for Sarah and the hospital sent her home, but I realized that with or without a baby, things could still wait.  Taking care of myself should not add to my stress.  It should not be one of the things on my to-do list that weighs me down.</p>
<p>So, I didn&#8217;t go running this morning.  I can go tomorrow instead.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me lazy.</p>
<p>So, I ate like crap all day.  Again.  I&#8217;ll eat a good, healthy dinner tonight.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me fat.</p>
<p>So, I didn&#8217;t finish my school projects.  I&#8217;ll finish them tomorrow.  And that doesn&#8217;t make me a slacker.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s the view from where I sit today.  Slightly frazzled because of my commitments.  Slightly frizzy because of the rain.  But completely ready to make the time to take better care of myself.  Completely ready to quit feeling guilty and blaming myself.  No good comes of guilt, but before you can move past it, you have to let go of it.  And I&#8217;m ready to do that.  Because I&#8217;m driving myself crazy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5498 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596793290/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8596793290_1550702b56_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5498" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
A couple months ago, I asked all of you imaginary friends for some advice on how to handle Gracie and her sassy self.  You all gave us some great advice, a lot of which we have followed in our house.  I think the most common suggestion from readers, though, was to read the book, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Raising-Your-Spirited-Child-Perceptive/dp/0060739665/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364774922&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=raising+your+spirited+child">Raising Your Spirited Child</a>.&#8221;  It took me a while to get around to it, but I finally picked up a copy a few weeks ago.  A lot of you asked me to report back on what I&#8217;d learned and thought about the book, so here I go&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What the book is about: </strong> The book is about raising children who are just more intense than other children.  &#8220;Spirited children&#8221; have higher highs and lower lows than others their age.  They are easily excitable, but also easily frustrated.  Based on the back of the book, Gracie fit the description perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>What I liked about the book: </strong> I loved getting to know the characteristics of a spirited child.  The book teaches you about why most children react strongly, and then explains how that is just part of who they are as a person.  The author also focuses intensely on the fact that being a spirited child is never a bad thing.  In fact, the traits that a spirited child possesses are often seen as assets in adults.  It&#8217;s our job as parents to find out how to use those traits to model them as children.</p>
<p><strong>What I didn&#8217;t like about the book:</strong>  While I loved learning about what makes a spirited child, there were some parenting suggestions for spirited children that I didn&#8217;t see working in our house.  For example, the author says that time outs are really ineffective for spirited children because it can rev them up and take their frustration to a new level.  The author does advocate giving your child a break when they become upset, but she suggests that you go with them and help them calm down.  I totally understand this perspective.  In fact, we use this method frequently with Gracie.  She does sometimes just need time and space to herself, and so we&#8217;ll go sit in her room with her and play quietly until she calms herself down.</p>
<p>But we do use time outs in our house, too.  Our time outs are not for instances when Gracie is having one of her meltdowns, though.  Those meltdowns are real instances of her having trouble getting herself under control, and we try to remember they are not discipline issues.  What we do use time outs for are for blatant rule breaking.  Throwing, hitting, kicking, screaming, etc.  Those will all land you in the slammer at our house &#8211; spirited child or otherwise.</p>
<p>Another thing I disagreed with was negotiating with spirited children to get something that both the child and the parent are happy with.  Perhaps this would work better with older children, but at this age neither of my kids are in negotiating positions.  In fact, I highly doubt we will ever be a negotiating family.  Chris and I were raised in loving homes with parents who set firm limitations.  Negotiating was not part of the process.  If mom said no, then the answer was no.  And that&#8217;s how we are raising our children, too.  Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Chris and I abuse that situation by making outrageous demands or even difficult demands.  But we don&#8217;t expect every decision we make to be negotiated with a toddler or preschooler.  Perhaps when they are older, and firm lines of authority have been established, but for now we are not in the position to negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>What we are currently using from the book:</strong>  Though the time out and negotiation approaches don&#8217;t really jive with our family, there are two practices that we have instantly started using in the book.  The first is understanding what type of child Gracie is.  The book says that you need to understand if your child is an introvert or an extrovert before you begin anything.  This will determine what their needs are when they are feeling over stimulated or frustrated.  I had never really thought about this before, but when I read the criteria for each, Gracie was a clear introvert and that has impacted so many ways that we interact with her now.  Actually, after reading the descriptions, everyone in our family are introverts, except Bean, who is an extrovert.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5488 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596788610/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8596788610_4a03a76913.jpg" alt="IMG_5488" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The book talks about introverts and extroverts not necessarily as personality traits, but as ways that different children draw their energy.  Introverts draw their energy from taking time for themselves, while extroverts draw their energy from being with others.  This would explain why traveling totally unwinds Gracie.  She is around people almost the entire trip, and for an introvert, that means she never gets the chance to recharge her batteries.  That also explains why she sometimes wanders up to her room and plays by herself for a little bit when we have people over.  But mostly, it explains why she is so clingy to me.  The author says that for little kids that are Gracie age, they can&#8217;t really go off by themselves completely because they are too small, so they instead might need just a few minutes of being held by a &#8220;safe person&#8221; (a.k.a. Momma) to take a break from the action for a while.  This is totally Gracie.  She will sometimes come over and sit with me when we are out somewhere.  She&#8217;ll sit for just a minute, and then go back to playing with other people.  She just needs that time to recharge her batteries.</p>
<p>What this has meant for parenting Gracie is that we have started giving her breaks in her bedroom when she is having meltdowns.  Like the book suggests as alternatives to time out, when she is melting down, we walk her up to her bedroom very calmly and then we start playing with one of her toys while she screams until she calms down and realizes that she isn&#8217;t in trouble and that we are just playing in a different place now.  It is amazing how quickly she calms down when we go to a quiet, secluded place without other children or people.  Eventually, she starts playing with us and after a few minutes we sneak out and she continues by herself, which is what her little personality needs.  We could never have done that successfully with Bean.  He would always want us to hang with him.  But Gracie is content and even needs some space and time to herself, so this has worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>Another thing we are using is water play.  The book says that one of the things that spirited children typically love is sensory activities, especially water play.  We now use water play a LOT with Gracie.  When she&#8217;s having a meltdown in the kitchen while I&#8217;m cooking dinner, I put her up on the counter and turn the faucet on.  She just runs her hands through the water over and over and over again, and it instantly calms her down.  Now, she will even ask for water when she is upset in our kitchen.  We also use baths when things are really tough.  On days when she just can&#8217;t get herself together, we go take a bath.  Maybe it&#8217;s 11:00 in the morning, or 4:00 in the afternoon.  Doesn&#8217;t matter.  We take a bath.  Bean, too.  And it calms her down right away.  We let her play and splash, and it doesn&#8217;t take long at all before her whole attitude is changed.</p>

<p><a title="IMG_5501 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8595693031/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8595693031_dc2d962369.jpg" alt="IMG_5501" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p><a title="IMG_5505 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8595695211/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8595695211_88352a02b5.jpg" alt="IMG_5505" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who has a spirited child.  Actually, I would recommend it to anyone with kids.  It is a great way to look at the psychological make up of our children.  If you happen to be able to pull out some parenting strategies from the book, then that&#8217;s a bonus, too.  The book seems to be written for kids that are a little bit older than Gracie (elementary age and above), but even with that age issue, the book is still very interesting and has proven to be highly effective for our family.  Like with all parenting books, read it for what it does offer and just move past parts that don&#8217;t work for your family.  I think that&#8217;s the best way to handle any parenting philosophy.  You&#8217;re still the parent and you still know better than any parenting expert, but use what they offer if you can make it work for your child.  We&#8217;re really enjoying the philosophies of this book in our family.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5526 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600048793/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8600048793_3a4ce89e82_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5526" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
One of my favorite things to do when I&#8217;m missing my dad is to cook something that he used to make. He had a handful of signature dishes. Some of them he never shared the recipes for, and occasionally I&#8217;ll spend an afternoon trying to figure out what the heck was in that one specific dish. He used to make this ground beef thing over rice that I loved when I was really little. I have no idea what it had in it. There were no veggies, no tomato sauce, no real sauce at all, actually. It was just ground beef browned with onions and something else that I can&#8217;t figure out, and then he served it over rice. It was really good, and it reminds me of my dad. Anyone know about that? It was probably a very Southern dish.</p>
<p>Anyway, one of my favorites he made that he DID share the recipe for was a shredded Mexican pork dish in the crock pot. He actually used a pressure cooker, but those scare me so I use a crock pot instead. It is super easy, and makes two or three big meals, so you can stretch it pretty good.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5526 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600048793/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8600048793_3a4ce89e82.jpg" alt="IMG_5526" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Start with a big hunk of pork butt roast. Make sure it has some good fat swirling in it.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5524 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600047353/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8600047353_545700f5e6.jpg" alt="IMG_5524" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Then, coat the mean in a packet of fajita seasoning. I&#8217;m sure you can make your own, but I don&#8217;t have time for that so I just use the packets. (I know, I know&#8230; The sodium! The preservatives! The chemicals! Save it. I ain&#8217;t got time.) Make sure you coat is really well in all the cracks and crevices.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to take your rings off before doing this. It gets right messy.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5527 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600049535/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8600049535_434867aa05.jpg" alt="IMG_5527" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Now, throw that pork butt in the crock pot and toss a can of diced tomatoes and a can of Rotel tomatoes on top of it. (I&#8217;ve also added a can of drained black beans before, and that was pretty good&#8230;)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5528 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601149314/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8601149314_750b67a75d.jpg" alt="IMG_5528" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And then set your timer for 6-8 hours, and let that roast just simmer, simmer, simmer.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5529 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601150604/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8601150604_e82d61a16b.jpg" alt="IMG_5529" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re ready to eat, shred it up in the crock pot and let it sit in the juice until you plate it up. I didn&#8217;t take any pictures of the finished meals because they disappear so quickly at my house that there isn&#8217;t time to grab my camera! (Just kidding. I forgot to take the pictures.)</p>
<p>We eat this two ways. One is the classic way my Dad used to serve it. You put rice in a bowl or on a plate and then spoon the shredded pork and lots of juice over the rice. You don&#8217;t want it soupy, but you want a good amount of that yummy juice. Usually, we eat it that way on the first night.</p>
<p>The second night, I drain all the juice and put the meat in a bowl. Then, we eat it on in tortillas as burrito or taco stuffing. It is delicious! It makes your tacos or burritos a little juicier, but it is worth it! My kids love it this way. I fix their tacos, and then wrap them in aluminum foil so they can hold them better. It&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s favorite dinner at my house.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to remember people we love, but I think remembering them in my kitchen is one of my favorites. I think about Dad as I cook, and then we talk about him while we eat. A full belly and a full heart. Can&#8217;t ask for more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601140358/" title="IMG_5515 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8601140358_dd99254047_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="IMG_5515"></a><br />
One of the things that has made potty training Gracie very different than potty training Bean is having Bean around.  He was sort of hanging out on the fringes for a while, just making sure Gracie wasn&#8217;t getting anything that he wasn&#8217;t getting.  He sniffed around her Skittles jar, and he talked about stickers a lot when she&#8217;d put one up on her chart.  I knew that it must be kind of hard for him to suddenly have Gracie be the center of attention for a week while we potty trained, so I tried to be sure to spend some extra time with him when we weren&#8217;t sitting on the potty with Gracie.  I made sure that he got to pick games and activities for us to do, and I tried hanging out with him after Gracie went to bed every night.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces I had of advice for dealing with siblings while potty training came from our friend, Gary, who has no children himself.  But he was one of four in his house when he was growing up, and I adore his family.  Everything he tells me about them makes me think that I want to raise my family like his parents raised theirs, and potty training was a great example.  When Gary&#8217;s little sister was potty training, Gary was about Bean&#8217;s age.  His mom told Gary that if he was in the bathroom cheering for his sister when she went potty, then he got a treat, too.  I thought that was a brilliant way to make potty training a whole-family affairs, and to share some of the spotlight with an older sibling.</p>
<p>We have been doing that with Bean, too.  If he is in the bathroom and cheering for Gracie when she actually goes potty, then he gets a Skittle, too.  They both think this is awesome.  Bean loves getting the treat, and Gracie loves having her brother cheering her on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bean, that means he has to endure hours of waiting in the bathroom while Gracie and I put on pretend make up and do our hair until she actually goes potty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601135068/" title="IMG_5506 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8601135068_d3045b8def.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5506"></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s normally a pretty good sport.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600037153/" title="IMG_5508 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8600037153_137c5ef47d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5508"></a></p>
<p>But sometimes he gets bored and goes on to play with super heroes or something like that.  And then he inevitably wanders back into the bathroom, and starts encouraging Gracie, &#8220;Go potty, Gracie!&#8221; he&#8217;ll coax.  &#8220;Go potty so we can go outside and play!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601138944/" title="IMG_5512 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8601138944_0549d78e28.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="IMG_5512"></a></p>
<p>I have also let him be part of all the potty training activities that are slightly more fun than waiting.  He likes to help Gracie pick out her underwear.  Are anyone else&#8217;s children obsessed with underwear?  Mine are, and it kind of weirds me out.  But they LOVE their underwear.  Choosing which pair to wear is critical to the success of their day.  Bean asks Gracie which character she wants to wear, and then he picks them out and she gets to choose which ones.  They came up with this little system all on their own, and so far it has worked out nicely.  Weirdly, but nicely.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601140358/" title="IMG_5515 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8601140358_dd99254047.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5515"></a></p>
<p>Another thing we have done is make sure that if Gracie gets something out of the ordinary because she is potty training, we give it to Bean, too, just to make it fair.  So, when Gracie can&#8217;t sit on the couches (harsh, but true), Bean plays by those same rules.  He sits on a towel pallet just like her.  We called them their &#8220;TV seats&#8221; this week, and they were a big hit.  Bean kept saying, &#8220;Come on, Gracie, let&#8217;s go sit on our TV seats.&#8221;  And she went happily along&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600041613/" title="IMG_5516 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8094/8600041613_4b519c14dc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5516"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes having an older child while you are potty training can cause some hostility and jealousy if you&#8217;re not watching for it.  I had not even thought about that when I started potty training Gracie, but it was a subtle change in Bean Man.  Giving him some tasks and perks so that he was involved with the potty training itself made a huge difference.  Gracie was more successful on the potty because her big brother was cheering for her, and he was happy to be involved and even leading the show in some instances.</p>
<p>Potty on!</p>

For Easter this year, we were celebrating with my mom and Grandma on Saturday and at our house with friends on Sunday.  It was supposed to be a great weekend.  Easter is my favorite holiday, and I was ready!</p>
<p>But then Friday night, about 15 minutes after we put Gracie down, we heard her calling to us.  And as soon as I scooped her up in my arms, she threw up all over me.  And then all over her bed.  And then all over her floor.  It was horrible!  I felt so bad for her!  Chris and I got everything cleaned up, and put her back to bed in fresh jammies and fresh sheets.  She never woke up again, so we figured it was just something she ate.</p>
<p>But promptly at 6:00am on Saturday morning, she started throwing up again.  And didn&#8217;t stop this time until about 10:30.  Oh, it was awful!  Is there anything worse than when your kids have a stomach bug?  Poor bunnies!  By 11:00, Gracie had stopped throwing up for a while, and Chris and I decided that maybe it was finished and we would be okay to drive to my mom&#8217;s for Easter lunch.  But Gracie got sick two times on the way in the car.  By the time we got to my mom&#8217;s, she seemed to have reached a stopping point.</p>
<p>We ended up having a really great Easter lunch anyway.  My mom went all Pinterest-y, and it totally paid off!  Look at her centerpiece for the table!  Isn&#8217;t that perfect for Easter?</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5530 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606081167/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8406/8606081167_aa896b581f.jpg" alt="IMG_5530" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And look at these deviled eggs. Bean was a little nervous about eating colored eggs&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5532 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607186628/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8607186628_7e6a9221a7.jpg" alt="IMG_5532" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>We hung out with my mom and Grandma for a while, taking it easy for Gracie Girl. It was so nice to sit around and enjoy the beautiful day together. Mom has a great sun porch out back, and we sat out there almost all day.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5534 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606082499/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8379/8606082499_1944cdbfc7.jpg" alt="IMG_5534" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5539 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606083877/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606083877_7be99087f6.jpg" alt="IMG_5539" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5541 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607189456/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8607189456_e982ed9fb6.jpg" alt="IMG_5541" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5545 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607190108/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8118/8607190108_c379548844.jpg" alt="IMG_5545" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, when Gracie was getting a little more spunk in her, we headed outside to hunt some Easter eggs. Chris and I hid them, and we color coded them for the kids. We knew Bean would get to them faster than Gracie, and we had to hide some out in the open for her but we didn&#8217;t want Bean Man taking those first. So, we told Bean that he had to find the green and blue eggs, and Gracie hunted the pink and purple. Orange eggs were free for anyone.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5548 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607190798/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8395/8607190798_d77f30278f.jpg" alt="IMG_5548" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5550 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606086693/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8606086693_6b92daf29f.jpg" alt="IMG_5550" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5557 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606088589/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8606088589_f07db8fc21.jpg" alt="IMG_5557" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5559 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606089553/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8606089553_f64c2c316a.jpg" alt="IMG_5559" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5562 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606091189/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606091189_5706c5f310.jpg" alt="IMG_5562" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5563 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607196678/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8607196678_ec84d731e9.jpg" alt="IMG_5563" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Bean Man found the Golden Egg, which had $2 in it. You would have thought that he&#8217;d won the lottery!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5576 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606093975/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8606093975_2078d70f41.jpg" alt="IMG_5576" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>All that hunting wore Gracie out, so we spent the rest of the afternoon in this position.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5578 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606095213/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606095213_40b442b1e5.jpg" alt="IMG_5578" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when the fever started. She spiked a high fever while napping, which prompted me to cancel our Easter lunch on Sunday. We had planned to have four families over, all with kids under 4 years old. With a stomach bug running through our house, I could just picture everyone calling me the next week saying their little one was down with the bug. Rather than get everyone sick, we canceled our lunch. I was really bummed because I&#8217;d planned this huge meal, and had spent all afternoon on Friday making party favors for the kids. But sickness comes, and you gotta do what you gotta do. I think we&#8217;re going to reschedule and have a cook out in a couple weeks instead. Rain checks are better than canceling!</p>
<p>This morning when we woke up, Gracie was still running a fever, but hadn&#8217;t thrown up since Saturday afternoon. So, we took our chances and put her in an Easter dress and headed to church. We kept the kids with us instead of putting them in the nursery so that we didn&#8217;t share our germs with our church friends.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5584 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607200654/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8546/8607200654_483b1c4274.jpg" alt="IMG_5584" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>When we got home, Chris showed me that he had hidden his Gator spirit under his church clothes all morning. Turns out it didn&#8217;t help. Which means my bracket is shot because I had the Gators winning it all. Stupid Gators. I should have known better&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5585 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607201360/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8607201360_c0dfc4a248.jpg" alt="IMG_5585" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>When we got home, we opened Easter baskets from Grandmomma. These were the third Easter baskets of the weekend, but the only baskets we took pictures of!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5587 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607202176/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8400/8607202176_a4d1f59295.jpg" alt="IMG_5587" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Bean got these giant blow up &#8220;punchers,&#8221; as he calls them. But Grandmomma only gave him one set, which means we have nothing to defend ourselves with. So, basically, Bean&#8217;s been pummeling us all day. But &#8211; HEY! &#8211; it&#8217;s Easter!</p>

<p>Over the course of the day, Gracie&#8217;s stomach bug has moved into the other end of the digestive system, and we&#8217;ve been having blow out diapers all day. Because she is so sick on her stomach, she isn&#8217;t eating anything. She wasn&#8217;t drinking anything for a while, either, and I was so worried we&#8217;d end up at the ER for dehydration. But, thankfully, she started drinking Gatorade and Pedialyte late this afternoon. She&#8217;s eating a few saltines, but not many. And she&#8217;s still running that fever. Chris is going to stay home with her tomorrow, and I see a visit to the pediatrician in our near future.</p>
<p>Overall, it wasn&#8217;t the Easter that I was expecting to have, but it was still full of the things that matter. Lots of family, lots of food, lots of jellybeans, and lots of thankful prayers.</p>
<p>HAPPY EASTER FROM OUR FAMILY TO YOURS!</p>

<p>This year, the Easter baskets runneth over for my kids.  Both grandmothers and I all made Easter baskets, so we are doling them out at various points throughout Easter weekend.  Grandmomma&#8217;s baskets will be opened tonight at our house.  She made them and stashed them here when she was visiting for Gracie&#8217;s birthday.  Chris and I will bring them out tonight for the kids.  Tomorrow we are having Easter lunch with Nana and my Grandma, and we&#8217;ll open Easter baskets from her then.  And, of course, the Easter Bunny will leave his basket on Saturday night, so we&#8217;ll open those on Sunday morning after church.</p>
<p>The Easter Bunny sent me an email with some pictures of his baskets so that I could share them with you all.  Just don&#8217;t tell Bean and Gracie&#8230;</p>
