			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601140358/" title="IMG_5515 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8601140358_dd99254047_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="IMG_5515"></a><br />
One of the things that has made potty training Gracie very different than potty training Bean is having Bean around.  He was sort of hanging out on the fringes for a while, just making sure Gracie wasn&#8217;t getting anything that he wasn&#8217;t getting.  He sniffed around her Skittles jar, and he talked about stickers a lot when she&#8217;d put one up on her chart.  I knew that it must be kind of hard for him to suddenly have Gracie be the center of attention for a week while we potty trained, so I tried to be sure to spend some extra time with him when we weren&#8217;t sitting on the potty with Gracie.  I made sure that he got to pick games and activities for us to do, and I tried hanging out with him after Gracie went to bed every night.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces I had of advice for dealing with siblings while potty training came from our friend, Gary, who has no children himself.  But he was one of four in his house when he was growing up, and I adore his family.  Everything he tells me about them makes me think that I want to raise my family like his parents raised theirs, and potty training was a great example.  When Gary&#8217;s little sister was potty training, Gary was about Bean&#8217;s age.  His mom told Gary that if he was in the bathroom cheering for his sister when she went potty, then he got a treat, too.  I thought that was a brilliant way to make potty training a whole-family affairs, and to share some of the spotlight with an older sibling.</p>
<p>We have been doing that with Bean, too.  If he is in the bathroom and cheering for Gracie when she actually goes potty, then he gets a Skittle, too.  They both think this is awesome.  Bean loves getting the treat, and Gracie loves having her brother cheering her on.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bean, that means he has to endure hours of waiting in the bathroom while Gracie and I put on pretend make up and do our hair until she actually goes potty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601135068/" title="IMG_5506 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8601135068_d3045b8def.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5506"></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s normally a pretty good sport.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600037153/" title="IMG_5508 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8245/8600037153_137c5ef47d.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5508"></a></p>
<p>But sometimes he gets bored and goes on to play with super heroes or something like that.  And then he inevitably wanders back into the bathroom, and starts encouraging Gracie, &#8220;Go potty, Gracie!&#8221; he&#8217;ll coax.  &#8220;Go potty so we can go outside and play!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601138944/" title="IMG_5512 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8518/8601138944_0549d78e28.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="IMG_5512"></a></p>
<p>I have also let him be part of all the potty training activities that are slightly more fun than waiting.  He likes to help Gracie pick out her underwear.  Are anyone else&#8217;s children obsessed with underwear?  Mine are, and it kind of weirds me out.  But they LOVE their underwear.  Choosing which pair to wear is critical to the success of their day.  Bean asks Gracie which character she wants to wear, and then he picks them out and she gets to choose which ones.  They came up with this little system all on their own, and so far it has worked out nicely.  Weirdly, but nicely.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8601140358/" title="IMG_5515 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8601140358_dd99254047.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5515"></a></p>
<p>Another thing we have done is make sure that if Gracie gets something out of the ordinary because she is potty training, we give it to Bean, too, just to make it fair.  So, when Gracie can&#8217;t sit on the couches (harsh, but true), Bean plays by those same rules.  He sits on a towel pallet just like her.  We called them their &#8220;TV seats&#8221; this week, and they were a big hit.  Bean kept saying, &#8220;Come on, Gracie, let&#8217;s go sit on our TV seats.&#8221;  And she went happily along&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8600041613/" title="IMG_5516 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8094/8600041613_4b519c14dc.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_5516"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes having an older child while you are potty training can cause some hostility and jealousy if you&#8217;re not watching for it.  I had not even thought about that when I started potty training Gracie, but it was a subtle change in Bean Man.  Giving him some tasks and perks so that he was involved with the potty training itself made a huge difference.  Gracie was more successful on the potty because her big brother was cheering for her, and he was happy to be involved and even leading the show in some instances.</p>
<p>Potty on!</p>

For Easter this year, we were celebrating with my mom and Grandma on Saturday and at our house with friends on Sunday.  It was supposed to be a great weekend.  Easter is my favorite holiday, and I was ready!</p>
<p>But then Friday night, about 15 minutes after we put Gracie down, we heard her calling to us.  And as soon as I scooped her up in my arms, she threw up all over me.  And then all over her bed.  And then all over her floor.  It was horrible!  I felt so bad for her!  Chris and I got everything cleaned up, and put her back to bed in fresh jammies and fresh sheets.  She never woke up again, so we figured it was just something she ate.</p>
<p>But promptly at 6:00am on Saturday morning, she started throwing up again.  And didn&#8217;t stop this time until about 10:30.  Oh, it was awful!  Is there anything worse than when your kids have a stomach bug?  Poor bunnies!  By 11:00, Gracie had stopped throwing up for a while, and Chris and I decided that maybe it was finished and we would be okay to drive to my mom&#8217;s for Easter lunch.  But Gracie got sick two times on the way in the car.  By the time we got to my mom&#8217;s, she seemed to have reached a stopping point.</p>
<p>We ended up having a really great Easter lunch anyway.  My mom went all Pinterest-y, and it totally paid off!  Look at her centerpiece for the table!  Isn&#8217;t that perfect for Easter?</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5530 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606081167/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8406/8606081167_aa896b581f.jpg" alt="IMG_5530" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And look at these deviled eggs. Bean was a little nervous about eating colored eggs&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5532 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607186628/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8607186628_7e6a9221a7.jpg" alt="IMG_5532" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>We hung out with my mom and Grandma for a while, taking it easy for Gracie Girl. It was so nice to sit around and enjoy the beautiful day together. Mom has a great sun porch out back, and we sat out there almost all day.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5534 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606082499/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8379/8606082499_1944cdbfc7.jpg" alt="IMG_5534" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5539 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606083877/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606083877_7be99087f6.jpg" alt="IMG_5539" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5541 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607189456/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8387/8607189456_e982ed9fb6.jpg" alt="IMG_5541" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5545 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607190108/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8118/8607190108_c379548844.jpg" alt="IMG_5545" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, when Gracie was getting a little more spunk in her, we headed outside to hunt some Easter eggs. Chris and I hid them, and we color coded them for the kids. We knew Bean would get to them faster than Gracie, and we had to hide some out in the open for her but we didn&#8217;t want Bean Man taking those first. So, we told Bean that he had to find the green and blue eggs, and Gracie hunted the pink and purple. Orange eggs were free for anyone.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5548 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607190798/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8395/8607190798_d77f30278f.jpg" alt="IMG_5548" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5550 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606086693/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8606086693_6b92daf29f.jpg" alt="IMG_5550" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5557 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606088589/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8606088589_f07db8fc21.jpg" alt="IMG_5557" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5559 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606089553/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8606089553_f64c2c316a.jpg" alt="IMG_5559" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5562 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606091189/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606091189_5706c5f310.jpg" alt="IMG_5562" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5563 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607196678/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8607196678_ec84d731e9.jpg" alt="IMG_5563" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Bean Man found the Golden Egg, which had $2 in it. You would have thought that he&#8217;d won the lottery!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5576 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606093975/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8606093975_2078d70f41.jpg" alt="IMG_5576" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>All that hunting wore Gracie out, so we spent the rest of the afternoon in this position.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5578 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606095213/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8117/8606095213_40b442b1e5.jpg" alt="IMG_5578" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when the fever started. She spiked a high fever while napping, which prompted me to cancel our Easter lunch on Sunday. We had planned to have four families over, all with kids under 4 years old. With a stomach bug running through our house, I could just picture everyone calling me the next week saying their little one was down with the bug. Rather than get everyone sick, we canceled our lunch. I was really bummed because I&#8217;d planned this huge meal, and had spent all afternoon on Friday making party favors for the kids. But sickness comes, and you gotta do what you gotta do. I think we&#8217;re going to reschedule and have a cook out in a couple weeks instead. Rain checks are better than canceling!</p>
<p>This morning when we woke up, Gracie was still running a fever, but hadn&#8217;t thrown up since Saturday afternoon. So, we took our chances and put her in an Easter dress and headed to church. We kept the kids with us instead of putting them in the nursery so that we didn&#8217;t share our germs with our church friends.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5584 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607200654/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8546/8607200654_483b1c4274.jpg" alt="IMG_5584" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>When we got home, Chris showed me that he had hidden his Gator spirit under his church clothes all morning. Turns out it didn&#8217;t help. Which means my bracket is shot because I had the Gators winning it all. Stupid Gators. I should have known better&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5585 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607201360/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8253/8607201360_c0dfc4a248.jpg" alt="IMG_5585" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>When we got home, we opened Easter baskets from Grandmomma. These were the third Easter baskets of the weekend, but the only baskets we took pictures of!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5587 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8607202176/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8400/8607202176_a4d1f59295.jpg" alt="IMG_5587" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Bean got these giant blow up &#8220;punchers,&#8221; as he calls them. But Grandmomma only gave him one set, which means we have nothing to defend ourselves with. So, basically, Bean&#8217;s been pummeling us all day. But &#8211; HEY! &#8211; it&#8217;s Easter!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5612 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606104127/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8606104127_6fdeb63382.jpg" alt="IMG_5612" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5609 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8606102899/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8248/8606102899_816884b852.jpg" alt="IMG_5609" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Over the course of the day, Gracie&#8217;s stomach bug has moved into the other end of the digestive system, and we&#8217;ve been having blow out diapers all day. Because she is so sick on her stomach, she isn&#8217;t eating anything. She wasn&#8217;t drinking anything for a while, either, and I was so worried we&#8217;d end up at the ER for dehydration. But, thankfully, she started drinking Gatorade and Pedialyte late this afternoon. She&#8217;s eating a few saltines, but not many. And she&#8217;s still running that fever. Chris is going to stay home with her tomorrow, and I see a visit to the pediatrician in our near future.</p>
<p>Overall, it wasn&#8217;t the Easter that I was expecting to have, but it was still full of the things that matter. Lots of family, lots of food, lots of jellybeans, and lots of thankful prayers.</p>
<p>HAPPY EASTER FROM OUR FAMILY TO YOURS!</p>

<p>This year, the Easter baskets runneth over for my kids.  Both grandmothers and I all made Easter baskets, so we are doling them out at various points throughout Easter weekend.  Grandmomma&#8217;s baskets will be opened tonight at our house.  She made them and stashed them here when she was visiting for Gracie&#8217;s birthday.  Chris and I will bring them out tonight for the kids.  Tomorrow we are having Easter lunch with Nana and my Grandma, and we&#8217;ll open Easter baskets from her then.  And, of course, the Easter Bunny will leave his basket on Saturday night, so we&#8217;ll open those on Sunday morning after church.</p>
<p>The Easter Bunny sent me an email with some pictures of his baskets so that I could share them with you all.  Just don&#8217;t tell Bean and Gracie&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5494 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596791378/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8596791378_1c5a87dabb.jpg" alt="IMG_5494" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Gracie&#8217;s basket:</p>
<p>A Veggie Tales big board book ($5 at Family Christian bookstores)<br />
A pad of princess stickers ($1 at Michael&#8217;s)<br />
An Elmo boo boo ice pack so she doesn&#8217;t have to keep using the Spiderman one ($4.50 at Babies R Us)<br />
A new Mickey Mouse sippy cup ($5 at Target)<br />
A set of Minnie Mouse hair clips ($1 at Michaels)<br />
A giant Dora the Explorer oversized novelty pen ($1 at Michaels)<br />
M&amp;M&#8217;s and a few Elmo plastic eggs with jellybeans inside</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8598331665/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8598331665_5f01e5ac3d_m.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="240" height="179" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m slowly getting back into running again.  I&#8217;m up to three or four times a week, and it feels so good.  Well, mentally, at least.  Physically, I&#8217;m freaking sore!  My calves are throbbing, my back is aching, and my thighs feel like they&#8217;ve been put in one of those paint shakers at Home Depot.  As my dad always said, getting old is hell!  But, I&#8217;m doing it one step at a time.  If I don&#8217;t feel like running on a day when I planned to run, then I walk.  If I&#8217;m running and get tired, then I turn back for home.  I&#8217;m trying not to push myself too hard yet.  My body needs to adjust to our old routine before I can start expecting it to just take off like it used to.</p>
<p>But last weekend, that all went to crap.</p>
<p>Last week, I ran my farthest since my dad died.  4.5 miles.  And I came home and felt awesome.  I went to work that day and literally danced all day long.  We were doing a poetry analysis of Katy Perry&#8217;s song, &#8220;Firework,&#8221; and I danced it out every period.  My students thought I was insane.  And then some of them took videos of it on their phones, and I&#8217;m almost 99% positive that I&#8217;m out there on YouTube somewhere, dancing it up with a video title that says, &#8220;My Teacher&#8217;s Lost Her Mind.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AumwgkFOzXg?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, having been that pumped up about my long run, I instantly needed more.  Running is addicting, and once you hit that happy place, you just want to stay there.  Like, forever.  So, I immediately came home from school that day and signed up for a stinking 10k run!  That was less than a week away!  And to make it even worse, I called my mother-in-law (who is not only a runner herself, but a race coordinator and a Jeff Galloway certified trainer) and my sister-in-law (who is a new runner, but has already kicked my butt by running a half marathon right out of the gate &#8211; I sort of hate her&#8230;) and my friend, Dawn (who shared my views on running, family, faith, work, life, humor, marriage, and just about everything in between).  And I made them all sign up for the race, too!  Now I had a team!  Which meant that when the runner and dancer&#8217;s high wore off later that night, I was stuck and there was no way I could back out even if I wanted to.</p>
<p>So, this past Saturday, Jackie, Annie and I got up at 5:15am and headed to the race.  It was POURING rain.  We were soaked by the time we got to the starting line.  But there was no way I was backing out now.  I had just pumped myself up for three whole days.  I was running a 10k that morning, whether it was raining or not.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8599433062/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8599433062_f5aa72427c.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="408" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>The rain situation was somewhat improved when I met up with Dawn and discovered there was a big group of runners from my church running, too.  Somehow, seeing other moms out there pumped and ready to go gave me the false impression that I was ready to go, too.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8598332955/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8598332955_f08f05c4fd.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="500" height="490" /></a></p>
<p>And then the horn sounded, and there was no turning back.  False impression, runners high, or not, I was going to run a 10k without any training at all.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8598335141/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8598335141_f8081c215e.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="374" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>The first three miles of the race were pretty good. I sing while I run, always have. I think it&#8217;s because I run so early in the mornings so no one is around. Plus, my music is blaring in my ears and I just let it all out. I sing LOUDLY, too. And I didn&#8217;t see any reason not to continue with that while I was racing with all these people. I sang for a good part of the first three miles. Mostly, I serenaded Annie, who I think was pretty embarrassed. But honey badger don&#8217;t care. Honey badger wants to SING.</p>
<p>(Can you tell I&#8217;m singing in this picture?)</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8598328873/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8598328873_9272b9702f.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>By mile four, I was regretting the singing. I probably should have conserved that energy. That&#8217;s probably why more people don&#8217;t sing while they run&#8230; I started getting slow in the fourth mile. And I&#8217;m pretty slow to begin with. But I was still so excited!</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8598328587/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8598328587_0f8285efbe.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>At the end of the fourth mile, I realized that if I didn&#8217;t pee somewhere, I was going to have a real situation on my hands. I finally found a port-a-potty on a construction site at some home that was being renovated. I hated having to stop because a) I was already super slow on my time and I didn&#8217;t want to be even slower, b) I didn&#8217;t want to hold Jackie and Annie back, and c) I really didn&#8217;t want to pee in a port-a-potty. But a what are ya gonna do in mile four of a race when your bladder is about to explode? You&#8217;re going to find a blue plastic port-a-potty and you&#8217;re gonna pee in it. And then you&#8217;re going to realize that it has been raining and your running capris are soaked, which makes them incredibly difficult to pull back up again. And then you&#8217;re going to hop around inside the port-a-potty while trying not to touch anything and tugging on your pants until you think they might tear. And then you&#8217;re going to WIN, and your pants will be pulled up like a real grown up. And then you&#8217;re going to run back out and join the rest of the runners and finish your damn race. THAT&#8217;S what you&#8217;re gonna do.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8599428014/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8599428014_ff4cdc0de0.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="408" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Mile five brought all kinds of pain. And cursing. And walking. And more cursing. At this point, I didn&#8217;t even try to keep up with Jackie and Annie. I just kept thinking, &#8220;All you have to do is finish. Just do whatever it takes to finish. And don&#8217;t throw up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mile six was brutal. Absolutely brutal. I believe it was in this mile that I told Jackie she was a terrible mother-in-law for trying to encourage me to be a runner. It was a low time, people. A very low time.</p>
<p>By the very last .2 miles, I was pacing myself with this older gentleman who was slow, like me, but still looked like he had some spunk left in him. In the last .2 miles, Jackie and Annie came back to where I was and insisted that we all cross the finish line together. As I surged forward with them, I yelled out to the man when I passed him, &#8220;WILL YOU PLEASE CARRY ME????&#8221; Another low point.</p>
<p>But, there at the finish line were Chris, Beanie, and Gracie cheering for me. I pushed one more time and made it across the finish line.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8599427748/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8102/8599427748_23b6995e9c.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="408" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Let me tell you, don&#8217;t run a 10k without training, folks. It wasn&#8217;t so much the distance that was the problem. It was my body. I was sore for DAYS. DAYS, I tell you. I have hobbled around all week like an old lady. My back has been killing me. It just wasn&#8217;t prepared to support me for that long of a distance. 5k&#8217;s you can probably wing, but a 10k is just painful if you haven&#8217;t had any preparation. At least, it was for my flabby butt.</p>
<p><a title="Untitled by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8599429294/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8599429294_8036237998.jpg" alt="Untitled" width="377" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Thank goodness, though, for family and friends who don&#8217;t see you as the flabby-bottomed, sore, old lady that you are. Instead, they see me as a runner. And it&#8217;s pretty nice to wear that title again.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="3dcfe882ac67895bc1f627347da132a0 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596880568/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8596880568_687f2269e0_m.jpg" alt="3dcfe882ac67895bc1f627347da132a0" width="171" height="240" /></a><br />
I&#8217;m in the middle of an eight-week small group Bible study at my church.  Our ministers asked a group of people to participate and go through this sort of training period, so that when they open small groups up to the congregation next fall, we will be the small group leaders.  I&#8217;m super excited about it.  I love small groups when it comes to spiritual reflection.  I think I get more out of a group of 6-10 people than I do in any other form of worship.</p>
<p>The method of studying the Bible that we are learning is actually a monastic style of study.  It is based on principles of worship and reflection that monks have used for hundreds of years.  I love the ideas behind the practice, but, to be honest, it feels pretty foreign to me at this point.  We have been talking a lot about being versus doing in our faith, and we&#8217;ve concluded as a small group that it is much easier to DO than it is to BE.  To do gives you tasks and things to accomplish.  Tangible boxes to check and a sense of accomplishment when you finish.  Often, doing is led by others &#8211; a minister giving a sermon, an author writing a book, a small group leader directing the discussion.  But to BE is very different.  To be is to simply be in God&#8217;s presence.  To not ask for anything, to not give anything, to not focus on anything other than being in his presence and listening.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking and praying a lot lately about being and about listening.  As a pretty outgoing person, I tend to talk a lot.  I&#8217;m always telling stories or sharing my point of view.  As a blogger, my world revolves around my experiences and my challenges and my struggles.  If you were to put a label on me, you could call me noisy.  But lately, there have been huge indications that perhaps it is time that I listened for a while.  For one thing, this Bible study came right as I was pondering this issue for myself.  How strange (or divine?) that I would be thinking about this topic myself and then suddenly my small group at church is discussing it.  For another, I&#8217;ve been doing some writing on the side other than for this blog, and I just finished an article about silence last week that was not really related to my small group discussion, but ended up being exactly what our discussion was about last night.  I may be a little skeptical of burning bushes, but I know enough to recognize when God is trying to get my attention.</p>
<p><em>Message received, Lord.</em></p>
<p>But my thoughts about silence and listening have actually gone beyond my faith.  I think these might be principles that could serve anyone of any belief system.  The idea that sometimes we need to BE, instead of DO.  That sometimes we need to put it all down for a while &#8211; the phones, the tablets, the television, the jobs, and even the spouses and the children &#8211; and just be still.  For me, that might mean be still and know God more fully, but for others that might mean to be still and reconnect to ourselves, or hear the heartbeat of the universe around us.  For some it might mean to be still and clear our mind of clutter, doubts, fears, and anxieties.  And for others still, it might mean to be still and simply sit in peace.  Whatever it is that you hear, I&#8217;m pretty sure there are some things that we only hear in the silence.</p>
<p><a title="3dcfe882ac67895bc1f627347da132a0 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8596880568/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8596880568_687f2269e0.jpg" alt="3dcfe882ac67895bc1f627347da132a0" width="357" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>A big focus for me in the past few weeks has been to be still and listen in my marriage.  Chris is such a laid back, gentle person, and it is usually me who drives our communication.  Normally, that&#8217;s not a bad thing.  Someone has to get us talking, and that task just usually falls on me.  I don&#8217;t mind because Chris always talks back.  He&#8217;s just generally not going to be the first one to bring it up.  But lately as I have sat in silence and thought about the importance of silence, I have wondered if maybe that&#8217;s not true.  Maybe Chris would bring things up.  Maybe he would speak first more, if only I was quiet enough to let him have a chance.  Maybe it&#8217;s not that he&#8217;s quiet.  Maybe it&#8217;s just that it takes him longer to prepare what he wants to say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve focused this week, especially, on being quiet in my marriage.  On listening.  On asking questions about Chris and his day-to-day life.  I make sure to listen when he speaks, even if what he is saying seems small.  I heard someone caution one time that small does not mean insignificant, and I need to remember that when my husband speaks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on finding silence in my life right now.  I&#8217;m learning how to quiet my head and listen with my heart, to both God and my husband.  Perhaps it was no coincidence that God gave us one mouth, but two ears.  It&#8217;s probably time I learned to use them.</p>

We are deep into Phase Three of potty training at our house.  Potty Camp 2013 has officially begun.  I&#8217;ve been chronicling the steps that we use in our house to potty train, so if you&#8217;re interested in <a title="Gracie Update: Age 22 Months" href="http://marriageconfessions.com/2013/01/30/gracie-update-age-22-months/">Step One</a> or <a title="Potty Training, Step Two" href="http://marriageconfessions.com/2013/03/17/potty-training-step-two/">Step Two</a>, be sure to go back and read them.  This week we started Step Three &#8211; Potty Camp 2013!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5317 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8591276898/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8591276898_40fdf33e08.jpg" alt="IMG_5317" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Potty Camp is what I call the official, traditional, tied-to-a-potty-for-several-days potty training period.  Once Gracie first showed interested in going potty, we transitioned into practicing on the potty in Step Two.  Now that I have a full week off for Spring Break, we are using this long period of time at home for Potty Camp.  During this step, Gracie has started to wear panties instead of a diaper, has started using the potty regularly throughout the day, and is learning to tell me when she has to go before it happens.</p>
<p>Here are the key parts for our family:</p>
<p>1.  We get up in the morning and change Gracie out of her diaper and into panties.  She immediately goes to sit on the potty.</p>
<p>2.  I set our kitchen timer for 15 minutes.  Then, every time the timer goes off, we run to the potty to sit for a while.  After we&#8217;re through, I reset the timer for another 15 minutes.  If Gracie doesn&#8217;t go potty after 30-40 minutes of this routine, then I narrow the timer to 12 minutes, and finally down to 10.  What I&#8217;m trying to do is catch her on the potty when she has to go.  So, if I know it&#8217;s coming soon, we make more frequent visits to the potty to wait.</p>
<p>3.  I hung a big piece of butcher paper on the wall by the kids potty.  That&#8217;s our sticker chart.  They make actual charts, but neither of my kids could ever get the stickers in the right place on a chart, so I just use a big sheet of paper now.  She can put the sticker wherever she wants on the chart when she goes potty.  She also gets one Skittle or M&amp;M.  If she doesn&#8217;t actually use the bathroom, she doesn&#8217;t get a sticker or a candy, but I try to make it sound positive when she asks and I have to tell her no.  I say something like, &#8220;Oh, I know you wanted a sticker, but we didn&#8217;t go pee pee in the potty yet.  Maybe next time we will pee pee and then we can get a sticker and a treat!&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5202 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8564944369/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8564944369_5dd1fcc500.jpg" alt="IMG_5202" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>4.  To keep Gracie sitting on the potty for as long as possible (to ensure that she has the largest window of opportunity for going pee pee in the potty), we use all kinds of tricks and games.  We sing songs, read books, play with mommy&#8217;s iPhone, play with baby dolls, play with bath toys, and watch movies on the iPad.  It also helps having Bean in the room because she&#8217;ll sit longer when he&#8217;s there, too.</p>
<p>5.  Throughout the day, I ask Gracie if she needs to go potty.  At this point (Day Two), she says yes every time, whether she needs to go or not.  But that&#8217;s okay.  She&#8217;s learning that if she tells me she has to go potty, we will go right to the potty.  Even if that is for false alarms right now, at least she is leaning how we get to the potty in the first place.  (&#8220;I tell Mommy, and she takes me.&#8221;)</p>
<p>6.  I stop potty training around 4:00 or 5:00 every day.  Usually, by this point, Gracie is tired of the ordeal and I don&#8217;t want to push her.  Also, I&#8217;ve noticed that she tends to have more accidents later in the day, and I think it&#8217;s just because she is over it.  So, I stop around 4:00 or 5:00 and put her back in a diaper for the evening and nighttime.  Then, we end on a positive note and can begin the next day on a positive note, too, because I haven&#8217;t pushed her too far.  As the week stretches on, I&#8217;ll probably lengthen that window and we&#8217;ll try making it to bath time and then bedtime without a diaper.</p>
<p>There are several goals of Potty Camp.  First, that Gracie learns that she has to tell me when she needs to go potty.  Second, that when she gets into the bathroom, she learns how to pull her panties up and down by herself.  Third, that she learns to wait on the potty until she actually goes to the bathroom.  Fourth, that Gracie learns what it feels like when she has to go potty.  And finally (and towards the end of the week), she learns to tell me BEFORE she goes potty that she needs to go.  It will take her probably all week to get to those last two steps.</p>
<p>A few things I have to remind myself throughout the week:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>She is going to have accidents, and that is a good thing.  Having an accident is what often prompts kids to start wanting to go potty.  That&#8217;s the reason I prefer not to use trainer diapers or pull-ups.  I want her to feel the difference between going potty in her diaper and going potty in her panties.</li>
<li>After accidents, I never, ever scold her.  Ever.  Potty training should be fun and exciting.  I want Gracie to WANT to go sit on the potty.  So, if she has an accident, I say in my very best, over the top voice, &#8220;OH, NO!  Uh oh!  We had an accident.  That&#8217;s okay!  Let&#8217;s go to the potty and try again!&#8221;  And then we head immediately to the bathroom and sit on the potty again.  Just so she knows that when we have to use the bathroom, we sit on the potty.</li>
<li>We won&#8217;t be fully dressed for a couple of days.  Gracie has been running around in a t-shirt and panties this week.  Sometimes, I put leggings on her if she&#8217;s getting chilly, but mostly it&#8217;s just shirts and panties.  I thought maybe a little dress would be okay, but it was actually kind of hard for her to manage when she sat on the potty, so we left the dresses in the closet this week and are sticking to t-shirts.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not a great idea to let a potty-training toddler sit on your unprotected furniture.  I took this picture all while thinking, &#8220;I should make her get down or else she&#8217;s going to pee on my couch.&#8221;  And 10 seconds later, she did.  Oops.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I try to be consistent during Potty Camp, and on the days or for the few hours when we aren&#8217;t consistent, I put Gracie back in a diaper.  I want her to be successful this week, not challenge her in new situations.  So, when we run to the grocery store or spent the day at my mom&#8217;s house, I put her back in a diaper.  I still took her on potty breaks, but she kept the diaper on so that if she had an accident it wasn&#8217;t such a big deal.  It will be a little time before I start taking her out of the house in only panties.  She&#8217;s got to master that concept first, and then we&#8217;ll try exploring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best advice I can give a potty-training parent is to be patient and consistent, consistent, consistent.  Sometimes, Gracie doesn&#8217;t want to go sit on the potty when the timer dings.  It&#8217;s fun for the first part of the day, but by middle of the afternoon, she&#8217;s sort of over it.  But I still take her and gently encourage her to sit on the potty, even if it&#8217;s just for a minute or two.  The more consistent I am, the better chances of success she has.  And I want her to be successful, so she can be really proud of herself.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5200 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8564943747/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8564943747_bc3d86445a.jpg" alt="IMG_5200" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s about all there is to report from the trenches right now.  Gracie is averaging about two accidents a day, and still thinks this is all super fun.  I&#8217;m hoping that tomorrow and Friday I can really get her to start being more aware of telling me when she needs to go, instead of me instigating it every time.  But you know what they say&#8230; plan to be surprised!  That is never more true than when potty training!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="IMG_5355 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8591303202/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8591303202_aebd7c0067_m.jpg" alt="IMG_5355" width="240" height="160" /></a><br />
When Gracie was a baby, she was too small for Bean to play with.  He would occasionally bring his toys over and play next to her, but that was really the extent of their relationship.  That and sneaking her pieces of cheese when she was entirely too small to have chunks of cheese in her mouth.  Almost gave me a heart attack several times.</p>
<p>About six months ago, they went through this very frustrating time when Bean realized that Gracie was now able to play with the toys, which meant he now had to share things.  That phase didn&#8217;t go over well with Bean.  There were frequent shouts of &#8220;mine!&#8221; in our house, until I banned the word to the naughty list.  Now, no one is allowed to say &#8220;mine&#8221; in our house.  Why?  Because everything is actually MINE.  I bought it, I simply ALLOW my children to play with it.  So, when they start claiming toys as untouchable for the other, I remind them that I have supreme authority over all the toys in the land.  It comes with my Mom crown.  Make sure you get yours before you leave the hospital when you have your baby.  They are quite handy.</p>
<p>Lately, though, the kids have been getting along so well.  So, so, so well.  I can send them upstairs to someone&#8217;s room to play, and I won&#8217;t hear a things from them for over an hour if I don&#8217;t go up there and check on them.  Now, there are times of the day when this works out better than others, but for the most part, all is quiet and docile in the sibling world at our house.</p>
<p>Which is why when things like these pictures below happen, Chris and I simply hide in a corner somewhere and take pictures on rapid shot.  Who knows how long this phase is going to last?  It might end tomorrow, for crying out loud.  We&#8217;re going to enjoy it while it&#8217;s here!</p>
<p>Chris took these pictures the afternoon of Gracie&#8217;s birthday party.  After all the guests had left, the two of them ended up on the kitchen floor together, just having a great time with a balloon.</p>

<p>Gracie turned two yesterday, but we celebrated on Saturday with family.  It was a pretty low key celebration, which is just the kind of party that Gracie likes.  She&#8217;s not big on the crowds and action, so hanging out with grandparents, aunts, and uncles was perfect for her.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5300 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8590173423/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8590173423_8e0091e319.jpg" alt="IMG_5300" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>But even the low number of people in attendance made our living room look like Christmas morning!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5245 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8590155225/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8510/8590155225_cd4b476989.jpg" alt="IMG_5245" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

Gracie wanted a Minnie Mouse themed party, so we had little Minnie Mouse decorations hanging from the ceiling in the kitchen (which I did not take any pictures of, sorry&#8230;). We also got Minnie Mouse balloons, along with pink and white balloons for our mailbox and scattered in bunches around the living room. There was also a Spiderman balloon that we snuck in there somewhere for Bean Man&#8230; And, of course, there was the Minnie Mouse birthday cake.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5287 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8591269030/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8521/8591269030_6448b4be6c.jpg" alt="IMG_5287" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>After opening presents and eating cake, we headed outside to play with Gracie&#8217;s two biggest gifts. Nana got her a new water table, and Grandmomma got her a sandbox. I think I am just as excited about this as both of the kids were. During the summer, we are outside all day long and these toys will be perfect!</p>

<p>Yesterday, on her actual birthday, Chris and I took the kids to the zoo to celebrate. It was a small zoo, but there was still a lot to do. It was gorgeous weather, and we stayed almost all day!</p>
<p><a title="IMG_5363 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8591306776/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8591306776_ee3c27c114.jpg" alt="IMG_5363" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5394 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8591319306/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8093/8591319306_df6d0b7b06.jpg" alt="IMG_5394" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><a title="IMG_5428 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/8590223459/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8238/8590223459_d6c45ce74f.jpg" alt="IMG_5428" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>

<p>When we first got to the zoo, Gracie flipped out at the very first exhibit. Chris and I were like, &#8220;Great. She&#8217;s afraid of animals and we brought her to a zoo on her birthday&#8230;&#8221; But, turns out, she&#8217;s just afraid of birds! And who can blame her? They kind of freak me out, too!</p>

<p>As the day went on, though, Gracie warmed up to the zoo. I think at first she was worried that something was going to jump out and get her. She was really jumpy. But Bean was a real life saver because the more he did, the more Gracie wanted to do, too!</p>

<p>Our favorite part was the giraffe exhibit. They had the spectator platforms built up really high so that we were literally face to face with the giraffes. They were really friendly, and you could feed them right out of your hand. Gracie liked them from afar, but Bean Man was right there in the middle of it!</p>

<p>It was a really great way to spend Gracie&#8217;s birthday, and we had fun together as a family, too. I can&#8217;t believe that sweet Gracie Girl is two! Where has the time gone????</p>

I should wait until tomorrow to post our annual birthday video for Gracie, but I just can&#8217;t do it! I can&#8217;t believe our sweet Gracie is two years old on Monday! Where has the time gone?!?!</p>
<p>We love you so much, Gracie! You&#8217;re our little firecracker that keeps this family on its toes. You bring us sunshine and happiness every day, sweet girl. We love watching you grow, and can&#8217;t wait to see what the world has to offer you.</p>
<p>We love you to pieces,<br />
Mommy, Daddy, and Beanie</p>

So, I casually mentioned in a blog post last week that I signed up for a 10k. And no one is freaking out about it, so I thought I would say it again to give people ample time to die laughing.</p>
<p>I SIGNED UP TO RUN A 10K THIS WEEKEND.</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3571 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7289992180/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7082/7289992180_6925389510.jpg" alt="IMG_3571" width="333" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>This is funny and terrifying on several levels.</p>
<p>Level One &#8211; I have never run a 10k before. Ever. In fact, the farthest distance I have ever run was 8 miles. And that was at my peak last year.</p>
<p>Level Two &#8211; I haven&#8217;t run regularly since August. I get out maybe once or twice a week now.</p>
<p>Level Three &#8211; The farthest I have run in the past seven months has been 3.5 miles.</p>
<p>And so, CLEARLY, I am in the best position possible to run my farthest race yet.</p>
<p>(Go ahead and laugh now.)</p>
<p>(And while you&#8217;re at it, laugh at this picture. Especially Bean.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3592 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7290066694/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7229/7290066694_701bafdff4.jpg" alt="IMG_3592" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Seriously, I don&#8217;t know what happened. All I know is that I ran 3.5 miles last week (which is my favorite distance to run &#8211; just long enough to get the runner&#8217;s high, but short enough that I can still function for the rest of the day), came home, jumped on the computer, and signed up for the first race I found in my area.</p>
<p>This is what happens, people, when you make decisions while on a runner&#8217;s high. Or any kind of high, I would imagine. Things seem totally doable and fun and like the right thing to do. And then you wake up the next morning and think, &#8220;What the heck just happened?!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>The worst (or best?) part is that I immediately texted my friend, Dawn, and convinced her to sign up.</p>
<p>(That&#8217;s Dawn on the left of me in this picture. We sometimes run races together. And we sometimes run away from our problems together. That&#8217;s the best kind of friend to have.)</p>
<p><a title="IMG_3946 by marriageconfessions, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marriageconfessions/7509003094/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/7509003094_6b90a1efef.jpg" alt="IMG_3946" width="500" height="387" /></a></p>
<p>Then I emailed my mother-in-law, who will be in town this weekend, and got her to sign up, too. And then I texted my sister-in-law and convinced her to run, too. So, now, I couldn&#8217;t even back out if I wanted! I&#8217;ve got PEOPLE! I have a TEAM!</p>
<p>WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME, IMAGINARY FRIENDS????? WHY WEREN&#8217;T YOU ALL HERE TO STOP ME FROM MAKING NO GOOD, VERY BAD CHOICES?!?!?!?</p>
<p>You really dropped the ball on this one, imaginary friends. I&#8217;m very disappointed in you.</p>
