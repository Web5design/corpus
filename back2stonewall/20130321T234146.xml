				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Osmond, best known for his years as one of the Osmond Family singers.<em> (The one with the mutton chops)</em> and his wife Suzanne<em> (along with various &#8220;other&#8221; Osmond Family members)</em> are taking time off from performing in Branson, MO to hold an anti-gay marriage hate rally in Salt Lake City, Utah at the State House called: <em>&#8220;A Celebration of Marriage &#8211; Every Child Deserves A Mom and Dad&#8221;</em> that will coincide with the Supreme Court cases over Prop 8 and DOMA and also the National Organization For Marriage&#8217;s hate march in Washington, DC:</p>
<p>Alan Osmond  currently serves on the high council of the Orem Suncrest Stake in Orem, Utah for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recently penned an anti-gay article for the Mormon website<a href="http://www.thefamily.com/" target="_blank"><em><strong> The Family</strong></em>,</a> which is run by <em>“The Osmond Network LLC”</em> and is linked to by the<strong><a href="http://osmond.com/about-us/alan/" target="_blank"> “Official Osmond Family Website”</a></strong></p>
<p>In Osmond&#8217;s article<em><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2011/11/alan-osmond-osmond-family-pens-anti-gay-article-defending-gay-reparative-therapy-mormon-church.html"> (which you can read by clicking HERE) </a></em>he states that being gay<em> is not genetic</em> and <em>that reparative therapy does work. </em> He also goes on to quote LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley who has said in the past <em>“Prophets of God have repeatedly taught through the ages that practices of homosexual relations, fornication, and adultery are grievous sins. Sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage are forbidden by the Lord. We affirm those teachings.” </em></p>
<p>Theres been no word on whether Marie Osmond and her lesbian daughter will be attending.</p>

<p>The Canadian House of Commons <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/03/20/pol-transgender-rights-bill-approved.html" target="_blank">has approved</a> a bill that makes it illegal to discriminate against transgender persons.</p>
<p>The legislation, <a href="http://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-279/" target="_blank">C-279</a>, An act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, was introduced as a private member&#8217;s bill by New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Randall Garrison and passed by a vote of 149-137. Typically, MPs are allowed to cast conscience votes on private member&#8217;s bills, which rarely become law.</p>
<p>All members of the opposition Liberal, New Democratic, Bloc Québécois and Green parties voted in favour or abstained, while 18 members of the governing Conservative Party supported the legislation, including four cabinet ministers. Prime Minister Stephen Harper cast his vote against C-279.</p>
<p>Echoing right-wing opposition to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21870064" target="_blank">similar legislative efforts</a> in Arizona, Canadian Conservatives had objected to the bill on the grounds that the safety of women and children would be compromised by allowing biological males to use women&#8217;s bathrooms, despite a recommendation by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to include transgender identity in anti-discrimination and anti-hate legislation.</p>

<p><em>“This season takes place in the 1960s, where the pants are very tight and leave little to the imagination,” a source tells us. “Jon’s impressive anatomy is so distracting that they politely insisted on underwear.”</em></p>
<p><em>“His privates are the inside joke. (Hamm) knows what he’s got. Imagine how distracting that would be on the side of a bus or building.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://www.famouswhy.com/pictures/people/natalia_paris.jpg" /></p>
<p>IN <em>what the hell is she talking about </em>news comes this bizarre story from a so-called model and possibly mediocre animal rights activist that is making a suggestion that people become gay as a result of eating hormone injected chicken. Yeah, she&#8217;s serious. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/chicken-hormones-kids-gay-natalia-paris_n_2909135.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong>A popular Colombian model thinks chicken injected with hormones can &#8220;turn&#8221; a child gay.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Colombia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.caracoltv.com/" target="_hplink">CaracolTV</a> filmed 39-year-old model <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/colombian-model-slammed-eating-chicken-turn-gay-article-1.1292738" target="_hplink">Natalia Paris apparently arguing that hormones in chicken are turning children gay</a>. The model reportedly made the comments as she greeted fans outside a store in Bogota, according to the New York Daily News.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>In the video clip, Paris claims girls between the ages of 7 and 10 are starting to develop sooner because hormones in poultry make everything in the body accelerate.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;That&#8217;s why those boys who are eating those chickens&#8230; they&#8217;re starting to turn into homosexuals,&#8221; she says, later adding that we need to be aware of the things we consume.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>SCROLL FOR VIDEO</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Natalia-Paris/49677819234?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts" target="_hplink">Facebook users</a> chastised <a href="http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news-lite/news/28577-eating-chicken-causes-homosexuality-colombian-model.html" target="_hplink">Paris for her offensive comments</a>, and the National Federation for Colombian Poultry Farmers (FENAVI) even had something to say.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;When you hear this kind of a statement from a public figure like Natalia Paris, we must express our total outrage,&#8221; FENAVI president Andres Fernando Moncada said, according to Colombia Reports. He dismissed Paris&#8217; claims as &#8220;urban myths.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Colombia Reports notes that <a href="http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news-lite/beauty/22245-natalia-paris-begs-like-a-dog-for-animal-rights-video.html" target="_hplink">Paris is a vocal animal rights activist</a>.</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>See, here&#8217;s the thing. I know that there are produce companies that have been found to use chemicals in their food to make it look a certain way. And I definitely get why there should be concern because these chemicals could in fact produce carcinogens as well as other potentially dangerous health issues. We should be concerned about what is being put into our food and how our animals are treated.</p>
<p>But the tone she takes in this statement is as if being gay is wrong. That being gay is in fact something you don&#8217;t want to be. That it&#8217;s something resulting in chemical changes brought on by food is laughable. And extremely insulting. Maybe she didn&#8217;t mean to but she is condemning homosexuality and inferring that it should be feared when it&#8217;s not. It completely makes any other points she made about the potential effects of this company invalid. So she can take her pseudo theories and eat them .</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Reems">Harry Reems</a>, a former adult film star who is best remembered for tickling the tonsils of Linda Lovelace in the 1972 classic porn film <em>Deep Throat</em> passed away yesterday at the George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center in Salt Lake City, UT  at the <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/deep_throat_xxx_porn_actor_harry_reems_has_died">age of 65</a> from pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Reems, born Herbert Streicher,  appeared in more than 100 pornographic films, in the 70&#8242;s and 80&#8242;s  including &#8220;<em>Forced Entry&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;The Devil in Miss Jones.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But the<em> &#8220;controversy&#8221;</em> of Deep Throat  led the FBI to indict Reems for conspiracy to distribute obscene material across state lines, a charge he was initially convicted of before a higher court overruled the decision and also ruined his acting career.  Reems&#8217;s defense claimed that he was the first <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States">American</a> actor to be prosecuted by the federal government merely for appearing in a film, and he received considerable support from established Hollywood and New York celebrities during his trial  His successful appeal was handled by attorney <a title="Alan Dershowitz" href="/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a> who was also Larry Flynts lawyer.</p>
<p>Reems aspired to be an actor in non-pornographic films, and in the late 1970s was cast in his first studio movie, <em>&#8220;Grease,&#8221;</em> as Coach Calhoun, the Rydell High track coach but was kicked off the project because of his <em>&#8220;scandalous past.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Acting was my true love, and I buried that possibility by going into adult films,&#8221;</em> Reems told Dave Itzkoff for a 2005 New York magazine piece. <em>&#8220;The writing was on the wall. There was no place for me in conventional entertainment.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>During the second half of his career, upset by his inability to break through to more traditional acting and low on funds, he turned to alcohol drug abuse and panhandling and began his recovery in 1989. He married and converted to Christianity and  not only got sober but had a second act as a successful real estate broker.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Michell-Shock-is-a-bitch1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23080" alt="Michell Shock is a bitch" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Michell-Shock-is-a-bitch1.png" width="297" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>Audio has just emerged of Michelle Shocked’s anti-gay rant at a show in San Francisco that have caused the implosion of her U.S. tour and, in all likelihood, her career thanks to the intrepid (and HOT) John Becker of <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/20/michelle-shocked-audio-emerge/"><em>JohnMBecker.com</em></a> who is a great supporter and contributor to Back2Stonewall.com.</p>
<p>Shocked <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/20/michelle-shocked-responds-i-was-misunderstood/">claimed</a> this afternoon that her remarks were <em>“misinterpreted.”</em> The audio itself suggests otherwise. I’ve transcribed it below (and bolded the relevant parts) so readers and listeners can judge for themselves.</p>
<p>Listen:</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F84134147" height="166" width="50%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe></center>It all starts at the 4:37 mark:</p>
<p><strong>Michelle Shocked:</strong> <em>So it’s not too late. You can jump into this Jesus gang anytime you want. But, um, I was in a prayer meeting yesterday, and you’ve gotta appreciate how scared, how scared folks on that side of the equation are. I mean, from their vantage point — and I really shouldn’t say ‘their,’ because it’s mine, too — we are nearly at the end of time. And from our vantage point, we’re gonna be, uhhh, I think maybe Chinese water torture is gonna be the means, the method — once Prop 8 gets, uh, instated, and once, um, preachers are held at gunpoint and forced to marry the homosexuals, I’m pretty sure that that will be the signal for Jesus to come on back [emphases mine].</em></p>
<p>There you have it, folks. Remember, Shocked <a href="http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/20/michelle-shocked-speaks-on-anti-gay-rant/">told</a> CNN that ”[her] statement equating repeal of Prop 8 with the coming of the End Times was neither literal nor ironic: it was a description of how some folks – not me – feel about gay marriage.” But as the audio shows, on the stage that night at Yoshi’s, Shocked absolutely <em>did</em> claim that very “vantage point” as her own.</p>
<p>After the above remarks, the audience chuckles and murmurs uncomfortably. Someone can be heard incredulously saying “What?” to which Shocked replies, laughing, ”You said you wanted reality.”</p>
<p>Then Shocked continues (5:40):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If someone would be so gracious as to please tweet out, ‘Michelle Shocked just said from stage, God hates faggots.’ Would you do it now? </strong>[emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Some members of the audience continue chuckling, while others are shocked. Another audience member shouts “Maybe some people’s gods…”</p>
<p><strong>Shocked went on:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>MS: Just adjusting my bra strap. Nothin’ worth gettin’ in a froth over.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>She then responds to a presumably stunned audience member:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>MS: You’re confounded. Matt [Penfield, who <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/398934/singer-michelle-shocked-goes-on-anti-gay-rant-during-san-francisco-show-cancellations-follow">live-tweeted</a> Shocked's show from the stage], you might need to come back up here.</p>
<p>Matt Penfield: There’s gonna be a loooooot of talking about that.</p>
<p>MS: I ain’t scared. I ain’t skeered. <strong>This is not a tribunal, this is one woman’s opinion. And… it’s fun. It’s a lot of fun. I am so committed to loving each and every soul in this room tonight that I could not come here and ignore you, I could not come here and pretend that I was above the conversation, and I couldn’t pretend that I was beneath it either. I had to join it.</strong> [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is when the audience seems to start really getting uncomfortable. Shocked thanks someone in the audience for giving her a “one-handed clap,” tells an awkward anecdote about being a “white girl sittin’ in a black church” and getting reprimanded for her method of clapping, and then strums a chord like she’s going to start another song. An audience member shouts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope you get wise, Michelle, and realize that there’s nothing to fear. There’s nothing to fear. Everybody is deserving of your — whoever your God is — his love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shocked asks the woman if she can respond “off the microphone,” to which the woman replies that she’d actually rather have Shocked respond <em>on</em> the microphone. Ms. Shocked’s tone abruptly changes — her voice rises markedly, and she literally hisses (7:42):</p>
<blockquote><p>MS: <strong>I am sick of Christians filled with hypocrisy, hiding behind the symbol of the cross.</strong></p>
<p>Audience member: Come on, show it. Show your true self. Come on!</p>
<p>Audience: I’m confused. Can you clarify? Say what you mean. Come on, Michelle. What are you so afraid of?</p>
<p>MS: <strong>I believe that the word of God is just what it says it is: the truth.</strong> [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s when the sound of rustling chairs and exiting patrons can be clearly heard (8:15). By this point, many in the crowd seem have come to the conclusion that Shocked is not trying to be funny, not trying to make a joke, but rather, expressing her sincerely-held anti-gay beliefs.</p>
<blockquote><p>MS (8:27): I’m just saying one thing, just one thing. Just one thing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And then she starts praying in Spanish. Seriously.</strong></p>
<p>She sings a song, but the much of the audience that remains at this point is clearly hostile. An audience member shouts at her as the song finishes, and Shocked responds:</p>
<blockquote><p>MS (16:07): Oh, don’t bother to applaud, it’s not needed. [applause] I don’t think I can handle all the adulation right now.</p>
<p>Audience Member: That’s because you don’t deserve any.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Everyone should get up and leave. That was rotten! That was a horrible thing to say, if that’s what you believe…</p>
<p>Audience Member: Somebody over there thinks she means something different. Maybe you’ve been confusing.</p>
<p>MS (16:31): I’ve got a question for y’all. It’s a sincere question: how are you enjoying reality so far?</p>
<p>Audience Member: It’s not your reality…</p>
<p>MS: Sucks pretty much, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Audience Member: It’s her reality, not ours…</p>
<p>MS (interrupting): You can’t have both.</p>
<p>Audience Member (continuing): Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.</p>
<p>MS: ‘Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.’ Let’s take that note. I just got a tweet, it said ‘Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.’ Where do I go to say that shit?</p>
<p>Audience Member: Uhhh, Arkansas.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Wow, that’s so weird. You’re so weird.</p>
<p>MS: Yeah, it is weird.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Your reality is tweets?</p>
<p>MS (interrupting): This is not my choice.</p>
<p>Audience Member (continuing): Your reality is tweets. According to this show, we spent like 20 percent of the show on tweets, 80 percent was a show, and 40 percent was homophobia.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Get her out of here!</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And then the Yoshi’s management intervenes (17:18):</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us tonight at Yoshi’s.</p>
<p>MS: You’re pullin’ the plug, you’re givin’ me the hook y’all.</p>
<p>Audience Members: Hell no! Go on! Sing!</p></blockquote>
<p>(Oh look, Michelle still has a few supporters left! How nice…)</p>
<p>At this point she starts to play again and advises the remaining audience members: “They’re gonna take away the microphone, you’re gonna wanna stay close.” The management starts closing down around Shocked, but she continues singing. At 18:45 a manager cuts in again and informs the audience that servers will be with them shortly to close out their tabs. Shocked sings angrily about seeing other people as the audience leaves, then says that since she figures she won’t be paid, she’s going to pass the hat and hope people drop $1 in. She then closes: “God bless us, everyone.”</p>
<p>I’m sorry, folks, but whatever you think of Shocked’s erratic and incoherent behavior, she wasn’t misunderstood, nor was she paraphrasing the bigoted beliefs of anti-gay Christians. She clearly and repeatedly stated that the anti-gay views she expressed were her own “reality,” and didn’t back down from them when audience members angrily challenged her, nearly all patrons left, and the venue shut the whole thing down.</p>
<p>Shocked isn’t the victim here. Her hateful remarks were understood loud and clear and she meant every disgusting word.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YQ8KJUOpckI/UQGYM8uFP7I/AAAAAAAAAYQ/ZviM2s-sSIM/s1600/ian-mckellen-patrick-stewart-back-for-xmen-days-of-future-past-001.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gay Geeks rejoice! Fans of Marvel&#8217;s X-Men series have always taken notice of the complex love/hate relationship of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto in both the original comics/animated series as well as the live action movies. But the actors Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart&#8217;s real life bromance is anything but complicated. The two have been friends for ages, even so much that McKellen is slated to officiate Stewart&#8217;s upcoming nuptials later this year! Here&#8217;s <a href="http://news.moviefone.ca/2013/03/19/patrick-stewart-wedding-ian-mckellen_n_2907719.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>This is going to be one handsome wedding. Lord Of The Rings and X-Men star Sir Ian McKellen will be officiating friend and fellow actor Sir Patrick Stewart&#8217;s upcoming wedding.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>McKellen made the announcement on the Jonathan Ross Show, a UK talk show.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;I’m going to marry Patrick,&#8221; he quipped on the show. Stewart, 71, will be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-features/9069971/Sir-Patrick-Stewart-Theres-still-so-much-I-want-to-do.html" target="_hplink">marrying jazz singer Sunny Ozzell</a>, 35, the two have been <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1179528/Patrick-Stewart-reprises-sugar-daddy-role-steps-new-flame-half-age.html" target="_hplink">romantically linked since 2009.</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>While McKellen and Stewart play mutant rivals Magneto and Professor Xavier in the X-men films, the two are actually close friends. According to McKellen&#8217;s Twitter account the duo will be appearing in a number of plays together this year as well as in the upcoming, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-x-men_n_2199572.html" target="_hplink">X-Men: Days Of Future Past.<br />
</a></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>McKellen also said it wasn&#8217;t the first time he&#8217;s married people. &#8220;I’ve done it once before with two guys having a civil partnership. I was crying my eyes out,&#8221; he said on the UK talk show. <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sir-ian-mckellen-officiate-at-429459" target="_hplink">The Hollywood Reporter</a> points out that in Massachusetts a friend or family member can officiate weddings for a one-time fee.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>And no, McKellen will not be wearing his Gandalf robes for the wedding. Sorry geeks.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It goes without saying that McKellen was likely referring to Stewart when he mentioned having supportive friends when he talked about coming out and being an actor last year. Stewart has always been a supporter for LGBT rights so I&#8217;m speculating that he would return the favor and officiate for McKellen if he ever so chooses. What a great friendship.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Liberty-Counsel-Musical.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23049" alt="Liberty Counsel Musical" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Liberty-Counsel-Musical.png" width="300" height="183" /></a></strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Seriously, I kid you not.</strong></em></p>
<p>Mat Staver and Matt Barber&#8217;s anti-gay Liberty Counsel which is  currently under investigation and dealing with a <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/sites/default/files/JenkinsMillerLawsuit.pdf">civil RICO lawsuit</a> [PDF] for the role they played in helping ex-gay Lisa Miller kidnap her daughter from her ex-lesbian partner and leave the country is working on a feature film to be released next year called <em>Uncommon</em>, starring Erik Estrada.  <em>Uncommon</em> will help spread propaganda and educate teens, parents, and school officials on religious liberty in the public schools and their right to be total teen douchebag bigots.</p>
<p><strong>REALLY I&#8217;M NOT KIDDING ABOUT THIS.</strong></p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/liberty-law-school-and-others-hit-rico-lawsuit-over-lisa-miller-kidnapping-case"><em>Uncommon</em> </a>website:</p>
<blockquote><p>The film will address the questions about religious liberty of students in public schools. Estrada, who is currently touring for his most recent, faith-based film, <em>Finding Faith</em>, stated his reason for getting involved: “For too long the confusion about prayer at graduation or a Christian-themed musical to be performed in a public school has left Christians uncertain and silent. It’s time we found our voice.”</p>
<p>Both a film and a musical, <em>Uncommon</em> will challenge teens to live dynamically by faith even during unjustified conflict. The film is about high school students who run into conflict with those who think public schools should be religion-free zones. The film will feature scenes with drama, music, and dance.</p></blockquote>
<p>And get this.  Theres an <a href="http://uncommonfilm.com/uncategorized/casting-call-march-22-23-2013/">OPEN AUDITION </a> on March 22-23, 2013 @ Liberty Christian Academy and  they are looking for &#8220;over the top talented teens and college-age boys and girls to sing and perform dance routines in the film. Huge personalities are a plus!&#8221;<em> (They&#8217;re talking about uber-Christian kids right?)</em></p>
<p>Anyway it all seems legit and completely <em>HYSTERICAL!</em></p>
<p><strong>Starring Erik Estrada&#8230;&#8230;. I&#8217;M DYING HERE!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Bwahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</strong></em></p>
