				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kentucky  Gov. Steve Beshear vetoed the controversial religious-freedom <a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2013/03/ky-house-votes-to-discriminate-lgbts.html">Kentucky Bill  279</a> Friday afternoon.  The Bill would allow religious individuals, organizations, and business owners with a <em>&#8220;sincerely held&#8221;</em> belief to openly defy state and local civil-rights laws, including those set in place in four Kentucky cities: Covington, Louisville, Lexington and Vicco that prohibit anti-gay discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have significant concerns that this bill will cause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care and individuals&#8217; civil rights,&#8221; Beshear said in a statement. &#8220;As written, the bill will undoubtedly lead to costly litigation.&#8221;</p>
<div>
<p>The sponsor of House Bill 279, Rep. Bob Damron, D-Nicholasville, <strong>(YES A DEMOCRAT)  </strong>said he thinks he&#8217;ll have the 51 votes required to override the veto if House leaders decide to take a vote. Damron said Beshear, a Democrat, did not ask him or Democratic House leaders to refrain from trying to override the bill during a conversation of more than an hour Friday in the governor&#8217;s Capitol office.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said, &#8220;The Senate is prepared to override the veto of HB 279 if and when the Speaker moves to do so. As a House bill, that chamber must act on the bill first.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be comforting for many Kentuckians to know that the ACLU is now calling the shots in the governor&#8217;s office,&#8221; said Martin Cothran, spokesman for The Family Foundation. &#8220;Religious people should not have to ask permission from the ACLU and gay rights groups to believe what they believe.&#8221;</div>
<div>Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and the Covington City Council had asked Beshear to veto the bill. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who is gay, came under fire from some advocacy groups for not publicly asking Beshear to veto it.</p>
<div>
<p>Gay rights groups applauded Beshear on Friday for vetoing the bill.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/starbucks-coffee-cup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23141" alt="starbucks-coffee-cup" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/starbucks-coffee-cup.jpg" width="243" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>Attention LGBT advocates and allies. When you want to make a clear, concise point to a bigot and homophobe about their stance on equality, take a lesson from the CEO of Starbucks and tell them where the door is and how fast they can leave. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/starbucks-gay-marriage-howard-schultz_n_2931734.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>At Starbucks&#8217; annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Wash., on Wednesday, CEO Howard Schultz told off an investor who tried to argue that the company&#8217;s support for gay marriage is bad for business.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://kplu.org/post/schultz-defends-starbucks-support-same-sex-marriage" target="_hplink">NPR affiliate KPLU captured audio of the heated exchange</a>:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;In the first full quarter after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings &#8212; shall we say politely &#8212; were a bit disappointing,&#8221; Starbucks shareholder Tom Strobhar said, referring to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/11/starbucks-gay-marriage-support-nom-condemns_n_2113930.html" target="_hplink">National Organization for Marriage&#8217;s boycott of the coffee company</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Schultz replied bluntly that Starbucks&#8217;s endorsement of marriage equality wasn&#8217;t about making money, but about the principle of diversity.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much,&#8221; Schultz said, to applause from the audience.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Last year, Starbucks <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/starbucks-same-sex-marriage-washington-_n_1231047.html" target="_hplink">endorsed a Washington state bill to legalize gay marriage</a>, and<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/politicsnorthwest/2017323520_starbucks_supports_gay_marriag.html" target="_hplink">released a statement</a> saying it was &#8220;deeply dedicated to embracing diversity.&#8221; The bill later became law.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Good or bad, money will always make someone guess their stance is it benefits their other interests. There really isn&#8217;t much for me to add to this so&#8230;bravo Schultz. Bravo.</p>

<p>After picking up the sonic screwdriver 4 years ago from David Tennant and making fezs cool again, Matt Smith will be leaving Dr. Who sometime around Christmas 2013 when the Doctor will regenerate for the unheard of 12th time.</p>
<p>With filming on the 50th anniversary episode, airing in November, beginning next  month sources say bosses already have an idea of who they want to replace him.</p>
<p>Matt refused to commit to a Doctor Who future beyond Christmas when  interviewed on Jonathan Ross’s show last week.</p>
<p>He said: “I am very happy doing it. I do the anniversary special, then the  Christmas special. At the moment it’s 2013 and we will see what 2014 holds.” An  insider said: “Matt has told bosses he wants to bow out at Christmas.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4854006/matt-smith-set-to-leave-doctor-who-at-christmas.html">Last night, the BBC said in a statement</a>: “Sorry folks but even we don’t know  what’s going to happen at Christmas. It’s not been written yet! But Matt  loves  the show and is to start filming the unmissable 50th anniversary, and  the new  series starting on Easter Saturday.</p>
<p>My choice for the 12th. Doctor.</p>
<p>I think its about time that the Doctor got his <em>(and my)</em> ginger regeneration wish:  Jason Fleming</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jason-Fleming-Ginger.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-23132" alt="Jason Fleming Ginger" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jason-Fleming-Ginger.png" width="402" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>Who&#8217;s your choice?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FIRE-Richard-Littlejohn.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23129" alt="FIRE Richard Littlejohn" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FIRE-Richard-Littlejohn.png" width="300" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>Lucy Meadows was a teacher. Lucy Meadows was an excellent and caring teacher.</p>
<p>Born male, Lucy transitioned to female later in life, a process that was supported by her employers and her friends.</p>
<p>But hack <em>&#8220;journalist&#8221;</em> Richard Littlejohn of Britain&#8217;s <em>Daily Mail</em>—one of Britain&#8217;s largest-circulation newspapers didn&#8217;t care.  All he cared about was circulation, sensationalism and spewing his hateful prejudice.  So Littlejohn publicly denounced Lucy in one of his columns in terms usually reserved for criminals, and child abusers.</p>
<p>Not long afterward,  LucyMeadows killed herself.</p>
<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> took the article down upon Meadows&#8217; death, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">here it is at archive.org</a>, and here&#8217;s an excerpt.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;What are you staring at, Johnny? Move along, nothing to see here. Get on with your spelling test. Today’s word is ‘transitioning’.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Upton/Miss Meadows may well be comfortable with his/her decision to seek a sex-change and return to work as if nothing has happened. The school might be extremely proud of its ‘commitment to equality and diversity’.</em></p>
<p><em>But has anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren’t equipped to compute this kind of information. &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>It should be protecting pupils from some of the more, er, challenging realities of adult life, not forcing them down their throats.</em></p>
<p><em>These are primary school children, for heaven’s sake. Most them still believe in Father Christmas. Let them enjoy their childhood. They will lose their innocence soon enough. &#8230; Nathan Upton is entitled to his gender reassignment surgery, but he isn’t entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/the-daily-mail-fire-richard-littlejohn-for-victimizing-lucy-meadows-leading-to-her-possible-suicide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">An online petition has been started demanding that Littlejohn be fired or resign.</a> SIGN IT.</p>
<p>The petition says: &#8220;No one deserves to have their lives turned upside down for their gender identity being thrown into the national spotlight.</p>
<p>Its time we band together and stop those like Littlejohn who think nothing of the consequences of their hateful words that ruin, destroy and in some cases kill.</p>
<p><strong>STAND UP FOR LUCY</strong>.</p>
<p>Richard Littlejohn is a greater threat to children by far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A West Virginia newspaper, <em>The Lincoln Journal </em>is <a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/west-virginia-papers-anti-lgbt-column-wants-" target="_self">coming under fire for publishing a homophobic and racist letter</a> after the Lincoln County Board of Education fired teacher Kelli Burns for being a lesbian.</p>
<p>Said the letter, which was transcribed from a voicemail the paper received:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We were really glad to hear that School Board is getting rid of them queers.

Thank you.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Burns who was fired after three separate hearings from the school board  late last week,<br />
alleged that students had been forced to write letters to the school board saying that she had &#8220;<em>tried to turn them gay.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="http://thecollegepolitico.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/megan-mccain.jpg" /></p>
<p>Over the past year we have seen a true evolution of beliefs in this country as it relates to equality and gay rights. If you remember after President Obama was reelected McCain expressed how the republican party needs to open their eyes about gay rights and in particular marriage equality. But that support has to be taxing when the vast majority vehemently opposes anything that has to do with equal rights for the LGBT community. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/meghan-mccain-gay-marriage_n_2915271.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Meghan McCain said that being a Republican who supports gay marriage is a &#8220;bitch&#8221; at an event sponsored by the <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/young-conservatives-for-the-freedom-to-marry" target="_hplink">Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry</a> on Monday, Raw Story <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/03/19/meghan-mccain-being-a-republican-who-supports-gay-marriage-is-a-btch/" target="_hplink">reported</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The MSNBC contributor and daughter of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is a longtime supporter of marriage equality. McCain <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/press/press-release/meghan-mccain-joins-leadership-of-young-conservatives-for-the-freedom-to-ma" target="_hplink">joined</a> Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry leadership in November 2012.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In May 2012, McCain <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/10/meghan-mccain-gay-marriage_n_1506353.html" target="_hplink">questioned</a> the sincerity of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/09/obama-gay-marriage_n_1503245.html" target="_hplink">President Barack Obama&#8217;s support for gay marriage.</a> In an op-ed for the Daily Beast, McCain claimed that <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/10/meghan-mccain-obama-plays-it-safe-with-gay-marriage-endorsement.html" target="_hplink">&#8220;talk was cheap during election season&#8221;</a> and true support would include backing legislation to legalize same-sex marriage.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Shortly after Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney lost to Obama, McCain said she would consider <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/16/meghan-mccain-gop-leave-party_n_2145833.html?utm_hp_ref=meghan-mccain" target="_hplink">switching parties</a> if the GOP failed to change some of its stances.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This makes one wonder if the reason that more members of the republican party are not vocal in their support for gay rights as a result of the backlash that would ensue afterword. We&#8217;ve seen how easily they&#8217;ve turned on Rob Portman after he publicly changed his stance on same sex marriage because he has a son who is gay.</p>
<p>Is that what it will take for more republicans to evolve on gay rights? Is the only way that they will see the error in their ways is if they have a family member that is LGBT? Maybe. But it would be nice if they supported our rights not only because they know someone effected by it personally but also because it&#8217;s the right, humane thing to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Osmond, best known for his years as one of the Osmond Family singers.<em> (The one with the mutton chops)</em> and his wife Suzanne<em> (along with various &#8220;other&#8221; Osmond Family members)</em> are taking time off from performing in Branson, MO to hold an anti-gay marriage hate rally in Salt Lake City, Utah at the State House called: <em>&#8220;A Celebration of Marriage &#8211; Every Child Deserves A Mom and Dad&#8221;</em> that will coincide with the Supreme Court cases over Prop 8 and DOMA and also the National Organization For Marriage&#8217;s hate march in Washington, DC:</p>
<p>Alan Osmond  currently serves on the high council of the Orem Suncrest Stake in Orem, Utah for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints recently penned an anti-gay article for the Mormon website<a href="http://www.thefamily.com/" target="_blank"><em><strong> The Family</strong></em>,</a> which is run by <em>“The Osmond Network LLC”</em> and is linked to by the<strong><a href="http://osmond.com/about-us/alan/" target="_blank"> “Official Osmond Family Website”</a></strong></p>
<p>In Osmond&#8217;s article<em><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2011/11/alan-osmond-osmond-family-pens-anti-gay-article-defending-gay-reparative-therapy-mormon-church.html"> (which you can read by clicking HERE) </a></em>he states that being gay<em> is not genetic</em> and <em>that reparative therapy does work. </em> He also goes on to quote LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley who has said in the past <em>“Prophets of God have repeatedly taught through the ages that practices of homosexual relations, fornication, and adultery are grievous sins. Sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage are forbidden by the Lord. We affirm those teachings.” </em></p>
<p>Theres been no word on whether Marie Osmond and her lesbian daughter will be attending.</p>

<p>The Canadian House of Commons <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/03/20/pol-transgender-rights-bill-approved.html" target="_blank">has approved</a> a bill that makes it illegal to discriminate against transgender persons.</p>
<p>The legislation, <a href="http://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-279/" target="_blank">C-279</a>, An act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code, was introduced as a private member&#8217;s bill by New Democratic Party Member of Parliament Randall Garrison and passed by a vote of 149-137. Typically, MPs are allowed to cast conscience votes on private member&#8217;s bills, which rarely become law.</p>
<p>All members of the opposition Liberal, New Democratic, Bloc Québécois and Green parties voted in favour or abstained, while 18 members of the governing Conservative Party supported the legislation, including four cabinet ministers. Prime Minister Stephen Harper cast his vote against C-279.</p>
<p>Echoing right-wing opposition to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21870064" target="_blank">similar legislative efforts</a> in Arizona, Canadian Conservatives had objected to the bill on the grounds that the safety of women and children would be compromised by allowing biological males to use women&#8217;s bathrooms, despite a recommendation by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to include transgender identity in anti-discrimination and anti-hate legislation.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>An AMC insider tells Confidenti@l that during filming of the sixth season of the hit show Mad Men — when the ’60s-style clothing was a tight fit — Hamm was politely instructed by a staffer at the network to please wear underwear while shooting his scenes.</em></p>
<p><em>“This season takes place in the 1960s, where the pants are very tight and leave little to the imagination,” a source tells us. “Jon’s impressive anatomy is so distracting that they politely insisted on underwear.”</em></p>
<p><em>“His privates are the inside joke. (Hamm) knows what he’s got. Imagine how distracting that would be on the side of a bus or building.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah.  I can imagine&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
