<p>Two construction workers talking on a NYC subway train at Penn Station:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guy #2:  No more kids for you two?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  No, she figures we’re both getting too old for a baby.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  How is your boy anyway?  Haven’t seen him in awhile.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Oh John’s good, pitching this year varsity.</strong><br />
Guy #2: He’ll definitely have the girls hanging around him now.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Yeah if he had any time for them.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Focused on baseball?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Focused on boys.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  You’re shittin me!<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  I kid you not.  Came out to me and Mary Ann bold as daylight last year.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Well I’ll be damned!  I’m not supposed to know it but I overheard Patrick Junior tell his sister he might be gay not two months ago.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  We all saw that coming though.</strong><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UK-man-gay-man-set-abaze.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23168" alt="UK man gay man set abaze" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/UK-man-gay-man-set-abaze.png" width="288" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>A British man has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter for burning to death an 18-year-old gay teenager in England.</p>
<p>18-year-old Steven Simpson, <em>(pictured above right)</em> was gay and suffered from Asperger’s syndrome, at his 18th birthday party, Simpson became drunk and had homophobic insults scrawled on his arm and stomach, told to strip to his boxers was then covered in tanning oil and Jordan Sheard <em>(pictured above left), </em> a 20-year-old at the party, held a cigarette lighter to the teen’s groin. The flammable liquid quickly caught on fire. But instead of helping Simpson, Jordan Sherard ran away.   Steven Simpson received burns to over 60 percent of his body he later passed away at the hospital from his injuries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/general-news/teen-dies-at-his-birthday-party-after-friend-covers-him-with-tanning-oil-and-sets-him-alight-1-5519548" target="_self">The <em>Yorkshire Post</em> reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Judge Roger Keen told him: “What it did was engulf him in a fire. You tried to briefly assist and then you ran away. That in my judgment is serious aggravation.”</em></p>
<p><em>The court heard the only person who went to Steven’s aid was neighbour Sean Banner who burned himself in the process. But when Mr Banner returned to the flat in Pleasant View, Cudworth, near Barnsley, he was initially arrested on suspicion of murder. Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said that earlier in the evening Sheard, who vaguely knew Steven, and two others joined the party and were let in despite having not been invited.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sheard’s lawyer Andrew Smith said his client’s actions were a “criminally stupid prank that went wrong in a bad way.” But prosecutor, Sarah Wright, said that actually what Sheard’s lawyer described as “good natured fun” was at the expense of a mentally vulnerable person and was “cruel behavior” toward someone who was an easy target.</p>
<p>Jordan Sherard was sentenced to only two and a half years in jail after pleading <em>guilty</em> to manslaughter.</p>
<p>Mind boggling. Only two and a half years.</p>
<p>How the hell can deliberately setting someone on fire and killing them get someone a two and a half-year sentence?</p>
<p>Two and a half lifetimes would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>It appears that earlier this week a New York University canceled a scheduled appearance by an adult film (aka porn star) Conner Habib because they felt that his appearance would be a detriment to the LGBT movement/rights. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/conner-habib-corning-college_n_2927280.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Corning Community College in upstate New York <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/shani/college-blocks-speech-by-gay-porn-star" target="_hplink">canceled a planned appearance by gay porn star Conner Habib</a> because of his involvement in the adult film industry.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>College president Katherine Douglas told members of Equal, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender student group, she was canceling Habib&#8217;s scheduled &#8220;Sex Week&#8221; talk. The cancellation was first reported by BuzzFeed. Douglas said she didn&#8217;t want gay rights to be linked to pornography, <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/03/corning_community_college_conner_habib_porn_star.html" target="_hplink">Habib told the Post-Standard</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Mr. Habib&#8217;s celebrity status as an adult film star is inconsistent with the educational theme of this program,” Bill Little, the college executive director of the office of institutional advancement,<a href="http://www.stargazette.com/article/20130321/NEWS01/303210046" target="_hplink"> told the Star Gazette</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The school said it <a href="http://binghamton.ynn.com/content/top_stories/649518/corning-cc-cancels-gay-porn-star-s-speech/" target="_hplink">would honor Habib&#8217;s contract</a> and pay for his travel expenses, YNN reported.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the promoters/organizers that invited Habib was allegedly pulled aside and told that the university could not have the porn star speak there. Habib wrote about the controversy specifically pointing out how we need to examine how we see porn and sex.</p>
<p>Okay so I need to rant here for a moment. First off, I think what the university did is wrong because it is teaching these students that people coming from a different perspective or disposition in life are unable to provide satiable, relevant contributions.  They make the vague excuse that a porn star would be able to talk about sex, the very thing that they are paid to do? Would you rather hear about sex from someone that can only provide textbook definitions or someone that has a plethora of experiences in trial and error?\</p>
<p>Because let&#8217;s be honest here, we all have watched pornography at some point. Aside from physicians, they know the anatomy of our bodies better than anyone else. And with that experience they can provide invaluable information on safety as well as technique. So why not have someone who takes their clothes off talk to these students?</p>
<p>We have got to stop this heteronormative mentality where we are so concerned about image rather than actual content. I&#8217;m sure Habib wasn&#8217;t going to show the group how to do various sex acts. This move by the university administration was about how it would look to the straight counterparts. The &#8220;oh no what will the straight people think? They&#8217;ll say we&#8217;re a bunch of deviants&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well let me tell you something, those that are close minded bigots were going to think that regardless, unfortunately.  Never mind the fact of how beneficial this could have been to students that have spent so much of their lives suppressing their sexual nature instead of embracing it and on a subconscious level this is what you are teaching them.</p>
<p>Think that I&#8217;m being extreme in my assessment of potential repercussions? As a community we need to  be less concerned with how it looks to the rest of society and making everyone in this community feel welcomed. From gay geek, to the model-esque gay to even the gay porn star. That&#8217;s how we learned that we were different, how we discovered we were LGBT. Through observations of others and listening to how our feelings. our behavior, was not the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>Eventually we learned  how our differences do not dictate moral character. Our life experiences can in fact enriches the lives of others through open communication.  It&#8217;s about thinking outside of the box. And not repeating the same, archaic way of thinking by some of our straight counterparts.  But this stifling who can talk about it teaches internalized homophobia.</p>
<p>We should be able to discuss a wide area of topics when we take examinations of our physical nature. Openly and without fear of suppression.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">March 23, 1874 &#8211; J. C. Leyendecker perhaps the most successful commercial artist of the 20th century was born in Montabour, Germany. He is best known for his poster, book and advertising illustrations, the trade character known as The Arrow Collar Man, and his numerous covers for The Saturday Evening Post.  Between 1896 and 1950, Leyendecker painted more than 400 magazine covers.  Leyendecker virtually invented the whole idea of modern magazine design.  His work on the Arrow Shirt Man, is still sexy today. When the ads first appeared in magazines carloads of letters from female fans would arrive daily. But, the model was not available. He was Leyendecker&#8217;s lover Charles Beach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kentucky  Gov. Steve Beshear vetoed the controversial religious-freedom <a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2013/03/ky-house-votes-to-discriminate-lgbts.html">Kentucky Bill  279</a> Friday afternoon.  The Bill would allow religious individuals, organizations, and business owners with a <em>&#8220;sincerely held&#8221;</em> belief to openly defy state and local civil-rights laws, including those set in place in four Kentucky cities: Covington, Louisville, Lexington and Vicco that prohibit anti-gay discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have significant concerns that this bill will cause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care and individuals&#8217; civil rights,&#8221; Beshear said in a statement. &#8220;As written, the bill will undoubtedly lead to costly litigation.&#8221;</p>
<div>
<p>The sponsor of House Bill 279, Rep. Bob Damron, D-Nicholasville, <strong>(YES A DEMOCRAT)  </strong>said he thinks he&#8217;ll have the 51 votes required to override the veto if House leaders decide to take a vote. Damron said Beshear, a Democrat, did not ask him or Democratic House leaders to refrain from trying to override the bill during a conversation of more than an hour Friday in the governor&#8217;s Capitol office.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said, &#8220;The Senate is prepared to override the veto of HB 279 if and when the Speaker moves to do so. As a House bill, that chamber must act on the bill first.&#8221;</p>
<div>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be comforting for many Kentuckians to know that the ACLU is now calling the shots in the governor&#8217;s office,&#8221; said Martin Cothran, spokesman for The Family Foundation. &#8220;Religious people should not have to ask permission from the ACLU and gay rights groups to believe what they believe.&#8221;</div>
<div>Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and the Covington City Council had asked Beshear to veto the bill. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray, who is gay, came under fire from some advocacy groups for not publicly asking Beshear to veto it.</p>
<div>
<p>Gay rights groups applauded Beshear on Friday for vetoing the bill.</p>

When you want to make a clear, concise point to a bigot and homophobe about their stance on equality, take a lesson from the CEO of Starbucks and tell them where the door is and how fast they can leave. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/starbucks-gay-marriage-howard-schultz_n_2931734.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>At Starbucks&#8217; annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Wash., on Wednesday, CEO Howard Schultz told off an investor who tried to argue that the company&#8217;s support for gay marriage is bad for business.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://kplu.org/post/schultz-defends-starbucks-support-same-sex-marriage" target="_hplink">NPR affiliate KPLU captured audio of the heated exchange</a>:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;In the first full quarter after this boycott was announced, our sales and our earnings &#8212; shall we say politely &#8212; were a bit disappointing,&#8221; Starbucks shareholder Tom Strobhar said, referring to the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/11/starbucks-gay-marriage-support-nom-condemns_n_2113930.html" target="_hplink">National Organization for Marriage&#8217;s boycott of the coffee company</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Schultz replied bluntly that Starbucks&#8217;s endorsement of marriage equality wasn&#8217;t about making money, but about the principle of diversity.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much,&#8221; Schultz said, to applause from the audience.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Last year, Starbucks <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/25/starbucks-same-sex-marriage-washington-_n_1231047.html" target="_hplink">endorsed a Washington state bill to legalize gay marriage</a>, and<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/politicsnorthwest/2017323520_starbucks_supports_gay_marriag.html" target="_hplink">released a statement</a> saying it was &#8220;deeply dedicated to embracing diversity.&#8221; The bill later became law.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Good or bad, money will always make someone guess their stance is it benefits their other interests. There really isn&#8217;t much for me to add to this so&#8230;bravo Schultz. Bravo.</p>

<p>After picking up the sonic screwdriver 4 years ago from David Tennant and making fezs cool again, Matt Smith will be leaving Dr. Who sometime around Christmas 2013 when the Doctor will regenerate for the unheard of 12th time.</p>
<p>With filming on the 50th anniversary episode, airing in November, beginning next  month sources say bosses already have an idea of who they want to replace him.</p>
<p>Matt refused to commit to a Doctor Who future beyond Christmas when  interviewed on Jonathan Ross’s show last week.</p>
<p>He said: “I am very happy doing it. I do the anniversary special, then the  Christmas special. At the moment it’s 2013 and we will see what 2014 holds.” An  insider said: “Matt has told bosses he wants to bow out at Christmas.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/4854006/matt-smith-set-to-leave-doctor-who-at-christmas.html">Last night, the BBC said in a statement</a>: “Sorry folks but even we don’t know  what’s going to happen at Christmas. It’s not been written yet! But Matt  loves  the show and is to start filming the unmissable 50th anniversary, and  the new  series starting on Easter Saturday.</p>
<p>My choice for the 12th. Doctor.</p>
<p>I think its about time that the Doctor got his <em>(and my)</em> ginger regeneration wish:  Jason Fleming</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jason-Fleming-Ginger.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-23132" alt="Jason Fleming Ginger" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Jason-Fleming-Ginger.png" width="402" height="254" /></a></p>
<p>Who&#8217;s your choice?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FIRE-Richard-Littlejohn.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23129" alt="FIRE Richard Littlejohn" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FIRE-Richard-Littlejohn.png" width="300" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>Lucy Meadows was a teacher. Lucy Meadows was an excellent and caring teacher.</p>
<p>Born male, Lucy transitioned to female later in life, a process that was supported by her employers and her friends.</p>
<p>But hack <em>&#8220;journalist&#8221;</em> Richard Littlejohn of Britain&#8217;s <em>Daily Mail</em>—one of Britain&#8217;s largest-circulation newspapers didn&#8217;t care.  All he cared about was circulation, sensationalism and spewing his hateful prejudice.  So Littlejohn publicly denounced Lucy in one of his columns in terms usually reserved for criminals, and child abusers.</p>
<p>Not long afterward,  LucyMeadows killed herself.</p>
<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> took the article down upon Meadows&#8217; death, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">here it is at archive.org</a>, and here&#8217;s an excerpt.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;What are you staring at, Johnny? Move along, nothing to see here. Get on with your spelling test. Today’s word is ‘transitioning’.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr Upton/Miss Meadows may well be comfortable with his/her decision to seek a sex-change and return to work as if nothing has happened. The school might be extremely proud of its ‘commitment to equality and diversity’.</em></p>
<p><em>But has anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren’t equipped to compute this kind of information. &#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>It should be protecting pupils from some of the more, er, challenging realities of adult life, not forcing them down their throats.</em></p>
<p><em>These are primary school children, for heaven’s sake. Most them still believe in Father Christmas. Let them enjoy their childhood. They will lose their innocence soon enough. &#8230; Nathan Upton is entitled to his gender reassignment surgery, but he isn’t entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/the-daily-mail-fire-richard-littlejohn-for-victimizing-lucy-meadows-leading-to-her-possible-suicide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">An online petition has been started demanding that Littlejohn be fired or resign.</a> SIGN IT.</p>
<p>The petition says: &#8220;No one deserves to have their lives turned upside down for their gender identity being thrown into the national spotlight.</p>
<p>Its time we band together and stop those like Littlejohn who think nothing of the consequences of their hateful words that ruin, destroy and in some cases kill.</p>
<p><strong>STAND UP FOR LUCY</strong>.</p>
<p>Richard Littlejohn is a greater threat to children by far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A West Virginia newspaper, <em>The Lincoln Journal </em>is <a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/west-virginia-papers-anti-lgbt-column-wants-" target="_self">coming under fire for publishing a homophobic and racist letter</a> after the Lincoln County Board of Education fired teacher Kelli Burns for being a lesbian.</p>
<p>Said the letter, which was transcribed from a voicemail the paper received:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We were really glad to hear that School Board is getting rid of them queers. The next thing is we need to get rid of all the niggers, the spics, the kikes and the wops&#8230;.You know even them Catholics, they are wrong as baby eaters&#8230;We need to clear them people out and have good, white, God fearing Christians and everybody else needs to be put to death for their abominations&#8230;.We&#8217;ll keep Lincoln County white and right. Thank you.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Burns who was fired after three separate hearings from the school board  late last week,<br />
alleged that students had been forced to write letters to the school board saying that she had &#8220;<em>tried to turn them gay.”</em></p>
