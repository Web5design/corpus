				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Toddlers-used-as-human-shields-in-France.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23201" alt="Toddlers used as human shields in France" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Toddlers-used-as-human-shields-in-France.png" width="295" height="186" /></a></p>
<p>News agencies from  France are reporting that yesterday&#8217;s NOM approved anti-gay hate march in Paris <a href="http://www.thelocal.fr/page/view/clashes-amid-last-ditch-anti-gay-marriage-protests#.UU9ZH5zkl_O" target="_blank">turned violent</a> when protesters attempted to march down the off-limits Champs Elysees, prompting riot police to respond with force and with tear gas.</p>
<p>Christine Boutin, leader of the French Christian Democratic Party, and one of National Organization for Marriage&#8217;s speakers at their forthcoming anti-gay hate march in Washington, DC was seen lying on the ground in the Champs-Elysees, after being tear-gassed by police during the demonstration, after clashing with the police herself.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>100 to 200 frustrated protestors had reportedly attempted to breach a police barricade blocking them from entering the Champs Elysees. In response, riot police forcibly pushed them back from the fences, as well as spraying them with tear gas. Jean-François Copé, leader of the centre-right opposition UMP party, who was present at the protest, called for President Hollande to be &#8220;held to account&#8221;, and expressed his &#8220;indignation&#8221; that tear gas had been deployed &#8220;against families present with their children.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://americablog.com/2013/03/violent-protest-paris-gay-marriage.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Americablog+%28AMERICAblog+News%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">John Aravosis</a>, from AmericaBlog is also reporting that anti-gay protestors also attempted to use their children as &#8220;human shields&#8221; against police.</p>
<p><em>“On met les enfants devant, on met les enfants devant.”</em> TRANSLATION:  “Put the kids in front, put the kids in front,” a father yells to other  protesters, as he approached the police line with his three-year old  child perilously perched on his shoulders right after the police used  tear gas and batons, telling the protesters to back up.</p>
<p><strong>DISGUSTING.</strong></p>
<p>So much for the anti-gay <em>&#8220;it&#8217;s all for the best interest of children&#8221;</em> lie.</p>
<p><em><strong>Les talibans francais.</strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Jim Parsons, known for his uber nerd persona Sheldon Cooper on T<em>he Big Bang Theory</em> took to the stage to work the wildly sucessful cult classic Rocky Horror Picture Show. Showing off some leg and a lot of attitude Parsons seems to completely transform in front of thee audience. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/jim-parsons-in-drag-_n_2933487.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices#slide=2252777">more</a>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>March 24, 1987 -</strong> <em>ACT UP</em> stages its first major demonstration. Seventeen protestors<br />
are arrested.</p>
<p>Outraged by the government&#8217;s mismanagement of the AIDS crisis, LGBT and straight concerned individuals unite to form the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.</p>
<p>ACT UP&#8217;s first demonstration takes place three weeks later on March 24th 1987 on Wall Street, the financial center, to protest the profiteering of pharmaceutical companies (especially Burroughs Wellcome, manufacturer of AZT). Over 250 people participated in the protest.</p>
<p>ACT UP&#8217;s flyer for the event listed its demands:</p>
<h2 align="center">NO MORE BUSINESS AS USUAL!</h2>
<h2 align="center">Come to Wall Street in front of Trinity Church at 7AM Tuesday March 24 for a</h2>
<h1 align="center"><span style="font-size: large;">MASSIVE AIDS DEMONSTRATION</span></h1>
<h2 align="center"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">To demand the following</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">1. Immediate release by the Federal Food &amp; Drug Administration of drugs that might help save our lives.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">These drugs include: Ribavirin (ICN Pharmaceuticals); Ampligen (HMR Research Co.); Glucan (Tulane University School of Medicine); DTC (Merieux); DDC (Hoffman-LaRoche); AS 101 (National Patent Development Corp.); MTP-PE (Ciba-Geigy); AL 721 (Praxis Pharmaceuticals).</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">2. Immediate abolishment of cruel double-blind studies wherein some get the new drugs and some don&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">3. Immediate release of these drugs to everyone with AIDS or ARC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">4. Immediate availability of these drugs at affordable prices. Curb your greed!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">5. Immediate massive public education to stop the spread of AIDS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">6. Immediate policy to prohibit discrimination in AIDS treatment, insurance, employment, housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">7. Immediate establishment of a coordinated, comprehensive, and compassionate national policy on AIDS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-small;">President Reagan, nobody is in charge!</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span style="font-size: small;">AIDS IS THE BIGGEST KILLER IN NEW YORK CITY<br />
OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN</span></h3>
<p>The first few minutes of the clip below from Fight Back Fight AIDS: 15 Years of ACT UP is some of the only remaining footage of the protest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a new leaked look at Brad Pitt and Paramount Pictures World War Z with the second trailer which was supposed to be released tomorrow.</p>
<p>For those of you who have read Max Brook&#8217;s awesome book of the same title you&#8217;ll see little resemblance between it and the movie other than the title and the main characters name.  Which is a pity.  But it does seem to be a serviceable action packed zombie apocalypse flick never the less.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tony-Perkins-FRC-KKK5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23176" alt="Tony Perkins FRC KKK" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Tony-Perkins-FRC-KKK5.png" width="300" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>Freedom to Marry&#8217;s Evan Wolfson, Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, Family Research Council&#8217;s Tony Perkins, <em>Daily Beast</em> journalist David Frum, and Alliance Defending Freedom&#8217;s Austin Nimocks participated in a roundtable this morning <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/face-the-nation/" target="_self">on <em>Face the Nation</em></a> to discuss the upcoming arguments at the Supreme Court and the rising support for marriage equality in the nation</p>
<p><strong>Said Wolfson to Perkins:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Marriage is not defined by who is denied it. When gay people share in the freedom to marry, it doesn&#8217;t change your marriage, it doesn&#8217;t change Tony Perkins&#8217; marriage. My marriage is my marriage. And it means that I&#8217;m able to share in the same aspirations of commitment and love and support and dedication and connectedness, and that my parents are able to dance at our wedding. And our familiy and friends are able to support and celebrate and hold us accountable for the commitment we&#8217;ve made to one another. That takes nothing away from anyone else&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;The gay people are not going to use up all the marriage licenses when we enter marriage. And this is not just somebody saying it. We now have nine states including the District of Columbia, fourteen countries on four continents in which gay people share in the freedom to marry and the result is families are helped and no one is hurt.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting segment, even though Bob Schieffer is obviously cluessless on the subject of same sex marriage.</p>
<p>But the question remains WHY does CBS invite Tony Perkins the leader of an <em><strong>officially identified hate group</strong> </em>on Face the Nation and give him  credibility on broadcast television.</p>
<p><em>Face the Nation </em>and<em> CBS </em>should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p>Two construction workers talking on a NYC subway train at Penn Station:</p>
<blockquote><p>Guy #2:  No more kids for you two?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  No, she figures we’re both getting too old for a baby.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  How is your boy anyway?  Haven’t seen him in awhile.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Oh John’s good, pitching this year varsity.</strong><br />
Guy #2: He’ll definitely have the girls hanging around him now.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Yeah if he had any time for them.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Focused on baseball?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Focused on boys.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  You’re shittin me!<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  I kid you not.  Came out to me and Mary Ann bold as daylight last year.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Well I’ll be damned!  I’m not supposed to know it but I overheard Patrick Junior tell his sister he might be gay not two months ago.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  We all saw that coming though.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  You’re the second person to say that.  How’d everybody see it but me?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  It was just a feelin Pat.  He was always a little soft, ya know?</strong><br />
Guy #2:  I guess you’re right.  But damn Charlie, we both have gay kids.  What do we do now?  Both our sons are gay.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  We don’t do anything.  We let em be gay and if some kid calls em a faggot we go to their house and raise hell with the parents like normal.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Well I guess John and Lucinda won’t be getting together like we thought awhile ago.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Guess not.</strong><br />
<em>**long pause**</em><br />
Guy #2:  Hey Charlie, you thinkin what I’m thinkin?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  I was for about half a second then it got weird and I started thinkin about somethin else instead.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>A British man has been sentenced to two and a half years in jail after pleading guilty to manslaughter for burning to death an 18-year-old gay teenager in England.</p>
<p>18-year-old Steven Simpson, <em>(pictured above right)</em> was gay and suffered from Asperger’s syndrome, at his 18th birthday party, Simpson became drunk and had homophobic insults scrawled on his arm and stomach, told to strip to his boxers was then covered in tanning oil and Jordan Sheard <em>(pictured above left), </em> a 20-year-old at the party, held a cigarette lighter to the teen’s groin. The flammable liquid quickly caught on fire. But instead of helping Simpson, Jordan Sherard ran away.   Steven Simpson received burns to over 60 percent of his body he later passed away at the hospital from his injuries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/at-a-glance/general-news/teen-dies-at-his-birthday-party-after-friend-covers-him-with-tanning-oil-and-sets-him-alight-1-5519548" target="_self">The <em>Yorkshire Post</em> reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Judge Roger Keen told him: “What it did was engulf him in a fire. You tried to briefly assist and then you ran away. That in my judgment is serious aggravation.”</em></p>
<p><em>The court heard the only person who went to Steven’s aid was neighbour Sean Banner who burned himself in the process. But when Mr Banner returned to the flat in Pleasant View, Cudworth, near Barnsley, he was initially arrested on suspicion of murder. Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said that earlier in the evening Sheard, who vaguely knew Steven, and two others joined the party and were let in despite having not been invited.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sheard’s lawyer Andrew Smith said his client’s actions were a “criminally stupid prank that went wrong in a bad way.” But prosecutor, Sarah Wright, said that actually what Sheard’s lawyer described as “good natured fun” was at the expense of a mentally vulnerable person and was “cruel behavior” toward someone who was an easy target.</p>
<p>Jordan Sherard was sentenced to only two and a half years in jail after pleading <em>guilty</em> to manslaughter.</p>
<p>Mind boggling. Only two and a half years.</p>
<p>How the hell can deliberately setting someone on fire and killing them get someone a two and a half-year sentence?</p>
<p>Two and a half lifetimes would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>It appears that earlier this week a New York University canceled a scheduled appearance by an adult film (aka porn star) Conner Habib because they felt that his appearance would be a detriment to the LGBT movement/rights. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/conner-habib-corning-college_n_2927280.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices&amp;ir=Gay%20Voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>Corning Community College in upstate New York <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/shani/college-blocks-speech-by-gay-porn-star" target="_hplink">canceled a planned appearance by gay porn star Conner Habib</a> because of his involvement in the adult film industry.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>College president Katherine Douglas told members of Equal, a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender student group, she was canceling Habib&#8217;s scheduled &#8220;Sex Week&#8221; talk. The cancellation was first reported by BuzzFeed. Douglas said she didn&#8217;t want gay rights to be linked to pornography, <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/03/corning_community_college_conner_habib_porn_star.html" target="_hplink">Habib told the Post-Standard</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>“Mr. Habib&#8217;s celebrity status as an adult film star is inconsistent with the educational theme of this program,” Bill Little, the college executive director of the office of institutional advancement,<a href="http://www.stargazette.com/article/20130321/NEWS01/303210046" target="_hplink"> told the Star Gazette</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The school said it <a href="http://binghamton.ynn.com/content/top_stories/649518/corning-cc-cancels-gay-porn-star-s-speech/" target="_hplink">would honor Habib&#8217;s contract</a> and pay for his travel expenses, YNN reported.</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the promoters/organizers that invited Habib was allegedly pulled aside and told that the university could not have the porn star speak there. Habib wrote about the controversy specifically pointing out how we need to examine how we see porn and sex.</p>
<p>Okay so I need to rant here for a moment. First off, I think what the university did is wrong because it is teaching these students that people coming from a different perspective or disposition in life are unable to provide satiable, relevant contributions.  They make the vague excuse that a porn star would be able to talk about sex, the very thing that they are paid to do? Would you rather hear about sex from someone that can only provide textbook definitions or someone that has a plethora of experiences in trial and error?\</p>
<p>Because let&#8217;s be honest here, we all have watched pornography at some point. Aside from physicians, they know the anatomy of our bodies better than anyone else. And with that experience they can provide invaluable information on safety as well as technique. So why not have someone who takes their clothes off talk to these students?</p>
<p>We have got to stop this heteronormative mentality where we are so concerned about image rather than actual content. I&#8217;m sure Habib wasn&#8217;t going to show the group how to do various sex acts. This move by the university administration was about how it would look to the straight counterparts. The &#8220;oh no what will the straight people think? They&#8217;ll say we&#8217;re a bunch of deviants&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well let me tell you something, those that are close minded bigots were going to think that regardless, unfortunately.  Never mind the fact of how beneficial this could have been to students that have spent so much of their lives suppressing their sexual nature instead of embracing it and on a subconscious level this is what you are teaching them.</p>
<p>Think that I&#8217;m being extreme in my assessment of potential repercussions? As a community we need to  be less concerned with how it looks to the rest of society and making everyone in this community feel welcomed. From gay geek, to the model-esque gay to even the gay porn star. That&#8217;s how we learned that we were different, how we discovered we were LGBT. Through observations of others and listening to how our feelings. our behavior, was not the same as everyone else.</p>
<p>Eventually we learned  how our differences do not dictate moral character. Our life experiences can in fact enriches the lives of others through open communication.  It&#8217;s about thinking outside of the box. And not repeating the same, archaic way of thinking by some of our straight counterparts.  But this stifling who can talk about it teaches internalized homophobia.</p>
<p>We should be able to discuss a wide area of topics when we take examinations of our physical nature. Openly and without fear of suppression.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">March 23, 1874 &#8211; J. C. Leyendecker perhaps the most successful commercial artist of the 20th century was born in Montabour, Germany. He is best known for his poster, book and advertising illustrations, the trade character known as The Arrow Collar Man, and his numerous covers for The Saturday Evening Post.  Between 1896 and 1950, Leyendecker painted more than 400 magazine covers.  Leyendecker virtually invented the whole idea of modern magazine design.  His work on the Arrow Shirt Man, is still sexy today. When the ads first appeared in magazines carloads of letters from female fans would arrive daily. But, the model was not available. He was Leyendecker&#8217;s lover Charles Beach.</p>
