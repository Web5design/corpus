				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>Two dangerous GOP bills<strong> </strong>racing through the Florida legislature would overturn several of Florida’s strongest local LGBT rights policies and would block future policies statewide.   The bills SB 726 which would eliminate requirements on what kind of benefits businesses must offer their employees prohibits local governments from requiring companies that they do business with to have <strong>family leave for domestic partners and would invalidate policies that already exist</strong>.  HB 655 would eliminate equal benefits ordinances (EBO) in the state as well as blocking the pending paid sick time referendum for all workers in that state</p>
<p>Proponents of the so-called pre-emption bills, which includes the Florida Chamber of Commerce, argue that local wage and benefit measures would create a regulatory patchwork unfriendly to business and cost jobs.</p>
<p>And as reported by the <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/breakingnews/os-local-control-protest-20130416,0,653154.story">Orlando Sentinel </a>and gay advocate and Bilerico journalist Michael Emanuel Rajner <strong><em>sponsors of the bill have admitted that Walt Disney World and Darden Restaurants, owner of the</em> <a id="PLENT000226" title="Red Lobster" href="/topic/economy-business-finance/tourism-leisure-industry/restaurant-catering-industry/red-lobster-PLENT000226.topic">Red Lobster</a> and <a id="PLENT000212" title="Olive Garden" href="/topic/economy-business-finance/tourism-leisure-industry/restaurant-catering-industry/olive-garden-PLENT000212.topic">Olive Garden</a> chains, helped draft the legislation</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2012/11/papa-johns-refuses-health-insurance.html">This is not the first time that Red Lobster has been caught </a>in attempting anti-worker practices.  Red Lobster was also exposed with Papa John&#8217;s of planning to cut workers hours to get around paying for Obama’s healthcare plan.</p>
<p>And s for Disney.  It looks like its days, aren&#8217;t going to be so gay after this news gets out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/17300000/Jonathan-Knight-jonathan-knight-17351392-407-357.jpg" width="285" height="250" /></p>
<p>If you grew up in the 90s as I did, then there&#8217;s no way you could not have heard about the music group New Kids On The Block. And even to this day, mention of the band drives the most mild mannered of housewives to a state of nostalgia and questionable dance moves. As the group evolved and the band members grew up, they were able to have the room to be who they really are and this is especially true for bandmember Jonathan Knight who came out years later.</p>
<p>But it was not of his own will, unfortunately as others decided to voice their own opinions on his sexuality. First by his old girlfriend and teen icon Tiffany. Then by the infamous blogger Perez Hilton that is known for his trolling ways. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/jonathan-knight-nkotb-gay_n_3084799.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>“Perez tried to out me many times and I hate that guy for doing that,&#8221; Knight noted. &#8220;I was already gay and living a gay lifestyle but he wanted me to talk about it. Why? My brother and the rest of the guys don’t go on interviews saying ‘I’m straight&#8217; etc. so why do I need to just because I’m gay?&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>He concluded, &#8220;People like him want me to talk about it to make themselves feel better. They think ‘I’m gay so I want to make sure everybody knows I’m not the only one out there.’ I hate that.”</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In 2011, Knight broke his silence following the Tiffany gaffe on the official NKOTB blog,<a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2011/01/jonathan-knight.html" target="_hplink"> according to Towleroad</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>He wrote:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;My belief is that you live your life by example, and not by a caption on a magazine! If there ever has been any confusion about my sexuality, then you are someone that doesn’t even know me!</em></strong><strong><em>I love living my life being open and honest, but at this time I choose not to discuss my private life any further! My fellow band members don’t discuss their private lives with their loved ones and I don’t feel that just because I am gay, I should have to discuss mine!”</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It does not matter whether Knight was living authentically as a gay man and just not speaking about it publicly or completely in the closet the journey of coming out should never be in the hands of anyone else. It&#8217;s disturbing and flat out wrong for Perez or anyone else have a hand in how someone else comes out because it isn&#8217;t anyone else&#8217;s business but yours. No one owes anyone to share that part of their lives if they are not ready to do so. All forms of the media should know that. It&#8217;s all about decency.</p>
<p>I do applaud Knight in embracing the media coverage that came of all this a few years ago and still doing so today. And hope those so called journalist bloggers like Perez learn some decency and stop trying to out people.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryan-Brown-evil1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23852" alt="Bryan Brown evil" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bryan-Brown-evil1.png" width="298" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy Hooper of <em>As Good As You</em> has exposed The National Organization for Marriage&#8217;s (NOM)  launch of an international organization to promote anti-gay hate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hrc.org/nomexposed/entry/nom-launching-an-international-organization-for-marriage-france-connections#.UWwIjCsk6zd" target="_self">Writes Hooper:</a></p>
<p>We know NOM has moved forward with all of the other plans in those strategy documents (including the &#8220;drive a wedge&#8221; one); this is just a continuation of the international plan, with France being the first chess move in a larger, planetary onslaught on behalf of inequality. Because it&#8217;s NOM&#8217;s Earth, apparently—we just get discriminated within it.</p>
<p>This should come as a surprise to no one.  With support and money dwindling for NOM and Brian Brown&#8217;s million dollar paycheck, Brown took a  <a href="http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2013/01/video-brian-brown-thanks-nom-supporters-for-buying-him-a-french-vacation.html" target="_hplink">recent trip to Paris</a>, where he enthusiastically reported on the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/13/world/europe/france-marriage-rights-protest/" target="_hplink">French anti-gay marriage demonstrations</a>.</p>
<p>Hooper goes on to note that internal NOM documents <a href="http://www.hrc.org/nomexposed/entry/must-read#.UWwXENca87s">released</a> last year confirm that NOM has been planning the creation of International Organization for Marriage since at least 2008-09.</p>
<p>And while French &#8216;traditional marriage&#8217; opponents are amping up the violent rhetoric, <a href="http://www.thelocal.fr/page/view/hollande-wants-blood-and-he-will-get-it#.UWwKFb8gqZh" target="_self">promising blood will be spilled over equality</a> and gay bashing is on the rise.  Brian Brown<del>shirt</del> and NOM remain silent on the violence.</p>

<p>The above photograph, taken immediately after the first explosion in yesterday&#8217;s horrifying Boston Marathon bombings, has emerged as one of the iconic images of the day. And like all iconic images, it contains a number of compelling stories.</p>
<p>The <em>Dallas Voice</em> has <a href="http://www.dallasvoice.com/gay-police-officer-appears-iconic-photo-boston-marathon-bombing-10144907.html">uncovered</a> one such story, about the police officer on the far right. His name is Javier Pagan, and he&#8217;s the Boston Police Department&#8217;s liaison to the LGBT community. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bostonpride">Boston Pride</a>, which lists Pagan as a &#8220;good friend,&#8221; says that he happened to be standing right behind the flags where the first bomb went off.</p>
<p>According to photographer John Tlumacki, this picture was taken &#8220;probably one second after the explosion.&#8221; He <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2013/04/15/tragedy-in-boston-one-photographers-eyewitness-account/?iid=lf|around#1">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The runner] was blown over by the blast and fell on the ground. The cops are just reacting as cops. They didn’t know what was going on. They’re pulling their guns out, looking left and right. They were pretty close to where the explosion went off and could have been killed or injured also.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pandemonium reigned in that split second, but Tlumacki reports that the police almost immediately switched into crisis mode, clearing the area and trying to maintain some semblance of order amidst the chaos. (His account is incredibly compelling and worth <a href="http://lightbox.time.com/2013/04/15/tragedy-in-boston-one-photographers-eyewitness-account/?iid=lf|around#1">reading</a> in its entirety.)</p>
<p>In addition to being one of the heroes of the Boston Marathon bombings, Pagan is a <a href="http://www.baywindows.com/one-of-the-last-to-accept-66264">hero</a> to the LGBT community: his position makes him the most highly visible LGBT member of the Boston Police force, he&#8217;s a member of the Gay Officer&#8217;s Action League, and he had the honor of escorting LGBT civil rights attorney Mary Bonauto to a celebration at City Hall plaza on the day same-sex marriages became legal in Massachusetts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/04/16/for-gay-cop-at-boston-bombings-heroism-is-in-the-family/javier_pagan_pedro/" rel="attachment wp-att-3828"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3828" alt="javier_pagan_pedro" src="http://www.johnmbecker.com/content/uploads/2013/04/javier_pagan_pedro.png" width="276" height="206" /></a>And Pagan isn&#8217;t the only hero in his family &#8212; Pedro, his <a href="http://crossfitsouthie.com/member-of-the-month-javier-pagan">husband</a> of four years (pictured at left with Pagan), is a retired sergeant from the New York Police Department who served on 9/11 and helped rescue people from the rubble after the Twin Towers collapsed.</p>
<p>Javier and Pedro are amazing examples of bravery and heroism &#8212; not just for the LGBT community, but for all people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Royal-Oak.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-23828" alt="Royal Oak" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Royal-Oak-300x204.jpg" width="300" height="204" /></a>Recently in the city of Royal Oak, MI, the city passed a human rights ordinance that made it illegal for all business within the city to discriminate against LGBT people.</p>
<p>The new law was to go into effect March, 2013, but a few business owners and some citizens of Royal Oak decided to start a petition to block the law from going into effect.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=59418" target="_blank">Pride Source/Between The Line</a> (a Metro Detroit LGBT publication), it appears that enough petition signatures were turned in at Royal Oak City Hall on April 2, to prevent the new ordinance to go into effect. This petition may force the ordinance to go before the voters in November of this year.</p>
<p>One Royal Oak resident, Fred Birchard, 75, who campaigned against a similar ordinance in 2001, told the <a href="http://www.freep.com/" target="_blank">Detroit Free Press </a> that he turned in 1,200 signatures, almost twice the minimum 746 needed to block the enactment of the ordinance.</p>
<p>If enough of the signatures are validated by the Royal City Clerk, then the city commissioners will take up the ordinance at their April 15 meeting. At that meeting, they will decide whether to drop the ordinance altogether  or vote to place it on the November ballot.</p>
<p>Local residents, such as openly gay city commissioner Jim Rasor and local business owners are not happy that the ordinance has been blocked.</p>
<p>Jim Rasor stated that if the signatures are validated, he has a high level of confidence that the commission will vote to put the ordinance on the ballot in November.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have a democratic process and if that [a] number of voters thinks it should be put to a vote in November, then so be it,&#8221; said Rasor. &#8220;In listening to Mr. Birchard, he thinks God talks to him directly and that what he thinks God says to him trumps civil Law.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rasor is also a well know attorney in Royal Oak and is often attained in LGBT discrimination cases because Federal, State and Local laws do not recognize basic rights of LGBT people (perfect example of the importance of ENDA).</p>
<p>Raso states -</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If someone&#8217;s boss walks into their office and fires them because the boss just found out they are gay, then I have no recourse under current Federal and State law.&#8221; He goes on to say, &#8220;that just feels un-American to me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many residents and business owners have their own opinion regarding the blockage of the ordinance -</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not pleased it was thwarted,&#8221; said Keith Howarth, owner of Noir Leather in Royal Oak. &#8220;I feel it&#8217;s a small minority of the older Royal Oak population and not representative at all of the new Royal Oak population. I think it is ignorant of the people who are thwarting it. It&#8217;s 2013 and we need to understand that there is diversity among us and everyone is welcome in Royal Oak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My partner and I were proud as citizens of Royal Oak that the city commissioners had made a wise and just decision,&#8221; said Kate Wade who has lived in Royal Oak with her partner, Eileen Brandeis, for over 25 years. &#8220;We question why when a governing body has made a decision in favor of equality for a minority group it can be challenged by an individual and put to a majority vote.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Royal Oak would have been the 22nd city in Michigan to enact a non-discrimination ordinance. The neighboring city of Ferndale, which has hosted Detroit&#8217;s <a href="http://motorcitypride.org/" target="_blank">Motor City Pride</a> for years until  it was recently moved to Downtown Detroit, passed an ordinance several years ago and Pleasant Ridge, another neighboring city, discussed a similar ordinance at their city council meeting April 9.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed that residents went the petition route,&#8221; said Dave Coulter, mayor of Ferndale who specifically addressed a frequent objection to non-discrimination ordinances that enactment uses valuable policing resources. &#8220;I spoke before the Royal Oak Commission (when they were considering the ordinance) and shared our experience in Ferndale. There have been very few incidents that involved the police. In fact quite the opposite. Passing the ordinance is one of the reasons that Ferndale has been as successful as we have been because it says to everyone that we are diverse and welcome everyone.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If the ordinance goes to popular vote in November, it will be up to the business owners and residents to educate the residents of Royal Oak on the importance of a law of this nature.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The challenge to the ordinance represents a small number of voters in Royal Oak. Royal Oak overwhelmingly supports fairness and equality, as the commission did and voters will in November,&#8221; said Jon Hoadley, director of Unity Michigan Coalition, a group that represents six of the largest LGBT organizations in Michigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak too much (about anti-LGBT sentiments) because <a href="http://www.five15.net/" target="_blank">Five 15</a> does so well with our alternative show,&#8221; said Gary Baglio, owner of Five 15 Store in downtown Royal Oak. &#8220;Our Drag Queen Bingo is so wildly popular that I hope it will help educate people as to why it&#8217;s so important to support this ordinance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally speaking as someone who lives local to Royal Oak and Ferndale, both cities have always been incredibly diverse and extremely accepting of LGBT people. <a href="http://five15.net/" target="_blank">Five 15 bookstore</a> is an amazing LGBT bookstore located in the heart of Royal Oak and is incredibly popular with customers of all kinds. The city of Ferndale has always done what ever they could to help support the fight for LGBT equality. I have every faith that not only will this ordinance get voted to go to a popular vote in November, but the residents of Royal Oak will all stand up and tell their city that they ARE in favor of a non-discrimination act.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eyewitnesses report &#8220;unspeakable horror&#8221; after two explosions went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon  at Copley Square on Monday in what could be the first major case of domestic or foreign terrorism since 9/11.</p>
<p>So far 2 people are reported dead and over 23 injured, at least 6 critically  <a href="https://twitter.com/Boston_Police">according to the Boston Police Department</a>.  Marathon organizers said that bombs caused the two explosions and Boston Police have confirmed the discovery of two more unexploded bombs in the area.</p>
<p>Daniel Lampariello, a college student who was at the finish line, told CBSNews.com that people were trampling each other after the pair of explosions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded like a large firework or M-80,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Competitors and race organizers were crying as they fled the chaos. Bloody spectators were being carried to the medical tent that had been set up to care for fatigued runners.</p>
<p>There were two &#8220;incredibly powerful explosions just seconds apart,&#8221; according to WBZ-TV&#8217;s Lis Hughes.</p>
<p>Law-enforcement sources said at least the first explosion occurred in the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel in Copley Square.</p>
<p>President Obama has been notified of the explosions and he has directed his administration to provide whatever assistance is necessary in the investigation and response.</p>
<p>Law-enforcement sources said at least the first explosion occurred in the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel in Copley Square.</p>
<p>Authorities have a suspect, who is currently being guarded in a Boston hospital with shrapnel wounds and are scouring surveillance video tape from the area looking for more suspects.</p>
<p>The Marathon this year was dedicated to the memory of those lost in the Newtown Massacre.  Relatives of the victims were among those attending the race finish at a VIP area. It was not known of any of the relatives were among the casualties.</p>
<p>Simply horrible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Louis-CK.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23813" alt="Louis CK" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Louis-CK.png" width="300" height="171" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Louis C.K.</strong>‘s new comedy special, <em>Oh My God</em>, premiered on HBO Saturday night with one joke totally backfiring as C.K using a stereo typical gay effete voice implied that pedophiles are gay .</p>
<p>C.K.’s <em>&#8220;humor&#8221;</em> turned to the offensive when describing his New York City apartment building, C.K. reflected on the fountain in the courtyard that features “marble boys pissing”:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain-sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain-made without — ‘Can you make me a fountain?’ [Response in stereotypical gay male's, sexually aroused voice:] ‘Yes, I’ll get started right away! Aaaaggh… AAGGGH, yes!!! YES!!! It’s fi-nished!’ And [the commissioned fountain] is just little boys pissing on the face of a Greek god that looks like him a lot? [again in stereotypical gay male's, sexually aroused voice, while mimicking standing under the fountain's boy]: ‘Ahhh, piss on me forever!!!’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse C.K. used the  stereotypical gay male’s voice to the joke preceding this one in which he spilled some water on his shirt while taking a quick swig, mincingly saying: “<em>Oh sh*t. G*d damn it! Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice by the way. It’s NOT! Shut UP!” </em>But it was.</p>
<p>Look. Some things aren&#8217;t funny and just plain wrong and the fact that fact that C.K. himself has advocated for gay marriage, and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/12/louis-c-k-says-gay-community-lost-opportunity-to-address-tracy-morgans-homophobic-comments-in-a-positive-way/" target="_blank">spoken</a> of the need to address homophobia, makes his remarks all the more disturbing.</p>
<p>But to C.K. obviously addressing homophobia stops when making crass unfunny jokes on the stage.  In 2011 when comedian <strong>Tracy Morgan</strong> joked that he would stab his son if he were gay, Louis C.K. was the first to  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/15/louis-ck-defends-tracy-morgan-twitter_n_877373.html#s292385&amp;title=Louis_CK" target="_blank">came to Morgan’s defense</a></p>
<p>These types of jokes are unacceptable and used to to get a laugh from uneducated idiots by lazy comedians.  Just as racial jokes are.   If C.K thinks they are okay perhaps he should go get a real job and  go tell those jokes at work, and then we&#8217;ll see  how long he&#8217;ll last.</p>
<p><em>GLAAD. Hellooooooo</em>?  Where is the outrage over this?  Or is HBO a donor?</p>
<p>You can watch the video clip of C.K.&#8217;s HBO Saturday and the gay pedophilia joke over at <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/did-louis-c-k-imply-pedophiles-are-gay-men-in-his-latest-hbo-special/">Mediate.com</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rainbow-flag650.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-23811" alt="rainbow-flag650" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/rainbow-flag650-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been feeling like there&#8217;s a lack of comedies centered around the lives of gay men then you may be in luck. In what appears to be a blend of girl power and sex appeal of Girls and Sex In The City, HBO has developed and began filming a pilot in San Francisco depicting the lives of several gay thirty somethings navigating through their lives with laughter. Here&#8217;s more</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>It&#8217;s an idea so obvious that it&#8217;s shocking it hasn&#8217;t been done before&#8211;a gay version of &#8220;Sex and The City&#8221; set in, of course, San Francisco.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The comedic pilot was penned for HBO by Michael Lannan, who previously served as a producer on James Franco&#8217;s controversial documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2352488/" target="_hplink">Interior. Leather Bar.</a> and stars Jonathan Groff, best known for playing Jesse St. James in Glee.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>According to Mission Local, the show tells the story of three gay friends&#8211;an artist, a restaurateur and a web game developer&#8211;<a href="http://missionlocal.org/2013/04/hbo-is-in-the-nighborhood/" target="_hplink">navigating the perils and pitfalls</a> of life and love in San Francisco&#8217;s trendy Mission District.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em>Out.com <a href="http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2012/12/21/hbo-gay-series-girls" target="_hplink">reports</a>:</em></strong><br />
<strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em>Just like its Girls and Sex and the City predecessors, this untitled project features a group of friends as they try to find footing in a concrete jungle. But these boys are a bit older than their Girls counterparts, so here’s to hoping for less woe-is-me angst and more adult-driven trivialities.</em></strong><br />
<strong style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em> </em></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As always I welcome fresh, new entertaining aspects of the LGBT community being showcased for the masses as we have been lacking in that area. I don&#8217;t even care if the show seems to glorify the stereotypes that are widely believed by society. The more visibility. even when there are vagrant portrayals of inaccurate stereotypes, the more we promote discussion. That is something I will always advocate.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing, if this is just another shallow superficial gabfest that does nothing to actually show the depth and complexity of the characters, or at the very least show us why they are these stereotypes they&#8217;re portraying then I&#8217;ll pass. I don&#8217;t care if the premise of the show is to be funny and lighthearted causing all kinds of hi-jinx as that is fine by me. But these characters cannot be all about sex and drinking, no matter how pro-sex I am, because in reality no one is that way all the time. Not even those that say they are actually are 24/7. And if these characters are saying and acting like they&#8217;re all about sex and partying, show me <strong><em>why</em></strong> that person acts that way. That&#8217;s how I know I would be able to root for them.</p>

<h2><strong>April 14</strong></h2>
<p><strong>April  14, 1865</strong> &#8211; President Lincoln is shot and mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth while attending the comedy &#8220;Our American Cousin&#8221; at Ford&#8217;s Theater in Washington, D.C. He passes away the next day.</p>
<p>C..A. Tripp&#8217;s book <a href="http://erclk.about.com/?zi=15/e5Y" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln</a> makes the case that Lincoln had several homosexual relationships throughout his life.</p>
<p>Tripp states that Lincoln&#8217;s relationships with women were either invented by biographers (his love of Ann Rutledge) or were desolate botches (his courtship of Mary Owens and his marriage to Mary Todd). Tripp is not the first to argue that Lincoln was secretly gay &#8211; earlier writers have parsed his friendship with Joshua Speed, the young store owner he lived with after moving to Springfield, Ill.</p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9f05e5d61439f93aa35752c0a9639c8b63">Lincoln&#8217;s story becomes interesting when Tripp looks at 1831,</a> when Lincoln was 22, and moved to New Salem, an Illinois frontier town, where he met Billy Greene. Greene coached Lincoln in grammar and shared a narrow bed with him. &#8221;When one turned over the other had to do likewise,&#8221; Greene told Herndon. Bed-sharing was common enough in raw settlements, but Greene also had vivid memories of Lincoln&#8217;s physique: &#8221;His thighs were as perfect as a human being could be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six years later, Lincoln moved to Springfield, where he met Joshua Speed, who became a close friend; John G. Nicolay and John Hay, two early biographers, called him &#8221;the only &#8212; as he was certainly the last &#8212; intimate friend that Lincoln ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>April 14, 1904</strong> - British actor John Gielgud is born in London. Perhaps the greatest actor to grace a stage in the English-speaking  world, Gielgud never came out publicly. Privately he gave large sums of money to gay rights organizations like Stonewall.</p>
<p><strong>April 14th, 1912</strong> &#8211; The RMS Titanic struck an iceberg just before midnight.  At  11:40 pm ship&#8217;s time. Titanic sideswiped an iceberg and the glancing collision caused <i>Titanic</i>&#8216;s hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea.  By 2:20 AM, she broke apart and foundered,  taking  over one thousand three hundred people still aboard to their deaths.  Just under two hours after the <i>Titanic</i> foundered, the Cunard liner <a title="RMS Carpathia" href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.</p>
<p>Were there gay passengers and crew on the Titanic at its time of sinking?  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XNI73U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006XNI73U&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=back2stoncom-20">Of course there was.  There was lovers Michael Whitney, Edward Wedding, and Archibald Butts and even the working crew including the rugged Balkan Stoker, the redheaded Royal Purser Felix Jones,  ship’s </a><br />

<p>You can watch Hugh Brewster, author of <em>‘RMS Titanic: Gilded Lives on a Fatal Voyage’</em> talks about the untold gay stories of the Titanic’s fatal maiden voyage by <a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2012/04/forget-leo-kate-titanic-untold-gay-story-video.html"><strong>CLICKING HERE.</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>April 14, 1968</strong> &#8211; Mart Crowley&#8217;s play, &#8220;The Boys in the Band&#8221; opens on Broadway in New York. Considered to be a groundbreaking work in American theater, the first truly &#8220;honest&#8221; portrayal of the lives of contemporary homosexuals. It opened in New York on April 14, 1968, at the off-Broadway Theater Four and ran for 1002 performances before being adapted to a successful motion picture. At a time when gay characters were seldom seen in commercial media except as crude stereotypes, although later in history some in the LGBT community would say that is indeed what Crowley&#8217;s play presented</p>
<p>The setup is pure theatrics. A  melange of gay men assemble in the apartment of catholically damaged Michael for   the birthday celebration of Harold a   self-proclaimed <em>&#8220;32-year-old ugly pockmarked Jew fairy.&#8221;</em> These boys were the last ones chosen for P. E., and the first to survive by wits. Tribal unity has the ironic element of verbal onslaughts as Crowley glories in a subculture&#8217;s   artful engagement with its own dialect.</p>
<p>Then came the backlash to the backlash in the early 1990&#8242;s with a revival production by San Francisco&#8217;s Theater Rhino company when fearful of the characters images some LGBT advocates denounced it as <em>Uncle Tomism </em>because they were worried about the LGBT organizations attempts to assimilate the community into straight society ignoring what a groundbreaking piece of LGBT history the play was for the 1960&#8242;.</p>
<p><strong>April 14, 1983 </strong>- In the same year that Great Britain reports its first 17 cases of <a title="AIDS" href="/wiki/AIDS">AIDS</a> the only UK gay magazine, Gay News, stops publication.</p>
<p><strong>April 14, 1985</strong> &#8211; The first Gay Erotic Film Awards is held in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>April 15</strong></h2>
<p><strong>April 15, 1843</strong> - American writer Henry James is born in New York City. His biographer Leon Edel has endorsed a series of articles written by Richard Hall detailing the extent of James love for his brother the Harvard philosopher William James. Of Henry&#8217;s writing, Maugham summed it up<br />
best: &#8220;<em>I don&#8217;t think Henry James knew how ordinary people behave. His characters have neither bowels nor sexual organs.</em> (In his books) people do not go away, they depart, they do not go home but repair to their domiciles.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>April 15, 1894</strong> &#8211; Singer Bessie Smith is born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In &#8220;Foolish<br />
Man Blues&#8221; Smith sang: &#8220;There&#8217;s two things got me puzzled, there&#8217;s two things I<br />
don&#8217;t understand; That&#8217;s a mannish-actin&#8217; woman, and a skippin, twistin&#8217; woman-actin&#8217; man.&#8221; Strange words for a woman whose best friend was male impersonator Gladys Fergusson and who had been introduced to the world of &#8216;women-lovin&#8217; women&#8217; by blues singer Ma Rainey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>April 16</strong></h2>
<p><strong>April 16, 1453</strong> &#8211; Leonardo da Vinci is born near Florence, Italy. When he was 24 he was<a href="http://www.bnl.gov/bera/activities/globe/leonardo_da_vinci.htm"> accused of having sex with a 17-year-old youth of &#8220;questionable&#8221; background. </a></p>
<p>Along with three other young men, he was anonymously accused of sodomy, which in Florence was a criminal offense, even though in most cases the authorities looked the other way and the general culture attached little social stigma to homosexuality.</p>
<p>The accusation specifically charged him with a homosexual interaction with one Jacopo Saltarelli, a notorious prostitute. The charges were brought in April, and for a time Leonardo and the other defendants were under the watchful eye of Florence&#8217;s <em>&#8220;Officers of the Night</em>&#8220;&#8211;a kind of renaissance vice squad.</p>
<p>However, the charges were dismissed in June, due to a lack of witnesses and evidence. It is probable that the Medici family brought had something to do with this outcome, as another of the defendants was Lionardo de Tornabuoni, and Lorenzo de Medici&#8217;s mother had been a Tornabuoni.</p>
<p>DaVinci never married or showed any (recorded) interest in women; indeed, he wrote in his notebooks that male-female intercourse disgusted him. His anatomical drawings naturally include the sexual organs of both genders, but those of the male exhibit much more extensive attention. Finally, Leonardo surrounded himself with beautiful young male assistants, such as Salai and Melzi.</p>
<p>This is a bit of gay history that is<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/in-starzs-da-vincis-demons-a-young-leonardo-discovers-some-heat/2013/04/11/2fefa8e6-9e42-11e2-a2db-efc5298a95e1_story.html"> conveniently being <strong><em>straightwashed</em> </strong>out of Starz’new drama series, “Da Vinci’s Demons,”</a> where young and sexy Leonardo (Tom Riley), who also seems to have invented the stubble trimmer and Supercuts along the way to designing  the paraglider and the helicopter. shares the storyline and his bed with high-class Medici mistress Lucrezia Donadi (Laura Haddock) who does more than pose <em>(topless of course)</em> with Leonardo while he’s supposed to spend painting her portrait.</p>

<h2>April 19</h2>
<p><strong>April 19, 1967</strong> &#8211; <strong><em>The Student Homophile League of Columbia University</em> </strong>becomes the first gay group to obtain a campus charter.</p>
<p>The <em>SHL</em> had twelve members who fought with university administrators for a year before the group was officially recognized. Stephen Donaldson, a bisexual identified LGBT rights activist is commemorated by a plaque in the queer lounge that bears his name in one of Columbia&#8217;s residence halls for spearheading the creation of the group.</p>
<p>When the charter was ultimately granted in April 1967 it earned media attention with the <i>New York Times</i> printing a story on the front page, the <i>Columbia Daily Spectator</i> reported that some students believed that the creation of the group was an April Fool&#8217;s Day joke.</p>
<p>The group is still in existence to this day and is now called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Queer_Alliance"><em><b>Columbia Queer Alliance</b></em></a><br />
<strong>April 19, 1982</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://www.goalny.org/Home.html"><em>The Gay Officers Action League, Inc. </em><strong>(GOAL)</strong></a>  is founded by NYPD Sergeant Charles Cochrane and retired Detective Sam Ciccone establishing the first official police fraternal society in the world to represent LGBT people within the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Cochrane, a 14 year veteran of the NYPD, created shock waves by testifying before a NYC Council hearing in favor of a gay rights bill. Following the testimony of a Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association Vice President, who denounced the bill and declared, &#8220;I didn’t know of any homosexual police officers.&#8221;, Cochrane stunned all present as well as NYC as a whole by his testimony: “<em>I am very proud of being a New York City Police Officer, and I am equally proud of being gay.”</em></p>
<p>In 1987, at the persistent urging of GOAL, the  NYPD began a concerted effort to actively enlist qualified gay candidates. In 2002, GOAL was admitted into COPS, The Committee of Police Societies, an organization consisting of all recognized NYPD religious, ethnic fraternal organizations.</p>
<p>Since its inception, GOAL has evolved not only as a fraternal organization, but also as an<br />
activist organization that represents the interests of its LGBT members in all agencies and branches within the criminal justice system.</p>
