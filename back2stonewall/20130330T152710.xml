				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ohio based hate group <em>Faith2Action&#8217;s</em> Janet Porter <em>(a Linda Harvey wannabee)</em> is out with a low budget trailer and begging for right-wing welfare <em>(money donations)</em> to make her new anti-gay propaganda filled  &#8221;documentary&#8221; <em>The Criminalization of Christianity</em> that warns America that “time and freedom are running out” in the fight to stop the gay rights movement and “If homosexual activists achieve their goal of the criminalization of Christianity.” <strong>*GASP!*</strong></p>
<p>D-List hater Porter formerly known as Janet Folger, is the founder and president of <a href="http://f2a.org/">Faith2Action,</a> a site dedicated to defending &#8220;<a title="Pro-family" href="/wiki/Pro-family">pro-family</a>&#8221; values but mostly known for as a group opposing the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007.</p>
<p>Porter has compared  homosexuality to &#8220;alcoholism&#8221; and &#8220;kleptomania&#8221; and firmly <em>(and delusionally)</em> believes that &#8220;Christians&#8221; are being victimized by the <a title="Media" href="/wiki/Media">media</a> and popular culture and that gay rights groups have persuaded Americans that Christians who condemn homosexuality are intolerant, while actually it is gay people and their supporters who are intolerant of Christians.</p>
<p>In her disgusting trailer below, Porter claims that gay rights advocates are “threatening marriage,” “threatening our children” and “threatening freedom” and makes references to the Jerry Sandusky being gay and his  abuse case<em> (Sandusky was married and not gay</em>), Chick-fil-A,  and a Michael Swift article from 1987 which Religious Right lunatics still over 25 years later apparently don&#8217;t realize was <a href="http://www.ralliance.org/GayAgenda.html">satire</a> along with scary ominous music and a link on their website to <strong>&#8220;DONATE&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>What is it about the midwest and its high rate of producing serial killers and anti-gay &#8220;christian&#8221; lunatics?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming right on the heels of her families hateful anti-gay <a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/2013/03/osmond-family-host-anti-gay-marriage-hate-rally-slc-utah.html">&#8220;Celebration of Marriage&#8221; </a>rally in Salt Lake City, UT this past week Marie Osmond talked with Diane Sawyer and let her know that she believes in marriage equality.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The God that I believe in is a god of love, not fear. I don&#8217;t tell my children if you&#8217;re not good you&#8217;re going to Hell. I tell my children that God will be there for them when they struggle. That&#8217;s the God I believe in&#8230;I believe in [my lesbian daughter's] civil rights, as a mother. I think my daughter deserves everything that she desires in life. She&#8217;s a good girl. She&#8217;s a wonderful child. I don&#8217;t think God made one color flower. I think he made many&#8230;&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is nice to see Marie Osmond finally standing against her anti-gay family and the Mormon church and speaking out for the civil rights of gays and lesbians and supporting her lesbian daughter.</p>
<p><em><strong>BRAVA DIVA!</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130329-204209.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="20130329-204209.jpg" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130329-204209.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In <em>what the hell is wrong with him </em> news, Seattle Seahawks player Chris Clemons decides to weigh his bigoted small minded opinion on whether an openly gay player should be welcomed in the NFL. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/chris-clemons-nfl-gay_n_2978949.html?utm_hp_ref=gay-voices">more</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Clemons said he didn&#8217;t think it would be a good idea for a player to come out of the closet while playing professional football, although he insisted he wasn&#8217;t homophobic.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Who on Gods earth is this person saying he&#8217;s coming out of the closet in the NFL?&#8221; tweeted Clemons.</p>
<p>Speculation about the possibility of a professional football player coming out picked up this week after a report by Mike Freeman of CBS Sports.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on interviews over the past several weeks with current and former players, I&#8217;m told that a current gay NFL player is strongly considering coming out publicly within the next few months &#8212; and after doing so, the player would attempt to continue his career,&#8221; wrote Freeman.</p>
<p>He added that the player believes it is &#8220;now time for someone to take this step&#8221; but is worried about the reaction of homophobic fans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the actual tweet that Clemons sent out stated &#8220;I&#8217;m not against anyone but I think it&#8217;s a selfish act. They just trying to make themselves bigger than the team.&#8221;&#8230;but how can you state that you&#8217;re not against something but call someone&#8217;s very nature &#8220;selfish&#8221;?</p>
<p>I mean is this what all homophobic people that play professional sports believes that a person not hiding who they are as &#8220;selfish&#8221;? The one thing that Clemons and any other bigot that believes that being openly gay takes away something <em>from</em> themselves or the team need a huge reality check.</p>
<p>Playing a professional sport is a job. A very glitzy, popular, endorsement enriched, potentially overpaid entertainment job. This isn&#8217;t a bathhouse where a gay player wants to come in and check out the merchandise. They are going to have a certain code of conduct just like anyone else and I&#8217;m sure that there will be reprimands for any harassment just like any other player so what the hell are you afraid of Clemons? Because that&#8217;s all we can deduce by such a myopic position you&#8217;re taking in this.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s <em>selfish</em> to ask someone to hide who they are just for your comfort Clemons, cause lets be honest here. That&#8217;s the only reason why you have an issue with this, no matter how politely you tried (and failed) to say during this message.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, thousands of pro-equality Americans <a href="http://www.lighttojustice.org/">gathered</a> outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. to show support for the freedom to marry on same days that the Court heard oral arguments on California&#8217;s Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act.</p>
<p>On March 26, a coalition of anti-gay groups held their own <a href="https://www.marriagemarch.org/about/">event</a> advocating for the preservation of marriage discrimination against same-sex couples. It consisted of a march from the National Mall to the Supreme Court and back followed by a rally on the Mall, and was enthusiastically <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-becker/bishops-tell-catholics-to_b_2841673.html">endorsed</a> by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on their Facebook page; the prelates encouraged Catholics across America to take time from their solemn Holy Week observances to travel to Washington, D.C. and demonstrate against marriage equality. (<em>I can&#8217;t think of a better way to prepare for Easter, can you?</em>)</p>
<p>As the eyes of the nation turned to the Supreme Court, pro-equality groups including the Human Rights Campaign urged people across the country to express their support for marriage equality by turning their social media profile photos red. (Facebook data <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-data-science/showing-support-for-marriage-equality-on-facebook/10151430548593859">indicates</a> that up to 2.7 million Facebook users appear to have done so.) The most commonly-used image was a red version of HRC&#8217;s ubiquitous equal-sign logo:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/29/cordileone-divisio/hrc_red_equality/" rel="attachment wp-att-3193"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3193" alt="hrc_red_equality" src="http://www.johnmbecker.com/content/uploads/2013/03/hrc_red_equality-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a>Well, San Francisco Archbishop <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/tag/salvatore-cordileone/">Salvatore Cordileone</a> &#8212; a notoriorious homophobe (and <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2012/08/28/catholic-archbishop-father-of-prop-8-arrested-for-dui/">drunk driver</a>) who leads the USCCB&#8217;s crusade against marriage equality and is widely known as the &#8220;Father of Proposition 8&#8243; &#8212; must have been upset by all the red he saw on Facebook this week, because the official archdiocesan <a href="https://www.facebook.com/archdiocesesf">Facebook page</a> posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513674285346020&amp;set=pb.235281479851970.-2207520000.1364497838&amp;type=3&amp;theater">photo</a> yesterday <em>mocking</em> marriage equality. Joe.My.God <a href="http://joemygod.blogspot.com/2013/03/from-sf-archbishop-drunk-driver.html">reports</a> that the post was deleted after it garnered over 350 negative comments, but <a href="http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2013/03/the-father-of-divisive-prop-8-posts-literal-symbol-of-division.html">Jeremy Hooper</a> snapped this screenshot of the offensive graphic before it was yanked (click on the photo to be taken to <a href="http://www.goodasyou.org/">Good As You</a>, Jeremy&#8217;s blog):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.goodasyou.org/good_as_you/2013/03/the-father-of-divisive-prop-8-posts-literal-symbol-of-division.html"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3192" alt="cordileone_division_screenshot" src="http://www.johnmbecker.com/content/uploads/2013/03/cordileone_division_screenshot.jpg" width="410" height="469" /></a><br />
That&#8217;s right: instead of following the example of Jesus, who Christian tradition says <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pope-washes-feet-of-young-detainees-_-not-all-of-them-catholic-_-in-holy-thursday-ritual/2013/03/28/39a9d8c4-97cc-11e2-b5b4-b63027b499de_story.html">demonstrated</a> ultimate humility on Holy Thursday by washing his disciples&#8217; feet, Archbishop Cordileone decided to spend <em>his</em> Holy Thursday mocking and deriding those &#8212; including a <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/18/dramatic-rise-marriage-equality/">majority</a> of the American people and a <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/06/poll-confirms-catholics-support-marriageequality/">plurality</a> of American Catholics &#8212; who believe gays and lesbians should have the simple freedom to marry the person they love.</p>
<p>Sending a message that&#8217;s literally divisive on one of the holiest days in the Christian liturgical year is a new low, even for someone like Archbishop Cordileone who regularly plumbs the depths of hate-fueled homophobia. But even though Cordileone&#8217;s smug, self-righteous bigotry is unusrprising, it nevertheless is astoundingly repugnant. The man he claims as his savior would be deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>(Admittedly vindictive postscript: my public <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freedom2marry">Facebook page</a> has over 200 more likes than the official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/archdiocesesf">Facebook page</a> of the Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco. <img src='http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ben-Carson1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23314" alt="Ben Carson" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ben-Carson1.png" width="300" height="186" /></a></p>
<p>The Republican and Tea Party&#8217;s newest rock star and raving lunatic Dr, Ben Carson appeared on the propaganda driven <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/03/28/1790741/newest-darling-of-the-republican-party-compares-same-sex-marriage-to-nambla-bestiality/">Fox News channel on Tuesday </a>to bitch about the Obama administration and to denounce the liberal media. Oh and he also equated being gay with pedophiles and bestiality.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CARSON:</strong> <em>My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman, it’s a well-established uh, fundamental pillar of society. <strong>No group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA [the North American Man/Boy Love Association], be they people who believe in beastiality, it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition.</strong> So it’s not something that’s against gays, it’s against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has signifcant ramifications.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Ironically Carson was presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2008 for his contributions to medicine and his work in education.</p>
<p>I guess this is the conservative outreach to the LGBT community that the GOP keeps talking about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Family Reserach Council President and White Supremacist Tony Perkins:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Legal arguments today were complicated by the fact that President Obama  and his Justice Department have chosen to abdicate their responsibility  to defend federal laws in court, and have instead joined in declaring  DOMA unconstitutional. No amount of legal footwork by those seeking redefinition of marriage  can change the fact that society needs children, and children need a mom and a dad. It&#8217;s not just about love between adults, it&#8217;s about  civilization. That&#8217;s a compelling reason for both California and the  federal government to define marriage as the union of one man and one  woman, and for the Supreme Court to uphold both Proposition 8 and DOMA.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Concerned Women For America spokesthing <a href="http://onenewsnow.com/latest-headlines-from-american-family-news/2013/03/27/attorney-freedoms-on-collision-course-if-doma-or-prop-8-struck-down#" target="_blank">Janet Crouse</a>:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Here we are, in modern-day America, with all of our arrogance and all of our pomposity, thinking that we know enough to absolutely change all of culture. It&#8217;s a day of great perplexity as those of us who treasure marriage and understand how basic it is, not just for individuals but for all of culture, to sit and listen to these arguments and understand the impact and ramifications of all that&#8217;s going on. It&#8217;s very, very sobering. And these are very momentous days, because if the Supreme Court does go in the wrong direction, we are in for very bleak days ahead.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Currently under Federal Investigation Liberty Counsel head <a href="http://onenewsnow.com/latest-headlines-from-american-family-news/2013/03/27/attorney-freedoms-on-collision-course-if-doma-or-prop-8-struck-down#" target="_blank">Mat Staver</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;If for some reason the court had five justices vote to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act under some concoction that it was prohibited by the Constitution, that would have catastrophic effect. It would elevate same-sex sexual activity and same-sex marriage to the same level as race – and that would put it on a direct collision course with religious freedom and freedom of speech. The court should not be involved in social engineering or re-engineering, but this could have a big impact.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Brian Brown and Maggie Gallagher of the National Organization for Marriage have not issued any statements and their whereabouts are unknown but a recent closings of <em>Golden Coral</em> all-you-can-eat buffets in the D.C. area due to selling out of food seems to indicate that they are waiting in nearby for the Supreme Courts rulings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ABC 4 News out of Salt Lake City, Utah is running a truly biased  story that spotlights how a large number gay rights advocates showed up to defend their civil rights at the Osmond Family&#8217;s Utah&#8217;s anti-gay hatefest on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.abc4.com/content/about_4/bios/story/Gay-right-advocates-crash-Utah-traditional/KMGCLkcV70OPBwcRNf-Kfg.cspx">Gay right advocates crash Utah traditional marriage celebration</a> </strong>- by Brian Carlson</p>
<blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brian-Carlson.png"><img class=" wp-image-23268 alignleft" alt="Brian Carlson" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Brian-Carlson.png" width="176" height="178" /></a>Tuesday&#8217;s celebration of traditional family marriage had everything: the Osmonds, the Governor, and hundreds of gay rights party crashers. Needless to say it was not what traditional family supporters expected. &#8220;Do you think it makes this thing tense?&#8221; asked Reporter Brian Carlson. &#8220;In some ways yes, in some ways no,&#8221; said Claus Nielsen, traditional family supporter. &#8220;It breaks my heart to see some of the signs around her that talk about hate, there&#8217;s one I&#8217;m looking at right now that says &#8216;Hate is not a family value,&#8217; and that&#8217;s not what this is about, it&#8217;s about sharing love but standing up for what we believe,&#8221; said Jill Johnson, traditional family supporter. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that man defines marriage, but God defines marriage,&#8221; said Cameron Smith, traditional family supporter.</em></p>
<p><em>With protesters in every direction, celebrating traditional marriage seemed to take on extra emotion especially during a young speaker&#8217;s remarks. </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;It takes a mom and a dad to raise a child, so it takes a mom and a dad to raise one,&#8221; said Amelia Summerhays, traditional family supporter. </em></p>
<p><em>Reporter Brian Carlson asked the organizer of the protest why they crashed the party. </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why do you have to do it on the night and especially the location where you have traditional family holding their celebration?&#8221; Carlson asked. </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Well because often we&#8217;re disregarded and we&#8217;re seen as invisible and I don&#8217;t want us to be invisible anymore,&#8221; said Kat Phillpotts, gay rights activist. </em></p>
<p><em>They certainly were seen. But even with all the distractions, supporters of traditional marriage said Tuesday&#8217;s event was about celebrating the family. </em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;What we&#8217;re celebrating here tonight is marriage between a man and a woman, and that&#8217;s one thing regardless of what your stance is that we have in common,&#8221; said Nathan Osmond, event performer.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously not only is &#8220;<em>Reporter Brian Carlson&#8221;</em> so self-important<em> (and such a shitty journalist)</em> that he refers to himself in the third person sense in <strong>(TWICE!)</strong> he also seems to think that members of the public can &#8221;crash&#8221; a public event held on public property.</p>
<p>I wonder if Carlson would describe it as <em>&#8220;party crashing&#8221;</em> when religious folk hatefully, loudly and nastily protest Gay Pride, Gay days at Disney or  anything else they feel like.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Reporter Brian Carlson&#8221;</em> also happens to be Mormon who graduated from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor’s degree in Broadcast Journalism and hobbies include rock climbing, football, drawing, volunteering, skiing, wakeboarding, working out, and watching movies when not cruising the Mormon Temples mens room.</p>
<p><strong>Good ole BYU.</strong></p>
<p><em>Where Mormon men are idiots and chaste and the sheep are extremely nervous.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Most-evil.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23265" alt="Most evil" src="http://www.back2stonewall.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Most-evil.png" width="300" height="173" /></a></p>
<p>The Kentucky House and Senate voted by overwhelming margins Tuesday night to override Gov. Steve Beshear’s veto of the controversial “religious freedom” bill that would not only give religious organizations but also individuals the right to ignore any state or city anti-discrimination laws on the basis of &#8220;religious freedom&#8221;</p>
<p>The House’s 79-15 vote sent House Bill 279 to the Senate, which voted 32-6 to override the Governors VETO.</p>
<p>Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear released a statement saying he was disappointed with the override of the only bill he vetoed in the 2013 legislative session. “As I explained in my veto message, I have significant concerns that this bill will cause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care, and individuals’ civil rights.”</p>
<p>HB 279 says that government shall not infringe on any person’s sincerely held religious beliefs unless it can show with “clear and convincing evidence” some compelling governmental interest for doing so.</p>
<p>Gay-rights and human-rights groups led the opposition to the bill, warned that it could be used to challenge local laws in Louisville, Lexington, Covington and Vicco designed to protect not only gays and lesbians from discrimination but could also be used to override racial and anti-discrimination laws geared to protect women. And possibly result in the withholding of needed medical care or te withholding of abortions using religious beliefs as a justification for abuse.</p>
<p>Chris Hartman, director of the Fairness Campaign, noted that the bill passed as the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on same-sex marriage. “Today the commonwealth took a step backwards in protecting its residents at the same time the United States Supreme Court was hearing arguments that will advance the rights of Americans. It’s sad and it’s disheartening,” he said.</p>
<p>While the Kentucky Senate is Republican controlled,  Kentucky&#8217;s House is overwhelming Democratic.  House Speaker Greg Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, cowardly declined to give a final tally for the vote to override Gov. Steve Beshear&#8217;s veto of House Bill 279</p>
