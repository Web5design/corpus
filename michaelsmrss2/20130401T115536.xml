<title>Calls for an audit and investigation into the AWU WA branch hammered by Slater and Gordon - who paid?  Whose interests were served?  Was the AWU better off - or was the union the biggest loser?</title>

&lt;/object&gt;
&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Put yourself in the position of lawyers for the AWU. &amp;#0160; When an allegation of misconduct is made against an official, with a call for an audit of the AWU&amp;#39;s financial records - what does your duty to the AWU require you to do? &amp;#0160; Do you take the report of malfeasance, investigate it, have the allegations audited? &amp;#0160;Or do you sue the complainant with one for the horse he rode in on?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Len Gandini was an AWU member who asked questions about Ralph Blewitt&amp;#39;s appointment as head of the WA branch.&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Mr Gandindi called for an audit of the WA Branch&amp;#39;s finances - and he made a number of allegations about Ralph Blewitt in a printed flyer calling for an election for the position of WA Secretary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Ralph tells the story here - Gillard and Murphy decided to sue Mr Gandini. &amp;#0160; Ralph Blewitt says he did not instruct them to sue, he did not pay for the suit, he could not pay for the suit and he was not involved in managing the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a high powered legal action it was, joining Mr Gandini with the firm that folded his flyers and put them in envelopes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b123970b-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ralph sues&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b123970b image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b123970b-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Ralph sues&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who paid for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Murphy and Ms Gillard may have decided to donate their services to the sophisticated property investor Ralph Blewitt, but I wonder if their instructed barrister RW Richardson of Counsel did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fdcb3970c-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rw richardson counsel&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fdcb3970c&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fdcb3970c-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Rw richardson counsel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The legal action meandered on until after Ralph and Bruce left the AWU in August, 1995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard not to imagine that the action was brought to stop this from happening - these two bullet points are from Mr Gandini&amp;#39;s flyer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b4f0970b-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Audit and election&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b4f0970b&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b4f0970b-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Audit and election&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The poor bloke who runs the folding up and sticking flyers in envelopes business seemed a bit exasperated by it all - didn&amp;#39;t stop Bernard Murphy and the crew, they kept him there as a defendant right to the end. &amp;#0160;Didn&amp;#39;t matter that he didn&amp;#39;t see, couldn&amp;#39;t see, didn&amp;#39;t read, didn&amp;#39;t do anything other than stick the flyers in envelopes and mail them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fe091970c-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;4th defendant defence - feb 1994&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fe091970c image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426fe091970c-800wi&quot; title=&quot;4th defendant defence - feb 1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Len Gandini seemed to have a reasonable defence too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b73a970b-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Defence Gandini - qualified privilege - blewitt as official&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b73a970b image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017c3840b73a970b-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Defence Gandini - qualified privilege - blewitt as official&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested to know of Ms Gillard and the newly minted Gillard-appointee Judge Bernard Murphy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who paid?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who gave instructions to sue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose interests did this action protect? &amp;#0160; Was the AWU the beneficiary or loser?&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Patients lose GP surgery to asylum seekers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by DAVID WILKES, Daily Mail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 2,000 patients will have to find a new GP because their local clinic is being turned over to asylum seekers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of refugees will have exclusive access to a doctor, three support staff and interpreters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will cost taxpayers £322,000 to convert the centre, in Derby, and £274,000 a year to run it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health chiefs came up with the idea after local doctors complained they were spending many hours trying to deal with refugees who have special medical needs but may not speak English or have any written records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Derby Primary Care Trust chose the Sai Medical Centre because it has been run by a locum since the GP who worked there decided to concentrate on his other practice, two miles away. Advertisements for a permanent replacement in the run-down inner-city area have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the news has brought an angry response from the surgery&#39;s 1,900 current patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saklane Muhammed, 23, said: &#39;I have been using it ever since I was born. This will mean having to find a new doctor, perhaps a long way away.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Hussain, 31, said: &#39;I am not happy at all. The asylum seekers will be getting everything while we have to find new doctors. Why can&#39;t we all use the same surgery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<title>The sale of 1/85 Kerr Street Fitzroy in early 1996 - who got the money?   Every touch leaves its trace.</title>

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We know when and to whom 1/85 Kerr Street was sold because the Land Titles Office records the real property transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39231970d-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sale of Kerr Street&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39231970d image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39231970d-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Sale of Kerr Street&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have heard Ralph Blewitt state that he did not receive any money on the sale of the property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spoken at some length with Bruce Wilson about the sale and its proceeds - he says that he did not receive any money from the sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am told that Ralph Blewitt recently attended on the Real Estate agent who ostensibly acted for him in the sale and asked for a copy of the file. &amp;#0160; I&amp;#39;m told that no file was produced for Mr Blewitt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the matter of where the money went will be an important element in any complete investigation of The AWU Scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detective Sergeant David McAlpine made some progress in that matter during the Western Australia Police Fraud Sqaud investigation into the scandal in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some extracts from Sergeant McAlpine&amp;#39;s running sheet produced at the time - with names redacted by white space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A policeman&amp;#39;s running sheet is like a diary, it lists persons spoken to, enquiries made, exhibits and property taken into police possession and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day McAlpine noted this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39ae5970d-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Sale fitzroy running sheet&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39ae5970d image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017ee9e39ae5970d-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Sale fitzroy running sheet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He contacted the Bank of Melbourne and someone else who could help him with the disbursement of fees on the sale. &amp;#0160;He also attended on the Commonwealth Bank and made enquiries about 3 accounts operated by persons of interest in WA in the AWU Fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f806c970c-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;6 12 96 sale fitzroy&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f806c970c image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f806c970c-800wi&quot; title=&quot;6 12 96 sale fitzroy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 6 December, 1996 Det Sgt McAlpine received documents from Simms and Co which showed that $23,300 was deposited 25/1/96 and that the balance of $16,818.00 was posted to XXX via his XXXXX. &amp;#0160; The logical person to whom money would be posted would be the vendor, Ralph Blewitt and the logical &amp;quot;via his&amp;quot; may refer to the post office box, probably the personal box referred to a few lines down with a note about Postal Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as McAlpine notes, &amp;quot;There is further funds outstanding&amp;quot;. &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/85 Kerr sold for $230,000 less a $150K mortgage loan to Bank of Melbourne (presume no interest capitalised or principal repaid) less a $23,300 deposit, less the $16,818 posted to XXX via his XXX. &amp;#0160; That leaves about $40,000 odd unaccounted for, or as McAlpine says &amp;quot;outstanding&amp;quot;.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAlpine records in his running sheet, &amp;quot;NAB &amp;#0160;XXXXX &amp;#0160;re that cheque&amp;quot;. &amp;#0160;Perhaps he was following up the National Australia Bank re the negotiation of a cheque that paid the rest of the funds outstanding to someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f8b0f970c-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Running sheet melbourne nab ac house sale fitzroy&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f8b0f970c image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f8b0f970c-800wi&quot; title=&quot;Running sheet melbourne nab ac house sale fitzroy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On 11 December, 1996 McAlpine was satisfied that the cheque for $16,818 was presented for payment on 21 March, 1996. &amp;#0160; Someone from the NAB was advised of this and &amp;quot;requested cheque&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then McAlpine says, &amp;quot;XXXXX is XXXXXXXXXXXX in Melbourne - will require statement from her.&amp;quot; &amp;#0160;I would love to know just who is the she from whom a statement was required, the mystery lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can rest assured that our state police forces co-operate with each other and that the information, exhibits and original documents that Detective Sergeant McAlpine seized or otherwise came to have will be available to today&amp;#39;s investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of the persons of interest in this matter can be shown to have received money upon the sale of 1/85 Kerr Street Fitzroy that would be a useful piece of evidence for prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 2em;&quot;&gt;Blaxland Federal MP Jason Clare says target the money to defeat criminals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f6fb2970c-pi&quot; style=&quot;display: inline;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The candidate&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f6fb2970c image-full&quot; src=&quot;http://michaelsmithnews.typepad.com/.a/6a0177444b0c2e970d017d426f6fb2970c-800wi&quot; title=&quot;The candidate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;TARGET the money, said Blaxland Federal Labor MP Jason Clare, and it will undermine the power and influence of criminals in our community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is all about money. Money creates power in the criminal underworld,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Most of these criminals are more afraid of losing their money than they are of going to jail.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Mr Clare said the government would now pursue tough new unexplained wealth laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They would reverse the onus of proof that means the onus is on the criminal to prove how they obtained their cash and assets through legitimate means.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the laws, assets and money could be seized by law enforcement until a person could prove it had been legally obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If we are serious about tackling organised crime one of the key things we have to do is rip their assets off them,&amp;quot; Mr Clare said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When your former lover is implicated in a $500K cash embezzlement - &amp;#0160;where you are the lawyer who created the documents that facilitated the fraud - where your boyfriend while you are away decides that your house should be renovated - where on your own admission you cannot rule out that embezzled money paid for those renovations - and where you are a person of interest in a Major Fraud and Extortion Squad investigation into your conduct, you should step aside as Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Prime Minister is under such a cloud concerning her integrity and suspect status in a major criminal investigation, common sense and good governance &amp;#0160;ought dictate that she steps down until her name is cleared or she is charged. &amp;#0160; &amp;quot;I did nothing wrong&amp;quot; is simply not good enough, Australia deserves much better.&lt;/p&gt;
