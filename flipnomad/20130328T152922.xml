				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left everything behind last March 25, 2011 hoping that I could travel for at least six months or more. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that this adventure will still be alive today. Prior to leaving, <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2011/03/sold-out-ready-set/" target="_blank">I sold almost everything that I have</a>, gave away the remaining stuff and kept some so I&#8217;ll have some stuff to start with when I go back.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving, I also had this blog for quite some time and worked hard in making it a better one with the hopes that it could help me fund my trip even if it was just earning a few bucks during that time.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving, I daydreamed everyday of traveling for a long time to see as much as I can, be amazed with the wonders and beauty of this planet I live in, taste unique cuisines and meet people from around the world.</p>
<p>And fast forward to the present time, I&#8217;m still living this nomadic lifestyle that I chose for myself.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">In the past two years, I learned that it wasn&#8217;t a walk in the park because there have been so many challenges. Maybe if I were born with a silver spoon in my mouth then it would have been easier on the financial side and maybe if I were carrying a &#8220;first world passport&#8221; then it would have been easier to enter and exit various countries. But despite lacking those advantages or privileges that other travelers have, I still feel lucky that I have survived two years on the road. Even if I wasn&#8217;t able to go out of Asia due to financial constraints, I feel grateful that I was able to visit so many awe-inspiring places that definitely blew my mind away and learned a lesson or two that will forever guide me in this thing called life.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Looking back, there were tough moments that really shook me up.</p>
<p>There were moments when I only ate cup noodles for a couple of days because my Paypal was &#8220;limited&#8221; and those were the only food I can afford to eat.</p>
<p>There were moments where I had to walk a few kilometers because it was the only option I had.</p>
<p>There were moments when I was in between choosing to give up this dream and just go back to my cubicle life.</p>
<p>But those moments helped me define for myself what I really want to do with my life for now.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Two Years of Being Nomadic" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8592996862_389dfa3e3e_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>Because of this lifestyle, I realized that I could move almost anywhere I want. I don&#8217;t have to put up with the crazy traffic that you can usually find in huge cities. I could go where the climate is nicer and avoid the heat or intense cold if I want to. Living a nomadic lifestyle gave me freedom to move almost anywhere anytime.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8529/8592996806_31fda6ef3f_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>Living this location independent lifestyle enables me to sleep and wake up anytime I want while still being productive. In the past two years, I had the opportunity to sleep and wake up anytime I want which sounds really shallow but I really like it. It felt to me like a privilege I never had, especially since I came from a sleep-deprived industry (I used to work in a call center which means I work in a variety of shifts). It also greatly improved my health since I could rest anytime I want if I&#8217;m feeling very tired.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8226/8592996710_70c0406021_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>This nomadic lifestyle also gave me the chance to live closer to nature for as much as I want. I never thought that it would be such a delight to always breathe fresh air and eat fresh locally produced food. I spent a huge amount of my time in small cities and towns where it&#8217;s less polluted. Looking back to my past life, I realized why my health greatly improves every after vacation, it&#8217;s because it gets expose to cleaner environment every time I take some time away from the city.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8229/8592996888_d8b8ca1b3d_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In this past two years, I also had the chance to visit a couple of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries and also had the opportunity to see wild animals in their natural habitat. I only got to see them before in zoos or on TV. I like learning stuff about animals since I was a kid and this lifestyle enabled me to visit places where I could see them in the wild. I really hope that I could go to more national parks in the coming years.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8592996836_147fefa02d_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years of being on the move every now and then, I had the chance to visit the places that I used to see on TV and read on books. I also had the chance to see places that I never knew existed and I aim to visit more in the coming years. This kind of lifestyle also enabled me to do this without waiting for anyone or someone to approve my vacation leaves.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8592996734_deedcfc80f_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years, I also had the the chance doing the things that I like doing like photography, writing, making <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/ebook/" target="_blank">ebooks</a> and lately I have been learning a lot in designing websites. In between travelling and sightseeing I always make sure that I do these things and learn a couple of new things every now and then. It was hard for me to do this back then since I rarely have the time but now I feel like I have enough time to focus on the things that I like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8591945013_09b98b1844_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years, I dined, traveled with, talked to people from various places, religions, race etc and learned a lot from them. I learned that despite our differences we are also similar. We all have dreams that we want to pursue. We all have friends and families that we love and care for. We all have fears and challenges that we face every day. We all breathe air to survive, drink water, eat food, and we will all eventually die. In the past two years, I also learned that despite the tons of bad news that make you lose faith in humanity, the world is still a safe place to live in and there are more <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/the-good-samaritan-kibber/" target="_blank">kind people</a> than &#8220;bad&#8221; ones.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">And if this world becomes a dangerous place for everyone then we have ourselves to blame for by allowing it to happen.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8593098404_344bbc5767_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years, I have done things that I have only dreamt of in the past. I tried things that I thought I can never do. I have lived every day in the present moment without worrying about the past and the future and I do hope that I could continue doing this for the years to come. But, in the past two years of living a nomadic life I also have learned a very important fact of life&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>nothing is permanent&#8230;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I want this to last forever, I know that like everything else in this world, this is just a temporary phase of my life. So I&#8217;ll try to enjoy this kind of life while it lasts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve heard about <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/leh/" target="_blank">Leh</a> and <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/ladakh/" target="_blank">Ladakh</a> a lot of times from the people that I&#8217;ve met in my past travels and I&#8217;ve always dreamt of going there to see it for myself. Alas the time finally came when I got a six months visa in India (last 2012) and figured that I have enough time to explore some northern districts including <strong>Ladakh </strong>and it&#8217;s capital <strong>Leh</strong>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/how-from-kaza-leh/" target="_blank">travel to Leh from Kaza</a> took us almost two full days. It was a gruelling trip but the scenery was mind-blowingly beautiful. Check out my last post about some details about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #006699;">Leh Palace built in 17th century</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh Palace" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8165/7573445974_63e1036349_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br />
Leh is not the main destination in Ladakh though it could be a nice place to chill and relax before you explore the nearby villages.</p>
<p>There are lots of accommodation in the Old Leh and New Leh area. We preferred to stay a bit far from the old palace and near the small farms instead. We stayed in a small guesthouse where a double room only cost us 200 Rupees. There are lots of affordable accommodation in Upper Tukcha.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7573374522_3a8e127b68_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Old Leh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8020/7573370788_48bed20fec_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">New Leh</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8144/7574428498_64b553b2c2_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">An undeveloped part of Leh</span></p>
<p>There are also lots of restaurants with a variety of cuisines. If you want to take a break from eating momos and thukpa, then Leh would be a nice place to feast on some familiar dishes like pizza and pasta.</p>
<p>There are also a couple of ATMs in this town including HDFC, State Bank of India and J&amp;K Bank where you could withdraw money. I have only tried HDFC and it accepts international cards (withdrawal transaction has 200 Rupees fee).</p>
<p>Leh also has a bus station that could conect you to various towns in Ladakh and as well as to Kargil, Jammu and Srinagar. There are shared taxis also available thru the travel agencies if you prefer using it instead.</p>
<p>There are also lots of shops selling outdoor gears, Tibetan jewelleries and artefacts (not sure if those are just reproductions or what) and other stuff that you might find interesting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7256/7573376736_9ec29b6145_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7135/7573378522_05122d296b_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">One of the many Tibetan Refugee Markets scatterred around Leh</span></p>
<p>Ladakh is also known as the land of stupas and you could find a lot of these in Leh.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7276/7573365622_c4eeef677c_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8027/7573375706_1c6a46a8b0_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Best time to visit would be during the months of June and July where it&#8217;s not that cold. But if you&#8217;re interested to see Leh during winter, then you still could do so. Leh fortunately has flights to Delhi and Srinagar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7262/7573368348_28bba6beef_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>

<p>But before you click away, check out my short interview with Ian.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="ian-of-borderless-travels-in-almaty-kazakhstan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8092/8460268431_c4f0b0421e_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until university that I had the opportunity to travel on my own, and my ticked to discover the world came in the form of a teaching job in Europe. It was while working in Switzerland that I learned the joys of travel and how valuable it is for learning about people and places. Traveling is an education in itself, and being passionate about life long learning, exploring the world around me became my passion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it was my the gut wrenching food poisoning I got in the Philippines. I don&#8217;t know a traveler who hasn&#8217;t had it bad but when you poop your pants while walking to the toilet you know you&#8217;re in trouble. I spent two days sicker than I&#8217;ve ever been in a wood box of a room throwing up into a plastic bag the size of my palm and periodically running to the bathroom. Lying alone on the floor in the fetal position wondering if it&#8217;d ever stop, completely fatigued, and with no one to help was not fun.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;As a traveler I&#8217;ve been pretty lucky and the good experiences far outweigh the bad. Hands down the best travel experience I had was spending a month traveling on the Trans-Siberian through China, Mongolia, Russia, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>To be honest, it wasn&#8217;t just the places that made this experience the best, it was the journey and the company. While working in S.Korea I met two travelers who decided to take the leap of faith and do the trip. A couple days before the end of our work contract I made the commitment too, changed my return flight, and joined up with them two months later.</p>
<p>The combination of friendship, adventure, and travel made this one of the best travel experiences I could ever have. And to be honest, I don&#8217;t think something like that will ever happen again. We were all at the right place at the right time. Oh, and we even threw in a road trip to the Arctic Circle in Finland to see Santa. It&#8217;s experiences like this that make travelling the best thing in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ian-of-borderless-travels-in-karakorum-mongolia" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8461368808_762fdaf626_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you&#8217;ve got out of travelling?</span></strong><br />
&#8220;I think for me the biggest realization I&#8217;ve got out of traveling is that people and places are more similar than we think. I&#8217;ve also learned the importance of family and how in this world, if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be part of one, its the most important thing in life. To be honest, people can travel anywhere in the world if they really want to but love, family, and friends are special things that you can&#8217;t fly to or buy. No matter where I&#8217;ve been I always seem find that the happiest people are the ones who are part of a community.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not stranger to this one and for me the biggest obstacle to traveling is how my relatives sometimes perceive my lifestyle choices. Its hard to overcome societal and family expectations of marriage, careers, children and a sedentary life. Traveling is a relatively new phenomena, although I like to compare it to being an early explorer. Even if we&#8217;re discovering places others have been to its new to us, our family, friends, and for me, some of the Borderless Travels community.</p>
<p>What keeps me going is the optimism that people will be able to see and learn about the world they might not otherwise get to know. Through my stories, adventures, and perspectives I hope the challenge the typical view of success while teaching those around me that its okay live differently and do what you want to not what others want you to.</p>
<p>I also love learning. From the people I meet and places I visit, to the food I eat and the experiences I live, I&#8217;m always learning. To be able to see the world from someone else&#8217;s perspective means that we can understand the people and places around us better and through that become better people. You never know what&#8217;s going to be behind the next door and taking that risk of opening it and stepping through might open many more&#8230;so why not?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm, this is a tough one. I guess I&#8217;d pick Mark Jenkins, a National Geographic writer and world traveler. I think I&#8217;d be able to learn a lot from him and hearing about his experiences. Before I started blogging I sent him an email after reading an amazing article about the tea porters of Nepal. He responded immediately with an outline of how to begin travel writing in a list of maxims. Things have certainly changed since he first started writing but his experience is something I think I could learn from.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="ian-of-borderless-travels-with-friends-johnny-onestep4ward-and-steevo-the-shameless-traveller-on-the-trans-siberian" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8376/8460271627_f151104cbe_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favorite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s funny, I&#8217;m sure most people have a far off place they can think of, but after years of travel and working abroad my favorite place on this planet is Ontario, Canada; home. I haven&#8217;t found a place I&#8217;d rather spend long periods of time than at home and for me livability is the most important factor when I think about my favorite place. It&#8217;s here in Canada where I have family, friends, nature, and the opportunity to try anything and learn everything. Where else in the world can you learn how to play hockey at the age of 24, spend lazy summer days at the cottage, or have a few drinks with some good friends?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a travel blogger and I love to travel but for me, spending time at home is just as important and makes Canada my favorite place on the planet!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveler?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the best place for a newbie traveler is to go somewhere they&#8217;ve always wanted to go. No matter where someone travels things are going to be different, and sure some countries are more comfortable/familiar than others, but experiencing the unknown is what makes for life changing experiences, good stories, and real travel.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong><br />
&#8220;While working in Switzerland I won a best Shakira look alike contest, full costume and all <img src='http://flipnomad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  Can you see the resemblance&#8230;Lol!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think of myself as a funny and friendly person who&#8217;s goal in life is to never be boring and always ready to try/learn new things.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are no direct bus from <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kaza/" target="_blank">Kaza</a> to <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/leh/" target="_blank">Leh</a>. We had an option to either go to Keylong and catch a connecting bus to Leh or go to Manali and take a shared taxi or bus to <strong>Leh</strong>.</p>
<p>From Kaza there were no bus yet to Manali when we were there (June 2012). We were told that the bus would probably start resuming it&#8217;s services by the end of the month. The reason behind it was that the roads are in bad condition due to snow and ice. The road was said to be only open during summer (June and July). The only option that time was the shared taxi from Kaza to Manali which cost 800 Rupees per head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7125/7560771292_5a0f13788a_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Kaza</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re initially thinking of just going to Keylong and just catch a bus to Leh but we&#8217;re told that there might be a chance that most buses that will pass thru Keylong might be full already since it&#8217;s the peak season. But we opted to take the shared taxi instead to Manali to make sure that we can get a seat up to Leh.</p>
<p><strong>The trip to Manali from Kaza</strong> was said to be just 10 hours but we travelled for about 13 hours including the stops. The shared taxi left Kaza at around 6:30AM and we arrived at Manali Bus Station at around 7PM.</p>
<p><a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/how-from-kaza-leh/" target="_blank">The road to Manali from Kaza is spectacular</a> and really mind blowingly beautiful. Here are some pictures of the journey:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7121/7572841178_61e72153e0_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Our vehicle broke down after two hours</span></p>

We saw this while waiting for the jeep to get fixed. They&#8217;re on the nearby hills. I&#8217;m not sure if these are the Himalayan Tahrs or Ibexes but we felt very lucky to see these endangered and magnificent animals in the wild.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7572852846_46b29ac748_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Just a few kilometers from Rohtang Pass</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8429/7572893412_90bc102296_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Rohtang Pass: Where we got stuck in a traffic jam for a couple of hours due to the numerous tourist vehicles that blocked the road.</span></p>
<p>We arrived at Manali at 7PM and started looking for a shared taxi service to Leh. we booked our seats with one agency who offered it to us for 1900 Rupees per head. The departure time though was 1AM and we waited at the bus station until that time.</p>
<p>Due to fatigue and exhaustion I slept the entire night on the jeep. Luckily the have very comfortable seats, really worth every penny that we paid for.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of our journey from Manali to Leh:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7572889488_6ff04cb52b_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Not your usual bus stop <img src='http://flipnomad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7114/7572888158_86008cbf6a_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">One of the tires of our vehicles got punctured after more than 12 hours on the road</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7572886158_c30ec3a5ce_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">No roads in some areas, you just have to drive on the sandy landscape</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7572885084_900440b263_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Leh, finally after almost of two full days of travelling!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;"><strong>Here are some tips that I&#8217;d like to share if you&#8217;re gonna take a <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/how-from-kaza-leh/">trip from Kaza to Leh</a>:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Bring water and food. The journey is quite long and luckily there are stops where you could buy some food and water.</p>
<p>2. Don&#8217;t eat something that might upset your stomach. You don&#8217;t want to end up looking for toilet in the middle of nowhere. Bring an Imodium with you (just in case).</p>
<p>3. Don&#8217;t put your camera in your backpack. There are so many nice things to see along the way. You could ask the driver to stop (if you take the shared taxi) along the way so you could take nice pictures.</p>
<p>4. don&#8217;t sit at the back. It&#8217;s more comfortable sitting in front especially if you easily get dizzy in long road trips.</p>
<p>5. Wear warm clothing. It gets really really cold at night.</p>
<p>6. There&#8217;s a checkpoint before you enter Leh and you&#8217;ll be asked to register and show them your passport.</p>
<p>7.  Enjoy the trip!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Safe Travels!</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Backpacking Spirit is a travel blog and a travel resource website rolled into one. This website is created by Emma Spires who intend to help would be travelers plan, organize and make their dream trip come true. Backpacking Spirit definitely needs to be bookmarked as it contains so many helpful articles about travel gears, inspirational stories, insightful interviews and much more.</p>
<p>Emma is a long term backpacker who has traveled extensively around the world. Her first trip overseas happened when she was only 17 years old when she signed up to volunteer in Ghana. Learn more about Emma and visit her at <a href="http://www.backpacking-spirit.com" target="_blank">Backpacking Spirit</a>.</p>
<p>But before you leave this page, check out my short interview with Emma.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Emma Spires of Backpacking Spirit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8460158385_778dd1e7cb_o.jpg" width="514" height="386" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I discovered my passion for travelling from wanting to volunteer. I remember a volunteering company came in to do a presentation in my high school and discussed the various projects on offer; before I knew it, I was signing myself up to a project in Ghana and was at the airport, by myself, with my parents waving me off and thinking – oh shit, what am I doing….</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was some of the best few months of my life; a new culture, new people and new experiences. I was sold on a life of travel at 17 years old.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Life on the road is full of unexpected bumps. One such bump occurred when a group of friends and I were doing a road trip in Western Australia and we had a car crash; it was one of the scariest experiences of my life feeling the camper van veer uncontrollably off the road, knowing you can’t do anything about it, waiting for the impact. Miraculously, we only came out with cuts and bruises but walking out of that camper van I have never felt so thankful to be alive. We carried on our road trip despite what had happened and it made the experiences so much sweeter.</p>
<p>Ironically, the place the accident happened was called&#8230; Lucky Bay.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You know what? It would be impossible for me to list one, so I’m going to cheat and name a few:</p>
<p>• Walking with lions in South Africa (yes literally, and boy it was pretty scary!)<br />
• Finding my perfect piece of paradise in Zanzibar<br />
• Watching a glowing red sun set over emerald green grass in the Serengeti<br />
• Making friends with Massai tribesmen on the side of the road &amp; teaching them a card game, in Tanzania, when our car broke down…<br />
• Seeing San Pedro prison in La Paz, Bolivia with my own eyes after being infatuated with reading about Thomas McFadden’s time spent there in Marching Powder (a highly recommended book, by the way!)<br />
• Getting up at 6:00am on a clear, crisp morning in Moshi to see Mount Kilimanjaro<br />
• Bare back horse-riding along the beach in Bali<br />
• Climbing to the top of Wine Picchu, and overlooking the Machu Picchu&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Emma Spires of Backpacking Spirit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8460158297_9a720d5e65_o.jpg" width="514" height="489" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;How not travelling really is like only reading one page of a book – the world is so vast that by not seeing it you will have such a narrow depiction of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What keeps me going is my aim to see as many countries as I can in my lifetime, and knowing that I have to achieve this, at whatever cost. Failure is not an option!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I would choose the Dalai Lama – imagine all that philosophical advice and inspiration you would get!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="walking-with-lions-south-africa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8460158137_2b7ae326b9_o.jpg" width="511" height="341" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favorite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;As before, I am not sure that I could pick just one place…! Among my favorite places to travel is definitely Africa; of course there are some very popular African destinations but on the whole I have found it be much less “touristy” that other backpacking haunts such as how SE Asia has become. Therefore, it has this essence of authenticity, of wholeness and earthiness. They say Africa gets into your blood… well, it definitely got into mine!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for the newbie traveler?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To keep your plans as open as possible. I&#8217;ve traveled in many different ways – from one way tickets to the other side of the road, to structured flight itineraries, and from my experience, it’s much more enjoyable to travel from place to place as and when it pleases you. You never know how long or how short a time you will want in each place.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A funny memory is the time I worked on a farm in Australia, and we were spraying weed killer over a field. Four girls and I had to wear these huge, oversize costumes to protect our skin, they looked like space outfits; every time we caught a glimpse of each other we had to laugh!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I am a person who is chasing a life less ordinary; I whole heatedly reject routine and a “9-5” lifestyle. I am also a person who cannot seem to stay in one place for too long!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our fellow travellers in <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kibber/" target="_blank">Kibber</a> suggested that we trek from Kibber to Ki to get a glimpse of the gompa from above. When asked about the direction, they only said to follow the wooden electrical poles until we see a small stream where we need to climb up and we&#8217;ll see a small road. From there we would just continue walking until we see the golden stupa which marks the area where we could descend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like a simple route huh? Is the descent easy? I&#8217;m not really good in hiking and I&#8217;m terrified of heights,&#8221; I asked them. And they said it&#8217;s easy!</p>
<p>Ok, so I thought it&#8217;ll be something I&#8217;d be able to manage easily.</p>
<p>Me and a friend, two Aussie girls and a guy from Spain agreed to trek together right after breakfast.</p>
<p>We followed the road until the first stupa that marks the entrance to the village of <strong>Kibber </strong>and started climbing up &#8217;til we saw the wooden electrical poles that they&#8217;ve told us about.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve crossed small patches of farms along the way and continued walking until we came about a road fork. One is a long way towards the next batch of wooden electrical poles, the other is a curved pathway where a stream flows.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the small stream they&#8217;ve mentioned,&#8221; I thought.</p>
<p>We went where the stream was and climbed uphill and finally saw the small road that they&#8217;ve mentioned and a nice view of Kibber as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7567056292_e104b88ccf_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">A nice view of Kibber</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Road to Ki Gompa" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7567054684_a04f7c96f8_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">The small road towards the other villages above <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/trekking-from-kibber-gompa/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #006699;">Ki Gompa</span></a></span></p>
<p>After doing our rounds of taking pictures we continues walking to what seemed to be an endless road surrounded by barren lands, small patches of wild plants and mountains flowers and the snow capped mountains.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Road to Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8003/7567052640_e375800706_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7567068140_c27818667f_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>After almost three hours of walking, we finally got a glimpse of the golden stupa from our horizon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8425/7567058344_f8d78e4155_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>We peeked down on the nearest cliff that we saw to check if we could see <strong>Ki Gompa</strong> (and to check if we&#8217;re walking the right path as well).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8424/7567065848_48b953c35f_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Ki Gompa</span></p>
<p>And we saw it. We&#8217;re on the right path,&#8221; I thought.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">The Descent</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7567064254_004d89c416_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Cliffs everywhere!!!</span></p>
<p>I had only small difficulty climbing up since I have the option not to look down. But the descent&#8230; the descent is something I always dread especially in this kind of terrain.</p>
<p>The two Aussie girls and my friend made it looked so easy but me and the Spanish guy were both trembling. Both of us were very terrified of heights.</p>
<p>The trail was so slippery because of the small rocks, there&#8217;s nothing to hold on to and you see an almost 90 degrees drop on one side and a sloping sea of sand and rocks on the other. I felt that if I slipped just a foot, then it would be ok but if I slipped two feet then I&#8217;d probably end up dead or alive with broken bones.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point of going back anymore, we&#8217;re quite far from where we started the descent. The easiest way would just be to continue on. The other travellers that I was with were so kind that they always stop to check if I was doing alright. They continuously threw in some words of encouragement to keep me going.</p>
<p>At one point, I almost gave up and thought that I&#8217;ll just stay where I was and would just ask them to call a helicopter to pick me up once they&#8217;re in the gompa. I would probably bust whatever I have and just end the trip right there and then.</p>
<p>But then again, I thought that it would be something that I&#8217;ll look back and would probably ask myself what if I continued.</p>
<p>So I scrapped the helicopter idea and just continued on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Spiti Valley" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7567079238_657d5155c7_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>

<p>After almost an hour of slowly descending, we rested to take some pictures of the magnificent Ki Gompa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7567077910_15e3a06662_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Ki Gompa is said to be the largest Buddhist Monastery located at 4166M above sea level. It has been founded in the 11th century and still is a functioning monastery up to this date.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/7567076538_9f37fffcdd_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Although I was still trembling with fear, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel proud on what I have accomplished. with the help of some new found friends, I was able to face my fear and continued with the descent. It was such a mind-numbing, knee-shaking and back-breaking feat for me.</p>
<p>We arrived at the grounds of Ki Gompa at around 4PM and waited for the bus that took us back to Kibber.</p>
<p>There seems to be no other way to deal with fear but to face it. I&#8217;m just happy that I did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>True Nomads is one of the latest travel blogs that I&#8217;ve been following lately. It&#8217;s written by Justin and his friend Ron who have been traveling for some time now. Their blog is full of helpful travel tips about the destinations that they&#8217;ve been to. There are also some very entertaining travel stories that you wouldn&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>Justin is originally from Colorado and left everything behind to pursue his passion to see the world. Learn more about him and visit his blog at <a href="http://truenomads.com/about-us/justin/" target="_blank">True Nomads</a>.</p>
<p>But before you click away, check out my short interview with Justin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8461216290_cd79f91f79_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I was born with it. I was always fascinated and jealous of other people&#8217;s travel stories from crazy, unheard of places when I was young. That said, the passion was greatly intensified when my friend&#8217;s parents took me out of The States for the first time, to Costa Rica. I loved every minute of it. Even when It was raining and everyone else was pissed off, I was still just excited and happy to be there. I was planning the next trip on the flight home I think. I haven&#8217;t stopped since.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually been really lucky, my friends would even say notoriously so. Things always happen to people around me, like getting jumped in Dar es Salaam, robbed in Brazil, and what ever else, but never me. I knew one guy in Africa that got malaria 6 times in 18 months, despite constantly taking his malaria meds. I never got it once and never took as much as a vitamin C pill. He didn&#8217;t think it was too funny. Or been in uncomfortable situations though. I just wrote a post about a horrible mini-bus ride through Mozambique, where there were 30 people in the 11 passenger van.&#8221; That was no fun.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many I can&#8217;t count them all. One that stands out in my mind was NYE in Rio De Janeiro. It was the best fireworks display I&#8217;ve ever seen. We were on Copacobana beach with 2 million people and they were shooting the fireworks off of three barges, that were spread out off shore. It was a magical moment. After that David Guetta performed on a giant stage on the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8460115917_54faa2a118_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of traveling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the biggest thing I&#8217;ve realized is that, contrary to the typical American belief, travel can be a lifestyle and not just a once-a-year vacation. Once I figured that out, I started figuring out HOW to do it. then there was no stopping me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think in those terms anymore. I don&#8217;t see travel as a hobby or a short break or vacation from &#8220;real&#8221; life. I more see it as a life style, and when ever I go home, THAT&#8217;S a vacation from traveling. Keeping motivated is easy. All I have to do is stop traveling for a short time and my addiction kicks in and makes me go again.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe captain Cook or some famous sailor. I like pushing myself and trying new things, and I&#8217;ve never got to sail around the seas and find tiny islands and unknown fish and animals. That&#8217;s my dream. I love diving also, so maybe I would choose Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Ya he&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8461215870_5eac217a34_o.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favourite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hard one. People ask me all the time. I think it&#8217;s the experiences that make a place, because I&#8217;ve been places people hate and I loved and vise-versa. I can say this though, I tend to stick to the tropics. I love places where I can scuba dive, walk around in flip-flops, and be warm. If I was ever going to settle down somewhere and open a hostel or something, it would probably be in eastern Indonesia on a remote island where only hardcore travelers go. Those kind of places are my favorite.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveller?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. Bring toilet paper. In at least 3 out of 7 continents, I&#8217;d rather have toilet paper than extra clothes. In fact, this question could probably be linked to the bad experiences question.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In Cambodia me and this girl I had just met were forced to either take a later bus or to ride in the underneath luggage compartment. We chose the compartment. It was really close and cozy for 6 hours. We ended up getting to know one another and traveling another month through Vietnam together. It&#8217;s probably one of those experiences that&#8217;s more fun to talk about later, than to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8220;myself&#8221; is a constantly changing thing. I had a thirst for knowledge and adventure and exploring and the unknown, so I&#8217;m constantly changing. I think to evolve and improve you have to change things up a lot. There is no room to broaden your horizons within a bubble. I think travel is the best education there is, and I&#8217;m in the best classroom known to man. My main two passions are traveling and scuba diving. And luckily the two go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color: #006699;">&#8220;Me and my Guatemalan friend started our travel blog www.truenomads.com together, hoping that we could someday have it sustaining our addictions, (travel). I have been to 45 countries, and him 35, so we have tons of stories and advice. Right now we are backpacking Europe, and we met here in Tallinn, Estonia. This weekend we leave here to hitchhike around Europe and then end up in Dublin for St. Paddies day. From there, our goal is to get around the world with as little money as possible. (since we have none). It means we have to stop and work here and there, hitchhike, couchsurf, and do whatever it takes to get around. The website is our means to share our stories ad to prove you don&#8217;t have to be rich to travel the world.&#8221;-Justin Carmack</span></p>
