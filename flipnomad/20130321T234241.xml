				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are no direct bus from <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kaza/" target="_blank">Kaza</a> to <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/leh/" target="_blank">Leh</a>. We had an option to either go to Keylong and catch a connecting bus to Leh or go to Manali and take a shared taxi or bus to <strong>Leh</strong>.</p>
<p>From Kaza there were no bus yet to Manali when we were there (June 2012). We were told that the bus would probably start resuming it&#8217;s services by the end of the month. The reason behind it was that the roads are in bad condition due to snow and ice. The road was said to be only open during summer (June and July). The only option that time was the shared taxi from Kaza to Manali which cost 800 Rupees per head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7125/7560771292_5a0f13788a_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Kaza</span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re initially thinking of just going to Keylong and just catch a bus to Leh but we&#8217;re told that there might be a chance that most buses that will pass thru Keylong might be full already since it&#8217;s the peak season. But we opted to take the shared taxi instead to Manali to make sure that we can get a seat up to Leh.</p>
<p><strong>The trip to Manali from Kaza</strong> was said to be just 10 hours but we travelled for about 13 hours including the stops. The shared taxi left Kaza at around 6:30AM and we arrived at Manali Bus Station at around 7PM.</p>
<p><a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/how-from-kaza-leh/" target="_blank">The road to Manali from Kaza is spectacular</a> and really mind blowingly beautiful. Here are some pictures of the journey:</p>

We saw this while waiting for the jeep to get fixed. They&#8217;re on the nearby hills. I&#8217;m not sure if these are the Himalayan Tahrs or Ibexes but we felt very lucky to see these endangered and magnificent animals in the wild.</p>

<p>We arrived at Manali at 7PM and started looking for a shared taxi service to Leh. we booked our seats with one agency who offered it to us for 1900 Rupees per head. The departure time though was 1AM and we waited at the bus station until that time.</p>
<p>Due to fatigue and exhaustion I slept the entire night on the jeep. Luckily the have very comfortable seats, really worth every penny that we paid for.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of our journey from Manali to Leh:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7572889488_6ff04cb52b_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Not your usual bus stop <img src='http://flipnomad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kaza to Leh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7572885084_900440b263_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Leh, finally after almost of two full days of travelling!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;"><strong>Here are some tips that I&#8217;d like to share if you&#8217;re gonna take a <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/how-from-kaza-leh/">trip from Kaza to Leh</a>:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. Bring water and food. The journey is quite long and luckily there are stops where you could buy some food and water.</p>
<p>2. Don&#8217;t eat something that might upset your stomach. You don&#8217;t want to end up looking for toilet in the middle of nowhere. Bring an Imodium with you (just in case).</p>
<p>3. Don&#8217;t put your camera in your backpack. There are so many nice things to see along the way. You could ask the driver to stop (if you take the shared taxi) along the way so you could take nice pictures.</p>
<p>4. don&#8217;t sit at the back. It&#8217;s more comfortable sitting in front especially if you easily get dizzy in long road trips.</p>
<p>5. Wear warm clothing. It gets really really cold at night.</p>
<p>6. There&#8217;s a checkpoint before you enter Leh and you&#8217;ll be asked to register and show them your passport.</p>
<p>7.  Enjoy the trip!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Safe Travels!</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Backpacking Spirit is a travel blog and a travel resource website rolled into one. This website is created by Emma Spires who intend to help would be travelers plan, organize and make their dream trip come true. Backpacking Spirit definitely needs to be bookmarked as it contains so many helpful articles about travel gears, inspirational stories, insightful interviews and much more.</p>
<p>Emma is a long term backpacker who has traveled extensively around the world. Her first trip overseas happened when she was only 17 years old when she signed up to volunteer in Ghana. Learn more about Emma and visit her at <a href="http://www.backpacking-spirit.com" target="_blank">Backpacking Spirit</a>.</p>
<p>But before you leave this page, check out my short interview with Emma.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Emma Spires of Backpacking Spirit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8460158385_778dd1e7cb_o.jpg" width="514" height="386" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I discovered my passion for travelling from wanting to volunteer. I remember a volunteering company came in to do a presentation in my high school and discussed the various projects on offer; before I knew it, I was signing myself up to a project in Ghana and was at the airport, by myself, with my parents waving me off and thinking – oh shit, what am I doing….</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was some of the best few months of my life; a new culture, new people and new experiences. I was sold on a life of travel at 17 years old.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Life on the road is full of unexpected bumps. One such bump occurred when a group of friends and I were doing a road trip in Western Australia and we had a car crash; it was one of the scariest experiences of my life feeling the camper van veer uncontrollably off the road, knowing you can’t do anything about it, waiting for the impact. Miraculously, we only came out with cuts and bruises but walking out of that camper van I have never felt so thankful to be alive. We carried on our road trip despite what had happened and it made the experiences so much sweeter.</p>
<p>Ironically, the place the accident happened was called&#8230; Lucky Bay.”</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You know what? It would be impossible for me to list one, so I’m going to cheat and name a few:</p>
<p>• Walking with lions in South Africa (yes literally, and boy it was pretty scary!)<br />
• Finding my perfect piece of paradise in Zanzibar<br />
• Watching a glowing red sun set over emerald green grass in the Serengeti<br />
• Making friends with Massai tribesmen on the side of the road &amp; teaching them a card game, in Tanzania, when our car broke down…<br />
• Seeing San Pedro prison in La Paz, Bolivia with my own eyes after being infatuated with reading about Thomas McFadden’s time spent there in Marching Powder (a highly recommended book, by the way!)<br />
• Getting up at 6:00am on a clear, crisp morning in Moshi to see Mount Kilimanjaro<br />
• Bare back horse-riding along the beach in Bali<br />
• Climbing to the top of Wine Picchu, and overlooking the Machu Picchu&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Emma Spires of Backpacking Spirit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8233/8460158297_9a720d5e65_o.jpg" width="514" height="489" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;How not travelling really is like only reading one page of a book – the world is so vast that by not seeing it you will have such a narrow depiction of life.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What keeps me going is my aim to see as many countries as I can in my lifetime, and knowing that I have to achieve this, at whatever cost. Failure is not an option!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I would choose the Dalai Lama – imagine all that philosophical advice and inspiration you would get!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="walking-with-lions-south-africa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8460158137_2b7ae326b9_o.jpg" width="511" height="341" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favorite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;As before, I am not sure that I could pick just one place…! Among my favorite places to travel is definitely Africa; of course there are some very popular African destinations but on the whole I have found it be much less “touristy” that other backpacking haunts such as how SE Asia has become. Therefore, it has this essence of authenticity, of wholeness and earthiness. They say Africa gets into your blood… well, it definitely got into mine!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for the newbie traveler?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;To keep your plans as open as possible. I&#8217;ve traveled in many different ways – from one way tickets to the other side of the road, to structured flight itineraries, and from my experience, it’s much more enjoyable to travel from place to place as and when it pleases you. You never know how long or how short a time you will want in each place.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;A funny memory is the time I worked on a farm in Australia, and we were spraying weed killer over a field. Four girls and I had to wear these huge, oversize costumes to protect our skin, they looked like space outfits; every time we caught a glimpse of each other we had to laugh!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I am a person who is chasing a life less ordinary; I whole heatedly reject routine and a “9-5” lifestyle. I am also a person who cannot seem to stay in one place for too long!&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our fellow travellers in <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kibber/" target="_blank">Kibber</a> suggested that we trek from Kibber to Ki to get a glimpse of the gompa from above. When asked about the direction, they only said to follow the wooden electrical poles until we see a small stream where we need to climb up and we&#8217;ll see a small road. From there we would just continue walking until we see the golden stupa which marks the area where we could descend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like a simple route huh? Is the descent easy? I&#8217;m not really good in hiking and I&#8217;m terrified of heights,&#8221; I asked them. And they said it&#8217;s easy!</p>
<p>Ok, so I thought it&#8217;ll be something I&#8217;d be able to manage easily.</p>
<p>Me and a friend, two Aussie girls and a guy from Spain agreed to trek together right after breakfast.</p>
<p>We followed the road until the first stupa that marks the entrance to the village of <strong>Kibber </strong>and started climbing up &#8217;til we saw the wooden electrical poles that they&#8217;ve told us about.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve crossed small patches of farms along the way and continued walking until we came about a road fork. One is a long way towards the next batch of wooden electrical poles, the other is a curved pathway where a stream flows.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the small stream they&#8217;ve mentioned,&#8221; I thought.</p>
<p>We went where the stream was and climbed uphill and finally saw the small road that they&#8217;ve mentioned and a nice view of Kibber as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7567056292_e104b88ccf_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">A nice view of Kibber</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Road to Ki Gompa" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7567054684_a04f7c96f8_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">The small road towards the other villages above <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/trekking-from-kibber-gompa/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #006699;">Ki Gompa</span></a></span></p>
<p>After doing our rounds of taking pictures we continues walking to what seemed to be an endless road surrounded by barren lands, small patches of wild plants and mountains flowers and the snow capped mountains.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Road to Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8003/7567052640_e375800706_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7567068140_c27818667f_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>After almost three hours of walking, we finally got a glimpse of the golden stupa from our horizon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8425/7567058344_f8d78e4155_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>We peeked down on the nearest cliff that we saw to check if we could see <strong>Ki Gompa</strong> (and to check if we&#8217;re walking the right path as well).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8424/7567065848_48b953c35f_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Ki Gompa</span></p>
<p>And we saw it. We&#8217;re on the right path,&#8221; I thought.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">The Descent</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8002/7567064254_004d89c416_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Cliffs everywhere!!!</span></p>
<p>I had only small difficulty climbing up since I have the option not to look down. But the descent&#8230; the descent is something I always dread especially in this kind of terrain.</p>
<p>The two Aussie girls and my friend made it looked so easy but me and the Spanish guy were both trembling. Both of us were very terrified of heights.</p>
<p>The trail was so slippery because of the small rocks, there&#8217;s nothing to hold on to and you see an almost 90 degrees drop on one side and a sloping sea of sand and rocks on the other. I felt that if I slipped just a foot, then it would be ok but if I slipped two feet then I&#8217;d probably end up dead or alive with broken bones.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point of going back anymore, we&#8217;re quite far from where we started the descent. The easiest way would just be to continue on. The other travellers that I was with were so kind that they always stop to check if I was doing alright. They continuously threw in some words of encouragement to keep me going.</p>
<p>At one point, I almost gave up and thought that I&#8217;ll just stay where I was and would just ask them to call a helicopter to pick me up once they&#8217;re in the gompa. I would probably bust whatever I have and just end the trip right there and then.</p>
<p>But then again, I thought that it would be something that I&#8217;ll look back and would probably ask myself what if I continued.</p>
<p>So I scrapped the helicopter idea and just continued on.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Spiti Valley" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8014/7567079238_657d5155c7_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Spiti Valley" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8006/7567062166_450be9504c_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>After almost an hour of slowly descending, we rested to take some pictures of the magnificent Ki Gompa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7567077910_15e3a06662_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Ki Gompa is said to be the largest Buddhist Monastery located at 4166M above sea level. It has been founded in the 11th century and still is a functioning monastery up to this date.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Ki Gompa" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/7567076538_9f37fffcdd_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Although I was still trembling with fear, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel proud on what I have accomplished. with the help of some new found friends, I was able to face my fear and continued with the descent. It was such a mind-numbing, knee-shaking and back-breaking feat for me.</p>
<p>We arrived at the grounds of Ki Gompa at around 4PM and waited for the bus that took us back to Kibber.</p>
<p>There seems to be no other way to deal with fear but to face it. I&#8217;m just happy that I did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>True Nomads is one of the latest travel blogs that I&#8217;ve been following lately. It&#8217;s written by Justin and his friend Ron who have been traveling for some time now. Their blog is full of helpful travel tips about the destinations that they&#8217;ve been to. There are also some very entertaining travel stories that you wouldn&#8217;t want to miss.</p>
<p>Justin is originally from Colorado and left everything behind to pursue his passion to see the world. Learn more about him and visit his blog at <a href="http://truenomads.com/about-us/justin/" target="_blank">True Nomads</a>.</p>
<p>But before you click away, check out my short interview with Justin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8461216290_cd79f91f79_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I was born with it. I was always fascinated and jealous of other people&#8217;s travel stories from crazy, unheard of places when I was young. That said, the passion was greatly intensified when my friend&#8217;s parents took me out of The States for the first time, to Costa Rica. I loved every minute of it. Even when It was raining and everyone else was pissed off, I was still just excited and happy to be there. I was planning the next trip on the flight home I think. I haven&#8217;t stopped since.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually been really lucky, my friends would even say notoriously so. Things always happen to people around me, like getting jumped in Dar es Salaam, robbed in Brazil, and what ever else, but never me. I knew one guy in Africa that got malaria 6 times in 18 months, despite constantly taking his malaria meds. I never got it once and never took as much as a vitamin C pill. He didn&#8217;t think it was too funny. Or been in uncomfortable situations though. I just wrote a post about a horrible mini-bus ride through Mozambique, where there were 30 people in the 11 passenger van.&#8221; That was no fun.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many I can&#8217;t count them all. One that stands out in my mind was NYE in Rio De Janeiro. It was the best fireworks display I&#8217;ve ever seen. We were on Copacobana beach with 2 million people and they were shooting the fireworks off of three barges, that were spread out off shore. It was a magical moment. After that David Guetta performed on a giant stage on the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8231/8460115917_54faa2a118_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of traveling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the biggest thing I&#8217;ve realized is that, contrary to the typical American belief, travel can be a lifestyle and not just a once-a-year vacation. Once I figured that out, I started figuring out HOW to do it. then there was no stopping me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think in those terms anymore. I don&#8217;t see travel as a hobby or a short break or vacation from &#8220;real&#8221; life. I more see it as a life style, and when ever I go home, THAT&#8217;S a vacation from traveling. Keeping motivated is easy. All I have to do is stop traveling for a short time and my addiction kicks in and makes me go again.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe captain Cook or some famous sailor. I like pushing myself and trying new things, and I&#8217;ve never got to sail around the seas and find tiny islands and unknown fish and animals. That&#8217;s my dream. I love diving also, so maybe I would choose Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Ya he&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Justin Carmack of True Nomads" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8461215870_5eac217a34_o.jpg" width="300" height="224" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favourite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a hard one. People ask me all the time. I think it&#8217;s the experiences that make a place, because I&#8217;ve been places people hate and I loved and vise-versa. I can say this though, I tend to stick to the tropics. I love places where I can scuba dive, walk around in flip-flops, and be warm. If I was ever going to settle down somewhere and open a hostel or something, it would probably be in eastern Indonesia on a remote island where only hardcore travelers go. Those kind of places are my favorite.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveller?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. Bring toilet paper. In at least 3 out of 7 continents, I&#8217;d rather have toilet paper than extra clothes. In fact, this question could probably be linked to the bad experiences question.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In Cambodia me and this girl I had just met were forced to either take a later bus or to ride in the underneath luggage compartment. We chose the compartment. It was really close and cozy for 6 hours. We ended up getting to know one another and traveling another month through Vietnam together. It&#8217;s probably one of those experiences that&#8217;s more fun to talk about later, than to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think &#8220;myself&#8221; is a constantly changing thing. I had a thirst for knowledge and adventure and exploring and the unknown, so I&#8217;m constantly changing. I think to evolve and improve you have to change things up a lot. There is no room to broaden your horizons within a bubble. I think travel is the best education there is, and I&#8217;m in the best classroom known to man. My main two passions are traveling and scuba diving. And luckily the two go hand in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color: #006699;">&#8220;Me and my Guatemalan friend started our travel blog www.truenomads.com together, hoping that we could someday have it sustaining our addictions, (travel). I have been to 45 countries, and him 35, so we have tons of stories and advice. Right now we are backpacking Europe, and we met here in Tallinn, Estonia. This weekend we leave here to hitchhike around Europe and then end up in Dublin for St. Paddies day. From there, our goal is to get around the world with as little money as possible. (since we have none). It means we have to stop and work here and there, hitchhike, couchsurf, and do whatever it takes to get around. The website is our means to share our stories ad to prove you don&#8217;t have to be rich to travel the world.&#8221;-Justin Carmack</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We woke up one morning and decided to hike the nearby hills to see a better view of the surrounding snow-capped mountains. We skipped breakfast thinking that it will just be a couple of hours from where we were staying. Armed with our cameras and a bottle of drinking water, we started climbing up the hills.</p>
<p><a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kibber/" target="_blank">Kibber</a> is located at an elevation of 4270M above sea level. It&#8217;s a bit cold even if the sun was shining brightly and it&#8217;s quite difficult to breathe. There were only a few trees that manage to survive here maybe because of it&#8217;s semi-arid almost desert like landscape.</p>
<p>Less than half an hour of continuously climbing uphill, me and my friend were already panting and decided to stop for a rest before we continued on. There were a few trails used by locals which we followed but in some areas there were no trails to follow. So we just have decided to walk whichever direction we like.</p>
<p>Our main aim was to get to the peak of the hill to get a good glimpse of the snow-capped mountains. We finally got to where we wanted to go after a couple of hours of walking.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7566844808_bc8bc7a3f5_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Gorgeous snow-capped mountains surrounding Kibber</span></p>
<p>After spending a couple of minutes marvelling at the beauty of the mountains, we decided to explore other areas. At this time, our stomach started feeling the hunger. The water left in our canister was probably just good for four more sips. We have decided to slow down to minimize the energy that we&#8217;re burning thinking that it will lessen the hunger that we&#8217;re feeling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8010/7566848816_9dba0fe85e_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><span style="color: #006699;">Sometimes there are just no roads to follow</span></p>
<p>After an hour more of walking to this unfamiliar land, we spotted an old man with three children a few hundred meters away from us. They seemed to be cooking something as we saw smoke coming from where they were.</p>
<p>The thought of asking for food and water crossed my mind but have decided to ignore it. We passed by them and they greeted us. As we were about to take another step away from where they were, the old man called us.</p>
<p>Not really understanding the local language, we still came and greeted them again. This time the old man offered us some tea. Shaking in hunger, I ignored my shyness and accepted the steaming cup of tea.</p>
<p>The cup of tea quenched my thirst and at the same time gave some sort of relief from the hunger that I was feeling. The old man offered another cup and I accepted it again.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7257/7566844060_ed4cb46ba4_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>While drinking our chai, the old man in his dialect tried to communicate with us. Not understanding what he was saying, we just introduced ourselves which I wasn&#8217;t really sure if he also understood us.</p>
<p>We bid goodbye after almost half an hour spent with them and offered payment for the tea that we drank. To our disbelief, the old man refused to accept our payment and just made a gesture of bowing as we walk away.</p>
<p>I was deeply touched by the act of kindness as I was walking a few steps away from them. At the back of my head I was thinking of giving something back. I hurriedly ran back and offered my scarf instead since I knew that they&#8217;re living in a very cold place, it might be something that he or one of his grandchildren might find useful.</p>
<p>I wrapped the scarf around one of his grandchildren and said thanks to him again and I went on my way back to the village where we were staying.</p>
<p>As I was walking, I just could not wrap my head around the thought that sometimes, people who have almost nothing are the most generous people in this world. I uttered a silent prayer and hope that the universe will conspire to give him and his grandchildren a better life.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Kibber" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7271/7566849752_1ea730f43f_z.jpg" width="600" height="440" /> <strong><span style="color: #006699;">Thank you very much!</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Bugno is the blogger behind Bohemian Traveler and has traveled extensively to a lot of countries for 15 years. You can find a lot of helpful insight and travel tips about various destinations in his blog. One of the series that I really like in his blog is his US Roadtrip last 2012 where they covered 13 states in 39 days.</p>
<p>Learn more about Stephen and join him in his adventures at <a href="http://bohemiantraveler.com" target="_blank">Bohemian Traveler</a>.</p>
<p>But before you leave this page, check out my short interview with Stephen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Stephen at Komodo National Park" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8065/8203328996_2896ab87a9_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t remember a time when I wasn&#8217;t passionate about traveling. Even as young nine years old I was sitting down with my parents helping them plan family vacation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you’ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I’m a believer in spontaneity on the road and I hardly ever book a room in advance. One time that it is wise to book accommodation in advance is when you are arriving by plane to a foreign city. I once arrived at Delhi airport at 11PM without a guidebook or reservation. Stupid move on my part. Looking back it seems scarier than it was at the time. I was naive then and am thankful nothing really bad happened.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had so many amazing travel experiences over the years that it is hard to choose one. I guess I will focus on the way people have been so hospitable and welcoming to me in many of the places that I travel. One of the most meaningful experiences was when a stranger on the bus in Syria invited me to his home for tea (which turned out to be a big meal) to talk and meet his family.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you&#8217;ve got out of travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think the biggest realization I&#8217;ve gotten out of traveling is that there is more good than evil out in the world. If you sit at home and watch the evening news every night you just here about all the doom and gloom out there. There are so many amazing things out there to experiences and so many remarkable people to meet. I think traveling has also taught me about hospitality, graciousness, and humility.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Stephen eating poutine in Quebec City" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7025/6408638213_41edbdd322_z.jpg" width="600" height="440" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t consider traveling a leisure activity. For me it is a pleasure, a passion, and a profession. Occasionally, it is important to treat it like a leisure activity so I can recharge my batteries. What keeps me going? The same thing has always driven my urge to travel: curiosity about the world. I have to see and experience things for myself. And that is how I learn about the world.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Dead or alive? I would travel with Hermann Hesse. He was a great traveler. I love how he explores eastern philosophies and religions and the deep complexities of the characters in his novels.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favourite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Another really difficult question because there are so many incredible places on our planet. If I had to choose one, I would say Cape Saint Vincent near Sagres, Portugal, in the Algarve. There is something magical about those cliffs and the rough sea crashing up against them and knowing you are at the furthest reaches of the European continent.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Yuanyang Rice Terraces around Xinjie China Stephen" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/6879247587_cb064979f9_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveller?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t be afraid to get out there and travel. Do some research at home, but you’ll learn a lot while you’re on the road. Don’t be afraid to try new things, but also know who you are. Also, don’t plan too much. Allow for spontaneity to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I was on an overnight train in a remote part of China and the only westerner on board. Into our train carriage comes some traveling salesman trying to sell toothbrushes. He must have gone on and on for 10 minutes about how fantastic his toothbrushes were. At some point I had enough and I stood up and pretended to sell an imaginary product in English. It was really bizarre and no one even knew what to think of me.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I’m curious about the people and places around the world and passionate about learning about them.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Stephen Bugno of Bohemian Traveler" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8531/8461171810_6aa0ec8193_z.jpg" width="600" height="337" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;">&#8220;My blog, <a href="http://www.bohemiantraveler.com" target="_blank">Bohemian Traveler</a> is about the places I go and my philosophy about traveling in general. My goal is to inspire people to travel through my writing and photography and provide people with deeper insight to those places. I also publish an online travel magazine where I focus more on off-the-beaten-track destinations and low-budget travel, giving readers the practical information needed for similar experiences.

<p>This would probably be one of the most recognizable Buddhist symbol and can be found at Swayambunath in Kathmandu Valley. You could also see other pair of eyes at the four sides of the stupa which represent Wisdom and Compassion. Swayambunath is one of the most visited places in <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/kathmandu/" target="_blank">Kathmandu</a> so expect lots of tourists when you go there. And beware of the monkeys as well, though they don&#8217;t attack people, sometimes they go very near and ask for food.</p>
