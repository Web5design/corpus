				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sabrina is the author and the blogger behind one of the newest blogs that I&#8217;ve been reading lately, <span style="color: #008080;">JustOneWayTicket.com.</span> She writes about a lot of helpful insights about the places that she visits. Sab&#8217;s writing make you easily relate to her as it&#8217;s very conversational and very engaging.</p>
<p>Sab is currently on another long trip this year. She previously traveled for more than a year last 2008 and went back to Germany for a bit last 2010 to work. She left again last 2011 and has been traveling since then. Get to know more about sabrina and follow her adventures at <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com" target="_blank">JustOneWayTicket.com</a>.</p>
<p>But before you leave this page, check out my short interview with Sabrina.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8647698507_ba297044d3_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" alt="Meet the Nomads - Sabrina Iovino of Just One Way Ticket"></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;When I was 12 I got a postcard from a friend who went to the Maldives. I was hooked, there were obviously better looking places in the world than Germany and I couldn&#8217;t wait to explore them. In 2007 I discovered Couchsurfing and I was amazed, suddenly traveling for a budget seemed to be so easy. So a year later <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com/2013/01/13/8-steps-to-freedom-how-i-quit-my-job-and-traveled-around-the-world/" target="_blank">I bought a one way ticket to Hong Kong and traveled around the world for 14 months</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and the Maldives? They were also a part of it. Hell, the most expensive part&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you’ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Taking the cheapest local bus from Cancun to San Christobal (Mexico). I was sitting in the back of the bus, squeezed between 5 Mexican ladies who had all babies on their laps and were breastfeeding them half of the trip. The bus ride took 24 hours and in the end I was full of vomit, breast milk and other things I don&#8217;t wanna define&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you’ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Beside skydiving in Mexico, <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com/2012/12/05/why-you-should-travel-philippines" target="_blank">swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines</a> and grilling Marshmallows over lava on a volcano in Guatemala, I would like to say the best travel experiences are the moments where you hang out with locals, experience hospitality from strangers, get inspired by their culture and being thankful to be part of that precious moment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Sabrina Iovino of Just One Way Ticket" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8560707047_cc55792d89_z.jpg" width="600" height="480" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;That you don&#8217;t need many things in life to be happy. If you have nothing, you have nothing to carry and even better, you have nothing to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What else could I do instead of traveling? Having a full time job, getting a mortgage for a house and looking towards to a decade full of debts? No thanks, that sounds a lot more tiring.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Someone who is funny, wise and handsome. Therefore a mix of Steve Carell, Paulo Coelho and this Spanish Model Jon Kortajarena would be great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Sabrina Iovino of Just One Way Ticket" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8561814220_47a0a94c1b_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favourite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I have too many, but if I can chose three, I&#8217;d say <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com/2012/12/05/why-you-should-travel-philippines/" target="_blank">Boracay</a> for the beaches and the parties, <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com/2013/02/19/tokyo-9-facts/" target="_blank">Tokyo</a> for the<br />
food and the fashion and Istanbul, because I&#8217;m stuck here since last summer (which means obviously, I really love it!)&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveller?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t plan too much, don&#8217;t drink too much and don&#8217;t have unprotected sex.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In India I was trying to use one of the lying cows on the beach as a back rest. That was not a good idea. In Bangkok <a href="http://www.justonewayticket.com/2012/12/13/exploration-of-an-abandoned-skyscraper-in-bangkok-the-sathorn-unique-building/" target="_blank">I climbed on top of an abandoned 50 floor skyscraper</a>. That was actually more insane than silly. Not recommended.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How do you keep yourself safe on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I trust my instincts. I mostly have a feeling when a situation turns into a bad one and then it&#8217;s time to remove myself as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;My mum would say I&#8217;m stubborn and cheeky and my dad would probably say I&#8217;m good in saving money and accounting. However, mostly I&#8217;m happy with myself, I love what I&#8217;m doing and I try to appreciate all the things that has happened to me. I&#8217;m a lucky girl. Traveling and seeing new places keeps me going. I just wish sometimes I would have started traveling a few years earlier. Time is running so fast. Life is too short and too precious to waste it with things we don&#8217;t love.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Sabrina Iovino of Just One Way Ticket" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8242/8561813974_35675e255c_z.jpg" width="600" height="339" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a travel blog. Yes, another travel blog, because there aren&#8217;t enough yet. Not very useful as a guide though, it&#8217;s more like a collection of photos and stories of my escapades. Please become a fan <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JustOneWayTicket" target="_blank">here</a>.&#8221; &#8211; Sabrina</span></p>

<p>I saw this humongous Buddha statue at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)" target="_blank">Golden Triangle</a>. Golden Triangle is infamous for being one of the hot spots for drug trade in Southeast Asia and when I went there I was thinking that it&#8217;s an uber-dangerous place to go to. I was surprised to see a park when I got there and hoards of tourists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are various trips that can be organized from <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/leh/" target="_blank">Leh</a> including some interesting places near some (semi)restricted area. One of those places that caught my interest is <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/04/overnight-trip-nubra-valley/">Nubra Valley</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nubra Valley</strong> transport packages cost vary depending on the kind of vehicle that you will use and the number of people that you can share the cost with. When we availed of a transport package (June 2012), rental cost of a Toyota Innova or Mahindra Xylo cost 8400 Rupees and you could go to three villages (Hunder, Diskit and Summor).</p>
<p>Most agencies are following the same standard rates for all the tourist packages that they&#8217;re offering. Aside from the transport, we also asked the same agency to process the permit for the said area. It cost us 450 Rupees each (inc their service charge).</p>
<p>Our trip to Nubra though was postponed twice due to road blocks. If it rains in <strong>Leh</strong>, the roads near Khardung La experiences heavy snow fall and some parts of the road were said to have been blocked by snow. On our third day of waiting for the trip to materialize, we finally got the go signal to push thru with the trip.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #006699;">View of Leh from above</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Leh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/7580725958_df1708edd8_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>I was just staring at the window the whole time of the ascent of our vehicles and spotted a few Himalayan partridges along the way. We stopped at one point where our driver presented our permits</p>
<p>Here are some pictures en route Khardung La (the highest motorable pass in the world):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="En Route to Khardung La" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/7580722674_83995099ab_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="En Route to Khardung La" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/7580718200_2d031a1dab_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="En Route to Khardung La" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8161/7580741718_5d5b40023c_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Traffic Jam in the mountains <img src='http://flipnomad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Khardung La" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8009/7580737240_b845dc3e13_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Khardung La at 5602M</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Frozen Shrine" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7270/7580735088_f5e5864194_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">A religious shrine wrapped in snow and ice</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="En Route to Khardung La" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8432/7580742910_91a828dccd_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /> <span style="color: #006699;">Icy Road</span></p>
<p>The whole trip from Leh to under took us around 4-5 hours including some stops for food and tooilet breaks and going through the traffic jam in Khardung La.</p>
<p>The weather in Hunder was sunny but a still bit cold. We looked for a cheap guesthouse where we could spend the night and found the Himalayan Guesthouse which cost 800 Rupee for a triple room with en suite bathroom.</p>
<p>We were a bit groggy and cranky when we arrived maybe because of the changing weather and the altitude as well. Despite of our mild &#8220;illness&#8221; we still proceeded to the sand dunes to see the Bactrian Camels (camels with two humps). Two of the locals that we&#8217;re travelling with opted to do a camel safari for an hour. I was initially thinking of doing the same but after realizing that it&#8217;s not really the &#8220;safari&#8221; that I have in mind but just a stroll along the sand dunes, I just opted out.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of Hunder village and the sand dunes:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Nubra Valley" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7580757220_760d8b2420_z.jpg" width="600" height="400" /><br />
<span style="color: #006699;">Gorgeous view, isn&#8217;t it!</span></p>

<p>This was the only activity we did on that day and we spent the night chatting about our views of <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/india/" target="_blank">India</a> and the <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/philippines/" target="_blank">Philippines</a>. It was interesting to realized that despite the many obvious differences that these two countries have, they also have a lot of similarities. It&#8217;s often nice to travel with locals as you get to know a lot about their home country. We spent almost four or five hours sharing a variety of stories and called it a night afterwards.</p>
<p>The following morning we visited the nearby monastery in Nubra Valley and headed back to Leh. Our road trip back to Leh was very interesting as we saw a lot of Himalayan Marmots along the way. Himalayan marmots looks like a large ground squirrel (are they squirrels?) about the size of a domestic cat often fond in the valleys of Ladakh, Bhutan and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of our trip back to Leh:</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t miss Nubra Valley when you visit Leh <img src='http://flipnomad.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I hate to be preachy but just a reminder, <strong>Nubra Valley</strong> has a fragile environment and I&#8217;d like to ask you to throw your trash in the trash bin. Sadly, I saw a lot of tourists throwing their garbage everywhere.</p>
<p><span style="color: #006699;"><strong>Safe Travels!</strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alana left her home in 2011 to pursue traveling and experience the diverse cultures and beauty that this world offers while she&#8217;s still young. She&#8217;s currently in Chiang Mai and have been living there for quite some time now. Aside from writing the usual stuff about destinations, foods, cultural events and other travel related topics, Alana shares a lot of her personal insights, reflections and her personal thoughts that a lot of us readers will definitely enjoy reading.</p>
<p>Get to know more about Alana and follow her journey at <a href="http://www.thepaperplanesblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Paper Planes Blog</a>.</p>
<p>But before you click away, check out my short interview with Alana.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Alana Morgan of The Paper Planes Blog" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8491495821_127df55d99_z.jpg" width="564" height="564" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been interested in different places, people, culture and languages. Growing up, we didn&#8217;t live near any extended family and made frequent trips around the U.S. – I was just two weeks old the first time I was on a plane.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily, I haven’t had any major problems. Though there was one really awful night in the desert in Rajasthan, India when my traveling partner got violently ill for hours. We were sleeping outside on the ground, in the middle of nowhere with stray dogs circling us, and I thought it would never end.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you’ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;In 2011 I made the big move from the U.S. to Thailand and I’m still here – it’s an ongoing adventure. The best moments are when I’m in an intriguing place, eating something exotic and delicious, with people who I find fascinating. Fortunately, when you travel this scenario is pretty common.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Alana Morgan of The Paper Planes Blog" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8492594882_09239171c6_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;"> What’s the biggest realization that you’ve got out of travelling?</span></strong><br />
&#8220;There are a million different ways to do things. What you think, what you do, where you live, what you hold important to you, what you realize you can live without…there’s no right or wrong way to do things.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It is tiring, but usually the good far outweighs the bad. You definitely have to make trade-offs to travel, especially if it’s long term, but the thrill you get after landing in a new place, or making a connection with someone you would have never met at home, or just seeing how incredibly big and wonderful and confusing the world is makes it worth it. I do, or see, or learn something everyday that’s different than home, and while sometimes it’s frustrating, it’s ultimately what keeps me going.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh I’m never good at these types of questions…William and Kate? I think it would be interesting to travel with someone with such a high profile and see how they experienced a new place in such a structured way – completely opposite from how I’m used to traveling.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Alana Morgan of The Paper Planes Blog" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8491495209_6b3b2e32be_z.jpg" width="600" height="457" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favourite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere where I feel completely content in that moment – I can’t pick just one! Thailand would definitely be up there though. I’m completely hooked.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveler?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Be patient and relax. It’s easy to get worked up when you’re in a new place, figuring out where you’re staying the night and trying to communicate with people who may not speak the same language as you. Usually if you stay calm everything works out and you save yourself from making a situation more difficult or unpleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found myself in many random situations that just happened by chance – like being an extra in a Chinese movie, dressing up in traditional wear for a high school’s sports day and being caught in the middle of the nation-wide three-day water fight during Songkran, the Thai New Year.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How do you keep yourself safe on your travels?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I have a couple little safety habits, like keeping a lock and chain with me to secure my bags, but mainly I just try to stay aware of my surroundings and keep myself in situations where I feel comfortable and secure.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, it depends on the day.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Awaken by the heat and humidity of Southeast Asian summer at 4AM, I went out of my room and got surrounded by the calming chants of the monks at the Buddhist temple near my temporary residence. The air was surprisingly colder outside compare to what I just suffered from inside the room. As my brain started to scramble at bad thoughts, complaints and things that I hate and frequently get anxious about, a flicker of positivity suddenly kicked in, waiting to be ignited and waiting to be nurtured.</p>
<p>I haven’t been blogging about my current state as I have tons of articles left from my <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/india/" target="_blank">trip in India</a> and scheduled to be posted in the coming months. And consciously, I also try my best to keep this blog solely talking about travel, just plain travel.</p>
<p>But a part of me wants to share some things to you as I know that this is an important part of my journey as well.</p>
<p>Thing’s aren’t looking good in the past few months this year due to a number of circumstances. Got news recently that my uncle needs to go through a bypass surgery and the entire family is pooling some money for the needed operation. We all chipped in something that could help fund it and luckily on the second diagnosis, the doctor said that angioplasty instead of bypass surgery could possibly remove whatever is blocking his artery. Days later after they performed angioplasty, fortunately everything seems to be fine and there’ no need for him to undergo the bypass surgery anymore.</p>
<p>In the past few months as well, I’ve been focusing all my time building new websites which I hope would be possible additional sources of income. For some weird reasons, the income that this blog has been consistently generating since it started seems to be drying up fast. I was expecting it to happen though but not this year which maybe the reason why I felt like I was caught off-guard and unprepared.</p>
<p>With all these worries going on around my head, frustrations and anxieties kick in on a daily basis. I try my best to keep calm and stay focus on the solutions.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">And in moments like this I realized how important it is to be surrounded by positive people who cheer you up and help you stay on track.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;">In moments like this I realized how important it is for me as well to pick myself up on every stumble down the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;">In moments like this I also realized on how crucial it is to have faith that everything will soon be fine.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>If you’re floating on tons of worries like I am now, I’d like to share with you some stuff that I’m currently doing to keep myself afloat in this challenging time:</p>
<p>1. I consciously try not to slip in the dark hole of worrying, although it’s easier said than done. Whenever worries kick in, I try to think of happy moments that I’ve had. And once my brain is neutralized, then I start thinking about solutions.</p>
<p>2. I noticed that the more I think about the problem itself, the more it seems to be bigger and stronger so I’m switching my gears and focus more on the solutions. The more I think about solutions the more the problem becomes easier to tackle with.</p>
<p>3. This is the right time to stay connected with positive people who lift our spirits up. Emotional energy is contagious and it’s so easy to pass it around (same goes with negativity).</p>
<p>4. I also don’t want to be a source of negative energy so every time I feel really low and down, I pack some stuff and cycle around town until I feel a bit better.</p>
<p>5. Music helps a lot, listen to a lot of good, fun music. I never realized it until I noticed it helping me shape my mood for the day.</p>
<p>6. Sleep a lot and stay healthy. It’s easier to beat the problems if we’re healthy and sane.</p>
<p>7. Be a source of positivity, everyone goes thru tough times.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">Threading on Faith</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Hoi An Japanese Bridge is one of the main attractions in the old town. It is said that this is the only known covered bridge with a pagoda attached to it. Aside from the bridge, the old town itself is an attraction by itself. the well preserved colonial houses, laid back ambiance, proximity to the river and the beach make <strong>Hoi An a great destination for travelers</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/04/exploring-the-ruins-leh-palace/">Leh Palace</a> is one of main places that tourists in <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/leh/" target="_blank">Leh</a> go to. It&#8217;s quite proximal to both the Old Leh and the New Leh area but if you&#8217;re not intending to walk, you can just hire a taxi that could take you all the way to the monastery above the palace.</p>
<p>The entrance to <strong>Leh Palace</strong> cost just 100 Rupees and the best time to go would be in the afternoon to see the sunset and a great view of Leh. There&#8217;s nothing much to see in the palace itself since it&#8217;s still under renovation when we went there (June 2012) but the Buddhist artworks on the walls of one of the rooms and the photo exhibit was really really nice.</p>
<p>Leh Palace is said to have been modelled on the Potala Palace of Lhasa, <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/tibet/" target="_blank">Tibet</a> and was built in the 17th century. It&#8217;s quite in ruins now but the Archaeological Society of <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/india/" target="_blank">India</a> is in the process of restoring the whole palace to it&#8217;s (hopefully) former glory.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of Leh Palace that I took:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Valerie is the blogger behind one of the newest blogs that I&#8217;ve been following lately called This Way to Paradise. This would probably the only travel blog that I know of that focuses on beaches and island travels. But of course val also shares her experience and insights on other destinations. If you&#8217;re a beach fanatic like me then you should bookmark her blog.</p>
<p>Val also writes about food and very helpful travel tips that you should also check out. Val aspires of creating a life that will help her travel full-time by next year. Get to know more about Valerie and visit her blog at <a href="http://www.thiswaytoparadise.com" target="_blank">This Way to Paradise</a>.</p>
<p>But before you leave this page, check out my short interview with Valerie.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Valerie Dawson of This Way to Paradise" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8491460093_1b807b4375_z.jpg" width="550" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How did you discover your passion for travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I went on a journey to Europe on my own when I was 22. From that very first trip, I learned how exciting travel can be.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the most horrible experience that you&#8217;ve had on the road?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Getting violent food poisoning in Cuba. The clinic wasn&#8217;t supposed to treat me because I was a foreigner. But, my body was so dehydrated that it was shaking. So, they hid me in a back room and hooked me up to an IV so that I wouldn&#8217;t die.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the best travel experience that you&#8217;ve ever had?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Going to Bali. It&#8217;s so exotic and the people are so happy there. I love everything about Bali. The smell of incense, the offerings, the food, the rice paddies. I am going back in two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Valerie Dawson of This Way to Paradise" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8508/8492560434_b1aaa0ca8e_z.jpg" width="453" height="604" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What’s the biggest realization that you&#8217;ve got out of travelling?</span></strong><br />
&#8220;That no matter how long you travel, you will never discover everything.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What keeps you going? What keeps you motivated?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The new things that I discover. The people that I meet who become good friends. I love how the days aren&#8217;t routine when I&#8217;m traveling. I wake up everyday thinking, anything can happen today!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">This is a silly and hypothetical one. If you would be given a chance to travel with a popular person or a celebrity, who would it be and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Alice Waters-she could be my chef!&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Valerie Dawson of This Way to Paradise" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8096/8492560358_891028f408_z.jpg" width="550" height="400" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">Where’s your favorite place in this planet and why?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Any beach&#8230;I love everything about the ocean&#8230;the sound of the waves, salt water, the smell of the ocean, swaying palm trees&#8230;show me the way to the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s your best tip for newbie traveler?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t plan too much. Be spontaneous.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What&#8217;s the funniest and silliest thing you&#8217;ve ever done while travelling?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Got to talking to my best friend so much that neither of us realized that we had been carried away by a rip tide. All of a sudden three locals were surrounding us in their kayaks and we looked around and realized we were REALLY far out in the ocean&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">How do you keep yourself safe on your travels?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I carry a safety alarm and am very alert to my surroundings.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #006699;">What do you think about yourself?</span></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I am adventurous, amusing to watch, I don&#8217;t have it as all together as people think I do, and I&#8217;m pretty funny, too.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Meet the Nomads - Valerie Dawson of This Way to Paradise" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8505/8492560984_3eaedc36f2_z.jpg" width="600" height="344" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left everything behind last March 25, 2011 hoping that I could travel for at least six months or more. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that this adventure will still be alive today. Prior to leaving, <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2011/03/sold-out-ready-set/" target="_blank">I sold almost everything that I have</a>, gave away the remaining stuff and kept some so I&#8217;ll have some stuff to start with when I go back.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving, I also had this blog for quite some time and worked hard in making it a better one with the hopes that it could help me fund my trip even if it was just earning a few bucks during that time.</p>
<p>Prior to leaving, I daydreamed everyday of traveling for a long time to see as much as I can, be amazed with the wonders and beauty of this planet I live in, taste unique cuisines and meet people from around the world.</p>
<p>And fast forward to the present time, I&#8217;m still living this nomadic lifestyle that I chose for myself.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">In the past two years, I learned that it wasn&#8217;t a walk in the park because there have been so many challenges. Maybe if I were born with a silver spoon in my mouth then it would have been easier on the financial side and maybe if I were carrying a &#8220;first world passport&#8221; then it would have been easier to enter and exit various countries. But despite lacking those advantages or privileges that other travelers have, I still feel lucky that I have survived two years on the road. Even if I wasn&#8217;t able to go out of Asia due to financial constraints, I feel grateful that I was able to visit so many awe-inspiring places that definitely blew my mind away and learned a lesson or two that will forever guide me in this thing called life.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Looking back, there were tough moments that really shook me up.</p>
<p>There were moments when I only ate cup noodles for a couple of days because my Paypal was &#8220;limited&#8221; and those were the only food I can afford to eat.</p>
<p>There were moments where I had to walk a few kilometers because it was the only option I had.</p>
<p>There were moments when I was in between choosing to give up this dream and just go back to my cubicle life.</p>
<p>But those moments helped me define for myself what I really want to do with my life for now.</p>

<p>Because of this lifestyle, I realized that I could move almost anywhere I want. I don&#8217;t have to put up with the crazy traffic that you can usually find in huge cities. I could go where the climate is nicer and avoid the heat or intense cold if I want to. Living a nomadic lifestyle gave me freedom to move almost anywhere anytime.</p>

<p>Living this location independent lifestyle enables me to sleep and wake up anytime I want while still being productive. In the past two years, I had the opportunity to sleep and wake up anytime I want which sounds really shallow but I really like it. It felt to me like a privilege I never had, especially since I came from a sleep-deprived industry (I used to work in a call center which means I work in a variety of shifts). It also greatly improved my health since I could rest anytime I want if I&#8217;m feeling very tired.</p>

<p>This nomadic lifestyle also gave me the chance to live closer to nature for as much as I want. I never thought that it would be such a delight to always breathe fresh air and eat fresh locally produced food. I spent a huge amount of my time in small cities and towns where it&#8217;s less polluted. Looking back to my past life, I realized why my health greatly improves every after vacation, it&#8217;s because it gets expose to cleaner environment every time I take some time away from the city.</p>

<p>In this past two years, I also had the chance to visit a couple of national parks and wildlife sanctuaries and also had the opportunity to see wild animals in their natural habitat. I only got to see them before in zoos or on TV. I like learning stuff about animals since I was a kid and this lifestyle enabled me to visit places where I could see them in the wild. I really hope that I could go to more national parks in the coming years.</p>

<p>In the past two years of being on the move every now and then, I had the chance to visit the places that I used to see on TV and read on books. I also had the chance to see places that I never knew existed and I aim to visit more in the coming years. This kind of lifestyle also enabled me to do this without waiting for anyone or someone to approve my vacation leaves.</p>

<p>In the past two years, I also had the the chance doing the things that I like doing like photography, writing, making <a href="http://flipnomad.com/category/ebook/" target="_blank">ebooks</a> and lately I have been learning a lot in designing websites. In between travelling and sightseeing I always make sure that I do these things and learn a couple of new things every now and then. It was hard for me to do this back then since I rarely have the time but now I feel like I have enough time to focus on the things that I like.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8591945013_09b98b1844_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years, I dined, traveled with, talked to people from various places, religions, race etc and learned a lot from them. I learned that despite our differences we are also similar. We all have dreams that we want to pursue. We all have friends and families that we love and care for. We all have fears and challenges that we face every day. We all breathe air to survive, drink water, eat food, and we will all eventually die. In the past two years, I also learned that despite the tons of bad news that make you lose faith in humanity, the world is still a safe place to live in and there are more <a href="http://flipnomad.com/2013/03/the-good-samaritan-kibber/" target="_blank">kind people</a> than &#8220;bad&#8221; ones.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;">And if this world becomes a dangerous place for everyone then we have ourselves to blame for by allowing it to happen.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="FlipNomad" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8593098404_344bbc5767_z.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>In the past two years, I have done things that I have only dreamt of in the past. I tried things that I thought I can never do. I have lived every day in the present moment without worrying about the past and the future and I do hope that I could continue doing this for the years to come. But, in the past two years of living a nomadic life I also have learned a very important fact of life&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>nothing is permanent&#8230;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I want this to last forever, I know that like everything else in this world, this is just a temporary phase of my life. So I&#8217;ll try to enjoy this kind of life while it lasts.</p>
