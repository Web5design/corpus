 Durrell Bishop's 1992 grad project for his design program at the  Royal College of Art was a brilliantly conceived riff on the answering machine, making use of  physical, legible interfaces that made a point of exposing the conceptual workings of the device to its users.

Here's TammieRD's compilation of all the alternate endings to the Animaniacs theme song, each better than the last. As I mentioned before <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000O179IQ/downandoutint-20">the complete seasons 1-3 DVDs</a> are a huge hit around our house. Really some of the best kids' (and grownups') TV of the last century.

Timo Arnall from the design studio BERG has makes several great and provocative points in his essay "No to NoUI" -- a well-argued piece that opposes the idea of "interfaces that disappear" and "seamless computer interfaces," arguing that by hiding the working of computers from their users, designers make it harder for those users to figure out what the computers are really doing and to solve the problems that inevitably arise.

<blockquote>
<p>
Interfaces are the dominant cultural form of our time. So much of contemporary culture takes place through interfaces and inside UI. Interfaces are part of cultural expression and participation, skeuomorphism is evidence that interfaces are more than chrome around content, and more than tools to solve problems. To declare interfaces ‘invisible’ is to deny them a cultural form or medium. Could we say ‘the best TV is no TV’, the ‘best typography is no typography’ or ‘the best buildings are no architecture’? 
<p>
...We might be better off instead taking our language from typography, and for instance talk about legibility and readability without denying that typography can call attention to itself in beautiful and spectacular ways. Our goal should be to ‘place as much control as possible in the hands of the end-user by making interfaces evident’. 
<p>
Of course the interfaces we design may become normalised in use, effectively invisible over time, but that will only happen if we design them to be legible, readable, understandable and to foreground culture over technology. To build trust and confidence in an interface in the first place, enough that it can comfortably recede into the background.

<blockquote>It's a basic human desire to destroy an OREO cookie with a pump action crossbow.

At this plant, three types of disposable chopsticks are made. Chopsticks common "Genroku" The first.

<p>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has weighed in on the growing controversy over the proposal to build DRM into HTML5, the next version of the standard language for building Web pages and applications. Staff technologists Seth Schoen and Peter Eckersley have written a great essay explaining how this kind of work is totally incompatible with the mission of the W3C and how its proponents' insistence that this isn't really DRM are just hollow jokes:

<blockquote>
<p>
The EME proposal suffers from many of these problems because it explicitly abdicates responsibilty on compatibility issues and let web sites require specific proprietary third-party software or even special hardware and particular operating systems (all referred to under the generic name "content decryption modules", or CDMs, and none of them specified by EME). EME's authors keep saying that what CDMs are, and do, and where they come from is totally outside of the scope of EME, and that EME itself can't be thought of as DRM because not all CDMs are DRM systems. Yet if the client can't prove it's running the particular proprietary thing the site demands, and hence doesn't have an approved CDM, it can't render the site's content. Perversely, this is exactly the reverse of the reason that the World Wide Web Consortium exists in the first place. W3C is there to create comprehensible, publicly-implementable standards that will guarantee interoperability, not to facilitate an explosion of new mutually-incompatible software and of sites and services that can only be accessed by particular devices or applications. But EME is a proposal to bring exactly that dysfunctional dynamic into HTML5, even risking a return to the "bad old days, before the Web" of deliberately limited interoperability.
<p>
Because it's clear that the open standards community is extremely suspicious of DRM and its interoperability consequences, the proposal from Google, Microsoft and Netflix claims that "[n]o 'DRM' is added to the HTML5 specification" by EME. This is like saying, "we're not vampires, but we are going to invite them into your house".
<p>
Proponents also seem to claim that EME is not itself a DRM scheme. But specification author Mark Watson admitted that "Certainly, our interest is in [use] cases that most people would call DRM" and that implementations would inherently require secrets outside the specification's scope. It's hard to maintain a pretense that EME is about anything but DRM.

<p>Carla enjoyed Danny Hillis' presentation at TED2013. Here's how he began the talk:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982. (Laughter) Actually, it's deceptively large. There's actually only about 20 people on each page, because we have the name, address and telephone number of every single person. And, in fact, everybody's listed twice, because it's sorted once by name and once by email address. Obviously a very small community. There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then. I knew them both. We didn't all know each other, but we all kind of trusted each other, and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network, and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things.</p>

<p>So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community, let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days. Now, it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet. So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com. So I picked think.com, but then I thought, you know, there's a lot of really interesting names out there. Maybe I should register a few extras just in case. And then I thought, "Nah, that wouldn't be very nice."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1936239434/boingboing"><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NewImage72.png" class="alignright"></a>A book that vigorously defends heroin users and sex workers? <em>In You Will Die: The Burden of Modern Taboos</em> Robert Arthur does that and more to demonstrate that taboos are not relics of primitive societies. America has its own ridiculous phobias and beliefs that cause tedium, suffering, and death. The government and the media use these taboos to lie and mislead. It is not a conspiracy, but by pushing panic for votes and viewers they thwart our pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p><em>You Will Die</em> exposes the fallacies and the history behind our taboos on excrement, sex, drugs, and death. Arthur uses racy readability and rigorous documentation to raze sacred shrines of political correctness on the left and of conventional wisdom on the right. From the proper way to defecate to how to reach nirvana, anticipate the unexpected. It is not simply a novel exploration of sex and drugs, but also of individuality, liberty, and the meaning of life. <em>You Will Die</em> gives readers a new way of seeing their world and allows them to make a more informed choice about living an authentic life.</p></blockquote>

<h4>What made you write <em>You Will Die</em>?</h4></p>

<p>Disillusionment. I grew up with the angst of believing I was a disgusting perverted heathen and after graduating from NYU Law in 2001 I began to research whether I was broken or if conventional wisdom was. The truth was out there but it was buried in boring academic texts, suppressed from the mainstream by puritanical censors on the right and politically-correct censors on the left. I wanted to make the truth easily accessible to the younger versions of me. I wanted them to realize that in these areas they aren't messed up. Our society is.</p>

<span id="more-220172"></span>

<p><h4>What do you think is the basis behind taboos? Is there an evolutionary behavior reason for taboos?</h4></p>

<p>Ignorance is the basis behind taboos. Taboos are associated with an ignorance so ingrained that people are disgusted or morally offended to have their beliefs merely questioned.</p>

<p>I think there is an evolutionary need to accept common convention or else there would be chaos, but I also think there is an evolutionary need to have some people question our deepest cultural assumptions, our taboos. Mutations in thought are as rare as physical mutations but they are necessary for society to evolve.</p>

<p><h4>Do you think some taboos are genetically hardwired, rather than culturally acquired? Are there any universal taboos that you've come across?</h4></p>

<p>I think incest and fecal avoidance have become hardwired because they are evolutionary advantageous. Not surprisingly, these functional taboos are the closest to being universal. More often taboos work in the opposite direction. Instead of genetics influencing cultures via taboos, cultures will frequently try to influence instinctual desires via taboos. Comparing the amount of propaganda and police force directed against drug usage and sex work versus coprophagy (the eating of feces) and incest, provides a clue as to which taboos are natural.</p>

<p><h4>Have you received any letters or email from readers who are upset that you are examining taboos?</h4></p>

<p>Yes. Frequently they are from drug-war supporters who have a loved one that was addicted to drugs. I find them as morally reprehensible as they find me. Addiction is often driven by people seeking an escape from problems -- not by drugs themselves. Addicts need mental-health treatment, not a permanent criminal record. Outside of marijuana, Hollywood and journalistic portrayals of drugs are still just as misleading as the <em>Reefer Madness</em> films of old were. Often, the only media image of drug users is an out-of-control addict, despite statistics showing that they constitute a small minority of users even with "hard" drugs. When it comes out that Barack Obama used cocaine, people are surprised he was successful, but non-addicts like him are the norm. If Obama was branded with a criminal record as a young man for drug possession the government would have been responsible for destroying his future, not cocaine. Suffering people will always find something in which to lose themselves, but Mexico's annual carnage on the scale of 9/11 and the mass incarceration of America's black men -- that requires prohibitionists.</p>

e-books to still be on sale. The DRM wording has been manually
removed from the WH Smith site and when readers click to purchase
the book it forwards them to the Kobo site where it clearly states
the e-books are DRM-free until WH Smiths is able to update their
website which will be at the end of April.

Inspired by the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/08/tropes-vs-women-in-video-games.html">Damsels in Distress</a> episode of Tropes vs Women in Video Games, and by the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/11/dad-genderswaps-donkey-kong-fo.html">Dad who genderswapped Donkey Kong</a> for his daughter, Kenna swapped the Link and Zelda sprites on a Zelda ROM, so that Zelda rescued Link:

<blockquote>
<p>


Tiles are the blocks of pixels that make up each sprite. Animation happens when the tiles are swapped for other tiles. So, to create new animation, you just have to edit the appropriate tile.
<p>
Some tips! Make sure that tile goes back in the same place where you found it, or you might end up with random legs and arms sticking out of scenery. When you open up your ROM in Tile Layer Pro, you'll see a grid with all of the ROM information displayed as pixels. It shows *all* of the rom information, so you're going to see a flaming hot mess -- at first. Keep scrolling down until you find something vaguely sprite-shaped and use the "+" and "-" keys on the keyboard to align them. But beware -- the tiles will go back to their starting alignment when you scroll and not all parts of the code use the same alignment. We spent hours hunting down the princess tiles because we didn't realize that the alignment changed from section to section.
</blockquote>
<p>
Kenna's made <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B9pJDI0EvDXWMlZfT3pnUVYxSU0/edit?usp=sharing">the patch</a> available.

A company called Lumilor has announced a permanent electroluminescent paint that can be selectively illuminated by applying a charge to it. Burning Man attendees are already familiar with the ubiquitous, cheap EL wire, but this takes things to a new level:

<blockquote>
<p>
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/5.jpg" class="bordered" align="right">

The LumiLor TM electroluminescent coating system is a patent-pending, practical, durable and affordable technology that can be illuminated with a simple electrical current. 
<p>
Used in conjunction with simple driver electronics,
LumiLor will illuminate any surface brightly, and is capable of being custom-animated to flash in sequenced, strobed, and sound activated modes.
<p>
The potential for customization is practically limitless!

<p>
As <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/20/genocide-trial-begins-in-guate.html">noted in previous Boing Boing posts</a>, former Guatemalan dictator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efra%C3%ADn_R%C3%ADos_Montt"> Efraín Rios Montt</a> is on trial in Guatemala City this week, three decades after the army he presided over massacred Ixil Maya villages in the Central American country's highlands. Former G2 commander Jose Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez is his co-defendant. <p> <p>Montt, 86, was trained at the notorious US Army <a href="http://www.soaw.org/">School of the Americas</a> and was celebrated and supported by the Reagan administration as a law-and-order tough guy who promised to bring <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/21/world/us-seeks-to-improve-ties-with-guatemala.html">an end to "indiscriminate violence</a>." <p>
Under his regime, the country entered a new phase of bloodbath; the scope of which Guatemala had never before known. And at last, with this tribunal, a legacy of impunity and silence is challenged. Whether the outcome amounts to justice will be a matter of debate for generations to come. But one of the most notorious mass murderers in Guatemalan history is finally on trial.

<p><span id="more-220102"></span><p>
Montt held a position in Guatemala's Congress until 2012, and was finally ordered to stand trial in January 2013 when a judge found that there was enough evidence to connect him to the murders of more than 1,700 Mayan people in <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-19/news/sns-rt-us-guatemala-riosmonttbre92i117-20130319_1_rios-montt-guatemala-city-nebaj">the counterinsurgency campaign executed under his command</a>.

<p>
Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) is an ignoramus, as is demonstrated by his questioning during this hearing on reforms to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Gohmert questions a Google rep about how Adwords in Gmail work. For the record, here's how it works: Google parses the email for keywords, checks to see if anyone has bid to have text-ads displayed on emails with those words, and displays ads that match. Here's how Gohmert thinks they work: A computer at Google reads your email, sends your identity to an advertiser, and asks it if it wants to display ads on your email.
<p>
Gohmert may have confused Adwords with some of the realtime auctions for display ads. Google rep very patiently, and repeatedly tries to explain this to Gohmert, who refuses to get it, and instead smugly keeps asking whether the government could buy the right to see who's sending what email from Google in the way he imagines (incorrectly) that advertisers do.

<p>
If watching the video is too painful, have no fear, TechDirt's Mike Masnick has thoughtfully transcribed some of the choicest moments:
<blockquote>
<p>

Gohmert: Okay, so what would prevent the federal government from making a deal with Google, so they could also "Scroogle" people, and say "I want to know everyone who has ever used the term 'Benghazi'" or "I want everyone who's ever used... a certain term." Would you discriminate against the government, or would you allow the government to know about all emails that included those words?
<p>
     Lawyer [confounded look] Uh... sir, I think those are apples and oranges. I think the disclosure of the identity...
<p>
    Gohmert: I'm not asking for a fruit comparison. I'm just asking would you be willing to make that deal with the government? The same one you do with private advertisers, so that the government would know which emails are using which words. 
    <p>
         Lawyer: Thank you, sir. I meant by that, that it isn't the same deal that's being suggested there.
<p>
    Gohmert: But I'm asking specifically if the same type of deal could be made by the federal government? [some pointless rant about US government videos aired overseas that is completely irrelevant and which it wasn't worth transcribing] But if that same government will spend tens of thousands to do a commercial, they might, under some hare-brained idea like to do a deal to get all the email addresses that use certain words. Couldn't they make that same kind of deal that private advertisers do? 

</blockquote>
<p>
For the record, I think there are real privacy concerns with Gmail's ads, but not the dumbass ones that Gohmert is worried about. Also for the record, <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130320/03244622387/rep-gohmerts-record-stunning-technological-ignorance-is-broken-rep-gohmert.shtml#c664">Gohmert believes</a> that a  trans-Alaskan pipeline will help caribou get more sex; denies climate change; and thinks that school shootings can be averted by giving school principals M-4 rifles.

<a href="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rolleiflex-ad2.jpg"><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/rolleiflex-ad2-600x775.jpg" alt="" title="Rolleiflex Ad" width="600" height="775" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-220071" /></a>
<p>
A few years ago I was bored with digital photography and started shooting 35mm film again. Digital lets me do <em>anything</em> but there is no challenge! The film results were beautiful but I was still not having the fun I was looking for! I decided to try medium-format photography but didn't want to just stumble into it, I wanted a <a href="http://www.rolleiclub.com/cameras/tlr/info/early_tlr.shtml">Rolleiflex</a>.
<p>
Rolleiflex is actually a series of cameras first produced in 1929, by German camera company Franke and Heidecke. The simple, square 6x6 centimeter images revolutionized photography. The Rollei made it easy to take large, high quality negatives (and positives) with its simple, elegant and incredibly reliable compact design. The TLR or Twin Lens Reflex camera became a staple of pros and news photographers the world over. 
<p>
<span id="more-220070"></span>
<p>
I never thought I'd own one. Thank you eBay!
<p>
Unlike the monster digital SLRs I was carrying around, the Rolleiflex takes you back to a simpler, messier time. Film advance is by crank. You may adjust your shutter speed, your aperture and the ISO rating of the film -- with dials. You can focus, you can move the camera (and your body) around but the lens is 80mm and zoom is something you do by walking closer or father from your subject.
<p>
It is this simplicity that brought fun back to composition for me. Instead of taking 100 massive shots and reviewing immediately on a digital camera back, with a Rollei you look DOWN into the viewfinder! You compose a reversed image in a mirror projected on a screen by the viewing (top) lens and when you hit the shutter, it opens the taking (bottom) lens to expose the film.
