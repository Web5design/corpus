Here's a fun set of instructions for baking anatomical heart-shaped bread that you rip apart and gorge upon:

<blockquote>
<p>
Nothing says romance like ritual cannibalism. Use this anatomical heart pull apart loaf to pretend you’re vampires feasting on the heart of that asshole in HR who gave a promotion to Brad. Alternately, you could engage in a little Indiana Jones cosplay where the sexy archaeologist in your life can rescue you from having your heart ripped out by any other man. Gentlemen bakers, you could show up at your vegetarian girlfriend’s house triumphantly holding this and declaring you were successful in the hunt, so tonight you feast. There are so many ways to express your doughy love.

A wonderful site called "Grandma Got STEM" profiles grandmothers who have accomplished marvellous feats of technology, and aims to drive a stake through the heart of stupid, thoughtless phrases like "How would you explain that to your grandmother?" or "So simple my grandma could do it."
<p>
Shown above, <a href="http://ggstem.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/helen-quinn/">Helen Quinn</a>, "particle physicist, PhD from Stanford in 1967, and grandmother of three young girls."
<p>
I've never understood why geeks hold their grandmothers in such contempt.

<blockquote>
<p>

Perhaps you are tired of hearing people say 'how would you explain that to your grandmother?' when they probably mean something like 'How would you explain the idea in a clear, compelling way so that people without a technical background can understand you?'
<p>
Here's a similar saying you may have heard: 'That's so easy, my grandmother could understand it.'
<p>
Grandma got STEM counters the implication that grannies (gender + maternity + age) might not easily pick up on technical/theoretical ideas by sharing pictures and remembrances from/of Grandmothers who have made contributions in STEM-related fields.

Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is one of the key figures in the political wrangle over whether undocumented immigrants in the USA will be legalized or deported. He's also the recipient of over $100,000 in campaign contributions from the private prison industry, whose profits would skyrocket if his push for prison for all those people is successful.

<blockquote>
<p>
Chuck Schumer is the lead Senate Democrat working on immigration reform--he gets to decide whether millions of undocumented immigrants will be imprisoned or legalized. Yet he’s also taken over $100,000 in campaign contributions from the private prison industry. Is it any surprise he’s pushing for billions more dollars spent on increased enforcement and detention of immigrants?
<p>
We can’t trust Sen. Schumer to push for fair legislation when he’s accepting money from private prison companies that have a strong interest in jailing as many immigrants as possible. How much of an interest? The two corporations from which Sen. Schumer took money, GEO Group and CCA, made $296.9 million in profits from the jailing of immigrants last year. 
<p>
Tell Sen. Schumer to return this money immediately. 
<p>
If 15,000 people sign, we'll personally deliver your petitions to Sen. Schumer and demand a response.

CISPA is a bill before Congress that will radically increase the ease with which the government and police can spy on people without any particular suspicion. It is being rammed through by people like Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), who received a small fortune in funding from the companies that stand to get rich building the surveillance tech CISPA will make possible. 
<p>
What's more, Rogers admits it, and even tweets about it! Nicko Margolies from the Sunlight Foundation writes,

<blockquote>
<p>

<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cispa1.png" align="right">
Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), a co-sponsor and major supporter of the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), deleted a retweet of an analysis of contributions to lawmakers from pro-CISPA companies. MapLight looked at the powerful House Intelligence Committee, where Rep. Rogers serves as Chairman, and followed campaign contributions to the members who are currently considering the bill that would allow companies to share more information on Internet traffic and users with the U.S. government.
<p>
Rep. Rogers, or possibly a member of his staff, retweeted the story that identified that members of the House Intelligence Committee "have received, on average, 15 times more money in campaign contributions from pro-CISPA organizations than from anti-CISPA organizations." He retweeted MapLight's tweet of this information from his iPhone and after 23 minutes thought better of it and removed it. Fortunately the Sunlight Foundation's Politwoops project caught it and archived this change of message and of heart. According to the MapLight piece, Rep. Rogers received $214,750 from interest groups that support CISPA.

Phil Windley, former CTO of Utah and now CTO of a startup called Kynetx, has an inspiring, brief piece on how technologists can help build a technological world where technology helps us live better lives over which we have more control, and how a failure to do something to build this world will give us a place where we are continuously spied upon and manipulated.


<blockquote>
<p>


<p>
We probably don’t really have a choice about whether a $0.03 wireless sensor platform will exist. Technology marches on. 
</p>

<p>
But we <em>do have a choice</em> about how it will be employed. If we follow the path we’re on now, all those devices will be controlled by some company somewhere that is providing the service behind them. All that data that all those devices are gathering about you will be streamed back to a walled garden via an encrypted channel to end up as fodder for some big data analytics platform that will be used by someone to sell you more stuff. You will be spied on by everything around you with no rational way to understand where all that data is going and how it’s being used. We’ll create government regulations that will do little to rationalize your world or help you understand it because they will only succeed in further Balkanizing it. 
</p>

<p>
There is another path: in this alternate world all the devices that are related to you will push their data into a place that you control. This will seem rational and natural because the model will follow the structure of the world you’re already used to with clear delineations between public and private spaces and easy-to-understand controls over how data is used and shared. I say “natural” in a literal way. This is the way the physical world works and we’re all used to it. In this alternate world <em>you are in control</em>.

Tommy sez, "I made this film clip with a great photographer friend of mine and it took two takes. That means I had to eat TWO CAKES.

I ended up eating so much confetti and glitter that I had a glittery poo the next day. But it was all worth it as backwards eating really can end up looking quite beautiful.

Thankfully the clip was not about the glittery poo."

One interesting finding is that Google is becoming less patient with its less popular progeny, with an accelerating trend to killing off products that aren't cutting it. This was occasioned by the launch of Google Keep, a networked note-taking app which has the potential to become quite central to your workflow, and to be quite disruptive if Google kills it -- much like Google Reader, which is scheduled for impending switch-off.

<blockquote>

So if you want to know when Google Keep, opened for business on 21 March 2013, will probably shut - again, assuming Google decides it's just not working - then, the mean suggests the answer is: 18 March 2017. That's about long enough for you to cram lots of information that you might rely on into it; and also long enough for Google to discover that, well, people aren't using it to the extent that it hoped. Much the same as happened with Knol (lifespan: 1,377 days, from 23 July 2008 to 30 April 2012), or Wave (1,095 days, from May 2009 - 30 April 2012) or of course Reader (2,824 days, from 7 October 2005 to 1 July 2013).
<p>

If you want to play around further with the numbers, then if we assume that closures occur randomly as a normal distribution around the mean, and that Google is going to shut Google Keep, then there's a 68% chance that the closure will occur between April 2015 and February 2019. Even the later date wouldn't be much longer than Evernote - which is still growing - has already lasted. Is Google really that committed to Keep?
</blockquote>

It's been more than a year since the <em>WSJ</eM> reported that Skype leaks its users' IP addresses and locations. Microsoft has done nothing to fix this since, and as Brian Krebs reports, the past year has seen the rise of several tools that let you figure out someone's IP address by searching for him on Skype, then automate launching denial-of-service attacks on that person's home.

<blockquote>
<p>


In the above screen shot, we can see one such service being used to display the IP address most recently used by the Skype account “mailen_support” (this particular account belongs to the tech support contact for Mailien, a Russian pharmacy spam affiliate program by the same name).

<p>
Typically, these Skype resolvers are offered in tandem with “booter” or “stresser” services, online attack tools-for-hire than can be rented to launch denial-of-service attacks (one of these services was used in an attack on this Web site, and on that of Ars Technica last week). The idea being that if you want to knock someone offline but you don’t know their Internet address, you can simply search on Skype to see if they have an account. The resolvers work regardless of any privacy settings the target user may have selected within the Skype program’s configuration panel.
<p>
Beyond exposing one’s Internet connection to annoying and disruptive attacks, this vulnerability could allow stalkers or corporate rivals to track the movement of individuals and executives as they travel between cities and states.

Designed by interior designer Brad Ford, it's impressive on the outside, but what's on the inside truly astounds: sleek leather furnishings and details from Moore &#038; Giles, rich wood finishings (handcrafted from reclaimed Bulleit Bourbon casks), elegant glassware, and a top-notch entertainment system, including a flat-screen TV, Blu-ray Disc™ player, and a state-of-the-art sound system, plus a one-year supply of Bulleit Bourbon and Bulleit Rye*. You park, open the hatch, and slide out the bar—cocktails anyone?

<p>
Bulleit is delicious bourbon, but I recently bought a bottle of Elmer T Lee Single Barrel and holy cats, is that stuff astounding.

According to <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/a_celebration_of_paris_is_burning_with_peaches_christ_and_latrice_royale">Niall Connolly at Dangerous Minds</a>, "If you have not seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QJ89VU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B007QJ89VU&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=boingboing06-20"><em>Paris Is Burning,</em></a> you’re just not doing it right.

<blockquote>I’ve written about <em>Paris Is Burning </em>before, and referenced it in <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/06/ballroom.html">my recent ballroom piece for Boing Boing</a>, but the truth is that the impact of this film on gay culture, and by extension culture at large, cannot be overestimated. That a film about underground drag culture and voguing resonated so strongly amongst gays should not be a surprise, but what is surprising is how far its influence has spread in “straight” circles. Its language and imagery are now common parlance, and it won a recent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/2012/11/the-greatest-documentaries-of-all-time/#.UUyTXM2zcxp">PBS “best documentary” poll</a> by an overwhelming landslide.</p><p>Which is why I was so delighted to see Paris Is Burning get recent a Midnight Mass screening in San Francisco, hosted by the queens Peaches Christ and Latrice Royale.</p></blockquote>

<p>
A NY federal judge handed down <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/ap_v._meltwater_sdny_copy.pdf">a terrible ruling</a> in <em>AP vs Meltwater</em>, which turned on whether providing a search-engine for newswire articles that showed the first sentence or two of the article was fair use. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Corynne McSherry sums up many of the ways in which this judge got it wrong. We can only hope for an appeal and a better ruling.

<blockquote>
<p>
Second, the court implicitly adopted AP’s dangerous “heart of the work” theory.  AP contended that sharing excerpts of a news article must weigh against fair use if those excerpts contain the lede.  The court stressed that the lede is “consistently important” and takes “significant journalistic skill to craft.” But that is beside the point – there is no extra protection because something is extra difficult. More important to the fair use analysis is the fact that (1) is primarily factual; and (2) contains precisely the information the user wishes to make known to others. As we explained in our amicus brief, this case illustrates why the heart of the work doctrine does not mesh well with highly factual, published, news articles. When it comes to news articles, an excerpt that is shared will very often be the most “important” aspect of the work – but that importance will derive from the uncopyrightable factual content, not the expression. It is not the “heart of the work,” but a piece of the factual skeleton upon which the expression hangs.

<p>
As <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/guatemala-genocide-trial-conti.html">I've been blogging here on Boing Boing this week</a>, former Guatemalan Army general and de facto dictator <a href="http://www.riosmontt-trial.org/">Efraín Rios Montt and ex-military intelligence chief Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez are on trial</a> over charges of <a href="http://www.riosmontt-trial.org/trial-background/">genocide</a>. 
<p>
A Guatemalan judge ruled in January that Montt must stand trial; his lawyer said his defense would be that he wasn't personally on the battlefield and couldn't control what happened there. I've been listening in to the trial via a live audio stream, and their cross-questioning of Ixil Maya witnesses suggests that this remains their plan.<p><span id="more-220500"></span>

The documentary film "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/granito/watch-granito-online.php#.UUyITVt4Z0I">Granito:How to Nail a Dictator</a>" is streaming online for free, and you should see it if you're interested in the United States' role in the atrocities of Guatemala's 36-year civil war. In the clip above, filmmaker Pamela Yates "finds an outtake from her 1982 interview with the then President that puts a lie to that claim."
<p>
That interview was for Yates' earlier film on the Guatemalan Civil War, "When The Mountains Tremble," which you can also <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/granito/when-the-mountains-tremble.php#.UUy3JVt4Z0I">watch online for free, here</a>.
<p>
The interview with Montt was filmed in 1982. In vivid testimonial over the last few days, witnesses in the trial have been describing atrocities that his troops carried out against men, women, and children during that very same year.
<p>
<a href="http://skylight.is/journal/#juiciogenocidios">Yates blogged earlier today</a> that bootleggers outside of the Guatemala City courtroom are selling copies of "Granito," retitled as "A greater story never told." 

<p>
"There is no honor or award that could surpass this endorsement of our film by the Guatemalan people," <a href="http://skylight.is/journal/#juiciogenocidios">Yates writes</a>,  "Bootleggers all over the world are tuned in to their cultures, and what people want to see and hear."
<p>
"Having your film bootlegged in a country is a great affirmation of its value in that society, whether it be for entertainment or in this case, hunger for a suppressed history and the restoration of collective memory.  The street price, by the way, is 10 Guatemalan Quetzales (US$1.25)."<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~4/Pjc8AFcmgMg" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><description>An outtake from "Granito:How to Nail a Dictator" which disproves claims by the defense for Guatemalan ex-dictator Rios Montt that he had no control over the Army.</description><wfw:commentRss xmlns:wfw="http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/">http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/rios-montt-i-control-the-ar.html/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments xmlns:slash="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/">0</slash:comments><feedburner:origLink>http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/rios-montt-i-control-the-ar.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Prosecutors call for inaccurate groundhog's death</title><link>http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/GbtBaK0bo-Y/prosecutors-call-for-inaccurat.html</link><category>Post</category><category>groundhog</category><category>law</category><category>Weird</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rob Beschizza</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 11:41:14 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://boingboing.net/?p=220497</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>After an unexpectedly cold start to March, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/22/ohio-prosecutors-indict-punxsutawney-phil-over-early-spring-forecast-seek-death/">authorities in Ohio have called for the indictment and execution of the groundhog</a> whose report promised an early end to winter.

Vera Greentea and Laura Muller's "Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits" is an indie comic (funded by a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/veragreentea/nenetl-of-the-forgotten-spirits-part-1-of-comic-mi">very successful Kickstarter</a>) that spans four issues. The first issue, just out ($6), is a nice, deceptively gentle entree into what promises to be a proper kick-in-the-teeth bit of horror about the Mexican Day of the Dead.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits is a spirited horror story about a ghost searching for her family during the festival of the Day of the Dead, while dodging ambitious exorcist apprentices. Vera Greentea (Recipes for the Dead, To Stop Dreaming of Goddesses) and talented artist Laura Müller (Mega Man Tribute, Subway to Sally Storybook) collaborate to create an autumn-friendly tale of skulls and hope. The first issue introduces the vivacious but forgotten ghost girl, Nena, as she explores the labyrinthine streets of Mexico during its most eerily evocative celebration and Bastian, the first of the exorcists speeding after her – completely for the wrong reason.

A developer made a game that's a spin on the old "waterworks"/"pipe mania" type game with an oil pipeline theme... complete with pixel-art anti-pipeline protesters. 

Like most indie developers, they were eligible and applied for funding from a variety of sources.

Apparently this <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/21/ontario-premier-to-investigate-game-with-pipeline-bombing-on-taxpayer-funded-broadcasters-website/">made some blowhards angry</a>, who think that "tax dollars funded the game" and shouldn't fund a game about blowing up pipelines, and that the developer donating to a non-profit charity somehow constitutes an ethics violation, having received so-called "tax-dollar funding". 


Tax breaks and grants and things are available to all sorts of content and media producers in Canada. Game development and film production and the like are industries that are very active here. It's also not illegal to donate proceeds to non-profit charities.

<p>Matt Novak (aka<a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/paleofuture/"> Paleofuture</a>) is a historian and blogger who writes about the history of innovation and the history of the way we imagine the future. A couple of weeks ago, at South by Southwest, he gave a fascinating presentation that I wanted you guys to hear more about.</p>

<p>The basic thesis: Tesla vs. Edison &mdash; UR DOIN IT WRONG.</p>

<p>Whether you think Tesla > Edison or Edison > Tesla, Novak says you're missing something important. In reality, technology isn't shaped by one guy who had one great idea and changed the world. Instead, it's a messy process, full of flat-out failures and not-quite-successes, and populated by many great minds who build off of and are inspired by each other's work. This is about more than just getting history right. Letting go of The Great Man paradigm has implications for everything from copyright law, to how we go about innovation today. When we focus too much on Great Men, Novak says, we lose sight of what innovation actually looks like ... and we impede our ability to build the future.</p>
