The Ixil ethnic group of the country's Mayan population were one of the army's primary targets during the conflict, which left some 200,000 dead and tens of thousands "disappeared."<p>
It's a shame none of the American forces that trained Montt and his regime, and helped prop them up to power, will ever be brought to justice.<p>

<p><em>Baker</em> was a 23-kiloton nuclear weapon that was detonated underwater at Bikini Atoll in 1946. The goal was to see what would happen to Navy boats if they were in the region where a nuclear bomb went off.

Michael Geist sez, "The Canadian Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology released its report on the Intellectual Property Regime in Canada yesterday. While most the recommendations are fairly innocuous, the report involves a classic case of policy laundering as the government has fabricated support for the Canada - EU Trade Agreement and Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) provisions that were not even raised at committee. The report recommends ratifying four intellectual
property treaties, despite the fact the treaties weren't discussed before committee.  
<p>
"Why? Leaked versions of CETA and TPP both include requirements to ratify them.

Should Canada reach agreement on CETA or the TPP, the committee report will presumably be used by the government to short-circuit further review on those treaties or to simply claim support for ratification on the basis on a committee recommendation that was secretly fabricated behind closed doors without any witness raising the issue during the public hearings."

Artist Shepard Fairey may be best known for Obey Giant and his Barack Obama "Hope" poster, but his latest work will be conquering an entirely different realm: outer space. The artist has designed the patch for an upcoming mission to the International Space Station called ARK1 — Advanced Science and Research — that will run from September 2013 through March 2014. ARK1 will be the first flight managed by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), a non-profit organization that was set up by the US Congress in order to help promote research aboard the ISS.

Here's a follow up to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/04/19/destructive-weird-and-absurd.html">Dumt and Farligt's 2012 video</a> in which Danish show (its name translates as "Stupid and Dangerous") enacts a series of improbable, destructive stunts while recording at 2500 fps. The resulting slomos are dreamlike bullet-time sequences of devastation and absurdity, and really rather good. Exploding camper at 3:02 FTW, and 60,000 matches right afterward? Perfecto!

Hey, Portlandians! Brian David Johnson and James H Carrott are doing a talk and signing for their new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1449337996/downandoutint-20">Vintage Tomorrows: A Historian And A Futurist Journey Through Steampunk Into The Future of Technology</a>, a fascinating look at the historical significance of steampunk, and an exploration of what the popularity of steampunk today's means about tomorrow's technology, at the Cedar Hills Crossing Powell's on March 25 at 7PM.

<blockquote>
<p>


    Steampunk, a mashup in its own right, has gone mainstream, with music videos from the likes of Nicki Minaj; America’s Next Top Model photo shoots; and Prada’s Fall/Winter menswear collection featuring haute couture, steampunk style. Some steampunk fans revile this celebrity. But James H. Carrott, co-author of Vintage Tomorrows, says that’s just how cultural change happens. “Things get appropriated; they affect the culture in some way or another, and the people who are at the heart of trying to make that change move onto the next key idea.”
<p>
    So what is steampunk, exactly, and why should we care? Carrott, a cultural historian, says “steampunk is playing with the past.” The world that steampunk envisions is a mad-inventor’s collection of 21st century-inspired contraptions, powered by steam and driven by gears. It’s a whole new past; one that has a lot to say about the futures we want to see.
<p>
    In Vintage Tomorrows, Intel’s resident futurist Brian David Johnson (@IntelFuturist) joins Carrott (@CultHistorian) in a globe-spanning journey to dig beyond definitions and into the heart of this growing subculture. Through interviews with experts such as Margaret Atwood, China Miéville, William Gibson, Cory Doctorow, Bruce Sterling, and James Gleick, this book looks into steampunk’s vision of old-world craftsmen making beautiful hand-tooled gadgets, and what it means for our age of disposable technology.

<p>

Last week, Brian Krebs (a respected security researcher and journalist who often publishes details about high-tech crime) was <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/15/internet-security-writer-ddos.html">SWATted</a> -- that is, someone defrauded his local police department into sending a SWAT team to his house, resulting in his getting confronted by gun-wielding, hair-trigger cops who had him lie on the ground and cuffed him before it was all sorted out.
<p>
Krebs, being a talented investigator, is hot on the trail of the people or person responsible for this. And a variety of sources point to a 20-year-old hacker who goes by "Phobia," and whose real name, according to Krebs, is Ryan Stevenson. Phobia was implicated in the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/06/mat-honan-on-being-hacked.html">attack on Wired reporter Mat Honan</a>, wherein his laptop drive and online backup were deleted, including irreplaceable photos of his child's first year, and eight years' worth of email.
<p>
Krebs phoned "Phobia" up and ended up speaking to Phobia and his father. Phobia denied attacking Krebs and insisted that he had nothing to do with the gamer/fraudster clan behind it (though Krebs pointed out that Phobia can be heard speaking in the group's YouTube videos, which document their attacks), but admitted that he had been the culprit in hacking Honan (his father then came onto the line to deny this). The transcript is the most interesting part of the piece:

<blockquote>
<p>


BK: Uh huh. And is Honan referring to you in this article?
<p>
RS: Yeah.
<p>
BK Yes?
<p>
RS: Uh huh.
<p>
BK: Did anything bad ever happen to you because of this?
<p>
RS: No.
<p>
BK: So, this was your doing with the Mat Honan hack, but you say you would never use a site like a stresser or…
<p>
RS: Yeah, I would never do that. That’s stupid.
<p>
BK: …or hack a reporter’s account or launch a denial of service attack against a reporter, or SWAT his house….
<p>
RS: <extended silence>
<p>
BK: So what’s the point of hacking a reporter’s iCloud account? Why’d you do that?
<p>
RS: Just to prove a point that, like…the security is breachable.
</blockquote>

The quality control problem forced the company to cut its revenue forecast by $12-17 million and its stock price took it on the chin. <p>
"The ingredients, weight and longevity qualities of the pants remain the same, but the coverage does not, resulting in a level of sheerness in some of our women's black Luon bottoms that falls short of our very high standards," the company stated. "We want you to Down Dog and Crow with confidence and we felt these pants didn't measure up."

On Friday, my friends in the <a href="http://theafghanwhigs.com">Afghan Whigs</a> performed at SXSW with special surprise guests Usher and Sinkane. It may seem like an unlikely combo but the Whigs's indie rock has always been drenched in soul and R&#038;B. Above is video of that musical extravaganza. I'm a bit late to the <a href="http://sinkane.com">Sinkane</a> party but the video below for his track "Runnin'," from the album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009M08XLW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B009M08XLW&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=boingboing0e-20">Mars</a>, is absolutely smoking. Previously known as Ahmed Gallab, the Sudanese-born musician has toured extensively as a multi-instrumentalist with the likes of Of Montreal and Caribou. <p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute or common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back."

The good folks at the Mozilla Foundation have unveiled an amazing suite of Web-development tools. Wired's Webmonkey has a great summary:

<blockquote>
<p>
The most popular request, and by far the coolest of the bunch, is the ability to do live edits in the text editor of your choice — effectively controlling Firefox with your editor. The video below shows an example of live editing via the popular Sublime Edit. This would essentially eliminate the need to jump from your editor to the browser, hit refresh, jump back to your editor, and so on. A dance that most of us are all too familiar with. Perhaps the best part, Rouget says this will work with the mobile version of Firefox as well.
<p>


Mozilla is also working on the opposite idea — authoring in the browser. That means putting an editor inside Firefox’s Dev Tools suite. Thus far this idea is less fleshed out, but the possibilities include putting in something like jsFiddle or perhaps a more traditional file-based editor.
<p>
Other new tools include some catch up features that bring Firefox’s Dev tools up to speed with what you’ll find in WebKit browsers. Examples include a new network panel prototype and the ability to doc the tools to the right side of the screen — great for wide monitors (this is already available in Nightly). There’s also a new “repaint” view that shows what gets repainted on the page, very useful if you’re trying to improve performance. Rouget has also been working on a new, dark theme for the Firefox dev tools.
</blockquote>

Last week, we <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/16/eff-explains-yesterdays-nati.html">brought you the wonderful news</a> that a district court in San Francisco had struck down the law that allowed the FBI to issue its own "National Security Letters" (NSLs) -- secret search-warrants with permanent gag orders. Now, Matt Zimmerman, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (who brought the case on behalf of an unnamed telco), explains in depth what EFF asked the court to recognize, how far they got, and what happens next:

<blockquote>
<p>
The court made five critical findings. First, Judge Illston quickly rejected the government's dangerous argument that NSL recipients had no power to review the constitutionality of the statute. The government had suggested that the court could only review specific problems with specific NSLs, meaning that larger structural problems with the statute would remain untouched. As the court correctly noted, however, the statute specifically allows a court to determine whether an NSL is "unreasonable" or "unlawful" which includes determining whether the statute itself is unconstitutional.
<p>
Second, the district court found that the statute impermissibly authorizes the FBI to limit speech without constitutionally-mandated procedural protections. The Supreme Court articulated the scope for such protections in 1965 in Freedman vs. Maryland, a case in which it struck down a Maryland licensing scheme that required films to be submitted to a government ratings board prior to public showings. The problem with the statute wasn't necessarily its substantive reach as it was possible that films could be banned without violating the First Amendment -- if, for example, they met the First Amendment definition of "obscene." Instead, the court was concerned that the procedures for challenging a ban stacked the deck against theater owners...
<p>
...

Fourth, the district court found that the statute was not "severable," meaning that Congress designed the NSL tool as a whole and that the powers it granted to the FBI were not intended to function separately if one of the powers was found to be unconstitutional. Because the nondisclosure provision was found to be unconstitutional on its face, the power to compel the disclosure of customer records must also fall. NSL statistics are consistent with this observation: 97% of all NSLs are delivered with a gag order.
<p>
Finally, the district court found that, regardless of other failings, the statute's standard of review violated separation of powers principles by forcing the courts to defer to the FBI's determinations and preventing independent review. It noted that a "[c]ourt can only sustain nondisclosure based on a searching standard of review." While courts do largely defer to the executive branch's judgment in national security matters, the standard in this statute required the court to consider the government's decision "conclusive" and only allowing the court to consider whether it was made in "bad faith." The court rightly noted that real judicial review requires more. 
</blockquote>

Canada's Conservative government has issued new regulations to librarians and archvists governing their free speech in public forums and online media. According to the Harper government, public servants owe a "duty of loyalty" to the "duly elected government" and must get permission from their <s>political officers</s> managers before making any public utterance -- or even a private utterance in an online forum that may eventually leak to the public, to prevent "conflicts" or "risks" their departments.
<p>
The Tories have also rolled out a snitch-line where those loyal to the party line can report on their co-workers for failing to maintain ideological purity.

<blockquote>
<p>


“Once you start picking on librarians and archivists, it’s pretty sad,” says Toni Samek, a professor of library and information studies at the University of Alberta. She specializes in intellectual freedom and describes several clauses in the code as “severe” and “outrageous.”
<p>
The code is already having a “chilling” effect on federal archivists and librarians, who used to be encouraged to actively engage and interact with groups interested in everything from genealogy to preserving historical documents, says archivist Loryl MacDonald at the University of Toronto.
<p>
“It is very disturbing and disconcerting to have included speaking at conferences and teaching as so-called ‘high risk’ activities,” says MacDonald, who is president of the Association of Canadian Archivists, a non-profit group representing some 600 archivists across the country.
</blockquote>

<p>
Regular readers will remember that Canada's librarians and archivists <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/09/22/save-the-canadian-national-arc.html">led a charge</a> to save Canada's National Archives when the Harper Tories broke up the irreplaceable collections and flogged them off to private collectors at fire-sale prices.

Last fall, while on the <a href="http://craphound.com/pc">Pirate Cinema</a> tour, I stopped in at the Library of Congress to give a talk called "A Digital Shift: Libraries, Ebooks and Beyond," which was an amazing treat. The LoC people were delightful and the building and its collections were outstanding. Now, they've put the video online!

The US Supreme Court has handed down a verdict in <em> Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &#038; Sons</em>, one of the most important copyright cases of the century. In it, the publisher  John Wiley &#038; Sons sought to block the import of legally purchased cheap overseas editions of its books by arguing that "first sale" (the right to resell copyrighted works) only applies to goods made in the USA. However you feel about cheap overseas editions and their importation into the USA, this was a disastrous legal theory. Practically everything owned by Americans is made outside of the USA and almost all of it embodies some kind of copyright. Under Wiley's theory, you would have <em>no</em> first-sale rights to any of that stuff -- you couldn't sell it, you couldn't even give it away. What's more, the other "exceptions and limitations" to copyright would also not apply, meaning that it would be illegal to photograph anything made outside of the USA (no di minimum exemption) or to transform it in any way (no fair use, either). Thanks goodness the Supremes got this one right!
<p>
Here's some choice bits of the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-697_d1o2.pdf">decision</a> (PDF)

<blockquote>
<p>
These intolerable consequences (along
with the absurd result that the copyright owner can exercise downstream control even when it authorized the
import or first sale) have understandably led the Ninth
Circuit, the Solicitor General as amicus, and the dissent to
adopt textual readings of the statute that attempt to
mitigate these harms. Brief for United States 27–28;
post, at 24–28. But those readings are not defensible, for
they require too many unprecedented jumps over linguis
tic and other hurdles that in our view are insurmountable.
See, e.g., post, at 26 (acknowledging that its reading of
§106(3) “significantly curtails the independent effect of
§109(a)”).

<p>
...In reaching this conclusion we endorsed Bobbs-Merrill
and its statement that the copyright laws were not “in
tended to create a right which would permit the holder of
the copyright to fasten, by notice in a book . . . a restriction
upon the subsequent alienation of the subject-matter of
copyright after the owner had parted with the title to one
who had acquired full dominion over it.” 210 U. S., at 349–350.
</blockquote>
<p>
And here's a serious smackdown of the "if I can make money doing it, copyright should protect it" theory of law:

<blockquote>
<p>
Third, Wiley and the dissent claim that a nongeographical interpretation will make it difficult, perhaps impossible, for publishers (and other copyright holders) to divide
foreign and domestic markets. We concede that is so. A
publisher may find it more difficult to charge different
prices for the same book in different geographic markets.
But we do not see how these facts help Wiley, for we can
find no basic principle of copyright law that suggests that
publishers are especially entitled to such rights.

<b>Update</b>: a great comment from Shrikant, below: 
<p>
<blockquote>
It would appear that the Supreme Court has essentially just paraphrased Robert Heinlein from Life-Line:
<p>
"There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary to public interest. This strange doctrine is not supported by statute or common law. Neither individuals nor corporations have any right to come into court and ask that the clock of history be stopped, or turned back."
