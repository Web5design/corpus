Tommy sez, "I made this film clip with a great photographer friend of mine and it took two takes. That means I had to eat TWO CAKES.

I ended up eating so much confetti and glitter that I had a glittery poo the next day. But it was all worth it as backwards eating really can end up looking quite beautiful.

Thankfully the clip was not about the glittery poo."

On the <em>Guardian</em>, Charles Arthur has totted up the lifespan of 39 products and services that Google has killed off in the past due to insufficient public interest. One interesting finding is that Google is becoming less patient with its less popular progeny, with an accelerating trend to killing off products that aren't cutting it. This was occasioned by the launch of Google Keep, a networked note-taking app which has the potential to become quite central to your workflow, and to be quite disruptive if Google kills it -- much like Google Reader, which is scheduled for impending switch-off.

<blockquote>

So if you want to know when Google Keep, opened for business on 21 March 2013, will probably shut - again, assuming Google decides it's just not working - then, the mean suggests the answer is: 18 March 2017. That's about long enough for you to cram lots of information that you might rely on into it; and also long enough for Google to discover that, well, people aren't using it to the extent that it hoped. Much the same as happened with Knol (lifespan: 1,377 days, from 23 July 2008 to 30 April 2012), or Wave (1,095 days, from May 2009 - 30 April 2012) or of course Reader (2,824 days, from 7 October 2005 to 1 July 2013).
<p>

If you want to play around further with the numbers, then if we assume that closures occur randomly as a normal distribution around the mean, and that Google is going to shut Google Keep, then there's a 68% chance that the closure will occur between April 2015 and February 2019. Even the later date wouldn't be much longer than Evernote - which is still growing - has already lasted. Is Google really that committed to Keep?
</blockquote>

It's been more than a year since the <em>WSJ</eM> reported that Skype leaks its users' IP addresses and locations. Microsoft has done nothing to fix this since, and as Brian Krebs reports, the past year has seen the rise of several tools that let you figure out someone's IP address by searching for him on Skype, then automate launching denial-of-service attacks on that person's home.

<blockquote>
<p>


In the above screen shot, we can see one such service being used to display the IP address most recently used by the Skype account “mailen_support” (this particular account belongs to the tech support contact for Mailien, a Russian pharmacy spam affiliate program by the same name).

<p>
Typically, these Skype resolvers are offered in tandem with “booter” or “stresser” services, online attack tools-for-hire than can be rented to launch denial-of-service attacks (one of these services was used in an attack on this Web site, and on that of Ars Technica last week). The idea being that if you want to knock someone offline but you don’t know their Internet address, you can simply search on Skype to see if they have an account. The resolvers work regardless of any privacy settings the target user may have selected within the Skype program’s configuration panel.
<p>
Beyond exposing one’s Internet connection to annoying and disruptive attacks, this vulnerability could allow stalkers or corporate rivals to track the movement of individuals and executives as they travel between cities and states.

 A chorus of cheers rings out the minute you pull up. Tailgating will never be the same now that your Bulleit Frontier Whiskey Woody-Tailgate Trailer is on the scene. Designed by interior designer Brad Ford, it's impressive on the outside, but what's on the inside truly astounds: sleek leather furnishings and details from Moore &#038; Giles, rich wood finishings (handcrafted from reclaimed Bulleit Bourbon casks), elegant glassware, and a top-notch entertainment system, including a flat-screen TV, Blu-ray Disc™ player, and a state-of-the-art sound system, plus a one-year supply of Bulleit Bourbon and Bulleit Rye*. You park, open the hatch, and slide out the bar—cocktails anyone?

Bulleit is delicious bourbon, but I recently bought a bottle of Elmer T Lee Single Barrel and holy cats, is that stuff astounding.

According to <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/a_celebration_of_paris_is_burning_with_peaches_christ_and_latrice_royale">Niall Connolly at Dangerous Minds</a>, "If you have not seen <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QJ89VU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B007QJ89VU&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=boingboing06-20"><em>Paris Is Burning,</em></a> you’re just not doing it right. I’m talking Life, honey."



<blockquote>I’ve written about <em>Paris Is Burning </em>before, and referenced it in <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/06/ballroom.html">my recent ballroom piece for Boing Boing</a>, but the truth is that the impact of this film on gay culture, and by extension culture at large, cannot be overestimated. That a film about underground drag culture and voguing resonated so strongly amongst gays should not be a surprise, but what is surprising is how far its influence has spread in “straight” circles. Its language and imagery are now common parlance, and it won a recent <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/blog/2012/11/the-greatest-documentaries-of-all-time/#.UUyTXM2zcxp">PBS “best documentary” poll</a> by an overwhelming landslide.</p><p>Which is why I was so delighted to see Paris Is Burning get recent a Midnight Mass screening in San Francisco, hosted by the queens Peaches Christ and Latrice Royale.</p></blockquote>

<p>
A NY federal judge handed down <a href="https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/ap_v._meltwater_sdny_copy.pdf">a terrible ruling</a> in <em>AP vs Meltwater</em>, which turned on whether providing a search-engine for newswire articles that showed the first sentence or two of the article was fair use. The Electronic Frontier Foundation's Corynne McSherry sums up many of the ways in which this judge got it wrong. We can only hope for an appeal and a better ruling.

<blockquote>
<p>
Second, the court implicitly adopted AP’s dangerous “heart of the work” theory.  AP contended that sharing excerpts of a news article must weigh against fair use if those excerpts contain the lede.  The court stressed that the lede is “consistently important” and takes “significant journalistic skill to craft.” But that is beside the point – there is no extra protection because something is extra difficult. More important to the fair use analysis is the fact that (1) is primarily factual; and (2) contains precisely the information the user wishes to make known to others. As we explained in our amicus brief, this case illustrates why the heart of the work doctrine does not mesh well with highly factual, published, news articles. When it comes to news articles, an excerpt that is shared will very often be the most “important” aspect of the work – but that importance will derive from the uncopyrightable factual content, not the expression. It is not the “heart of the work,” but a piece of the factual skeleton upon which the expression hangs.

<p>
As <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/guatemala-genocide-trial-conti.html">I've been blogging here on Boing Boing this week</a>, former Guatemalan Army general and de facto dictator <a href="http://www.riosmontt-trial.org/">Efraín Rios Montt and ex-military intelligence chief Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez are on trial</a> over charges of <a href="http://www.riosmontt-trial.org/trial-background/">genocide</a>. 
<p>
A Guatemalan judge ruled in January that Montt must stand trial; his lawyer said his defense would be that he wasn't personally on the battlefield and couldn't control what happened there. I've been listening in to the trial via a live audio stream, and their cross-questioning of Ixil Maya witnesses suggests that this remains their plan.<p><span id="more-220500"></span>

The documentary film "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/granito/watch-granito-online.php#.UUyITVt4Z0I">Granito:How to Nail a Dictator</a>" is streaming online for free, and you should see it if you're interested in the United States' role in the atrocities of Guatemala's 36-year civil war. In the clip above, filmmaker Pamela Yates "finds an outtake from her 1982 interview with the then President that puts a lie to that claim."
<p>
That interview was for Yates' earlier film on the Guatemalan Civil War, "When The Mountains Tremble," which you can also <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/granito/when-the-mountains-tremble.php#.UUy3JVt4Z0I">watch online for free, here</a>.
<p>
The interview with Montt was filmed in 1982. In vivid testimonial over the last few days, witnesses in the trial have been describing atrocities that his troops carried out against men, women, and children during that very same year.
<p>
<a href="http://skylight.is/journal/#juiciogenocidios">Yates blogged earlier today</a> that bootleggers outside of the Guatemala City courtroom are selling copies of "Granito," retitled as "A greater story never told." 

<p>
"There is no honor or award that could surpass this endorsement of our film by the Guatemalan people," <a href="http://skylight.is/journal/#juiciogenocidios">Yates writes</a>,  "Bootleggers all over the world are tuned in to their cultures, and what people want to see and hear."
<p>
"Having your film bootlegged in a country is a great affirmation of its value in that society, whether it be for entertainment or in this case, hunger for a suppressed history and the restoration of collective memory.  The street price, by the way, is 10 Guatemalan Quetzales (US$1.25)."<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~4/Pjc8AFcmgMg" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><description>An outtake from "Granito:How to Nail a Dictator" which disproves claims by the defense for Guatemalan ex-dictator Rios Montt that he had no control over the Army.</description><wfw:commentRss xmlns:wfw="http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/">http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/rios-montt-i-control-the-ar.html/feed</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments xmlns:slash="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/">0</slash:comments><feedburner:origLink>http://boingboing.net/2013/03/22/rios-montt-i-control-the-ar.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Prosecutors call for inaccurate groundhog's death</title><link>http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/GbtBaK0bo-Y/prosecutors-call-for-inaccurat.html</link><category>Post</category><category>groundhog</category><category>law</category><category>Weird</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rob Beschizza</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 11:41:14 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://boingboing.net/?p=220497</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>After an unexpectedly cold start to March, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/03/22/ohio-prosecutors-indict-punxsutawney-phil-over-early-spring-forecast-seek-death/">authorities in Ohio have called for the indictment and execution of the groundhog</a> whose report promised an early end to winter.

Vera Greentea and Laura Muller's "Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits" is an indie comic (funded by a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/veragreentea/nenetl-of-the-forgotten-spirits-part-1-of-comic-mi">very successful Kickstarter</a>) that spans four issues. The first issue, just out ($6), is a nice, deceptively gentle entree into what promises to be a proper kick-in-the-teeth bit of horror about the Mexican Day of the Dead.

<blockquote>
<p>
Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits is a spirited horror story about a ghost searching for her family during the festival of the Day of the Dead, while dodging ambitious exorcist apprentices. Vera Greentea (Recipes for the Dead, To Stop Dreaming of Goddesses) and talented artist Laura Müller (Mega Man Tribute, Subway to Sally Storybook) collaborate to create an autumn-friendly tale of skulls and hope. The first issue introduces the vivacious but forgotten ghost girl, Nena, as she explores the labyrinthine streets of Mexico during its most eerily evocative celebration and Bastian, the first of the exorcists speeding after her – completely for the wrong reason.

Apparently this <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/03/21/ontario-premier-to-investigate-game-with-pipeline-bombing-on-taxpayer-funded-broadcasters-website/">made some blowhards angry</a>, who think that "tax dollars funded the game" and shouldn't fund a game about blowing up pipelines, and that the developer donating to a non-profit charity somehow constitutes an ethics violation, having received so-called "tax-dollar funding". 


Tax breaks and grants and things are available to all sorts of content and media producers in Canada. Game development and film production and the like are industries that are very active here. It's also not illegal to donate proceeds to non-profit charities.

<p>Matt Novak (aka<a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/paleofuture/"> Paleofuture</a>) is a historian and blogger who writes about the history of innovation and the history of the way we imagine the future. A couple of weeks ago, at South by Southwest, he gave a fascinating presentation that I wanted you guys to hear more about.</p>

<p>The basic thesis: Tesla vs. Edison &mdash; UR DOIN IT WRONG.</p>

<p>Whether you think Tesla > Edison or Edison > Tesla, Novak says you're missing something important. In reality, technology isn't shaped by one guy who had one great idea and changed the world. Instead, it's a messy process, full of flat-out failures and not-quite-successes, and populated by many great minds who build off of and are inspired by each other's work. This is about more than just getting history right. Letting go of The Great Man paradigm has implications for everything from copyright law, to how we go about innovation today. When we focus too much on Great Men, Novak says, we lose sight of what innovation actually looks like ... and we impede our ability to build the future.</p>

Ronaldo Lemos sez,

<blockquote>
<p>
The Competition Authority in Brazil (CADE) convicted om March 20th the country's six major collecting societies and their central office (ECAD) - responsible for the collection of music royalties for public performance in Brazil - of formation of cartel and abuse of dominant position in fixing prices. According CADE, the Ecad and its associations not only organized to abusively fix prices, but also created barriers of entry for new associations to join the entity. 
<p>
All entities will have to pay a fine of R$38 million (approximately US$ 20 million) and will have to reorganize the whole collection system, both by offering arrangements beyond the "blanket license" model, the only license ECAD and their associations made available for the performance of music, and by allowing each association to compete for different prices.
<p>
The rapporteur of the Case, Elvino Mendonça, said after the conviction: "The behavior of cartel is visible. The current collection system prevents all forms of competition. ECAD and its associations abused their market power and fixed prices. The evidence is abundant."

Efrain Ríos Montt, the former de facto dictator of Guatemala, is in court today for the third day of his trial on charges of genocide against some 2,000 Ixil Maya during the country's 36-year civil war. <a href="http://radio.cmiguate.org/">Listen here</a>, or <a href="http://paraqueseconozca.blogspot.mx/">watch here</a>. I also <a href="https://twitter.com/xeni/guate-genocide-trial">created this Twitter list</a> so you can follow the accounts of people live-tweeting from the courtroom (or listening to the audio/video stream, where dialogue is in Spanish and Ixil Maya only).
<p>
As you can see for yourself on the video stream, the ex-general is sitting and listening in the courtroom while prosecution witnesses, Ixil Maya victims, recount in gruesome detail the atrocities they survived under his regime. <p>As I type this blog post, an Ixil woman, Cecilia Sánchez Sánchez, is breaking down in tears as she retells the story of how on one day in 1982, her husband, two sons, and baby were murdered, her home burned, and "flying instruments" (helicopters) swarmed overhead, dropping bombs on the villagers. <p>Did you ever see your husband again, the interrogator asks her. "No, I only went to carry away his bones."

This tribunal is the first and only genocide trial in history held in a domestic court against a former head of state, and is a huge historic moment for Guatemala. It's also an important moment for the United States. <p>

Our military and our government were intimately involved in orchestrating, funding, and propping up to power the Guatemalan generals who led the bloody civil war that killed at least 200,000, and left tens of thousands more "disappeared." <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/03/20/genocide-trial-begins-in-guate.html#previouspost">Montt was trained</a> in the US Army's own School of The Americas, and aided by our CIA under the Reagan administration.<p>

<a href="http://www.theworld.org/2013/03/genocide-trial-in-guatemala-a-tribute-to-tenacity-of-indigenous-groups/">PRI's The World has a good interview</a> with Kate Boyle of the Guatemala Documentation Project for the National Security Archive, who has been monitoring the proceedings and has been working for years to help preserve the evidence that makes this process possible. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2007/01/31/npr-xeni-tech-guatem-2.html">I reported on some of that work for NPR</a>. <p>
But denial persists. Supporters of Montt and the military legacy he represents call the trial a form of political persecution or "political lynching," and deny that any genocide took place. <a href="http://cacif.org.gt/index.php?option=com_content&#038;view=article&#038;id=953%20888&#038;Itemid=468&#038;lang=es">Here is one such example</a>.<p>

<a href="http://nisgua.blogspot.com/">NISGUA</a> has been liveblogging the proceedings, too. <a href="http://www.nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/genocide-on-trial-in-guatemala-ixil.html">Day 1</a>, <a href="http://nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/genocide-on-trial-in-guatemala-day-2.html">Day 2</a>, <a href="http://nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/genocide-on-trial-in-guatemala-day-3.html">Day 3</a>.<p>

<a href="http://nisgua.blogspot.com/2013/03/genocide-on-trial-in-guatemala-day-3.html">From today's NISGUA post</a>, a powerful documentation that I encourage you to read:


<p>
<blockquote>Survivor testimony continued on the third day of former dictator Efraín Rios Montt and intelligence chief Rodriguez Sánchez's trial for genocide and crimes against humanity. Hours of intense first-person accounts of violence and endurance left impressions of profound grief: "They killed our fathers, our mothers, and everything we loved," said one witness; as well as resolute purpose: "I am one of the few survivors. Perhaps I was sent to be the messenger of the story here."
</blockquote>

Outside the courtroom, <a href="http://skylight.is/journal/#juiciogenocidios">bootleggers are selling copies</a> of a documentary film credited with helping to bring Montt to trial. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/granito/granito-de-arena-como-atrapar-a-un-dictador.php#.UUyH-lt4Z0J">You can watch the film online here</a>. Snip from the filmmakers' blog:



<blockquote><img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/130319-GRANITO-PIRATA-300x225.jpeg" alt="" title="130319-GRANITO-PIRATA-300x225" width="300" height="225" class="bordered alignright size-full wp-image-220445" />

Guatemalan bootleggers at the scene saw this as an opportunity to sell pirated DVDs of our film <a href="http://skylight.is/films/granito/"><em>Granito: How to Nail a Dictator</em></a>, which tells the story of how our film became evidence in the genocide case.  If you look closely at the text at the top of the DVD, it says “UNA HISTORIA MAS GRANDE JAMAS CONTADA” (“A GREATER STORY NEVER TOLD”).  There is no honor or award that could surpass this endorsement of our film by the Guatemalan people.  Bootleggers all over the world are tuned in to their cultures, and what people want to see and hear.  Having your film bootlegged in a country is a great affirmation of its value in that society, whether it be for entertainment or in this case, hunger for a suppressed history and the restoration of collective memory.  The street price, by the way, is 10 Guatemalan Quetzales (US$1.25).
</blockquote>
<p>

The filmmakers are <a href="http://skylightpictures.createsend1.com/t/ViewEmail/r/A40BB96EB86AC6B12540EF23F30FEDED/344015CC2E56C5B59A8E73400EDACAB4">encouraging people to send emails</a> imploring the US Ambassador to Guatemala to attend the trial. <p>
There's a <a href="http://blog.witness.org/2013/01/nail-a-dictator/">powerful first-person essay by Yates</a> about the making of that documentary here, on the Witness.org blog. In fact, out-takes from that film were used by the prosecution to build their case against Montt:




<blockquote>The lawyers were as surprised as we were when they saw the outtakes.. In 1982, I had asked: “What would you say to the charges that it’s the Army that is massacring (Maya) peasants in the highlands? Is there repression on the part of the Army?”
<P>
Ríos Montt responded, “There is no repression on the part of the Army. Our strength is in our capacity to make command decisions. The Army is ready and able to act, because if I don’t control the Army, then what am I doing here?”


<P>
My filmic evidence helped prove the prosecution’s command responsibility liability theory: Ríos Montt ordered the targeted killings.</blockquote>

LA video artist Michael Haussman recorded human bodies bouncing up and down at 2000 fps, synching the camera to the movement so that the people appear to be standing still while gravity mercilessly attempts to separate their meat from their bones. Add in some spooky music and it's like watching someone in the first stages of being torn to shreds by angry, invisible poltergeists.
<blockquote>
<p>
This slow motion study reveals the shocking effects of gravity upon our body. What is normally missed in the blink of an eye, is poetically recorded in extreme slow motion, as gravity takes hold and pulls the body down to earth, causing the skin, cellulite, muscles and facial expression to sag down, with a weariness, as if the subject has suddenly aged thirty years. It appears like a special effect, the force ripples from the legs up, turning the body wrinkled and saggy, with a worn, older face that is defeated and depressed. Then the exact opposite effect and emotion overcomes the subject as they are made weightless and set free. We observe the body becoming youthful, rejoicing in it’s expression and flawless skin texture, as it sores away from the earth. All physical and emotional expressions seem to float effortlessly upward in a positive, beautiful direction.

<p>Lucy Meadows was a teacher. Born male, Lucy transitioned to female later in life, a process that was supported by her employers. Writing at the <em>Daily Mail</em>&mdash;one of Britain's largest-circulation newspapers&mdash;Richard Littlejohn <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">publicly denounced her</a> in terms usually reserved for child abusers. Not long afterward, <a href="http://www.st-marymagdalens.lancs.sch.uk/">Meadows killed herself</a>.<span id="more-220394"></span>

<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em> took the article down upon Meadows' death, but <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121226073921/http:/www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2251347/Nathan-Uptons-wrong-body--hes-wrong-job.html">here it is at archive.org</a>, and here's a representative excerpt.

<blockquote><p>
What are you staring at, Johnny? Move along, nothing to see here. Get on with your spelling test. Today’s word is ‘transitioning’.

<p>Mr Upton/Miss Meadows may well be comfortable with his/her decision to seek a sex-change and return to work as if nothing has happened. The school might be extremely proud of its ‘commitment to equality and diversity’.

<p>But has anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren’t equipped to compute this kind of information. ...

<p>It should be protecting pupils from some of the more, er, challenging realities of adult life, not forcing them down their throats.

<p>These are primary school children, for heaven’s sake. Most them still believe in Father Christmas. Let them enjoy their childhood. They will lose their innocence soon enough. ... Nathan Upton is entitled to his gender reassignment surgery, but he isn’t entitled to project his personal problems on to impressionable young children.
</blockquote>

<p>You want to point out that children don't do this at all, that prejudices centered on complex cultural issues are learned from adults. You want to wonder at those who would hound people who are already widely victimized, yet remove evidence of their ostensibly principled beliefs when their targets suffer the predictable effects. You want to remark on what a miracle it is that steps toward libel reform can take place at all. You want to wonder at how the children feel at the death of their teacher, children to whom suicide must now be explained.

<p>But most of all, you just want to see Britain lose its interest in the opinions of people like Richard Littlejohn.<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~4/Z4uAKLeHiEY" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><description>Lucy Meadows was a teacher.

I've written here before that the impending UK press-regulation rules coming in as a result of the Leveson report will inadvertently end up treating bloggers and other everyday Internet users as though they were newspapers, exposing them to the threat of arbitration proceedings where they will have to pay the legal costs of people who want to silence them, and be subject to "exemplary damages" -- enormous statutory fines that grossly exceed any actual harm caused. 
<p>
Now the Open Rights Group has started a campaign to warn party leaders about this in the three days we have left before Leveson becomes law. We need your help now, or bloggers and the open Internet will become collateral damage in the campaign to control Britain's awful tabloids. 
<p>
Jim from ORG writes, "The Leveson regulations are being applied to UK websites -- in ways that could catch more or less anyone who publishes a blog. Ordinary bloggers could be threatened with exemplary damages and costs. If this happens, small website publishers will face terrible risks, or burdensome regulation -- and many may simply stop publishing."

<p>Peter Clines is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804136572/boingboing">Ex-Heroes</a>, a science fiction novel about super humans trying to save what remains of Los Angeles in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Above, the cover for the Clines' upcoming follow-up novel: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804136599/boingboing">Ex-Patriots</a>. Below, an interview with Clines about his love of  Dr. Who. (Keep your eye out for 3 Doctor Who Novels coming out April 2: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038534676X/boingboing">Plague of the Cybermen</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385346786/boingboing">Shroud of Sorrow</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385346743/boingboing">The Dalek Generation</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>Originally published by a small, print-on-demand press without any publicity or marketing support and almost no physical distribution, Peter Clines&rsquo;s brilliant novels, <em>Ex-Heroes</em> and the forthcoming <em>Ex-Patriots</em> -- which combine the best of the sci-fi, thriller, horror, and adventure fiction genres -- still managed to draw an incredible cult following. Now, Broadway is thrilled to introduce <em>Ex-Heroes</em> and <em>Ex-Patriots</em> to a whole new slew of fans with the release of these paperback originals. With two more novels to follow in the series, including <em>Ex-Communication</em> (July 9, 2013), <em>Ex-Heroes</em> and <em>Ex-Patriots</em> are sure to appeal to fans of such hits as <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>World War Z</em>, and Ready <em>Player One</em>.</blockquote>



<p><h4>How big of a role did <i>Doctor Who</i> play in your decision to become a writer?</h4></p>

<p>It was a huge influence. I watched the show religiously as a kid, and even then I was aware that a good story could really help make up for cheap sets and rubber monsters (pay attention, SyFy!). I got chills from cliffhanger endings in &ldquo;The Face of Evil&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Horror of Fang Rock.&rdquo; Davros in &ldquo;Genesis of the Daleks&rdquo; was the first time I ever realized a character was evil. I always knew they were the bad guys out there, but Michael Wisher as Davros was just pure evil. And I loved the brilliant plot-twists that could be either scary or kind of sad and dramatic. Not to mention the fact that the whole show is about someone who gave up their life so they could try to make a difference. </p>

<p>It was just fantastic storytelling, and it made me want to tell stories that would get the same reactions from people. </p><span id="more-220148"></span><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385346786/boingboing">
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/ShroudSorrow.jpg" class="alignright">
</a><h4>Of all of the actors who played Doctor Who, which was your favorite?</h4></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say Tom Baker. The scarf, the hat, a dozen layers of clothing... that&rsquo;s always going to be the Doctor to me. I think Doctor Who is a lot like James Bond&mdash;the first one you&rsquo;re ever exposed to is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; one and then other actors get brought in to play the part as time goes by.</p>

<p><h4>Why do you think the character and story continues to thrill fans, old and new alike?</h4></p>

<p>The TARDIS and time travel are fun, the monsters are exciting, but at the end of the day I think it&rsquo;s the honest sense that the Doctor just wants to help people. He doesn&rsquo;t care about politics or procedure or social classes (he&rsquo;s really the antithesis of the Prime Directive). He just wants people everywhere to have good, happy lives, and he gave up his whole life on Gallifrey because he thought he should try to make that happen. That sort of selflessness is something everyone can admire. </p>

<p>I mean, what&rsquo;s one of the running gags in the series? When the Doctor needs someone out of the way, do they vanish mysteriously? Do they have an accident? Do they get fired? No, when he needs someone out of the way, they win the lottery. A recurring plot point in the show is that the Doctor gives people the life they&rsquo;ve always dreamed of just so that he can get on with what he&rsquo;s focused on doing.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/038534676X/boingboing">
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/PlagueCybermen.jpg" class="alignleft"></a><h4>What do you think is the Doctor&rsquo;s real name? Go ahead, guess. </h4></p>

<p>I would have no idea. I feel confident it isn&rsquo;t Steve, Brett, or Cliff. I like that they&rsquo;re pushing an idea from the Sylvester McCoy years, that the Doctor might be something bigger and greater than &ldquo;just&rdquo; a Time Lord. Because there&rsquo;s something fantastic and kind of scary about the idea that being the nigh-immortal last survivor of the oldest race in the universe is your cover story...</p>

<p>I could prove my geekiness by pointing out that his school nickname was Theta Sigma. And I didn&rsquo;t even have to look that up. I could even name the episode.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385346743/boingboing">
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DalekGeneration.jpg" class="alignright">
</a><h4>If you could cast anyone as the next incarnation of the Doctor, who would it be? </h4></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. Lots of people want to see female Doctors and other-ethnicity Doctors, and while I don&rsquo;t see any story-logic problem with that I do think it&rsquo;d probably alienate a lot of fans. I always thought Richard Grant would make a fantastic Doctor, except now he&rsquo;s sort of been the Doctor, so that probably wouldn&rsquo;t go over well. Then again, Lalla Ward played a princess and later became the second Romana, with the logic being she was using the princess as sort of a regeneration template.</p>

<p>Y&rsquo;know who&rsquo;d be a great Doctor? Martin Freeman, from <i>Sherlock</i> and <i>The Hobbit</i>. He&rsquo;s got an ability to seem completely harmless and extremely dangerous. That&rsquo;s a fantastic quality for a Doctor.</p>

<p>
A recent and most welcome addition to the series is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B4HCM4K/downandoutint-20">MAD: Artist's Edition</a>, a spectacular tribute to the early years of the magazine and especially to the brilliant satire of Harvey Kurtzman, one of the great heroes of satire, which features an introduction by Terry Gilliam himself.
<p>
<em>MAD: Artist's Edition</em> isn't just an amazing book, it's an amazing <em>object</em>, a massive and weighty presence that drew me magnetically to it as soon as I got it back to my office. I spent the next several hours on a rug on the floor with it, clambering all around it (it's much easier to move yourself than a book this size!)</font>, marvelling and delighting at it. I snapped a few highlights (<a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/tags/artistsedition/">full-rez photos here</a>)</font> to give you a sense of what's going on here. 
<p>

<font size="-1">(<em>Love, Kurtzman style -- from <b>Shadow!</b></em>)</font>
<p>
Let's start with the obvious: Kurtzman was a genius of parody, with a wolvertonian grasp of the grotesque and a sense of humor that was capable of expressing itself in both broad and subtle strokes. This was a man who could capture both drama and comedy, as in this sequence from <em>Smilin' Melvin'</em>, where the punchline is just a lagniappe on top of a sequence that is as illustrative as it is absurd:
<p>

<p>
And Prince Valiant is reproduced with pitch-perfect veracity, even when he's holding his ass and screaming in agony:

<font size="-1">(<em>Love the gothic lettering on the onomatopoeia, from <b>Prince Violent</b></em>)</font>
<p>
It's that veering between styles and modes that really makes this stuff sing. Is Howdy Doody a daemonic possessed toy, or a agent of commercial forces bent at getting kids hooked on booze? Why choose?
<p>
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8579111529_4e0d689c28_z1.jpg" class="bordered"><br />
<font size="-1">(<em>Stare into the eyes of madness, from <b>Howdy Doo-It?</b></em>)</font>
<p>
Not only could Kurtzman strike some wolvertonian notes, he could also write some spectacular material for Wolverton to illustrate, like the series of full-page spreads dedicated to portraits of typical MAD readers:
<p>
<img src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/8579106461_acd3f37059_z1.jpg" class="bordered"><br />
<font size="-1">(<em>Wolverton and Kurtzman, a match made on MADison Ave</em>)</font>
<p>
And since this is such a big ole compendium, the IDW folks saw fit to include these illos as finished inks, later in the book:

It's only the book's rather smashing price-tag <font size="-1">(north of $225)</font> that stopped me from grabbing a scalpel and hacking out some of the full-page sheets and the splashes, as every one of them would make a fantastic framed piece:

<font size="-1">(<em>Kurtzman's "Flesh Garden" is much classier than the pornographic "Flesh Gordon," which was a little too on-the-nose</em>)</font>
<p>
There's even a lavishly illustrated page of fake classifieds:
