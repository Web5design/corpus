		<description><![CDATA[The mommy board wars get vicious, but there are few topics that are infused with as much vitriol as circumcision. Some mother was clueless enough to ask a question on an anonymous board and chaos ensued. This post is from dcurbanmoms, a mommy board that has an entire board dedicated to nannies (more on that in another post). There was much anger and much posting of statements from medical professionals. That is to be expected. What is not to be expected is how far off the farm some of the... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/mommy-board-wars-circumcision/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a tale of the last week of my life, which has deteriorated to the point where I feel like a shut-in. I shall never see the sun again. I will resort to having groceries delivered and sneaking out to get the mail at night because I have developed a feral fear of other humans. Day 1 My husband leaves town for a business trip that is going to last a week. I am slightly panicky but reassure myself that we will be busy with school and activities so... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/trapped-in-the-house-with-sick-children/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

While my recipe doesn&#8217;t call for it, I threw in the pre-chopped up combination of onions, garlic and shallots. I thought the shallots would be such a nice flavor in this carbonara. I was right. This recipe initially intimidated me because of the raw eggs that are stirred into the pasta. However, after learning that the eggs cook if you stir them into piping hot pasta, fresh out of... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/trader-joes-5-item-meals-spaghetti-carbonara/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

Their crime? Failing to adequately address their plans to fix the notoriously ailing education in the city of Los Angeles. Both Garcetti and Greuel are locked in a tight contest for mayor of Los Angeles, with an election date of May 21st rapidly approaching.

I’ve heard her.&#8221; &#8220;Their dad buys them candy all the time.&#8221; I know you&#8217;ve heard statements just like this. Judging other parents should be a sport. It certainly goes on often enough. Judging goes on during playdates, on playgrounds, outside classrooms and on Mom’s night out.

		<description><![CDATA[My kids love pigs. Specifically, they love both Olivia and Peppa Pig. They can’t get enough of either pig. I’ve seen enough of both pigs to have wearied of the swine, but I thought I’d compare and contrast the two. It’s a pig-off! &#160; Family Both little piggies have happy, nuclear families. Peppa has only one brother while Olivia has two. Wait, scratch that. Olivia has a little brother and a little bother. This one is a draw. Self-involvement Olivia takes the prize for self-involvement. She is a very self-involved... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/olivia-versus-peppa-pig/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Sleep when the baby sleeps.&#8221; That&#8217;s what everyone told me. That&#8217;s great advice when you have the first baby. But, when you have the second baby soon after the first one, all bets are off. The toddler is up all day and the baby is up half the night. This results in a mother who quickly ends up on the brink of insanity. I, personally, remember being so tired that I was starting to slightly hallucinate. I was at home with the children. I don&#8217;t know what techniques I would... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/managing-the-exhaustion/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

Farrah was on the cast of the original Teen Mom, which ended its run in 2012.

MacKenzie Rosman, who played Ruthie,  is now 23. She’s done a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager and some feature films. She’s showing some skin this month for Maxim Magazine this month which is a little mentally disturbing. You can see pictures on her website.
