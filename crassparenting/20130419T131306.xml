		<description><![CDATA[This morning on my Facebook page, a dear friend posted a link of a letter a working mom wrote to her daughter (and to the world) in response to her daughter’s question: “do you love work more than you love my brother and me?”  What a gut-wrenching question for a mom to answer. Of course, the mom answered that she loved her kids more than work, but her reasoning just adds some fuel to the working mom/stay at home mom battles. Just so you know my bias: I am a... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/mommy-wars-working-vs-stay-at-home-moms-part-400/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son has been busy making his birthday list for days. He asked for a book that I thought, at first, was a joke. It turns out that I had a lot to learn. The book he asked for is called Farts Around the World. It is actually a real book. There are even two other books in the series: Farts in the Wild: A Spotter&#8217;s Guide Farts: A Spotter&#8217;s Guide While I was trying to find this book at the last minute, I found several other books that are along... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/books-that-make-kids-snicker/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Babies can be impossible when it comes to sleeping. They are up half the night demanding food or cuddles. Getting them to sleep can be one of the biggest hurdles for parents. The problem is, all babies are different and they adjust to sleeping differently. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be one magic answer for getting them to sleep. The difficulty involved in getting babies to sleep leads to another problem. Parents get lots and lots of advice about how to sleep. Here are some examples of sleeping advice I&#8217;ve heard:... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/the-sleeping-advice-assault/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am trying to plan a party for my son, who is turning seven in a few days. I am realizing how far over the top kids&#8217; birthdays have gotten. The last several birthday parties I have attended have been much fancier than anything I have the energy to plan. Today, birthday parties often include bringing in a magician, exotic animals, bounce houses, face-painting artists and other entertainment that is costly. If the birthday party is not held at the family&#8217;s home, then it has to be at an interesting... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/the-kids-birthday-party-competition/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The mommy board wars get vicious, but there are few topics that are infused with as much vitriol as circumcision. Some mother was clueless enough to ask a question on an anonymous board and chaos ensued. This post is from dcurbanmoms, a mommy board that has an entire board dedicated to nannies (more on that in another post). There was much anger and much posting of statements from medical professionals. That is to be expected. What is not to be expected is how far off the farm some of the... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/mommy-board-wars-circumcision/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a tale of the last week of my life, which has deteriorated to the point where I feel like a shut-in. I shall never see the sun again. I will resort to having groceries delivered and sneaking out to get the mail at night because I have developed a feral fear of other humans.

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I have to confess, there are actually six Trader Joe&#8217;s items in this meal, in addition to the pantry items. While my recipe doesn&#8217;t call for it, I threw in the pre-chopped up combination of onions, garlic and shallots. I thought the shallots would be such a nice flavor in this carbonara. I was right. This recipe initially intimidated me because of the raw eggs that are stirred into the pasta. However, after learning that the eggs cook if you stir them into piping hot pasta, fresh out of... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/trader-joes-5-item-meals-spaghetti-carbonara/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

Their crime? Failing to adequately address their plans to fix the notoriously ailing education in the city of Los Angeles. Both Garcetti and Greuel are locked in a tight contest for mayor of Los Angeles, with an election date of May 21st rapidly approaching. Eric Garcetti is the councilmember for District 13, and is known for his progressive policies... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/education-debate-in-the-l-a-mayoral-election/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

I’ve heard her.&#8221; &#8220;Their dad buys them candy all the time.&#8221; I know you&#8217;ve heard statements just like this. Judging other parents should be a sport.

		<description><![CDATA[My kids love pigs. Specifically, they love both Olivia and Peppa Pig. They can’t get enough of either pig. I’ve seen enough of both pigs to have wearied of the swine, but I thought I’d compare and contrast the two. It’s a pig-off! &#160; Family Both little piggies have happy, nuclear families. Peppa has only one brother while Olivia has two. Wait, scratch that. Olivia has a little brother and a little bother. This one is a draw. Self-involvement Olivia takes the prize for self-involvement. She is a very self-involved... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/olivia-versus-peppa-pig/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>
