		<description><![CDATA[Holly Madison gave birth to her daughter, Rainbow Brite Aurora a couple of few weeks ago and she’s already on the cover of inTouch Magazine debuting her little one. In the magazine, she talks about her birth and she makes me exceedingly jealous. She’s probably going to get some heat from the natural birth crowd, but she praises her epidural and makes her birth sound sort of fun. “Just holding her is so much fun,” Holly gushes in the new issue of In Touch, on newsstands now. “Even the delivery... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/i-wish-id-had-holly-madisons-birth/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

Her daughter was not in the car when she was arrested. She was arrested at 1 am, right after she nearly sideswiped a police car. Teen Mom 2 star Leah Calvert had her third baby, a girl, on February 4th.

		<description><![CDATA[Matt Damon and his wife are supposedly holding a huge vow-renewal ceremony. I have to confess that I really don&#8217;t understand this phenomenon. The only time I understand a vow-renewal ceremony is when a couple has split up for a while. I wouldn&#8217;t want to go through the stress and headache of a wedding again. Perhaps I&#8217;d feel differently if I hadn&#8217;t had a big wedding. I just don&#8217;t get the purpose of renewing vows. Did they not mean them the first time? Do vows expire?

		<description><![CDATA[This is Medication Safety Week and a new report by Safe Kids Worldwide details just how kids get their hands on potentially deadly medications. Each year more than half a million parents call poison control because their kids have taken medication not prescribed for them and more than 67,000 kids end up in the emergency room. This is a thirty percent increase in ER visits from a decade ago. Scary stuff. The study finds that the most common places kids get medication are on the floor or ground, in a... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/new-report-underscores-importance-of-safe-medication-storage/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds incredible, but St. Mary&#8217;s School District in Maryland has enacted bans on fun hugs, homemade food and birthday party invitations. However, once you take a look at the individual restrictions, and the fact that they aren&#8217;t final &#8211; they&#8217;re just recommendations, the headline-grabbing changes don&#8217;t seem as radical as they sound at first. The ban on homemade food isn&#8217;t actually designed to deprive children of cupcakes. Its a ban that has been enacted because of the rise in food allergies among children. Many schools across the country have... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/maryland-school-bans-hugs-and-cupcakes/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

She is uncomfortable, anxious, excited and a whole host of other feelings. I&#8217;m sure many of us know exactly what she is going through right now. I was told that kid #1 was going to be early by my ob as I was having contractions pretty early. So I was terribly prepared week 36 to have this child.  I distinctly remember waking up one morning in... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/advice-on-getting-thru-the-last-daysweeks-of-pregnancy/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

I peruse it occasionally because it is absolutely awful. But, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s not just terrible because of rich, entitled people. It’s also awful because the people who post on this forum don’t appear to have a filter between their brains and their keyboards. Here are some POPULAR posts that I found.

		<description><![CDATA[Hypnobabies is about as hip as it gets when it comes to childbirth trends. The course and the business that has grown up out of it are very popular among people who are focused on having an unmedicated birth. It all started as a home study course for pregnant women. It’s designed to ease their fear and discomfort during childbirth. It is supposed to teach the mother, through visualization and self-hypnosis, how to manage her discomfort, fear and pain during her labor and delivery. The home-study course costs around $150.... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/hypnobabies-is-a-hip-trend/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>
