		<description><![CDATA[Modern parenting is sometimes hard because you get so much information. There are a zillion things you could be doing wrong at any given moment. It’s easy to forget that in the hassle of things, there are many things that you are doing right. Take a moment and answer this question. What are you doing well? What are you proud of as a parent? Give yourself some credit. I&#8217;ll start: My kids are pretty polite. I&#8217;ve never let them have soda. I think they have a pretty good sense of... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/parenting-what-are-you-doing-right/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My second son has entered the terrible twos. I can tell because my sweet, sweet son screamed for an hour tonight, threw his dinner at me and refused to stop crying until he could sit on my lap and feed me crackers that I didn&#8217;t want to eat. I can&#8217;t believe it. I forgot how awful it is. The terrible two&#8217;s just descended on the house (AGAIN). He can&#8217;t really talk so I am not always sure what he is screaming about. Sometimes I know what he wants but he... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/terrible-twos-how-could-i-have-forgotten-how-awful-it-is/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sacred Pregnancy is a book written by Anni Daulter, a woman who has a child named Lotus. She’s also the editor of Sacred Pregnancy magazine, which I must find a copy of immediately (the current issue has an article on Feng Shui birth which I’m guessing is difficult to pull off in a hospital). She is a member of a Sacred Pregnancy community which involves a number of services in addition to the book and magazine. What is Sacred Pregnancy? In this article, Daulter says “We need to go back... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/the-sacred-pregnancy-movement/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The one thing I can count on at my house is that someone will make a mess. Some of the time I am the guilty party, but I always come clean about what I have done. I&#8217;ve never peed on the floor, wall, or rugs and if I did I would clean it up. So when the cleaning lady said someone was peeing all over the floor in the bathroom and on the walls, there were only a few suspects. I felt like I knew who was doing it, but... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/whose-pee-is-on-the-floor/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All parents want to prepare their daughters for a good life. One of the key goals of all parents is preventing their daughters from earning a living on the pole. Parents also want to prevent early grandchildren. So, with that in mind, I researched some books that will help keep your daughter on the straight and narrow: Secret Keeper: The Delicate Power of Modesty by Dannah Gresh. This book will help your daughter realize she is a masterpiece created by God and she has a jewel that she best protect.... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/books-that-will-keep-your-daughter-off-the-stripper-pole/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

I have compiled a list of the features such a car should have. Manufacturers should take note.

She always talks to other children and if she meets one of my husband&#8217;s or my friends, she talks to them as well. I love that she is so friendly, but the stuff that comes out of her mouth is enough to make you want to lock her in the attic until she is old enough to know better.

Here are a few  little-known, but completely wonderful fantasy films that&#8217;ll give your kid a leg-up on all her/his Hobbit-loving wannabe nerd pals. Also, they are pretty fun for adults too. All of these movies are adaptations from books and both the books and the DVDs are available on Amazon (just click on that that handy dandy link to your right). Extensive previews (and low quality versions of the first two films) are... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/movies-for-your-wee-nerd/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

A college counselor friend went to a psychic who said, &#8220;Your job is very very important to a very very small group of people.&#8221; Most nod politely when I tell them what I do. But parents and parents-to-be find my job fascinating and I&#8217;m often surprised when I get hit with questions about college admissions.
