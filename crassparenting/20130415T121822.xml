		<description><![CDATA[Ok, I have to confess, there are actually six Trader Joe&#8217;s items in this meal, in addition to the pantry items. While my recipe doesn&#8217;t call for it, I threw in the pre-chopped up combination of onions, garlic and shallots. I thought the shallots would be such a nice flavor in this carbonara. I was right. This recipe initially intimidated me because of the raw eggs that are stirred into the pasta. However, after learning that the eggs cook if you stir them into piping hot pasta, fresh out of... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/trader-joes-5-item-meals-spaghetti-carbonara/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

Their crime? Failing to adequately address their plans to fix the notoriously ailing education in the city of Los Angeles. Both Garcetti and Greuel are locked in a tight contest for mayor of Los Angeles, with an election date of May 21st rapidly approaching. Eric Garcetti is the councilmember for District 13, and is known for his progressive policies... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/education-debate-in-the-l-a-mayoral-election/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

I’ve heard her.&#8221; &#8220;Their dad buys them candy all the time.&#8221; I know you&#8217;ve heard statements just like this. Judging other parents should be a sport. It certainly goes on often enough. Judging goes on during playdates, on playgrounds, outside classrooms and on Mom’s night out.

		<description><![CDATA[My kids love pigs. Specifically, they love both Olivia and Peppa Pig. They can’t get enough of either pig. I’ve seen enough of both pigs to have wearied of the swine, but I thought I’d compare and contrast the two. It’s a pig-off! &#160; Family Both little piggies have happy, nuclear families. Peppa has only one brother while Olivia has two. Wait, scratch that. Olivia has a little brother and a little bother. This one is a draw. Self-involvement Olivia takes the prize for self-involvement. She is a very self-involved... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/olivia-versus-peppa-pig/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Sleep when the baby sleeps.&#8221; That&#8217;s what everyone told me. That&#8217;s great advice when you have the first baby. But, when you have the second baby soon after the first one, all bets are off. The toddler is up all day and the baby is up half the night. This results in a mother who quickly ends up on the brink of insanity. I, personally, remember being so tired that I was starting to slightly hallucinate. I was at home with the children. I don&#8217;t know what techniques I would... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/managing-the-exhaustion/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

There are rumors that in a desperate attempt to stay relevant, she filmed a naught movie with James Deen, the porno star who recently starred in a regular movie with Lindsay Lohan. Farrah was on the cast of the original Teen Mom, which ended its run in 2012. Since then, she&#8217;s made an attempt at being a singer and recently, there... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/there-might-be-a-teen-mom-porn/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

MacKenzie Rosman, who played Ruthie,  is now 23. She’s done a few episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager and some feature films. She’s showing some skin this month for Maxim Magazine this month which is a little mentally disturbing. You can see pictures on her website.

I told him, repeatedly, he could not have it. This did not stop him from constantly asking if he could have the phone. I continued to say no.

		<description><![CDATA[There’s nothing more fun than a good mommy war on the mommy boards. Anyone who hangs out on a mommy forum knows they happen all the time and they get out of hand fast. I may make this a regular feature since this is so entertaining. I found a great one on UrbanBaby. This thread has it all: religion, separation of church and state, butthurtness and small, individual wars breaking out. The thread got extremely long and very involved, but I&#8217;ve summarized some of the best parts of the war.... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/04/mommy-board-wars-the-religious-book-edition/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>
