		<description><![CDATA[Raising a nerd? Awesome! Want to give your wee nerd an intro into the genre of fantasy? Awesomer! Here are a few  little-known, but completely wonderful fantasy films that&#8217;ll give your kid a leg-up on all her/his Hobbit-loving wannabe nerd pals. Also, they are pretty fun for adults too. All of these movies are adaptations from books and both the books and the DVDs are available on Amazon (just click on that that handy dandy link to your right). Extensive previews (and low quality versions of the first two films) are... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/movies-for-your-wee-nerd/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

A college counselor friend went to a psychic who said, &#8220;Your job is very very important to a very very small group of people.&#8221; Most nod politely when I tell them what I do. But parents and parents-to-be find my job fascinating and I&#8217;m often surprised when I get hit with questions about college admissions. One colleague, on top of Machu Picchu, was peppered with questions about moving off of a wait list.  A friend attended the... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/getting-into-college-part-iii/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, it’s Easter time again.  And my understanding is that it isn’t just a time for a bell from Rome to bring chocolate eggs to a bunny in the United States who hangs out in malls and hides things that will go bad throughout the house and the yard causing children and pets to get sick. Unfortunately, that’s my understanding of Easter. See, I was raised by a single father who at times was slightly, shall we say, otherwise occupied when it came to celebrating holidays or anything else where... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/the-easter-watering-can/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People come out of the woodwork to offer helpful advice to pregnant women all the time. I thought I&#8217;d summarize some of the advice I&#8217;ve heard or may have gotten. This should be an excellent resource for all pregnant women. You should have a planned c-section so nothing goes wrong. You should have the baby naturally at home in the bathtub. Births outside of the hospital are dangerous. You should use a midwife. You  need a doula. You should see a reputable obstetrician.

		<description><![CDATA[The Duggars, famous for having 19 biological children, are actually considering adoption. They recently traveled to Asia and moved to consider adoption after visiting an orphanage in China. Apparently, the other Duggar kids are pushing them to consider adoption. Here&#8217;s the thing: people who follow the same extremely fundamentalist faith as the Duggars don&#8217;t typically consider adoption. There are those that believe that adopted children inheirit the sins of their parents. They often site the verse Exodus 20:5, which states: “For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/the-duggars-may-adopt/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

The group is holding a Father-Daughter Retreat that you might want to consider if your daughter is showing signs of rebellion, independence, self-awareness or any other worrisome behavior. Vision Forum has an interest in father-daughter relationships as they promote a belief system called &#8220;The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy&#8220;.

It&#8217;s an endless topic of discussion on playgrounds. Are you a lazy parent or a superior parent when it comes to food? Take our handy quiz. Milk I buy the milk that is on sale at the grocery store. I pay the extra couple of dollars for organic milk. I pay $5.00 for a half-gallon of organic, free-range milk at Whole Foods.

I, of course, have already gone overboard on the Easter baskets and I need to stay out of the stores until after the holiday. I am easily swayed by any cute stuffed animals and my children already have more than they need. I just can&#8217;t say no to a homeless duck or bunny. What are you doing for Easter? I love it because I have fond memories of it as a child. Are your kids... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/easter-week-open-thread/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered how the Duggar&#8217;s homeschool? You may have seen hints of it on the show &#8220;19 Kids and COunting&#8221;. Occasionally, you may hear the parents use phrases like &#8220;biblical world view&#8221; or discuss the importance of children learning self-control and reverence. This is all part of a method that they use called &#8220;Advanced Training Institute&#8221; (ATI) which is a popular homeschool program among very conservate Christians. ATI curriculum in all subjects is focused on a biblical perspective.

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel Martinez-Leffew is a 12 year old boy who lives in Northern California. He spent the first years of his life in foster care, and he was told he was unlikely to be adopted because of his genetic disorder, Goldenhar Syndrome. That all changed when he was adopted by Bryan Leffew and Jay Foxworthy. Daniel has made a heartfelt plea to Supreme Court Justice Roberts in light of the upcoming debates about marriage equality surrounding Proposition 8.
