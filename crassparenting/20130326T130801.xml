		<description><![CDATA[Feeding children isn&#8217;t just a necessity to keep them alive and healthy. It&#8217;s also a competition that clearly shows who is the best parent around. It&#8217;s an endless topic of discussion on playgrounds. Are you a lazy parent or a superior parent when it comes to food? Take our handy quiz. Milk I buy the milk that is on sale at the grocery store. I pay the extra couple of dollars for organic milk. I pay $5.00 for a half-gallon of organic, free-range milk at Whole Foods.

I, of course, have already gone overboard on the Easter baskets and I need to stay out of the stores until after the holiday. I am easily swayed by any cute stuffed animals and my children already have more than they need. I just can&#8217;t say no to a homeless duck or bunny. What are you doing for Easter? I love it because I have fond memories of it as a child. Are your kids... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/easter-week-open-thread/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered how the Duggar&#8217;s homeschool? You may have seen hints of it on the show &#8220;19 Kids and COunting&#8221;. Occasionally, you may hear the parents use phrases like &#8220;biblical world view&#8221; or discuss the importance of children learning self-control and reverence. This is all part of a method that they use called &#8220;Advanced Training Institute&#8221; (ATI) which is a popular homeschool program among very conservate Christians. ATI curriculum in all subjects is focused on a biblical perspective.

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel Martinez-Leffew is a 12 year old boy who lives in Northern California. He spent the first years of his life in foster care, and he was told he was unlikely to be adopted because of his genetic disorder, Goldenhar Syndrome. That all changed when he was adopted by Bryan Leffew and Jay Foxworthy. Daniel has made a heartfelt plea to Supreme Court Justice Roberts in light of the upcoming debates about marriage equality surrounding Proposition 8. You can check out his family&#8217;s blog for more information about the fight... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/watch-this-childs-poignant-plea-to-justice-roberts/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tandem nursing works just like tandem bikes. It’s nursing for two. It means the mother is nursing both a baby and an older child. It’s common among women who practice extended breastfeeding, which is breastfeeding an older child. It’s not uncommon for a mother who adheres to extended breastfeeding to nurse the child until the child decides to wean. This may happen anywhere between the ages of two to six. Advocates believe that extended breastfeeding gives the child many emotional and some physical benefits. So, when a newborn comes along,... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/tandem-nursing-would-you-do-it/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Holly Madison gave birth to her daughter, Rainbow Brite Aurora a couple of few weeks ago and she’s already on the cover of inTouch Magazine debuting her little one. In the magazine, she talks about her birth and she makes me exceedingly jealous. She’s probably going to get some heat from the natural birth crowd, but she praises her epidural and makes her birth sound sort of fun. “Just holding her is so much fun,” Holly gushes in the new issue of In Touch, on newsstands now. “Even the delivery... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/i-wish-id-had-holly-madisons-birth/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

The only time I understand a vow-renewal ceremony is when a couple has split up for a while. I wouldn&#8217;t want to go through the stress and headache of a wedding again. Perhaps I&#8217;d feel differently if I hadn&#8217;t had a big wedding. I just don&#8217;t get the purpose of renewing vows. Did they not mean them the first time? Do vows expire?

		<description><![CDATA[This is Medication Safety Week and a new report by Safe Kids Worldwide details just how kids get their hands on potentially deadly medications. Each year more than half a million parents call poison control because their kids have taken medication not prescribed for them and more than 67,000 kids end up in the emergency room. This is a thirty percent increase in ER visits from a decade ago. Scary stuff. The study finds that the most common places kids get medication are on the floor or ground, in a... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/new-report-underscores-importance-of-safe-medication-storage/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It sounds incredible, but St. Mary&#8217;s School District in Maryland has enacted bans on fun hugs, homemade food and birthday party invitations. However, once you take a look at the individual restrictions, and the fact that they aren&#8217;t final &#8211; they&#8217;re just recommendations, the headline-grabbing changes don&#8217;t seem as radical as they sound at first. The ban on homemade food isn&#8217;t actually designed to deprive children of cupcakes. Its a ban that has been enacted because of the rise in food allergies among children. Many schools across the country have... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/maryland-school-bans-hugs-and-cupcakes/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>
