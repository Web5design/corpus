		<description><![CDATA[The Duggars, famous for having 19 biological children, are actually considering adoption. They recently traveled to Asia and moved to consider adoption after visiting an orphanage in China. Apparently, the other Duggar kids are pushing them to consider adoption. Here&#8217;s the thing: people who follow the same extremely fundamentalist faith as the Duggars don&#8217;t typically consider adoption. There are those that believe that adopted children inheirit the sins of their parents. They often site the verse Exodus 20:5, which states: “For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/the-duggars-may-adopt/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

It&#8217;s an endless topic of discussion on playgrounds. Are you a lazy parent or a superior parent when it comes to food? Take our handy quiz. Milk I buy the milk that is on sale at the grocery store. I pay the extra couple of dollars for organic milk. I pay $5.00 for a half-gallon of organic, free-range milk at Whole Foods.

I, of course, have already gone overboard on the Easter baskets and I need to stay out of the stores until after the holiday. I am easily swayed by any cute stuffed animals and my children already have more than they need. I just can&#8217;t say no to a homeless duck or bunny. What are you doing for Easter?

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever wondered how the Duggar&#8217;s homeschool? You may have seen hints of it on the show &#8220;19 Kids and COunting&#8221;. Occasionally, you may hear the parents use phrases like &#8220;biblical world view&#8221; or discuss the importance of children learning self-control and reverence. This is all part of a method that they use called &#8220;Advanced Training Institute&#8221; (ATI) which is a popular homeschool program among very conservate Christians. ATI curriculum in all subjects is focused on a biblical perspective.

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel Martinez-Leffew is a 12 year old boy who lives in Northern California. He spent the first years of his life in foster care, and he was told he was unlikely to be adopted because of his genetic disorder, Goldenhar Syndrome. That all changed when he was adopted by Bryan Leffew and Jay Foxworthy. Daniel has made a heartfelt plea to Supreme Court Justice Roberts in light of the upcoming debates about marriage equality surrounding Proposition 8.

		<description><![CDATA[Tandem nursing works just like tandem bikes. It’s nursing for two. It means the mother is nursing both a baby and an older child. It’s common among women who practice extended breastfeeding, which is breastfeeding an older child. It’s not uncommon for a mother who adheres to extended breastfeeding to nurse the child until the child decides to wean. This may happen anywhere between the ages of two to six. Advocates believe that extended breastfeeding gives the child many emotional and some physical benefits. So, when a newborn comes along,... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/tandem-nursing-would-you-do-it/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

In the magazine, she talks about her birth and she makes me exceedingly jealous. She’s probably going to get some heat from the natural birth crowd, but she praises her epidural and makes her birth sound sort of fun. “Just holding her is so much fun,” Holly gushes in the new issue of In Touch, on newsstands now. “Even the delivery... <a href="http://crassparenting.com/2013/03/i-wish-id-had-holly-madisons-birth/">Read More &#187;</a>]]></description>

The only time I understand a vow-renewal ceremony is when a couple has split up for a while. I wouldn&#8217;t want to go through the stress and headache of a wedding again. Perhaps I&#8217;d feel differently if I hadn&#8217;t had a big wedding. I just don&#8217;t get the purpose of renewing vows. Did they not mean them the first time? Do vows expire?
