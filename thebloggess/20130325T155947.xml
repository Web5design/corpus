			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t a real post.  It&#8217;s just me catching you up on assorted shit in case you don&#8217;t read twitter.  Also?  Spoiler alert for my mom: I&#8217;m still alive.  No worries.</p>
<p>So yesterday I woke up at 3am with incredible pain in my chest like I&#8217;d been stomped on by a dozen brontosauruses who were giving piggie-back rides to grand pianos, and so after taking a shitload of aspirin I woke Victor up by thoughtfully screaming &#8220;<em>I&#8217;M DYING, YOU ASSHOLE</em>&#8221; because apparently I get kind of inappropriately angry when I&#8217;m hurty and scared.  Then we put Hailey in the car and sped down the road because we&#8217;re too stupid to just call for an ambulance.  Or at least, that&#8217;s what the police told us when they pulled us over for speeding.  Hailey was like &#8220;Are you guys going to go to jail?&#8221; and I was all &#8220;Only your father.  I&#8217;m not going to be alive that long.&#8221;  Or at least that&#8217;s what I said in my mind.  In real life I just whimpered, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine, bunny.  Go back to sleep.&#8221;  Then the ambulance came and I got a ride to the hospital but I was in too much pain to even tweet about it or to instagram an arty picture of my feet in front of the ambulance doors and that&#8217;s kind of th<em>e definition</em> of pain, in my opinion.  Then they hooked me up to a million monitors and the ambulance guy looked at the readings and was all &#8220;&#8230;<em>Oh</em>.&#8221;   And I was like, &#8220;<em>WHAT THE HELL DOES &#8216;OH&#8217; MEAN?</em>&#8221; and then he gave me some nitroglycerin to put under my tongue and I was all, &#8220;The explosive from Little House on the Prairie?&#8221; and he just stared at me and shoved the drug in my mouth and told the driver to go faster, but technically I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating because there was <em>totally</em> an episode of Little House on the Prairie where Pa had to drive a wagon of explosive nitroglycerin across a river, so I think the lesson here is that ambulance drivers need to be better versed in pop culture.  Also, nitroglycerin tastes like pain.  Which makes sense since it&#8217;s an explosive but they should really be like, &#8220;Hey, this is like a red-hot soaked in the blood of Satan but it will distract you from all of the Little House on the Prairie hallucinations you&#8217;re not having.  It&#8217;s totally normal to make your mouth feel like it&#8217;s betraying you for not spitting it out and punching me.  No worries.&#8221;  Then lots of other stuff happened but it all blended in together and I woke up in the hospital with needles and wires sticking everywhere and then many, many hours later the doctor told me that my heart was awesome and that I&#8217;d probably had a severe gallbladder attack or a panic attack, and then we went home and slept for several hours until we ended up in the Minor Emergency Center because both Victor <em>and</em> Hailey came down with minor infections.  So basically our whole family is falling to shit.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/finger.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18094 aligncenter" title="finger" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/finger.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>Today though we are all medicated up and we feel fine.  So fine, in fact, that we went to an antique store and I found this bear head and asked twitter to convince me not to buy it:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bear.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18092 aligncenter" title="bear" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bear.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>But they were useless because they wanted it as badly as I did, but then I noticed the price tag and I&#8217;m not about to spend $200 for something that doesn&#8217;t even come with a neck.  Instead I&#8217;m holding out for a half-bear that still has arms to hug you with, because I think that would be very comforting when you were having a bad day.  Then Victor was all &#8220;Bears don&#8217;t hug you.  They maul you&#8221; and I reminded him that there&#8217;s a reason they call the best hugs &#8220;bear hugs&#8221; and I wrote &#8220;Look for bear arms&#8221; on my to-do list.  I think this whole bear incident is a sign of my maturing financial wiles and Victor says it&#8217;s a sign of my declining mental health, but in the end we left without a dead bear so everyone wins.  Except the bear, I guess.</p>
<p>This whole post needs way more commas and is even more rambly than usual.  Side-effect of the nitroglycerin, I suspect.  That and exploding, probably.</p>
<p>PS.  Spell-check says that &#8220;rambly&#8221; isn&#8217;t a real word.  Obviously spell-check doesn&#8217;t read this blog.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m on book tour in <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Kansas City (Missouri)</a></strong>, which is apparently only minutes from Kansas City (Kansas) and is very confusing for everyone involved.  But while I&#8217;m away I&#8217;m running reruns.  Because I&#8217;m not clever enough to travel and write at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">************</p>
<p><strong>A series of voicemail messages I listened to a year and a half after they were sent because I don&#8217;t know how my phone works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yvonne:</strong> Argh.  This lady at the drugstore just coughed H1N1 all over my daughter.  Call me in 4 months when you actually get this.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll still be friends then.  Probably.</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving myself a message when I couldn&#8217;t find my journal to write in):</strong> Why don&#8217;t people use &#8220;let&#8217;c&#8221; as a contraction for &#8220;lettuce&#8221;?  It would save time.  This is me, by the way.  Not future-me though.  Just regular me.  Hope we&#8217;re doing well.</p>
<p><strong>My sister:</strong> Hey, someone in our family died but I&#8217;m not telling you over voicemail because that would be weird.  But you&#8217;re never going to get this because <em>you never listen to your voicemails.</em> It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sending a time-capsule into space that no one will ever find.  I though you were supposed to be the responsible one.</p>
<p><strong>My sister again: </strong>It&#8217;s mom&#8217;s birthday today.  I&#8217;m calling to remind you.  You owe me.</p>
<p><strong>me again:</strong> Hi.  This is just me pretending to be on the phone so that I don&#8217;t have to make eye contact with the crazy lady on Main who&#8217;s always talking to herself.  Except that technically I&#8217;m calling myself to leave myself a message so I&#8217;m basically doing the same thing.  <em>Fuck.</em> I bet this is just how the crazy lady got started.</p>
<p><strong>My sister again:</strong> It&#8217;s daddy&#8217;s birthday today.  I&#8217;m calling because you said that I didn&#8217;t remind you about mom&#8217;s birthday even though <em>I totally did</em>.  Does this phone even work?</p>
<p><strong>My sister again: </strong>Hey, did you know it&#8217;s your birthday?  My guess is &#8220;no&#8221; since I didn&#8217;t remind you.</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving a message to myself again): </strong>If dead people want to wear open toed shoes in their caskets do the morticians give them a pedicure or are you just stuck with however your feet looked when you die?  Do you have to pay extra for the death pedicure?  I should get a tattoo on my chest that says &#8220;Put me in feetie-pajamas when I die&#8221;.  That way I&#8217;m warm <em>and</em> I&#8217;m saving money.</p>
<p><strong>me again</strong>:  Okay, I just remembered that I don&#8217;t <em>have </em>any feetie-pajamas and it would suck if right before I died I ballooned up to like 500 pounds and Hailey was all &#8220;HER DYING WISH WAS TO HAVE FEETIE PAJAMAS&#8221; but they can&#8217;t find any in my size and so she spends all her time looking for enormous feetie-pajamas when she should just be taking care of herself.  Now I&#8217;m all depressed.  Forget the tattoo.  The tattoo was a terrible idea.</p>
<p><strong>Victor:</strong> WHY DON&#8217;T YOU EVER ANSWER YOUR PHONE?</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving a message to myself again): </strong>I was calling to remind you to write something funny about birds but then I got distracted by my own voice on the answering machine and now I don&#8217;t remember what I was going to say.  It was about birds, I think&#8230;?  Crap.  I lost it.  Way to go,<em> us.</em></p>
<p><strong>my sister again: </strong>It&#8217;s mom&#8217;s birthday today.  Honestly, <em>I don&#8217;t even know why I try.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Okay, why do you even <em>have</em> a phone?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my first time in Cincinatti and I asked if I could go on <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKRP_in_Cincinnati">WKRP</a></strong> to talk about the book but I was told that WKRP never really existed, which I think is code for &#8220;They don&#8217;t want you, Jenny.&#8221;  Also, now I can&#8217;t get the WKRP song out of my head.  And now, neither can you, probably.</p>
<p>But I did get one of my tv interviews back and so I&#8217;m sharing it here because you can only see my facial tic twice and that is a huge improvement from my first tour and so I need to show it off to someone.  Thank you for being that someone.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Today I&#8217;m on book tour in Dayton.</a></strong>  Come see me?  Please?</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m away I&#8217;m leaving you with Golden-Oldies, aka reruns.  But they&#8217;re old enough that they&#8217;re almost new again.  Sort of.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">************</p>
<p>People keep asking me what my New Year&#8217;s resolutions are and I tell them that I don&#8217;t have any and then they get all pissy because they assume that I think I don&#8217;t need to change but it&#8217;s really just that I&#8217;m too bored with myself to invest any more time thinking about me, and also because &#8220;What are your new year&#8217;s resolutions?&#8221; is kind of code for &#8220;So tell me what <em>you</em> think is wrong with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why my new resolution for 2011 is to get into something so blatantly reprehensible that when 2012 comes I will have an obvious choice for what I need to give up next year and I won&#8217;t be sitting here trying to figure out which one of my many vices is the most obvious to everyone else.   And then I&#8217;ll be all &#8220;This year I&#8217;m going to shoot up less heroin!&#8221;  Or stop burning books.  Or stop burning kittens.  Or stop burning books about kittens.  I haven&#8217;t really decided yet.  Whichever thing seems more likely to have people remark about how brave I am, probably.</p>
<p>PS.  You never realize how many terrible life-choices are in front of you until you think about how nice it will be to tell people you&#8217;ve given them up.  This is probably why so many people are shooting up heroin right now.</p>
<p>PPS.  OMG.  I GOT IT.  This year I vow to start shooting up kittens with heroin.  It&#8217;s gonna be a brave, brave 2012.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED: </strong> As requested, I drew up some <strong><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/thebloggess*">anti-kitten-heroin photocards</a></strong> that you could use to save money on birthday presents but no one bought any&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_9660" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 419px">
	<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/im_against_kittens_on_heroin_photocard-243326950741964410?rf=238233029691800410"><img class="size-full wp-image-9660 " title="I'm against kittens on heroin" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Im-against-kittens-on-heroin.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="322" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Click on the picture if you want one.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8230;so instead I made a whole different set of cards for people who <em>want</em> kittens to be on heroin&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_9661" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 425px">
	<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/im_for_kittens_on_heroin_photocard-243197914834106690?rf=238233029691800410"><img class="size-full wp-image-9661 " title="for kittens on heroin" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/for-kittens-on-heroin.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="314" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Or you could really confuse people by giving them one of each.</p>
</div>
<p>But then it turns out that no one bought any of those either.  Conclusion:  Heroin-kitten awareness is at an all time low, probably because we don&#8217;t have a sexy spokesperson attached.  Someone contact Neil Patrick Harris.</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;What the FUCK, lady?&quot;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong>  Several of you are not big vampire fans and are confusing True Blood&#8217;s Eric Northman with South Park&#8217;s Eric Cartman.  Which is ridiculous, because <em>why would my cat pretend to be a cartoon character?</em>  That&#8217;s fucking<em> ludicrous</em>, y&#8217;all.</p>
<div id="attachment_11549" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 350px">

	<p class="wp-caption-text">It&#39;s sort of uncanny.  Plus, Ferris&#39; fangs are real.  AND he has six nipples.  And one time he got into my rainy-day crafts drawer and was covered in glitter for *weeks*.  My cat is totally the next sexy vampire.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>EEEEEEEE.</em></strong></p>
<p>That is the sound of a hamster being squeezed too tightly by a three-year-old.  It is also the sound I&#8217;m making after finding out that your tremendous support of the paperback version of <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">my book (which came out last week) is now #5 on the NYT paperback list</a></strong>.  I am so incredibly lucky to have such an amazing community behind me who is willing to buy a book all over again just so they can read the bonus chapter.  Also, I have lots of great tour stories to tell you when the tour is finally over (<strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Come see me?</a></strong>) but for now let me just say that the greatest part about touring is watching nervous people creep in alone but leave as groups of new friends.  I am so lucky to be a part of your bizarre tribe.</p>
<div id="attachment_18056" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 600px">

	<p class="wp-caption-text">Picture of a few awesome people from last week&#39;s book tour. They smelled like cupcakes and magnificence.</p>
</div>
<p>And to thank you a tiny bit for all of  your bad-assness I&#8217;m giving away five autographed copies of <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">the new book</a></strong> this week.  And if you already have one you can just sell it on eBay, or use it as a coaster, or give it to your newest friend to test how easily offended they are.  Just leave a comment and I&#8217;ll pick people before I leave again for the next leg of the tour.</p>
<p>PS.  For real.  Thank you.  We did this together.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Conversation in the car with my husband:</strong></p>
<p>me:  I can&#8217;t understand you when you&#8217;re mumbling like the Hamburglar.</p>
<p>Victor: The Hamburglar didn&#8217;t mumble.  He said &#8220;Robble-Robble.&#8221;</p>
<p>me:  Yeah.  And that&#8217;s incoherent mumbling.</p>
<p>Victor:  No.  It&#8217;s him saying what he&#8217;s doing.  He&#8217;s robbing you.  Of hamburgers.</p>
<p>me:  <em>Oh my God.</em></p>
<p>Victor:  You<em> just</em> now got that, didn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>me:  I thought he was just saying nonsense words.  <em>Why would he use &#8220;robble&#8221; as a verb?</em>  Why wouldn&#8217;t he say &#8220;<em>burgle, burgle</em>&#8220;?  That way  it makes sense and also the word &#8220;burger&#8221; is almost in it.  That&#8217;s just basic marketing.</p>
<p>Victor:  Maybe because he&#8217;s not a burglar.  A burglar robs you when you&#8217;re not home.  A robber is more like a mugger.  More violent.</p>
<p>me:  Huh.  The Hamburglar was made of burgers, wasn&#8217;t he?  Doesn&#8217;t that make him a cannibal?</p>
<p>Victor:  No.  You&#8217;ve confused the Hamburglar with Mayor McCheese, haven&#8217;t you?  Classic error.  The Hamburglar was the only human in the group.</p>
<p>me: And Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>Victor:  No.  Clowns aren&#8217;t human.</p>
<p>me:  Agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Victor:  I just never understood why Mayor McCheese was the Mayor but then sometimes he was also the arresting officer.  That seems like a conflict in judicial law.</p>
<p>me:  <em>Right?!</em>  And he carried around that big police stick to hit people with.  McDonald&#8217;s was kind of fucked up, now that I think about it.  And what the hell was Grimace?  A stain?</p>
<p>Victor:  He was a shake.</p>
<p>me:  A <em>purple</em> shake?</p>
<p>Victor:  And he was called &#8220;Grimace&#8221; because that&#8217;s what you do when you drink a shake too fast.  You grimace.</p>
<p>me:  It&#8217;s weird how much you&#8217;ve thought about this.</p>
<p>Victor:  It&#8217;s weird that you claim to be a writer and yet you don&#8217;t recognize &#8220;robble&#8221; as a verb.</p>
<p>me:  Hang on.  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldland">I&#8217;m looking all this up on the internet.</a></strong>  <em>Oh, holy shitsnacks.</em></p>
<p>Victor: What?</p>
<p>me:  Prepare yourself.  <strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldland">&#8220;A large, purple character was first introduced in November 1971 as the &#8220;Evil Grimace&#8221;. In Grimace&#8217;s first two appearances, he was depicted with two pairs of arms with which to steal milkshakes.&#8221;</a></em></strong></p>
<p>Victor:  SEE.  I KNEW MILKSHAKES WERE INVOLVED SOMEHOW.</p>
<p>me: Stop yelling.  Then in 1974, Grimace lost two of his arms and his evilness and became a simpleton whose brother might have been &#8220;the king of all Grimaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victor:  I totally want a t-shirt that says &#8220;KING OF ALL GRIMACES&#8221;.</p>
<p>me:  God, <em>who doesn&#8217;t?</em>  Apparently, Mayor McCheese was dropped from the line <strong><a href="http://mentalflossr.tumblr.com/post/3376558849/mayor-mccheese-v-h-r-pufnstuf">after he was sued by H.R. Pufnstuf</a></strong> for being too similar.  Hoy crap, this is like TMZ for puppets.</p>
<p>Victor:  You&#8217;re just making shit up now.</p>
<p>me:  <em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldland">It&#8217;s on the internet so it&#8217;s real.</a></strong></em>  OH!  And Officer Big Mac was the guy with the constable uniform.  He just looked like Mayor McCheese but they were totally different characters.  So that&#8217;s a relief, huh?</p>
<p>Victor:  I&#8217;ve been losing sleep over it.</p>
<p>me:  Also, apparently Ronald McDonald had a dog named &#8220;<strong><a href="http://mcdonalds.wikia.com/wiki/Sundae">Sundae</a></strong>&#8221; who was extremely sarcastic and negative, spoke in a monotone, and hated ticks, adventures, and the Hamburglar, <strong>whom he referred to as &#8220;<em>Bun-Head</em>.&#8221;</strong>  And he was portrayed by that guy who played &#8220;Mini-Me&#8221; on Austin Powers.</p>
<p>Victor: I don&#8217;t believe any of this.</p>
<p>me:  It&#8217;s totally true and all part of the McDonald&#8217;s canon.  Ronald McDonald had an unmedicated, angry, depressive dog who I think was probably racist.  If burgers are classified as a race, that is.</p>
<p>Victor:  This is one of the strangest discussions we&#8217;ve ever had.</p>
<p>me:  No.  Not even close.</p>
<p>PS.  <strong><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/king-235955101247350449?rf=238233029691800410">You are welcome, Victor.</a></strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Conversation with my husband:</strong></p>
<p>Victor: Oh my God, I could hear you sobbing all the way on the other side of the house.  <em>What&#8217;s wrong?</em></p>
<p>me:  This book.  <em>It&#8217;s so.incredibly. sad.</em></p>
<p>Victor:  Seriously?  You&#8217;re crying <em>over a book?</em></p>
<p>me:  It&#8217;s terrible and beautiful and perfect and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m never going to stop crying.</p>
<p>Victor:  <strong><em><a href="http://johngreenbooks.com/the-fault-in-our-stars/">The Fault in Our Stars?</a></em></strong>  What the shit, Jenny?  It says it&#8217;s about terminal cancer patients <em>in the very first sentence.</em>  Why would you even read that?  <em>You can&#8217;t watch Doctor Who without crying.</em></p>
<p>me: <em> No one with a soul can watch Doctor Who without occasionally crying.  </em>And besides,<em> it&#8217;s a teen book.</em>  I thought it would be like <em>Twilight</em>, but with slightly less vampires.</p>
<p>Victor:  Seriously?  It&#8217;s just a book.  Calm down.  <em>These people are all imaginary.</em></p>
<p>me:  AND THEY&#8217;RE MY FRIENDS.  ALL OF MY IMAGINARY FRIENDS ARE VERY SICK, VICTOR, <em>AND I&#8217;D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU&#8217;D RESPECT THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION.</em></p>
<p>Victor:  You are so confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Victor doesn&#8217;t understand how books work.</strong></p>
<p><em>PS. There are no real spoilers in this post but God knows what the comment section will be like.  Enter at your own risk.</em></p>

<p>While I&#8217;m gone I&#8217;m taking the lazy way out and running reruns.  Because if it&#8217;s good enough for TV, it&#8217;s good enough for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> ************</p>
<p>I use an online thesaurus all the time because there&#8217;s only so many ways to say &#8220;nipples&#8221;, but sometimes I suspect that the thesaurus people are just fucking with me:</p>

	<p class="wp-caption-text">And yes, I realize that I spelled &quot;hemorrhaging&quot; wrong but I don&#39;t think I misspelled it quite so badly that the average person would say &quot;Oh. I bet she meant &#39;marijuana&#39;&quot;.  Also, why is &quot;hurricane&quot; there?  WTF, Thesaurus?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Today I&#8217;m in Chicago on book tour.</a></strong>  Come see me? <em> Pretty please?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m busy with travel so instead of new posts I&#8217;m totally phoning it in with reruns from years ago.  But you&#8217;ve probably forgotten this one so it&#8217;s like it&#8217;s brand new.  Sort of.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">************</p>
<p>Most people know about my horrible giant squid phobia so my inbox is always littered with terrible squid news that makes me want to poison the sea even more than I already do, but today I got an email from my friend Desiree who thought I should know about <strong><a href="http://green.yahoo.com/blog/guest_bloggers/26/the-world-s-only-immortal-animal.html">this new jellyfish</a></strong> and I was all, &#8221;<em>Whatever, dude. </em>Its arms are like soggy pixie sticks.  <em>Why would I be afraid of this?</em>&#8221; and she was like &#8220;Well, maybe because <em>THEY&#8217;RE FUCKING IMMORTAL</em>.&#8221;   And then I looked a little closer and got totally freaked out because I&#8217;m pretty sure these things are goddamn vampires.  Hang on.  Here&#8217;s the picture:</p>
<div id="attachment_6290" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 478px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vamp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6290" title="vamp" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vamp.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="464" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Looks totally innocent and harmless. Much like Edward Cullen.</p>
</div>
<p>And here&#8217;s the same picture after I&#8217;ve made it a little more clear.  Because some of you don&#8217;t have enough imagination.  Or vodka.  And I&#8217;m here to help.</p>
<div id="attachment_6291" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 450px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vamp2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6291" title="vamp2" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/vamp2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="357" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah.  *Exactly.*</p>
</div>
<p>And there are two problems here.  One is that vampires are supposed to be sexy, and these?  Not so much.  Secondly?  <em>Werewolf eels</em>.  I&#8217;m not sure they exist but if vampire jellyfish are real then pretty much all bets are off, y&#8217;all.  This is why I recommend that we dump enough gelatin into the oceans to make it into an enormous jello and then we can piece it out and pick out all the vampires the same way that you pick all the pears out of your jello salad.  Then we stab all the jellyfish in their hearts with a stake.  Or put them in a big aquarium and let them fight it out and charge people to bet on the vampire-gladiator death matches.  And then we spend all that money on healthcare.  I think I just solved the healthcare crisis <em>and</em> wiped out vampires.  Plus?  Free jello.  <em>You&#8217;re welcome, America.</em></p>
<p>PS.  In vaguely related news I just found <strong><a href="http://eikoishizawa.com/thegreatsleepingbear_thegreat01.html">my new sleeping bag</a></strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bear5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6302" title="bear5" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bear5.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s in the shape of a bear so if I get attacked by bears at night I won&#8217;t get eaten because the bear will be all &#8220;Oh!  Pardon me<em>.</em> I didn&#8217;t know you were in here&#8221; and then I&#8217;ll make the bear&#8217;s head say &#8220;No problem.  I was just devouring this girl.  By the way, how did you get in here?&#8221; and the bear will be like &#8220;Oh, some asshole left the front door unlocked&#8221; and then I&#8217;ll be all &#8220;<strong><em>Victor, you asshole!  You didn&#8217;t lock the front door again!</em></strong>&#8221; and then the jig is up.  This is why I&#8217;m going to put a reminder post-it note inside the bear sleeping bag that says: &#8220;DON&#8217;T YELL AT VICTOR IN FRONT OF BEARS&#8221; but probably we&#8217;re all fucked because I have pretty much <em>no</em> impulse control when I&#8217;m mad about people not locking doors.  It takes two seconds and IT FUCKING SAVES LIVES.  Only <em>you</em> can prevent us being murdered by bear when we sleep, <em>Victor. </em>And then I pointed out that it was pretty selfless of me to sleep in a bear sleeping bag to save the rest of the family and Victor pointed out that I&#8217;m really only saving me and that we&#8217;d never even seen a bear in real life and that I&#8217;d probably poke an eye out just sleeping in it and then I&#8217;d have to explain to the doctor that my eye got eaten by my sleeping bag.  Then I started to disagree but then I remembered that last week I got <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/?p=6151">stabbed by chicken</a></strong> so technically he has a point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_6297" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 480px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bear4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6297" title="bear4" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/bear4.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="412" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Nom nom nom nom.  This girl is delicious.  But I wish she&#39;d taken her shoes off first. God knows what she&#39;s tracking in.  So inconsiderate.&quot;  (This is what bears are thinking when they eat you.)</p>
</div>
<p>PPS.  Victor just said that he&#8217;s &#8220;not the only person who lives here and maybe I could get off my ass and lock the damn door myself&#8221; but excuse me, <em>I&#8217;M WEARING A BEAR</em>.  I don&#8217;t have opposable thumbs in this bear sack, jackhole.  Honestly, it&#8217;s like he <em>wants</em> the bears in here.</p>

<p>Until I&#8217;m back I&#8217;m posting old posts in the hope because you&#8217;ll think they&#8217;re new if you have ADD like me.  It&#8217;s a blessing.  And a curse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>************</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2011/07/the-trials-and-tribulations-of-ferris-mewler-self-proclaimed-fabio-of-cats/">Ferris Mewler is back from the animal hospital today</a></strong>, after losing both his claws (it was medically necessary.  <em>Stop judging me</em>) and his testicles (for cosmetic reasons. <em> Kidding</em>.).  He&#8217;ll be in a hard collar for the rest of the week, much to the amusement of the other cats, whom he has mercilessly terrorized and bullied since day one.  I&#8217;m usually not one for sharing 200 pictures of my cat, but today it&#8217;s hard not to make an exception.  He looks like he&#8217;s dressed like a martini for Halloween.</p>
<p>Homecoming:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Today I&#8217;m on book tour today in New Jersey</a></strong>.  Come see me?  <em>Please?</em></p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m gone I&#8217;m doing a bit of a best-of-rerun-a-thon because I&#8217;m too freaked out to write while I&#8217;m away.  But they&#8217;re from a long time ago so it might seem new to you, especially if you&#8217;ve done a lot of drugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">**********</p>
<p><em>This is the longest and most confusing post ever.  I started writing it months ago and then got distracted.  If I were you I probably wouldn&#8217;t read it.  You&#8217;ve been warned.</em></p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>It all started with a tweet I sent out a few months ago, linking to the blog of an antique store that was selling something fantastic and horrible&#8230;</p>
<p>me:  <strong><a href="http://dollypythonvintage.com/place-your-bets/">HOLY SHITSNACKS.  SOMEONE BUY THIS FOR ME</a>:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place-your-bets.jpg"><img title="place your bets" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/place-your-bets.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="612" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/comments.jpg"><img title="comments" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/comments.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="735" /></a></p>
<p>Follow-up tweet:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/twitter.jpg"><img title="twitter" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/twitter.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="197" /></a></p>
<p>************</p>
<p><strong>Conversation with Victor on the phone (several minutes later, when I realized he&#8217;d probably read my twitter feed):</strong></p>
<p>me:  Hey.  I just bought a honey-badger killing a python.</p>
<p>Victor: <em>Who is this?</em></p>
<p>me:  No, seriously.  I just emailed you a picture.  The cobra-mongers said I could rent it for $100, but it&#8217;s only $300 to keep it and renting is like throwing money away.  That&#8217;s what Dave Ramsey always says.</p>
<p>Victor: You bought two dead animals &#8211; killing each other - <em>because renting them is a bad investment?</em></p>
<p>me:  <em>And</em> also because I suck at returning things.  I still have VHS tapes from Blockbuster that I&#8217;ve never returned.</p>
<p>Victor: *sigh*</p>
<p>me:  This is awesome because it&#8217;s like a naked honey-badger death/Cobra match.  <em>There is no part of that that doesn&#8217;t scream &#8220;BUY ME&#8221;.  </em>Plus, the cobra looks so damn happy.  He&#8217;s like &#8220;HI FRIEND!&#8221; and the honey-badger is all &#8220;I WILL END YOU&#8221; and the cobra&#8217;s like &#8220;WOULD YOU LIKE A NUTTER-BUTTER?  <em>THEY ARE DELICIOUS.</em>&#8221;  And the honey-badger is like &#8220;I WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN INTO A SWEATER.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victor:  Wtf?</p>
<p>me:  <em>Oh my God, they&#8217;re totally us.</em>  Guess which one is me?</p>
<p>Victor:  The cobra.</p>
<p>me:  <em><strong>EXACTLY.</strong></em>  I&#8217;m going to make a whole cartoon just based on honey-badger and cobra.</p>
<p>Victor (opening the picture):  Oh, holy shit.  Honey, <em>seriously?</em>  <em>You paid money for this?</em>  It&#8217;s not even a honey-badger.  It&#8217;s a mongoose with mange.  It&#8217;s Rikki-Tikki-Tavi from Kipling.</p>
<p>me:  <em><strong>Which is even better.</strong></em>  It&#8217;s a death-match <em>with a moral.</em>  How often do you buy a death-match that comes with its own story?  <em>Almost never</em>.</p>
<p>Victor:  And where are you planning on putting this monstrosity?</p>
<p>me:  I hadn&#8217;t thought that far ahead.  It was an impulse buy.  It&#8217;s like when you buy gum at the check-out counter.  You don&#8217;t go in for it, but you buy it.  And then the whole family appreciates it later.  This is just like gum. AWESOME DEATH-MATCH GUM.</p>
<p>Victor: I need you to stop talking now.</p>
<p>***********</p>
<p><strong> Two weeks later:</strong></p>
<p>me:  EEEEAAAAAAHH!</p>
<p>Victor:  <em>What the fuck?  What&#8217;s wrong?</em></p>
<p>me:  I JUST OPENED A PACKAGE AND THERE WAS A COBRA IN IT.</p>
<p>Victor:  Um, you mean the cobra <em>you ordered</em>?</p>
<p>me: <em> Oh holy shit, my heart is racing.</em>  I totally forgot I bought it.</p>
<p>Victor:  <em>Of course you did.</em></p>
<p>me:  <em>Wow.</em>  You know when you&#8217;re opening a package and there&#8217;s a cobra in it and you&#8217;re all &#8220;WHO IN THE FUCK SENT ME A COBR-Oh, wait.  This is probably the cobra I ordered&#8221;?</p>
<p>Victor: <em> Nope.</em> <em> No one</em> knows what that&#8217;s like.</p>
<p>me:  Ugh.  I <em>hate</em> that feeling.  I&#8217;m so freaked out now I don&#8217;t even want to open the rest of it.  They should have put a warning on the outside.</p>
<p>Victor:  Something like, &#8220;Here&#8217;s the cobra you ordered.  Dumb-ass&#8221;?</p>
<p>me:  <em>No</em>, because then the post office would confiscate it.  There&#8217;s a sign up at the post office that says you can&#8217;t mail fireworks or puppies.  If you can&#8217;t mail a puppy I&#8217;m pretty sure that you can&#8217;t mail cobras either.  That&#8217;s basic logic.</p>
<p>Victor:  &#8221;Logic&#8221; doesn&#8217;t enter into any part of this debacle.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_12360">
<dt><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/creepy.jpg"><img title="creepy" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/creepy.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="436" /></a></dt>
<dd>The most unadorable nom nom picture ever.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>***********</p>
<p>Then I waited to be less creeped out by them, but they were quickly losing their whimsy and I started to suspect they were planning to kill me in my sleep.  Plus, Ferris Mewler developed an unhealthy obsession with the mongoose.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/look-away-jeff.jpg"><img title="look away, jeff" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/look-away-jeff.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="364" /></a></p>
<p><em>And</em> with the snake.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/no-means-no.jpg"><img title="no means no" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/no-means-no.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>And in the end I decided to just put them both outside in the garage so they could scare away other cobras and mongeese.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s totally working.</em></p>
<p>PS. Look.  I made new cards for <strong><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/thebloggess*">my shop</a></strong>:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/romance_is_in_the_air_romance_and_mange_card-137119923834023281?rf=238233029691800410">This one is for romance.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/comparison_shopping_card-137642521546786729?rf=238233029691800410">And this one is for when your spouse thinks you&#8217;ve spent too much money on shoes or power-tools or whatever.</a></strong>  Unless you spent too much money on a mongoose/cobra deathmatch.  Then this card is not applicable.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">This weekend I went to this flea market and I bought a cloak that I thought would be perfect for role-playing Lord of the Rings/Game of Thrones.  Then I found a tag sewn inside and realized that it probably belonged to the Pope.  I can only assume that he decided he needed to unload some of his vestments to pay for retirement.  Regardless, I think this means that I&#8217;m the new Pope.  Or that I&#8217;m running for Pope.  Something like that.</p>
<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter" style="text-align: center;">
<dl id="attachment_17981" class="wp-caption  aligncenter" style="width: 410px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17981" title="photo-4" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-4.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="593" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">There are stains all around the hip line, which I hope is wine. Probably it was just sprinkler water and the Pope was like &#8220;Ah well, it&#8217;s only water&#8221; and then Jesus turned it into wine and the Pope was like &#8220;JESUS. THAT STOPPED BEING FUNNY THE 100th TIME YOU DID IT&#8221; and Jesus was like &#8220;Just wait.  It&#8217;ll come back around again.&#8221;</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Technically it looks like a RenFest costume&#8230;until you turn around:</p>
<div id="attachment_17984" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 400px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17984" title="photo-3" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-3.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="559" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Yes, it&#39;s a cross, but in my defense I thought it was a giant &quot;t&quot; for &quot;The Game of Thrones.&quot; Or &quot;Mr. T.&quot;  One of those.</p>
</div>
<p>Regardless, I think that I&#8217;m now the official Pope until the new one gets elected and I&#8217;m pretty sure that I get paid in hats, which is great because I totally have a face for hats.  Plus (unlike the last Pope) I won&#8217;t just join twitter and immediately get distracted and stop working, because I&#8217;m already good at not working but still pretending to work.  Also, I&#8217;d get to ride in the Pope-mobile, which is like a convertible that has a see-through top so your hair doesn&#8217;t get fucked up and you still get a tan.  Which is pretty smart and probably my favorite thing the Pope has ever invented.  Plus, if I run for Pope lots of religious people will be praying <em>a ton.</em>  Mostly about me not needing to be elected Pope.  And possibly some just praying for my soul.  So I just raised prayer rates <em>and I DON&#8217;T EVEN HAVE A HAT YET</em>.  That&#8217;s how awesome I am at being Pope.  I&#8217;m not even trying and already Jesus is probably super inundated with work.  Which he loves.   Because he&#8217;s not on twitter.</p>
<p>PS.  I need some slogans for my posters.  Because I&#8217;m pretty sure you run for Pope the same way you run for student council and that&#8217;s what I would have done if I wasn&#8217;t so <del>high </del>shy.  I&#8217;m thinking something like &#8220;Jenny for Pope.  She&#8217;s got issues but the last Pope was in the Hitler Youth so maybe stop judging her, asshole.&#8221;  Or something with ninjas.  People love ninjas.</p>
