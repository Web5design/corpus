			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Excerpt of messages from my friend (who asked that her identity remain a secret because she&#8217;s embarrassed to admit that she knows me in real life.)</strong></p>
<p>me: Ugh.  Don&#8217;t tell Victor, but I REALLY hate jizz.</p>
<p>friend: Um.  <em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>me:  I mean, I get the draw, but it just doesn&#8217;t do it for me.</p>
<p>friend: Why exactly would Victor be mad at that?</p>
<p>me: Because he really likes it and he wants me to share his interests, I guess?  I just can&#8217;t get into it.</p>
<p>friend: <em>Speechless.</em>  What does he expect you to do with it?</p>
<p>me:  Just enjoy it, I guess?  He collects it.</p>
<p>friend:  Like&#8230;in a jar?  This is kinda TMI.</p>
<p>me:  <em>Oh, holy shit.</em>  I just reread what I wrote.  Not <em>jizz.</em>  <strong>JAZZ</strong>.  I meant to write <em><strong>JAZZ</strong></em>.  Victor wants me to appreciate <strong>JAZZ</strong> with him.</p>
<p>friend:  <em>Oh, thank Christ.</em></p>
<p>me:  I<em> really</em> need to spell-check this shit before I send it out.</p>
<p>friend:  The &#8220;i&#8221; and the &#8220;a&#8221; are like&#8230;<em>not even remotely close to each other.</em>  Was that an autocorrect?</p>
<p>me:  I don&#8217;t think so.  I&#8217;ve never even written &#8220;jizz&#8221; on my phone before.  I must have done it unconsciously.</p>
<p>friend:  That&#8217;s a weird Freudian slip.</p>
<p>me:  I guess I just had jizz on the brain.</p>
<p>friend:  Stop typing.</p>
<p>me:  No way.  My phone is finally starting to recognize jizz.  <em>It&#8217;s like</em> <em>it&#8217;s learning.</em></p>
<p>friend:  You&#8217;re corrupting your phone.  With jizz.</p>
<p>me: <em> Ew</em>.</p>
<p>friend:  I need a shower.</p>
<p>me:  You and me both, sister.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember a couple of days ago when I told you how <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/03/i-assure-you-theres-nothing-of-interest-going-on-in-here/">Hunter S. Thomcat won&#8217;t let me pee in peace?</a></strong>  <em>Yeah.</em>  That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t feel terribly bad about putting <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070QMUI2?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=B0070QMUI2&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=thebloggess-20">this inflatable unicorn horn</a></strong> on him while he was napping.  And also, he&#8217;s a cat and that&#8217;s what cats are there for.</p>
<p>In my defense, I was just going to take a super-quick picture of him asleep, but then when I was turning on my phone to take the picture he woke up and was like &#8220;What the fuck?  <em>WHAT HAPPENED?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And then he got kind of cocky.</p>
<div id="attachment_18131" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 550px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cat-unicorn-21.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18131" title="cat unicorn 2" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cat-unicorn-21.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="680" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">This cat has serious swag.</p>
</div>
<p>And he was totally bad-ass about it for about 30 seconds until the other cats started staring at him with wide eyes and then he was like, &#8220;WHY IS EVERYONE LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?  <em>OMG, IS THERE A BEE ON MY HEAD?</em>  BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE THERE&#8217;S A BEE ON MY HEAD.&#8221;  And I told him to calm down but he totally didn&#8217;t because I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing at him, and then it just got more ridiculous and I had to sit down on the ground to collect myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cat-unicorn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18132 aligncenter" title="cat unicorn" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cat-unicorn.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s bluffing.</p>
<p>And then Victor came in and was like &#8220;What are you doing?  <em>What is on the cat?  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?</em>&#8221; and I was all &#8220;Uh&#8230;<em>SURPRISE!  </em>We could only afford one party hat.  Sorry. <em> I&#8217;m terrible at party planning.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>And then Victor walked out of the room because apparently he doesn&#8217;t like parties <em>or</em> unicorns.  Honestly, it&#8217;s amazing that we ever got together in the first place.</p>
<p>PS. I have another unicorn story but I don&#8217;t have time to tell you all about it because I&#8217;m moving a few miles away this week and that means I have <strong><a href="http://blog.chron.com/goodmombadmom/2008/05/horrible-collections/">1400 tiny glass animals</a></strong>, 32 taxidermied animals, and three live animals to pack up.  And a<em> lot</em> of shit to put on eBay.  Like boxes of faces, haunted mortuary doves, and monkey hands.  <em>Things you need</em>.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>

<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18160 aligncenter" title="photo-3" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-31.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="623" /></a><br />
Also, it totally makes me want to put a sandwich in the shredder. Just for fun. Sorry, Lesha.</p>
<p>PS.  Completely unrelated:  <strong><a href="http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/67962/index2.html">The last words of Roald Dahl (creator of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) were, &#8220;Ow.  Fuck.</a></strong>&#8221;  My guess is that those are<em> lots</em> of people&#8217;s last words.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Frost once said that he could sum up life in three little words: <em>It goes on.</em></p>
<p>But that isn&#8217;t entirely accurate as most of the people in the world (including Frost) are now dead, so instead I&#8217;ve decided that all of life could be summed up in two sentences:</p>
<p><em>Sometimes it&#8217;s shit.</em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes it&#8217;s <strong>the</strong> shit.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as eloquent as Frost, but I think it&#8217;s more accurate.  It&#8217;s also better than my first try at summing up life, which was : <em>If possible, try to get licked by a giraffe.</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, <em>attacked by an ostrich</em> works too.  I&#8217;ve done both and they are wonderful things to add to your bucket list.  Bring some bactine.</p>
<p>Your turn, fellow insomniacs.  Sum up life for me.  It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re accomplishing anything else tonight.</p>
<p>PS.  Seriously.  Make friends with the people at the zoo and they&#8217;ll let you sneak in and play with the giraffes.  They&#8217;ll also let you crash a golf cart into a wall.  But only once.</p>

There&#8217;s no event here.  This is a marina.  You&#8217;ve been booked to scrape barnacles off of boats.&#8221;  But the joke&#8217;s on them because I <em>love</em> scraping barnacles.  Plus, if you show up I&#8217;ll force them to let me do a reading and a signing in between the barnacle stuff.  It&#8217;ll be awesome.  Or terrible.  Probably both.</p>
<p>April 1 ~<a href="http://www.booksinc.net/event/jenny-lawson-books-inc-marina"> <strong>San Francisco, CA, Books Inc</strong></a>. (in the Marina, apparently), 7pm</p>
<p>April 2 ~ <strong><a href="http://www.rakestrawbooks.com/upcoming-events">Danville, CA Rakestraw</a></strong>, 7pm</p>

<p>And to thank you even more I&#8217;m going to give a few of you an autographed copy of my book which you can&#8217;t read.  Unless you can read German.  In which case, you are way smarter than me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Conversation with Victor when he came home from a business trip:</strong></p>
<p>Victor:  Jenny.  <em>Seriously?</em></p>
<p>me:  What?</p>
<p>Victor: <em> &#8221;What?&#8221;</em>  There&#8217;s a dead fox on the wall.   <em>That&#8217;s what.</em></p>
<p>me:  <em>And she looks awesome.</em>  And technically it&#8217;s a coyote.  Honestly, you should have seen her before the makeover.</p>
<p>Victor:  <em>Makeover?</em></p>
<p>me:  She was<em> significantly</em> less foxy before the wig, makeup, false eyelashes and assorted accessories.</p>
<p>Victor:  *sigh*</p>
<div id="attachment_18103" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/before.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18103" title="before" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/before.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">BEFORE. (I had to take her into several stores to find the perfect hair color and accessories. People were all &quot;IS THAT A DOG&#39;S HEAD IN YOUR PURSE?&quot; and I was like &quot;No. It&#39;s a coyote and she&#39;s been dead longer than I&#39;ve been alive so stop judging me.&quot;) </p>
</div>
<div id="attachment_18104" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 500px">
	<a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Penelope.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18104" title="Penelope" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Penelope.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="499" /></a>
	<p class="wp-caption-text">AFTER. (I haven&#39;t settled on a name for her but I&#39;m leaning toward &quot;Penelope Vanderpelt.&quot;)</p>
</div>
<p>me:  She turned out so awesome that she decided to take a bobcat lover.</p>
<p>Victor:  And<em> that</em> explains the dead bobcat on the wall.</p>
<div id="attachment_18107" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px">

	<p class="wp-caption-text">AFTER. (Yes, I&#39;m aware that the hat looks ridiculous. It&#39;s almost impossible to find a good top hat for a bobcat to wear.  I&#39;m still looking.)</p>
</div>
<p>me:  I haven&#8217;t figured out his back-story, but I suspect he speaks with an English accent and says &#8220;biscuits&#8221; instead of &#8220;cookies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Victor:  Huh.</p>
<p>me:  But he&#8217;s a passionate lover once the hat come off.  <em>Which it does.</em>  Mainly because I don&#8217;t love it and I&#8217;m still looking for a better hat.  This is his third hat.  Whiskers O&#8217;Shaunnesy <em>does not</em> have a face for hats.</p>
<p>Victor:  I&#8217;m going to bed.</p>
<p>me: Someone called earlier but I couldn&#8217;t pick up the phone because I was working on Mr. O&#8217;Shaunnesy and so I just hit &#8220;speaker&#8221; with my elbow and yelled &#8220;I CAN&#8217;T PICK UP THE PHONE BECAUSE I&#8217;M SUPERGLUING A MUSTACHE ON MY BOBCAT.&#8221;</p>
<p>Victor:  Who was it?</p>
<p>me:  I dunno.  They hung up on me.</p>
<p>Victor:  <em>Shocker</em>.</p>
<p>me: I&#8217;m sure it was a telemarketer.  Anyone who called us on purpose wouldn&#8217;t be shaken by that kind of a greeting.</p>
<p>Victor:  One day when I run for congress this is all going to be very hard to explain.</p>
<p>PS.  On a surprisingly related note, a ton of you have asked if I&#8217;ve been watching <strong><a href="http://www.amctv.com/shows/immortalized/video">Immortalized</a></strong> on AMC.  I have, and I&#8217;m a little in love with <strong><a href="http://www.amctv.com/immortalized/videos/who-is-takeshi-yamada-inside-immortalized">Takeshi Yamada, who makes me look totally normal and makes &#8220;hairy trouts</a>&#8220;</strong> (which are -<em>surprisingly</em>- not sex toys).  It&#8217;s even possible that I <em>might</em> get to be a guest judge next season, which would be awesome because in my mind <em>all</em> the AMC shows are shot in the same neighborhood and that means that I could probably just sneak over to the <em>Walking Dead</em> lot and beg them to let me be an unpaid background zombie.   EVERYONE WINS.</p>
<p>PPS.  Vaguely related:  These are auctions I&#8217;m currently fascinated with on eBay.  Most are older than I am and one has been through some sort of terrific fire.  They all look as if they&#8217;ve just been shocked with a passive-aggressive surprise party given by everyone they&#8217;ve ever cheated on.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/What-the-shit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18101 aligncenter" title="What the shit" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/What-the-shit.jpg" alt="&quot;Oh, my God, Frank...what are you wearing?&quot;" width="550" height="556" /></a></p>
<p>I have a problem. Someone stop me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t a real post.  It&#8217;s just me catching you up on assorted shit in case you don&#8217;t read twitter.  Also?  Spoiler alert for my mom: I&#8217;m still alive.  No worries.</p>
<p>So yesterday I woke up at 3am with incredible pain in my chest like I&#8217;d been stomped on by a dozen brontosauruses who were giving piggie-back rides to grand pianos, and so after taking a shitload of aspirin I woke Victor up by thoughtfully screaming &#8220;<em>I&#8217;M DYING, YOU ASSHOLE</em>&#8221; because apparently I get kind of inappropriately angry when I&#8217;m hurty and scared.  Then we put Hailey in the car and sped down the road because we&#8217;re too stupid to just call for an ambulance.  Or at least, that&#8217;s what the police told us when they pulled us over for speeding.  Hailey was like &#8220;Are you guys going to go to jail?&#8221; and I was all &#8220;Only your father.  I&#8217;m not going to be alive that long.&#8221;  Or at least that&#8217;s what I said in my mind.  In real life I just whimpered, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine, bunny.  Go back to sleep.&#8221;  Then the ambulance came and I got a ride to the hospital but I was in too much pain to even tweet about it or to instagram an arty picture of my feet in front of the ambulance doors and that&#8217;s kind of th<em>e definition</em> of pain, in my opinion.  Then they hooked me up to a million monitors and the ambulance guy looked at the readings and was all &#8220;&#8230;<em>Oh</em>.&#8221;   And I was like, &#8220;<em>WHAT THE HELL DOES &#8216;OH&#8217; MEAN?</em>&#8221; and then he gave me some nitroglycerin to put under my tongue and I was all, &#8220;The explosive from Little House on the Prairie?&#8221; and he just stared at me and shoved the drug in my mouth and told the driver to go faster, but technically I wasn&#8217;t hallucinating because there was <em>totally</em> an episode of Little House on the Prairie where Pa had to drive a wagon of explosive nitroglycerin across a river, so I think the lesson here is that ambulance drivers need to be better versed in pop culture.  Also, nitroglycerin tastes like pain.  Which makes sense since it&#8217;s an explosive but they should really be like, &#8220;Hey, this is like a red-hot soaked in the blood of Satan but it will distract you from all of the Little House on the Prairie hallucinations you&#8217;re not having.  It&#8217;s totally normal to make your mouth feel like it&#8217;s betraying you for not spitting it out and punching me.  No worries.&#8221;  Then lots of other stuff happened but it all blended in together and I woke up in the hospital with needles and wires sticking everywhere and then many, many hours later the doctor told me that my heart was awesome and that I&#8217;d probably had a severe gallbladder attack or a panic attack, and then we went home and slept for several hours until we ended up in the Minor Emergency Center because both Victor <em>and</em> Hailey came down with minor infections.  So basically our whole family is falling to shit.</p>

<p>Today though we are all medicated up and we feel fine.  So fine, in fact, that we went to an antique store and I found this bear head and asked twitter to convince me not to buy it:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bear.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-18092 aligncenter" title="bear" src="http://thebloggess.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bear.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>But they were useless because they wanted it as badly as I did, but then I noticed the price tag and I&#8217;m not about to spend $200 for something that doesn&#8217;t even come with a neck.  Instead I&#8217;m holding out for a half-bear that still has arms to hug you with, because I think that would be very comforting when you were having a bad day.  Then Victor was all &#8220;Bears don&#8217;t hug you.  They maul you&#8221; and I reminded him that there&#8217;s a reason they call the best hugs &#8220;bear hugs&#8221; and I wrote &#8220;Look for bear arms&#8221; on my to-do list.  I think this whole bear incident is a sign of my maturing financial wiles and Victor says it&#8217;s a sign of my declining mental health, but in the end we left without a dead bear so everyone wins.  Except the bear, I guess.</p>
<p>This whole post needs way more commas and is even more rambly than usual.  Side-effect of the nitroglycerin, I suspect.  That and exploding, probably.</p>
<p>PS.  Spell-check says that &#8220;rambly&#8221; isn&#8217;t a real word.  Obviously spell-check doesn&#8217;t read this blog.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m on book tour in <strong><a href="http://thebloggess.com/2013/02/buy-my-birdfeeders/">Kansas City (Missouri)</a></strong>, which is apparently only minutes from Kansas City (Kansas) and is very confusing for everyone involved.  But while I&#8217;m away I&#8217;m running reruns.  Because I&#8217;m not clever enough to travel and write at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">************</p>
<p><strong>A series of voicemail messages I listened to a year and a half after they were sent because I don&#8217;t know how my phone works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yvonne:</strong> Argh.  This lady at the drugstore just coughed H1N1 all over my daughter.  Call me in 4 months when you actually get this.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll still be friends then.  Probably.</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving myself a message when I couldn&#8217;t find my journal to write in):</strong> Why don&#8217;t people use &#8220;let&#8217;c&#8221; as a contraction for &#8220;lettuce&#8221;?  It would save time.  This is me, by the way.  Not future-me though.  Just regular me.  Hope we&#8217;re doing well.</p>
<p><strong>My sister:</strong> Hey, someone in our family died but I&#8217;m not telling you over voicemail because that would be weird.  But you&#8217;re never going to get this because <em>you never listen to your voicemails.</em> It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m sending a time-capsule into space that no one will ever find.  I though you were supposed to be the responsible one.</p>
<p><strong>My sister again: </strong>It&#8217;s mom&#8217;s birthday today.  I&#8217;m calling to remind you.  You owe me.</p>
<p><strong>me again:</strong> Hi.  This is just me pretending to be on the phone so that I don&#8217;t have to make eye contact with the crazy lady on Main who&#8217;s always talking to herself.  Except that technically I&#8217;m calling myself to leave myself a message so I&#8217;m basically doing the same thing.  <em>Fuck.</em> I bet this is just how the crazy lady got started.</p>
<p><strong>My sister again:</strong> It&#8217;s daddy&#8217;s birthday today.  I&#8217;m calling because you said that I didn&#8217;t remind you about mom&#8217;s birthday even though <em>I totally did</em>.  Does this phone even work?</p>
<p><strong>My sister again: </strong>Hey, did you know it&#8217;s your birthday?  My guess is &#8220;no&#8221; since I didn&#8217;t remind you.</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving a message to myself again): </strong>If dead people want to wear open toed shoes in their caskets do the morticians give them a pedicure or are you just stuck with however your feet looked when you die?  Do you have to pay extra for the death pedicure?  I should get a tattoo on my chest that says &#8220;Put me in feetie-pajamas when I die&#8221;.  That way I&#8217;m warm <em>and</em> I&#8217;m saving money.</p>
<p><strong>me again</strong>:  Okay, I just remembered that I don&#8217;t <em>have </em>any feetie-pajamas and it would suck if right before I died I ballooned up to like 500 pounds and Hailey was all &#8220;HER DYING WISH WAS TO HAVE FEETIE PAJAMAS&#8221; but they can&#8217;t find any in my size and so she spends all her time looking for enormous feetie-pajamas when she should just be taking care of herself.  Now I&#8217;m all depressed.  Forget the tattoo.  The tattoo was a terrible idea.</p>
<p><strong>Victor:</strong> WHY DON&#8217;T YOU EVER ANSWER YOUR PHONE?</p>
<p><strong>me (leaving a message to myself again): </strong>I was calling to remind you to write something funny about birds but then I got distracted by my own voice on the answering machine and now I don&#8217;t remember what I was going to say.  It was about birds, I think&#8230;?  Crap.  I lost it.  Way to go,<em> us.</em></p>
<p><strong>my sister again: </strong>It&#8217;s mom&#8217;s birthday today.  Honestly, <em>I don&#8217;t even know why I try.</em></p>
<p><strong>Laura:</strong> Okay, why do you even <em>have</em> a phone?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my first time in Cincinatti and I asked if I could go on <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKRP_in_Cincinnati">WKRP</a></strong> to talk about the book but I was told that WKRP never really existed, which I think is code for &#8220;They don&#8217;t want you, Jenny.&#8221;  Also, now I can&#8217;t get the WKRP song out of my head.  And now, neither can you, probably.</p>
<p>But I did get one of my tv interviews back and so I&#8217;m sharing it here because you can only see my facial tic twice and that is a huge improvement from my first tour and so I need to show it off to someone.  Thank you for being that someone.</p>
