				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://wp.me/p2L46z-l0"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1323" alt="round one" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/round-one1.jpg?w=489&#038;h=250" width="489" height="250" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Get ready, folks, because March Madness: Shipping Wars starts NOW! Each poll will be open for 72 hours. Get those votes in and tell all your friends so your favorite ship doesn&#8217;t sink.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This first round promises to be a brutal one with a lot of big names and fandom favorites facing off. We would tell you all to make it a clean fight, but this <em>is</em> shipping. All is fair when it comes to your OTP.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know who to vote for? Not familiar with one of these ships? Be sure to check out our <a title="March Madness: Shipping Wars" href="http://3chicgeeks.com/2013/03/18/march-madness-shipping-wars/" target="_blank">master post</a> for a brief description of each pair. The second half of round one will commence once these polls close.</p>
<p>Happy Shipping!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wp.me/p2L46z-jK"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1296" alt="24422_2964699413943_1793162717_n" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/24422_2964699413943_1793162717_n.jpg?w=428&#038;h=219" width="428" height="219" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of year. March Madness is upon us, and all over the nation people are carefully filling in their brackets and cheering on their favorite teams. While we have varying opinions on basketball here at 3ChicGeeks.com (Freak Geek: &#8220;I do not concern myself with the ancient Mayan sacrificial rites, as they bring no benefit to the halls of Asgard.&#8221;), there is one competitive sport we all enjoy: Shipping.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;re going there. It&#8217;s going to be a bloody war, but in the end there will be one ship to rule them all. <span id="more-1224"></span>Our Shipping Wars shall have two divisions of 16 ships: the Fan Favorites and the Canon ships. They range from beloved pairings to a few of the more questionable ones&#8230; we don&#8217;t discriminate.</p>
<p>Use this master post to grab your copy of our ship wars brackets and read up on all of the ships facing off in this bloody battle.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/march-madness1.gif"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1284" alt="March Madness" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/march-madness1.gif?w=660&#038;h=414" width="660" height="414" /></a>Fan Favorites:</h2>
<p><strong>Johnlock</strong>: We all know our favorite consulting detective would be lost without his blogger. Johnlock is so ingrained into the minds of <em>Sherlock </em>fans everywhere that it&#8217;s easy to forget that this ship isn&#8217;t actually canon. Really, no explanation needed for why this ship got the #1 seed in the Fan Favorites. We expect Johnlock to take it all the way to the final face-off.</p>
<p><strong>Black Frost: </strong>A deadly Russian assassin with flaming red hair, and a frost giant with a desire for world domination, what could go wrong? Natasha Romanova and Loki Laufeyson have been lied to by their governments their whole lives, and have worked on the dark side before. Natasha joined the Avengers by Hawkeye&#8217;s <del>love</del> persistence, but can SHE turn the frosty prince to the light?</p>
<p><strong>Wincest: </strong>I cannot even begin to describe how much of a thing this is within the <em>Supernatural</em> fandom. This probably stems from the fact that the Winchester brothers are soul mates  Like, actually though. For reals. We can&#8217;t make this stuff up. How can you compete with that?</p>
<p><strong>Kale:</strong> Childhood friends, hunting partners&#8230; destined lovers. Katniss Everdeen and Gale Hawthorne seem like the perfect match. After all, who doesn&#8217;t love a good best-friends-turned-more tale? We&#8217;re rooting for you to get out of the friendzone, Gale.</p>
<p><strong>Drarry:</strong> We see right through your charade, boys. Feigning hate for one another while secretly spending your nights in each other&#8217;s arms is classic. It&#8217;s okay. <em>We know. </em>Just do us a favor and avoid merman mpreg.</p>
<p><strong>Stony: </strong>Clean-cut out-of-time artifact Steve Rogers meets playboy philanthropist alcoholic in a metal suit, Tony Stark. Sparks fly (once Cap figures out how <del>magnets </del>electrical devices work) and then they settle down, open a bed &amp; breakfast in Vermont and Iron Man gives birth to Captain America&#8217;s baby.</p>
<p><strong>Nuna: </strong>Listen, this doesn&#8217;t even really belong in this category. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, it&#8217;s canon. But apparently JKR says otherwise, so&#8230; RAWR. The adorably awkward pairing of Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood is a ship made in dweeb heaven. They are perfect together. Perfect, I say!</p>
<p><strong>SanSan:</strong> If only the Hound wasn&#8217;t so emotionally (and physically) scarred, perhaps he would be able to admit how deeply he cares for his Little Bird, Sansa. Hey, I&#8217;m not saying I understand this ship, but it continues to be one of the most prominent non-canon GoT pairings in fan fic. The Internet has spoken.</p>
<p><strong>Spander: </strong>William the Bloody and Xander Harris are a match made in heaven&#8230; or Hellmouth. Take your pick. We&#8217;re not sure what to say about this pairing, so we&#8217;re just going to&#8230; Tree. Closet. Witty repartee. Lots of suspicious BDSM fics on AO3. The end.</p>
<p><strong>Bagginshield:</strong> One hug and suddenly a whole new ship was born. Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield are an unlikely pair, but those are usually the best ones. We&#8217;ll see how far this hairy duo makes it in the Ship War.</p>
<p><strong>Merthur: </strong>Merlin and Arthur is another one of those ships that sort of negates every canon pairing. Merthur is, was, and will always be written in the stars. You cannot convince us otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Mal/Inara:</strong> If you didn&#8217;t spend every episode of <em>Firefly </em>staring at these two and willing them to finally kiss, then I really have nothing to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>Mystrade:</strong> You know those two people that when you see them, you just <em>know</em> they are meant to be together? Mycroft Holmes and Greg Lestrade are those two people.</p>
<p><strong>Legolas/Gimli:</strong> Did you know that after Legolas built a ship to finally sail to Valinor, Gimli was allowed to go with him <em>because of their great love</em> (and a good word from Galadriel)? Seriously. That really says it all.</p>
<p><strong>Destiel:</strong> Destiel technically isn&#8217;t canon, but, like Johnlock, it may as well be. The number of Dean/Castiel shippers in the <em>Supernatural</em> fandom is as numerous as the members of the fandom itself because everyone ships Destiel. This is fact.</p>
<p><strong>Swan Queen: </strong>Out of everyone I know in the OUaT fandom, I can count the ones who don&#8217;t ship Swan Queen on one hand. Because there&#8217;s maybe two of them<em>. Maybe. </em>While Swan Queen may not last in this tournament while against such a heavy-hitter right off the bat, this ship still holds a special place in everyone&#8217;s heart.</p>
<h2>Canon Ships:</h2>
<p><strong>The Ponds: </strong>Amy and Rory are basically like the most perfect couple ever. They have their ups and their <em>downs</em> (too soon?), but they always get through it together in the end. It doesn&#8217;t matter where they are in space and time, these two are destined to be together.</p>
<p><strong>Lannister Twincest: </strong>Yes. We&#8217;re bringing in the twincest. This may possibly be one of the most disturbing canon ships I&#8217;ve ever come across, but there you have it. It&#8217;s a thing. It sails. Will it last against the Ponds in the first round? Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Kaylee/Simon: </strong>Kaylee is that really cool chick that you wish was your best friend. Then there&#8217;s Simon, the really smart guy who simply doesn&#8217;t have a clue when it comes to women. Somehow, though, these two finally become canon. It&#8217;s adorable and endearing.</p>
<p><strong>Zoe/Wash: </strong>MY FEELINGS. Sometimes ships appear to make no sense in the beginning and over time it slowly becomes apparent why it could not possibly be any other way. This is one of those ships. Let&#8217;s pretend that scene in <em>Serenity</em> didn&#8217;t happen, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Buffy/Angel: </strong>How can we describe Buffy and Angel as a couple? They&#8217;re&#8230; well&#8230; they&#8217;re kind of like Bella and Edward except Buffy isn&#8217;t a whiny, self-entitled, elitist, annoying Mary Sue and Angel&#8230; Angel doesn&#8217;t sparkle. Okay then.</p>
<p><strong>RumBelle: </strong>Again, you know those ships that appear to make no sense in the beginning and then suddenly they&#8217;re just the best ship ever? This is another one of those. Rumpelstiltskin and Belle&#8230; who would&#8217;ve known they&#8217;d be so perfect together.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Harkness &amp; the Universe:</strong> Let&#8217;s face it. What Jack Harkness wants, Jack Harkness gets. To put Captain Jack in a ship with one other person would be absurd. No, no, he is in a ship with everyone. In the universe. It&#8217;s totally canon.</p>
<p><strong>Hinny: </strong>Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley is one of those pairings that is very divisive among fans; you either love them or you hate them. There really isn&#8217;t a whole lot more to say than that, other than the fact that this ship is terrible at naming children.</p>
<p><strong>Romione: </strong>We all saw this ship coming from book one. Well, at least I did. Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley are almost complete opposites, though they match each other in stubbornness. Somehow these two balance each other out into a harmonious couple, that is after they finally own up to their feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Katniss/Peeta: </strong>Boy has crush on girl, girl pretends to be in love with boy to survive massive game of homicide, boy and girl help lead a revolution and she eventually reciprocates his love&#8230; What a typical love story.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hawk: </strong>More commonly known as Clintasha, we decided to rename their ship Black Hawk because of reasons. Intensely close as far as spies go, Hawkeye and Black Widow have a hardcore following. They even spawned their own special Tumblr tag &#8211; &#8220;What Happened in Budapest?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Snowing: </strong>Snowing is Snow White and Prince Charming&#8230; if you don&#8217;t ship that, well you can just go to hell you terrible cynic.</p>
<p><strong>Éowyn/Faramir: </strong>I&#8217;ll admit to being totally biased towards this ship as it was my first OTP. Éowyn is a badass who needs a man who will appreciate her and let her be herself. Faramir has grown up in the shadow of his older brother and needs a woman who will love him for all that he is. Yes. Perfection.</p>
<p><strong>Jon/Ygritte: </strong>Jon Snow is that adorable, polite, and fairly awkward boy-turned-warrior who gets seduced by the enemy. In this case the enemy happens to be a red-haired sassy minx of a girl. This ship may have a time limit, but we love it just the same.</p>
<p><strong>10th Doctor/Rose: </strong>From the moment Nine took Rose&#8217;s hand in his and said, &#8220;Run&#8221;, we&#8217;ve shipped the Doctor and Rose. However, it&#8217;s Ten and Rose&#8217;s charming, puppy love energy that made the fans REALLY ship them. Ship them hard. Spaceship them.</p>
<p><strong>Aragorn/Arwen: </strong>I have to admit I never got this ship. I mean, the films make me get it, but when I read the LotR books it just didn&#8217;t. make. sense. Still, these two go on to become king and queen and be the shippiest ship in all of Middle Earth. That has to count for something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/springfest_2013_original-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1251" alt="Springfest_2013_original-1" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/springfest_2013_original-1.jpg?w=611"   /></a></p>
<p>This weekend The Freak and Unique Geek were given the opportunity to cover their first event as members of the press. Springfest 2013 had its highs and lows, with some glimmering moments of excellence among the general con chaos.</p>
<p><span id="more-1227"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_1255" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0915.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1255" alt="Voice actors Bill Rogers (left) and Mike Pollock (right)" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0915.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Voice actors Bill Rogers (left) and Mike Pollock (right)</p></div>
<p>We arrived in the early afternoon on Saturday, the first item on our itinerary was a visit to the &#8220;Press Room&#8221; for what we could only assume was perhaps an orientation and/or a mixer. We were not informed that this would be a Q&amp;A session with voice actors Mike Pollock (best known as the current voice of Dr. Eggman in the Sonic The Hedgehog series) and Bill Rogers (best known as the current voice of Brock on Pokemon). Perhaps it was a newbie mistake, but I would expect the organizers of a press room to inform the press that they&#8217;ll be interviewing someone and who it is that they&#8217;ll be interviewing. We were both, thankfully, at least somewhat familiar with their work so we could add to the conversation rather than drag it down. Both actors were incredibly polite and funny. Audio and video from the Press Room will be found at <a href="http://www.nerdgig.com">NerdGig.com</a> and <a href="http://leetneet.com/">LeetNeet.com </a>(recorded by SolidX) later in the week.</p>
<p>After the Press Room we decided to head over to <a href="http://ladefensenyc.com/">La Defense</a> to grab something quick to eat which turned into a full fledged brunch. We could do an entire post about our brunch as it was so hollandaise-covered-quiche-filled-beardy-hipster-waiter-tastic. It wouldn&#8217;t be relevant, but we&#8217;d do it anyway&#8230; if it weren&#8217;t for this nagging journalistic integrity. If you&#8217;d like some food porn, however, you can check out our <a href="https://twitter.com/GrayCecelia/status/312995646326075393/photo/1">tweet</a> about it. It was so good we went back on Sunday. This post is becoming a post about brunch, sorry not sorry.</p>
<div id="attachment_1257" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1070.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1257" alt="Yeah, that's a guy actually just taking a nap in the back there. " src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1070.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yeah, that&#8217;s a guy actually just taking a nap in the back there.</p></div>
<p>After our extreme Brunch cravings were put to rest, we decided to kill a little time in the Dealer&#8217;s Room. It was filled with  exactly what you would expect; prints, buttons, lolita gear, <em><strong>the comfiest chairs I have ever had the fortune to sit</strong><strong> upon</strong></em>, miscellaneous manga. Oh, what&#8217;s that you say? You want to hear more about the chairs? You could own only these and Ikea Lack tables and be completely satisfied with your life choices. It seems like I&#8217;m exaggerating but I&#8217;m really not, <a href="http://www.yogibo.com/">check them out</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1260" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1065.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1260" alt="I don't know anyone who doesn't need more tiny pink whales in their lives. " src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1065.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I don&#8217;t know anyone who doesn&#8217;t need more tiny pink sparkly polka dot whales in their lives.</p></div>
<p>Other than the chairs, there were some genuinely excellent vendors.  We purchased some adorable rings on Sunday from <a href="http://mayuiki.deviantart.com/gallery/">Mayuiki</a>, and we both openly gawked at <a href="http://kgoggles.deviantart.com/gallery/">Karlen Tam</a>&#8216;s art. There were also some very tempting buttons relating to any and all fandoms, and a large selection of sonic screwdrivers that threatened to empty my wallet. The Dealer&#8217;s Room, though small, provided something for everyone which was definitely appreciated.</p>
<p>The Cosplay Contest/Masquerade was next on our list, and a major attraction for everyone at the convention. The contest was held together brilliantly by the very funny and very quick on his feet <a href="http://www.uncleyo.com/">Uncle Yo</a>. He managed to kill time, cover technical issues, calm the crowd, and enhance the performances of the cosplayers. If you need an MC at any fandom-y event, do yourself a favor and give Uncle Yo a call. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed with the technical aspects of the contest. They also could have used a sound check and a quick run through of the sound cues before allowing people in. It was scattered, and a little awkward at times.</p>
<div id="attachment_1265" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/539071_2962647082636_1205697650_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1265" alt="Your new lord, kneel before him." src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/539071_2962647082636_1205697650_n.jpg?w=300&#038;h=224" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Your new overlord, kneel before him.</p></div>
<p>Then came the highlight of the convention. An adorable 3 year old, hereafter referred to as Stormageddon, Dark Lord of All, rushed the stage. Stormy was, of course, interrupting a special musical performance that was suffering from some severe audio problems at the time (so the crowd was totally ready to cheer on the chaos). He proceeded to lure in Elderberry with his adorable little face and <em><strong>walk off with one mic and then somehow acquire the second one AFTER he&#8217;d already proven himself untrustworthy.</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, it continued to fall apart after Stormageddon had officially won control over all of the microphones and hearts in the theatre. It seems everyone in the booth wasn&#8217;t entirely sure about what was happening, and a staffer rushed down (I&#8217;m so sorry you had this task SolidX, but you handled it in the funniest way possible). He saw the crisis unfolding before him and said into his walkie talkie with a terrible, disbelieving look on his face&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a situation&#8230; it&#8217;s complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>We then proceeded to drop all professional pretenses and lose our minds while we watched four adults attempt to corral and bargain with their new master Stormageddon before someone finally had the sense to jump up and just take the microphones away from him. Stormy was then reunited with his Mother, and given a hearty round of applause as he exited the theatre. We decided that there was nothing that could really top that experience and headed home for the day.</p>
<div id="attachment_1267" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1055.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1267" alt="&quot;No, stop that!&quot;" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_1055.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;No, stop that!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>Sunday dawned bright and early with a panel called &#8220;How to Avoid Fangirls, Fanboys, the Overrated&#8221;, and I was prepared to feel defensive (as fan status has become a very contentious subject in the Sherlock Holmes fandom as of late) but was surprised with a funny, if chaotic panel addressing the serious subject of proper con etiquette. Those in charge of the panel needed to exert a little more authority over the room, and some of those in attendance needed to take a lesson from the panel, but it was a grand experience.</p>
<p>Then, after brunch and a second trip to the Dealer&#8217;s Room, we attended the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cosplaynyc?group_id=0">CosplayNYC Magazine</a> panel. It was well put together in theory, but a troll wandered into the dungeon and proceeded to dismantle the presentation by asking nonsensical questions that the panelists answered when they should have ignored. The magazine itself seems to be a very useful tool for anyone looking to research specific conventions to see if it would be worth the cost of a ticket, build a simple piece for a costume, or just keep up with the New York Cosplay community.</p>
<p>After a last minute scramble to chase after any last Cosplayers we saw and loved and needed pictures of, we parted ways with Springfest 2013. A gallery of our favorite Cosplayers and Lolitas with all of their information can be found below.(Follow them! Like them!) and some behind the scenes pictures and extra food porn can be found on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/3ChicGeeks">Facebook Page</a>.</p>
<p>Overall the experience felt rather akin to a middle school dance. You know someone&#8217;s in charge, but it just kind of seems like they&#8217;re not actually there and everyone&#8217;s wearing funny clothes and constantly adjusting themselves and fixing their makeup and taking group pictures and screaming but no one knows what&#8217;s going on or what there is to do other than adjust themselves and take pictures and scream. It needed work organizationally, and though I understand it&#8217;s no small task to corral insanity, there were steps that could have been taken to improve the experience. The panels could have used more rehearsal and the volunteers could have used more information about the venue and event, the press could have been given a more detailed schedule of events, the events themselves could have been held in a smaller area. We won&#8217;t say we&#8217;re never going to attend again, ever, but SpringFest is not an absolute must-see event. We&#8217;d like to see it improve and grow for next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have neglected to mention to all of you that a lot of my geekery is directed at crafting, and I don&#8217;t mean in a look-at-this-TARDIS-I-made kind of way but in an OH-MY-GOD-IS-THAT-A-NEW-MARTHA-STEWART-CRAFT-GLITTER-SET?!?! kind of way. I know the smell of Michaels and it&#8217;s comforting, I flip out over really nice paper, I have urges to buy every size crochet hook that exists and do a sampler quilt with the same stitch in different sizes. I&#8217;m in the craft fandom, and I&#8217;m in deep.</p>
<p>It should then come as no surprise that I have accepted Pinterest as my lord and savior, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s had similar effects on all of you other craft geeks out there. The problem is, <em>sometimes Pinterest lies to me.</em> They&#8217;re not big lies, it&#8217;s just that sometimes things look cool but then don&#8217;t work or the images don&#8217;t link back to anything and I have to wing it <del>and I scream and panic.</del> I&#8217;m sure everyone has encountered this at some point, and I&#8217;m here to help. This is product testing for Pinterest, and today we&#8217;re looking at three separate DIY&#8217;s that involve those books you have that have seen better days (I&#8217;ll be using an unreadable paperback copy of Prisoner of Azkaban that comes apart in many little sections, I was apparently a very aggressive reader as a child.). They&#8217;ll each be rated on three criteria; ease, clarity of directions, and durability of the final product.</p>
<p><span id="more-1214"></span>The first image is a really beautifully simple book bead from <a href="http://smallestforest.net/2009/11/23/a-quick-tutorial-book-beads/">Smallestforest.net</a>. Let&#8217;s dive right in.</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/d6415e84a1dbac4a3a4aed9266833471.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1215" alt="d6415e84a1dbac4a3a4aed9266833471" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/d6415e84a1dbac4a3a4aed9266833471.jpg?w=611"   /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ease:</strong> 4/5, the only reason it isn&#8217;t 5/5 is because you do need a craft punch in order to do it correctly in a reasonable amount of time. Or you could spend hours cutting out tiny perfect flowers, your choice.</p>
<p><strong> Clarity:</strong> 4/5, the pictures are fairly self explanatory, but a caption with a word about the amount of flowers per bead or the type of adhesive or recommended dry time would be helpful. The craft completion wasn&#8217;t inhibited by the lack of them. I used plain old Elmer&#8217;s glue and let them dry overnight to be safe.</p>
<p><strong> Durability:</strong> 2/5, make sure you don&#8217;t wear these on rainy days or varnish them to waterproof the beads. The stiffness is also an issue that varnish would solve, the beads without it run the risk of getting completely flattened by a bump into something.</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> 3/5, easy and cute, with a few extra steps or different materials they could last a long time but the beads as they are at the end of the directions won&#8217;t last long with regular use.</p>
<p>Next is the fun book lantern that&#8217;s popped up on my feed too many times to count from <a href="http://the3rsblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/07/project-19-week-22-book-pages-pendant-lantern/">Reduce, Reuse, Redecorate</a>. They&#8217;d be really awesome as party decorations.</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/91d758640c10e59bad53a0c06cc31fad.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1216" alt="91d758640c10e59bad53a0c06cc31fad" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/91d758640c10e59bad53a0c06cc31fad.jpg?w=611"   /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ease:</strong> 3/5, this is easy as long as you have a circle cutter or large circular craft punch and are better at lining things up than I am. You can freehand the circles like the directions say, but I noticed too many variations in the overall shape of the circles when I did that.</p>
<p><strong> Clarity:</strong> 4/5, the directions aren&#8217;t directions in a step by step sense. It&#8217;s all fairly common sense, someone could make this just by seeing the picture. Once again, a note on type of glue and dry time would be nice.</p>
<p><strong> Durability:</strong> 2/5, probably best as party decorations and not permanent fixtures as the paper will gather dust and discolor depending on the light exposure and other environmental factors.</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> 3/5, fun for a small event, maybe too labor intensive to do enough for a large space, and definitely not for forever (how does one clean paper, exactly?). The delicate nature of the paper lantern also makes this not the best craft to have within reach of anyone under the age of 3, or active kids in general.</p>
<p>Last we have the book rose, used for decorating presents or just about anything else from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFHun3tgZ0M">Luvleescrappin on Youtube.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-15-at-10-29-06-pm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-1217" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-15 at 10.29.06 PM" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-15-at-10-29-06-pm.png?w=150&#038;h=132" width="150" height="132" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ease:</strong> 5/5, can you trace a circle? Can you draw a spiral? Are you capable of using scissors and cutting along a line? Can you roll up paper. Good, then you can do this craft.</p>
<p><strong> Clarity:</strong> 5/5, the video is maybe a bit long, but everything you&#8217;d need to know is stated.</p>
<p><strong> Durability:</strong> 3/5, for their stated purpose, decorating a wrapped gift, they work great as long as you don&#8217;t put another gift on top. For any other purpose you&#8217;d need to stiffen and waterproof these or use a different material.</p>
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> 4/5, it&#8217;s easy and cost effective, and it makes your gifts look extra fancy The skill can also be translated onto different materials to make fabric roses for hair clips or pretty pastel card stick roses for Easter napkin rings. If you&#8217;ve got some extra paper around, give it a shot.</p>
<p>I hope this was informative, and I&#8217;d love to see any Pinterest crafts you&#8217;d like me to test out in the future before you go making a mess for a bad craft (or, if you&#8217;ve been tricked by a craft in the past I&#8217;d love to hear the story). Leave me a link below!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/we-are-fandom.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1204" alt="we are fandom, hear us roar - a discourse on how a fandom can make or break anything on the internet." src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/we-are-fandom.jpg?w=550&#038;h=218" width="550" height="218" /></a></p>
<p>It’s a running joke that Tumblr is fueled by two things: hipsters and fandoms.  But mostly fandoms. Seriously, I dare you to find a hipster photography post that doesn&#8217;t get hijacked by the <em>Supernatural</em>, <em>Doctor Who</em>, <em>Sherlock,</em> or<em> Merlin </em>fandom at some point. I dare you.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about social media like Tumblr is that it has generated even more participatory culture amongst fangirls and fanboys everywhere. It&#8217;s easier than ever to paint your favorite character, remix a song, or make a fan video and share it with millions on a variety of platforms where fellow enthusiasts can offer criticism, praise, and even their own responses. Let&#8217;s not even get started on the gifs. Some shows, such as <em>BBC Sherlock</em>, have been gif&#8217;d so much that you can probably watch the entirety of the series in gifs.</p>
<p><span id="more-1193"></span>The instantaneous nature of the internet also means that fandom news travels fast. In fact, news travels so quickly that this photo of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman turned into a fandom phenomenon in just a few hours&#8217; time on Monday, March 11th.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 478px"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://static.entertainmentwise.com/photos/Image/bbc%201.jpg" width="468" height="350" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s grape to see you too, buddy!</p></div>
<p>Yes, a simple silly picture taken between cast mates led to fan art, gifs, copycat pictures, and my personal favorite, the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23replacesherlockquoteswithgrape&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#ReplaceSherlockQuotesWithGrape</a> tag on Twitter.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/712e6a73d2ae0761df1cd5ddb7c4c08a/tumblr_mjjypapKxx1s48lc7o1_500.jpg" width="400" height="294" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Okay, this one was pretty grape as well. <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/712e6a73d2ae0761df1cd5ddb7c4c08a/tumblr_mjjypapKxx1s48lc7o1_500.jpg" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p></div>
<p>Instead of relying on traditional news media, which can take days or even weeks to spread the word on a beloved show, we can all flock to our computer screens and have the latest news in a matter of minutes. And then we can all flail together.</p>
<p>You may be thinking: &#8220;Okay, so fans have all this access to other fan-generated content now. So what?&#8221;</p>
<p>The point is simple. Technology has changed the way in which we interact with each other as fans and has created a giant network of fans all across the world. We are not limited to sharing our love of a particular book or television show with only those in our immediate vicinity; the only limit to fandom groups now is internet access. However, this accessibility has lead to some criticism of the new generation of fandom.</p>
<p>Recently, the new wave of internet fandom has come under scrutiny, particularly in the Sherlock Holmes community. Some of the more traditional fan-based groups that pride themselves on their scholarly approach to their passion showed disdain for the new generation of Sherlockians. It is no secret that some prominent members of the Baker Street Irregulars (we&#8217;re looking at you, Shreffler) expressed their disapproval of popular podcasters, <a href="http://bakerstreetbabes.com/">The Baker Street Babes</a>. The situation even warranted a mention in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/books/suit-says-sherlock-belongs-to-the-ages.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> article</a>. The fact that anyone&#8217;s &#8220;fan cred&#8221; can be questioned is ridiculous. The fact that female fans were targeted specifically YET AGAIN is outrageous. Didn&#8217;t we just fight this &#8220;fake geek girl&#8221; battle? Clearly the war is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The BSI and BSB situation raised an interesting dialogue on what it means to be a fan, one which we believe the majority of the BSI <a href="http://bakerstreetbabes.tumblr.com/post/43615655994/sherlockians-read-this-read-thiiiiiiiiiis" target="_blank">responded to beautifully</a>. The fact of the matter is, anyone can be a fan of something. It doesn&#8217;t truly matter how long you&#8217;ve been a fan of Sherlock Holmes or the Avengers. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you haven&#8217;t read every single canon story and if you don&#8217;t write academic essays on the homoerotic subtext of Batman comics. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t regularly discuss the deeper symbolism of <em>Doctor Who</em> episodes at dinner parties. If you love something you are free to express that love and connect with others in any way you see fit. This is a truth that should go without saying.</p>
<p>Why then, does fan snobbery exist? The answer is quite simple. We, the online fandom generation, are a threat. In fact, we&#8217;re completely taking over. Not only do we interact with each other in new ways, but we also interact with the writers, actors, directors, artists, etc. in ways that traditional fan avenues could never hope to achieve. Sure, you can meet an actor at a convention, but do you really think that thirty second interaction is going to have as much impact on say, Martin Freeman, as does the existence of Tumblr? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>We, the online fandom, have everyone&#8217;s attention. We&#8217;re the ones helping to shape the shows we love. We&#8217;re the ones taking over social media as we know it. <em>And people are taking notice.</em></p>
<p>We are fandom, hear us ROAR.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/simcity_logo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1186" alt="simcity_logo" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/simcity_logo.jpg?w=611&#038;h=305" width="611" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>Chances are, if you used a computer with any sort of regularity in the past decade or two, you&#8217;ve encountered the franchise that changed gaming forever. Before Will Wright created the very first <em>SimCity</em> game, the closest thing we had to an open-ended city building game experience was the option to edit custom maps for other games. <em>SimCity </em>was the first of its kind, focusing on the goal of running a city rather than defeating an enemy in battle. In theory, you could play <em>SimCity</em> forever without ending the game. Over the years, Maxis have released several sequels to <em>SimCity</em>, each one more innovative and groundbreaking than the last. When the latest, prettiest and most complex <em>SimCity</em> game (and the first one in about a decade, if you don&#8217;t count <em>SimCity Societies</em> which no one does) was announced, hardcore gamers were dying to get their hands on it. Then, <del>the fire nation</del> EA attacked.</p>
<p><span id="more-1185"></span></p>
<p>So what went wrong? A number of things. Problem numero uno was (and is) definitely the always-online requirement. If you disconnect from the internet,<em> you cannot play </em><em>SimCity</em>. This is a measure that has become popular in recent times. One big release that had an always-online DRM requirement is Blizzard&#8217;s <em>Diablo III. </em>While there were some glitches and hiccups during the launch, the demand for servers was filled and bugs sorted out at record speed when you compare it to EA&#8217;s handling of the <em>SimCity</em> disaster so far. Now, it made sense for <em>Diablo III</em> to have an always-online requirement, in a way &#8211; I have  many fond memories of hours spent on Battle.net, back when <em>Diablo II </em>was the best game money could buy. However, EA alienated a large segment of potential buyers outright by slapping an always-online requirement on a game that has been single-player for, oh, <em>all of its existence</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 329px"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://www6.pcmag.com/media/images/347232-simcity-social.jpg?thumb=y" width="319" height="319" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color:#cc99ff;"><em>Unless you count <strong>SimCity Social</strong>. Which we don&#8217;t.</em></span></p></div>
<p>So, basically, what we&#8217;ve got here is many people who want to play a single-player game, which has to be played while connected to the internet for no good reason, and not enough server space. This has proved to be a recipe for disaster over the past week. Though EA is busy adding new servers, Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=simcity">#simcity hashtag</a> is filled to the brim with angry players who are stuck waiting for server space to free up.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>“So, what made you decide to major in urban planning?&#8221;"Well I was going to play <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23SimCity">#SimCity</a>, but I figured this would be faster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twitter isn&#8217;t the only social networking site swarming with people who are tired of staring at a queue timer. Redditors bemoan the existence of DRM while pondering how long it will be before a cracked version of <em>SimCity</em> starts making the rounds. A large number of people detail their <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/7/4076570/ea-not-offering-simcity-refunds">struggle to obtain a refund</a>, after finding the game to be completely unplayable due to the DRM requirement. Though <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/ea-not-altering-return-policy-for-furious-simcity-buyers/">Amazon is offering buyers refunds</a>, those who have purchased it from other sources are left out in the cold. EA has previously had customer service employees <a href="http://imgur.com/Q0N6rUo">threaten people with the ban hammer</a> for daring to requesting a refund, they now say it is perfectly alright to do so (<a href="http://pastebin.com/mFMt375v">good luck actually GETTING one, though</a>). People have also taken their rage to Amazon. As of 11pm EST, both of Amazon&#8217;s listings for the game (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/SimCity-Limited-Edition-Pc/product-reviews/B007FTE2VW/ref=dp_db_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">limited </a>and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Arts-41018ted-Edition2-SimCity/product-reviews/B007VTVRFA/ref=cm_cr_pr_hist_5?ie=UTF8&amp;filterBy=addFiveStar&amp;showViewpoints=0">standard </a>versions) hold a combined total of 4172 one-star ratings (out of a combined total 4554 reviews for both editions). The number of 5-star reviews, by comparison, is just under a hundred when you count the number of them on both listings; however, majority of them are Uhpinions-worthy material such as this one:</p>

<p><span style="color:#339966;">You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be mega unhappy like everyone else at the constant waiting and lack of actually being able to play a game I purchased.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">Well, you&#8217;d be wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">The hours upon hours since launch that I haven&#8217;t been able to log in, whether it be sitting in queues, or server busy messages, or just plain old not working screens, I&#8217;ve managed to do a heap of things that I never do when I&#8217;m locked in my man cave playing video games.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">I&#8217;ve washed the dishes, the laundry, changed the oil in the car, mopped the floors, dusted, did a spot of gardening, greeted my children who I hadn&#8217;t really seen since Christmas, walked the dog, asked how my wife&#8217;s day has been and listened to the entire response, restocked the groceries and many more things! My family has never been happier that they&#8217;ve got a father and husband again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">In fact, I feel like Simcity has given me a new lease on life. This wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without the seemingly crazy decision to have constant online connections and server side save points even for single player.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#339966;">So I can only thank EA and Maxis. Your failures have been my rewards. 5 stars!</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>SimCity</em> launch has been so disastrous that Amazon had taken the &#8220;purchase download&#8221; option off the site for almost a full day yesterday. It is back today, though with a warning that any mortal who tries to play this game shall <del>perish</del> face incomprehensibly long waiting times. EA themselves have recently thrown their hands up in despair and sent out a memo to all affiliates asking them to <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/08/simcity-marketing-pulled-by-ea?utm_campaign=ign+main+twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">stop promoting <em>SimCity</em></a>. Maxis have also been forced to <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/7/4075120/simcity-servers-update-maxis-disabling-features">deactivate some of the gameplay features</a> until the situation is more manageable. Redditors are busy pointing out all the ways that EA has failed to adequately prepare for the influx of players at launch, detailing the shortcomings with the tenacity of Johnlock shippers deducing whether or not John and Sherlock are <em>involved</em>, if you know what we mean. Just look at this:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 550px"><img class=" " alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/H4HVHbS.png" width="540" height="346" /><p class="wp-caption-text">(<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19wlf9/how_you_know_that_bad_planning_is_at_least/">source</a>)</p></div>
<p>What is EA&#8217;s take on all this? Well they&#8217;re claiming that <em>SimCity</em>&#8216;s issues stem from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/ea-simcity-s-broken-because-it-s-just-too-much-fun--248186.phtml">too many people wanting to play i</a>t. Everyone wants to play it, so there&#8217;s not enough space. This couldn&#8217;t possibly be our fault for not holding a beta test or for putting more effort into planning the experience. Yeah, they&#8217;re for real with that. We have no words that are fit to be uttered in polite company.</p>
<p>Fortunately, players have options.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/SimCity-4-Deluxe-Edition-Download/dp/B00457VJ3G/ref=zg_bs_videogames_19"><em> SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition</em></a> has just climbed back up to Amazon&#8217;s Top Sellers list (and darn it, now I want to reinstall my copy). A handy list of the best <em>SimCity 4 </em> mods is at the top of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19u61p/for_those_that_are_going_back_to_simcity_4_since/">r/SimCity&#8217;s</a> &#8220;hot&#8221; list. And, in a brilliant marketing ploy, <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/57690/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1"><em>T</em></a><em>ropico 4</em> is on sale for 75% off on Steam. Those who are really determined to have the full <em>SimCity</em> experience for free are urged to check this <a href="http://tholman.com/playable-simcity-2013/">freeware fully functional version</a> (no really click on it we&#8217;re not kidding).</p>
<p>In the long-term, EA&#8217;s failures at launch are probably going to be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back. Already, the company has done all it can to bleed every single cent from its customers &#8211; from DRM to DLC that you have to pay extra for before you can get your game to actually work, and beyond. Already, there is talk of a class-action lawsuit against the company for failing to deliver a functional product and then refusing to offer refunds. A petition asking for the institution of a standard industry-wide refund policy in the case of non-functioning software has already made its way onto <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/institute-industry-wide-return-policy-video-games-rely-remote-servers-and-drm-function-properly/nMy1wrtC">WhiteHouse.gov</a>, and Forbes magazine&#8217;s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2013/03/08/the-simcity-effect-we-need-an-industry-wide-return-policy-for-defective-and-unplayable-games/">blog</a>. It is clear that, even if EA fixes the issues within the next day or so, there will be severe reprecussions for their failure to pay attention to their consumers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because wouldn&#8217;t we all. Thankfully elbow patches are in, and here&#8217;s a way to create some without needing to sew anything.</p>
<p>Needle felting is a magical mysterious thing that<a href="http://3chicgeeks.com/2013/02/25/diy-felt-phone-case/"> I&#8217;ve found myself doing recently</a>. The materials are pretty cost effective (I got the roving, which is the loose wool, needle, and mat for under $25), and the only real skill you need is the ability to stab something.  For this craft you will need:</p>
<p>A sweater that needs a little nerdy pizazz, roving in a contrasting color, a needle (I use the Clover 5 needle felting tool), and a mat (I used a foam mat initially, but they wear out very quickly so if you&#8217;re planning on continuing go get a brush mat)</p>
<p><span id="more-242"></span>Step 1: Find your elbow. Throw on the sweater and bend your arm, circle your elbow area with chalk.</p>
<div id="attachment_232" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0441.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-232" title="Elbow" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0441.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My Elbow is here.</p></div>
<p>Step 2: Insert the mat into the elbow and line up the circle so it sits roughly centered on the mat</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0442.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-233" title="Mat in Elbow" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0442.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Step 3: Pull out your roving and fluff it up. Try to separate major lumps, they could show up in the final product.</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0443.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-234" title="Roving" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0443.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Step 4: Use a cookie cutter in any shape you&#8217;d like. Hearts are probably the best shape other than round or oblong, I used this packing tape because I just moved and I can&#8217;t find my cookie cutters anywhere. Turns out  tape is exactly the right size.</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0444.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-235" title="Tape" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0444.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Now shove that roving in there</p>
<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0445.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-236" title="Patch" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0445.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>And start stabbing. And I mean really stab, stab until it doesn&#8217;t seem like you&#8217;re doing much of anything any more and then stab again, it&#8217;s also really important to keep your fingers away from there because those needles are sharp. You&#8217;ll probably be stabbing for about 5 minutes straight, keep in mind that you&#8217;re trying to interlock all those little fibers with each other and with the fibers of the sweater. Then remove your cookie cutter/tape roll and&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0448.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-239" title="The Patch" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0448.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Complete!</p></div>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a lovely little elbow patch. You can trim up the edges, even add a little design like polka dots or stripes if you&#8217;re feeling adventurous. Throw on your glasses and put on some smoking slippers and go prance about.</p>
<div id="attachment_240" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0449.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-240" title="IMG_0449" alt="" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/img_0449.jpg?w=200&#038;h=300" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You&#8217;re ready to hit the library.</p></div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#800080;"><strong>Or: Where Do Zombies Come From Anyway?</strong></span></p>
<p>When someone mentions the word zombie, the first thing that comes to mind is a decaying, flesh-hungry corpse that has returned from the dead to eat your brains and take over the world. You know, something straight out of <em>Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 409px"><img class="    " alt="" src="http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16900000/The-Walking-Dead-the-walking-dead-16919183-840-600.jpg" width="399" height="285" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ain&#8217;t it cute? <a href="http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/16900000/The-Walking-Dead-the-walking-dead-16919183-840-600.jpg" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p></div>
<p>Zombies have seen a huge rise in popularity lately; they&#8217;re more mainstream now than ever before. You can find them everywhere: books, graphic novels, television, film, live-action games on college campuses. It is fairly safe to say that most people are familiar with some form of zombie story these days.</p>
<p><span id="more-1171"></span>What most people don&#8217;t know is that zombies originally had nothing to do with eating flesh. Or brains. Or an inexplicable virus. Or the apocalypse. Or running around chasing each other with Nerf guns. In fact, zombies as we know them really didn&#8217;t come about until around <em>Night of the Living Dead</em>.</p>
<p>So where <strong>do</strong> zombies come from?</p>
<p>Zombies (or, more correctly, zombis) come from Afro-Caribbean folklore. The zombi figures found in Haitian tradition are vastly different from the zombies of modern film and television. They are not driven by the mad desire to consume brains, nor are their bites part of an infectious pandemic. Instead, zombis are tragic figures.</p>
<p>Zombis were people killed by man, usually by the <em>bokor</em>, or people who practice both light and dark vodou<strong>*</strong>. The bodies were reanimated after death and bound to serve their creator. They were mindless, soulless, and generally walked with a slow, limping gait. Most importantly, they were completely without agency. Zombis, in short, were slaves.</p>
<p><strong>Let me repeat that: Zombis were metaphors for slavery.</strong></p>
<p>Knowing that really offers some perspective on how Western media appropriates aspects of other cultures. Zombis have been completely transformed from victims into the enemy. Sure, you feel bad when you&#8217;re watching your favorite zombie flick and someone gets bitten and starts to transform. However, there&#8217;s still very much that us vs. them mentality. When you consider that zombis are meant to represent slaves, that mentality opens up a whole new can of worms in terms of racism and oppression.</p>
<p>Does this mean that everyone who writes zombie stories is racist? Absolutely not. By now the Western concept of the zombie has become such a fixation in the media that it is its own entity. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we shouldn&#8217;t be aware of where the zombie comes from and what cultures we are blindly taking from. Cultures that are deserving of our respect.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re sitting down to catch up on the latest Walking Dead or pen your very own zombi(e) novella, take a moment to think about the Haitian folklore that brought us the zombi figure. Reflect on it, and reflect on the implications of what you&#8217;re watching/reading/writing/playing.</p>
<p>Take a moment to respect another culture.</p>
<p><strong>*Note:</strong> <em>Not</em> voodoo. Vodou = a religion of Haitian origin. Voodoo = the Western (mis)perception of said Haitian religion.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/nerdy-news-february-2013.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" alt="nerdy news february 2013" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/nerdy-news-february-2013.jpg?w=611"   /></a></p>
<p>Hallelujah, the month of red hearts, cupids and rising Hallmark profits has come to an end! We have had so much nerdy news this month, it almost makes up for any potential strange men in diapers running around shooting arrows into people. Gosh, can you tell Freak Geek&#8217;s been corrupted by <em>Supernatural</em> to the point where she can&#8217;t go a single post without making a reference? She swears she doesn&#8217;t have issues&#8230; Anyway, read right on for February&#8217;s nerdy news roundup!</p>
<p><span id="more-1152"></span></p>
<h3>Television</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Supernatural</em> hires a consulting detective to deduce that <a href="http://orintwos.tumblr.com/post/42258685077/about-the-wall-paper-mystery-here-is-photo" target="_blank">we might be getting</a> our precious Gabriel back. Freak Geek screaming with joy about mooses and Loki.
</li>
<li>Speaking of <em>Supernatura</em>l &#8211; after 8 years, the boys finally have a man cave of their own, and Dean&#8217;s heterosexuality is iffy at best, and word on high is that Castiel will be a regular in Season 9. Loki likey.</li>
<li>In a stunning case of Potterlock, Argus Filch <a href="http://io9.com/5984835/watch-the-daleks-prepare-to-recreate-their-1964-invasion-of-earth" target="_blank">becomes the First Doctor</a> while Daleks march down streets of London. No wait, &#8220;march&#8221; isn&#8217;t right. Roll? Drift? IDK!</li>
<li><em>Supernatural</em> <a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/0eqNLQEyEJVOIOVCeiznw7" target="_blank">original soundtrack</a> makes our lives complete (Freak Geek&#8217;s, at any rate).</li>
<li><em>Walking Dead</em> returns. Enough said.</li>
<li>Helena Bonham Carter &amp; Dominic West to star in BBC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/02/helena-bonham-carter-elizabeth-taylor-movie-richard-burton" target="_blank">far better version</a> of <em>Liz &amp; Dick</em>. Promises to be eons better by virtue of not starring Lindsay Lohan.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Sherlock</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Season 3 is close to beginning production; as such, February has been an active month for <em>BBC Sherlock</em> fans. Mainly, it&#8217;s thanks to Arwel Wyn Jones, who tweeted photos of the reconstruction of 221B&#8217;s set daily and is thus hailed as a god amongst men by Sherlockians.</li>
<li>There will be official <em>BBC Sherlock</em> figurines. Artist Trevor Grove posted sculpts of the upcoming Sherlock and John figures <a href="http://trevorgrove.deviantart.com/art/Sherlock-BBC-351820363" target="_blank">on his DeviantArt</a>. The figures have already been okayed for production by the actors, the BBC and Big Chief Studios, who will be manufacturing the figures. Plans abound on tumblr for Johnlock stop-motion macarena and even more Reichenfeels. These will probably come true when the figurines are available later on in 2013.</li>
<li>The feared and beloved Dark Lord Mark Gatiss <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/02/mark-gatiss-i-want-to-see-sherlock-grow-ol/" target="_blank">has stated</a> that he hopes <em>Sherlock</em> can go on for the next 20 years. It is uncertain how many of those years would involve waiting for a new season.</li>
<li>Baker Street Irregulars (BSI) have announced that all who like Sherlock Holmes should be free to like Sherlock Holmes. Which, you know, you&#8217;d think to be a given but apparently it had to be said explicitly. It is a wonderful victory, and we salute those who have been at the forefront of the battle this whole time.</li>
<li>The legendary Reapersun drives Gaian Sherlockians wild and lets loose a maddened scavenger hunt for clues to solve a puzzle on 2/21/13. Sherlock fans come together in the forums to weep over Reichenfeels and try to obtain the mystery item. The prize was an equippable item which turns into a chibi John and Sherlock running amok, Moriarty&#8217;s hat from when he robbed the Tower of London, John&#8217;s head and a background of the door of 221B. There are also special edition items of The Sheetlock and various related things; they go nicely with the Human Skull, Jumper Collection and Red Pants. Chuck bless Reapersun.</li>
<li>BBC Shop release a series of <a href="http://www.bbcshop.com/sherlock-holmes-store/sherlock-a-study-in-pink-gift-edition-print/invt/bcsh0001/?cm_mmc=Buyat-_-Affiliate-_-Online-_-Buyat&amp;source=buyat" target="_blank">Sherlock art prints</a> by Alice X. Zhang. We desire them greatly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Movies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Benedict Cumberbatch in talks to take yet another role as misunderstood, brilliant genius &#8211; this time as Alan Turing, the forefather of computers. Freak Geek is inwardly screaming because she&#8217;s read Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <i>Cryptonomicon</i> and is now having a feeling. RORY!!! SHE IS HAVING A FEELING!!!</li>
<li> New <em>Star Trek</em> &amp; <em>Iron Man</em> trailers debut during Beyonce concert. Ovaries go boom. Tumblr flooded with gifs five minutes later.</li>
<li> Peter Dinklage is probably <a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/2013/02/15/bolivar-trask-peter-dinklage-villain-xmen-days-of-future-past/" target="_blank">playing Bolivar Trask</a> in <em>X-Men: Days of Future Past</em>, Critique Geek is now running around screaming.</li>
<li><em>Catching Fire</em> <a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/body-suit-spidey-sense-130222.htm" target="_blank">posters</a> for Victory Tour released.</li>
<li><em>Avengers 2</em> <a href="http://www.geekzenith.com/2013/02/25/joss-whedon-reveals-the-main-theme-for-avengers-2/" target="_blank">theme song</a> released.</li>
<li><a href="http://geektyrant.com/news/2013/2/27/poster-for-elijah-wood-and-sasha-greys-thriller-open-window.html?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">Posters emerge</a> of Elijah Wood&#8217;s new movie with Sasha Grey. Yes, that Sasha Grey.</li>
<li>Emma Watson attempting to hog all the Disney princesses, <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/emma-watson-may-put-on-the-glass-slipper-for-kenneth-branaghs-cinderella-20130228" target="_blank">is in talks</a> to star in Kenneth Branagh&#8217;s <em>Cinderella </em>in spite of already being signed to star in Guillermo del Toro&#8217;s <em>Beauty &amp; the Beast</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was a football game at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKVorba5GLs">Beyonce concert</a>. We&#8217;re still not sure why.</li>
<li>Indie game developers gain notoriety after <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130212/10325521952/game-developer-connects-with-pirates-sees-massive-support-deletion-torrents.shtml" target="_blank">befriending</a> Piratebay.</li>
<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Glass">Google Glass</a> is next step in fashionable scientific advancement. While it is an advanced and useful idea, the privacy issues are something to consider. Does being able to record the Nine Inch Nails concert in its entirety without holding up your iPad the entire time outweigh Google having access to pretty much everything that will be recorded by the glasses? We&#8217;re not sure, but the ability to check your Facebook feed while walking down the street, without taking the time to take out your phone seems like a valuable tool for most people. I wonder if they come with built-in Instagram?</li>
<li>SONY did a live stream to talk about PS4; did not reveal the actual console, expected retail, or anything of the sort. People excited anyway.</li>
<li>This just in: Brides would rather carry <a href="http://www.indystar.com/article/20130227/LIFE/302270040?nclick_check=1">books</a> instead of bouquets. It&#8217;s a trend we&#8217;re mostly okay with, but we have a feeling that throwing the bouquet will be a much more painful experience. On the plus side, I now have an excuse to invite my mortal enemies to my wedding and then hit them with a book. Think <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix </em>ought to do it?</li>
<li>Critique Geek wants this <a href="//news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/body-suit-spidey-sense-130222.htm" target="_blank">Spidey-sense suit</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLpyBwBhoy0" target="_blank">This happened</a>, it was awesome.</li>
<li>The Ackles offspring is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OKWVSya.jpg" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to be a Disney princess.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now you&#8217;re officially caught up on all the nerdy news of February!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/reichenbach-feels-playlist1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1145" alt="The Reichenbach Feels Playlist - All your reichenbach Fall feels in a convenient playlist format" src="http://3chicgeeks.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/reichenbach-feels-playlist1.jpg?w=611"   /></a></p>
<p>We here at 3 Chic Geeks are <em>intensely</em> familiar with the feeling of having ALL THESE FEELINGS about the Reichenbach Fall. We don&#8217;t know how Sherlock did it; we can&#8217;t get over what happened; the mere words &#8220;<em>Goodbye, John</em>&#8221; are enough to make us randomly burst into tears&#8230; we swear we don&#8217;t have problems. Now that <em>Sherlock</em> season 3 is <em>thiiiiiiiis</em> close to being filmed, we thought we&#8217;d give everybody another way of torturing themselves until that fateful day when <em>Sherlock</em> 3.1 hits the airwaves. So, the great and sinister force that is Freak Geek went through her music collection and put together a playlist that details EVERY SINGLE FEEL that you will feel&#8230; in the exact order of you feeling those feels. Ready to laugh, weep and rip your hair out? Read on to find out which songs made the list!</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#999999;">Disc</span><span style="color:#ebebeb;"><span style="color:#999999;">laimer: If this playlist looks like it was made by Dean Winchester&#8230; that&#8217;s probably because it was. Don&#8217;t judge me. I only know like five albums. -FG</span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p><span id="more-870"></span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ycOp67eLoM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">1. <em>&#8220;My friend, Sherlock Holmes, is dead.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Don&#8217;t Fear the Reaper</em> by Blue Öyster Cult.</p>
<p>Why: <em>Reichenbach Fall</em> opens with the poignant moment of John announcing that Sherlock is dead to his therapist. This song serves to remind us that Sherlock&#8217;s not really dead&#8230; and the worst is yet to come. Don&#8217;t fear the reaper, because what&#8217;s coming is ten times worse.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KysKdijAhJI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;"><em>2. GET SHERLOCK</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Ace of Spades</em> by Motorhead</p>
<p>Why: He&#8217;s the man with the key, and that&#8217;s kind of like being the man with the ace of spades&#8230; and you really can&#8217;t accuse Moriarty of wanting to live forever. <em></em></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>The pleasure is to play<br />
</em></strong><strong><em>It makes no difference what you say</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>This whole time, everything has been about The Game, ever since Sherlock swept out of the flat, John in tow, calling out to his landlady (who is not his housekeeper, thank you very much) that <em>&#8220;the game, Mrs. Hudson, is ON.&#8221;</em> And now, with this episode, as Moriarty shatters the glass and takes his seat upon the throne, crown on his head&#8230; he&#8217;s this close to winning. The only gun he needs is the ace of spades. <em></em><span style="color:#f3f3f3;font-size:xx-small;">Also, fxxx Lemmy.</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/uHS3hGlOIAA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">3.<em> &#8220;In a world of locked doors, the man with the key is king&#8230; and honey, you should see me in a crown.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Man that you Fear</em> by Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p>Why: Probably an unorthodox choice, but hear me out here: the lyrics TOTALLY fit. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Your apple has been rotting</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Tomorrow&#8217;s turned up dead<br />
</em><em>I have it all and I have no choice but to</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Make everyone pay and you will see</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>You can kill yourself now</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Because you&#8217;re dead</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>In my mind (<span style="color:#0000ff;"><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/manthatyoufear.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">x</span></a></span>)</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Those first two lines are so evocative of Moriarty carving an IOU into the apple; they completely capture the meaning of that action and that scene. And, you know, in that moment, Sherlock probably begins to understand that <em>he is going to die</em> or Moriarty will. One way or another, one of them (or possibly both) will not walk out of that game alive. Flash forward to the rooftop:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#339966;"><em><strong>Sherlock</strong>: I can still prove that you created an entirely false identity.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Moriarty</strong>: Oh just kill yourself. It&#8217;s a lot less effort. Go on. For me.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And in his mind, Moriarty sees himself as the victor already, and the loser is dead. Bonus points for this line later on in the song:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>You&#8217;ve poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I mean, do I even <em>have</em> to explain that one? To me, in this context, this line refers to the children being kidnapped and poisoned. It&#8217;s so <em>obvious</em>, Jawn.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KOQ4pkUAFbA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">4. <em>&#8220;Doing what Moriarty wants; becoming a fugitive. Run.&#8221;</em> </span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Renegade</em> by Styx.</p>
<p>Why: As the warning shot was fired and the ambiguously gay duo took off on foot, another one of Moriarty&#8217;s plans moved forward. The thoughts and hints Moriarty had placed in everyone&#8217;s heads became concrete ideas, until there were none left loyal to Sherlock.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Oh Mama, I&#8217;m in fear for my life from the long arm of the law</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Law man has put an end to my running and I&#8217;m so far from my home</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Bonus feels? Sherlock getting dressed for his arrest. That scene. As he is putting on his armor of coat and scarf, he knows, this is the last time he will see 221B in a long, long time. Perhaps, the last time he will see it ever. The only thing he knows is that he&#8217;s about to become a fugitive, and he didn&#8217;t expect John to come along with him.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/9BQYiugOwBs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">5. <em> &#8220;Take my hand!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Now people will definitely talk.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Take my Hand</em> by Simple Plan</p>
<p>Why: Oh my Chuck, the chorus! I mean, this whole song just gives me intense Reichenfeels, but think of the chorus, if nothing else!</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Take my hand tonight</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Let&#8217;s not think about tomorrow</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Take my hand tonight</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>We can find some place to go</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Cause our hearts are locked forever</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>And our love will never die</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Take my hand tonight one last time</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t ship Johnlock <del>(wait, there are people who don&#8217;t ship Johnlock?)</del> this song should give you major, crippling, heart-wrenching brotp feels, especially in the context of that moment. They&#8217;re fleeing the police on foot, handcuffed to each other, and they have no idea where they are going or what they&#8217;re going to do, beyond escaping together. The only thing that&#8217;s certain is that they will always be together, because they&#8217;re bros and that&#8217;s that&#8230; oh, no, wait, THEY WON&#8217;T BECAUSE SHERLOCK IS GOING TO FAKE DIE AND LEAVE JOHN THINKING THAT HE IS DEAD AND OH GOD I CANNOT TYPE ANYMORE WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME. [gross sobbing]</p>
<p>If you ship Johnlock, here&#8217;s a bonus round of heart-wrenching feels for you:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>The city sleeps and we&#8217;re lost in the moment</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Another kiss as we&#8217;re lying on the pavement</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>If they could see us they would tell us that we&#8217;re crazy</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>But I know they just don&#8217;t understand</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Come on, you&#8217;re Sherlockians. Doesn&#8217;t just simply <em>hearing</em> the words &#8220;lying on the pavement&#8221; make you want to curl up in a fetal position and weep while eating Nutella out of a jar with a spoon? LYING ON THE PAVEMENT. If you say no, you are a filthy liar.</p>

<p>The song: <em>Heat of the Moment</em> by Asia.</p>
<p>Why: Rise and shine, Sammy. Asia. This is the quintessential song about saying something you didn&#8217;t mean at all and regretting it for many, many years afterwards. You didn&#8217;t mean to get into a shouting match with Sherlock, did you, John? Well, it wasn&#8217;t really a shouting match though, now was it? He just kind of sat there and you shouted abuse at him. <span style="color:#e0e0e0;">(Yes, I went there, please forgive me.)</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/A3b9gOtQoq4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#99ccff;"><span style="color:#008080;">7. <em>&#8220;Come and play. Bart&#8217;s Hospital rooftop. SH </em></span><em><span style="color:#cc99ff;">PS.</span> <span style="color:#008080;">Got something of yours you might want back.</span></em></span><span style="color:#008080;"><em>&#8220;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Stayin Alive</em> by The Bee Gees.</p>
<p>Why: This should be pretty self-explanatory, don&#8217;t you think? The surest way to freak out a crowd of Sherlockians is to play the Bee Gees really loudly. Or just yell &#8220;Vatican Cameos!&#8221; and dive to the floor, but that&#8217;s&#8230; so much effort.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/pkXIYgsvO0c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">8. <em>&#8220;Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get ya?&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Sympathy for the Devil</em> by the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Why: In this song, the narrator is the devil; Lucifer himself has come to earth to introduce himself, and take account of his misdeeds. In this scene, Moriarty meets Sherlock on the rooftop, and explains what he&#8217;s done and why he&#8217;s just won the game. And just like the devil is totally not sorry for any of it, Moriarty too is blatantly unapologetic.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Pleased to meet you</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Hope you guessed my name</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Ah, what&#8217;s puzzling you</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Is the nature of my game</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>In my head, the chorus matches up to what Moriarty is saying.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#339966;"><em><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get ya?</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Sherlock:</strong> Richard Brook.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Nobody seems to get the joke. But you do.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Sherlock:</strong> Of course.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Moriarty:</strong> &#8216;Atta boy.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Sherlock:</strong> Rich Brook in German is Reichenbach. The case that made my name.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><em></em>Now, what&#8217;s the game Moriarty was playing? Even then, at the very end, the viewer is confused. What was he trying to do, what was he trying to achieve by all this? Why? And, even more importantly, <em>how</em>? What was the code?</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/a1ieuwzQ9mA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">9. <em>&#8220;Genius detective proved to be a fraud. I read it in the paper so it must be true. I love newspapers&#8230; fairy tales&#8230; and pretty grim ones too.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Take a Bow</em> by Muse.</p>
<p>Why: I imagine this is what was going through Sherlock&#8217;s head as Moriarty outlined the ending of the fairy tale. We know Sherlock has the brain of a philosopher, and yet he chooses to be a detective. What does that tell us about his heart? And once we&#8217;ve deduced what his heart is like&#8230; what can we then deduce about what he might be thinking at that very moment?</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/SIwXMPhM0FU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">10.  <em>&#8220;Your death is the only thing that&#8217;s going to call off the killers.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Thoughts of a Dying Atheist </em>by Muse</p>
<p>Why: I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me for using two Muse songs in a row, but it seems to be rather fitting at this moment. You see, both Sherlock and Moriarty are staring into the eyes of Death right now. It is highly likely neither of them had faith in a power higher than themselves; and yet, all this talk about hell and angels? As such, I thought this song to be rather apropos. Let us take the lyrics&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><em><strong>I know the moment&#8217;s near </strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> And there&#8217;s nothing we can do </strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> Look through a faithless eye </strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> Are you afraid to die? </strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And let us compare them to this scene:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#339966;"><em><strong>Sherlock:</strong> Yes, but I&#8217;m not my brother, remember? I am you. Prepared to do anything. Prepared to burn. Prepared to do what ordinary people won&#8217;t do. You want me to shake hands with you in hell, I shall not disappoint you.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Moriarty:</strong> Nah. You talk big. Nah. You&#8217;re ordinary. You&#8217;re ordinary. You&#8217;re on the side of the angels.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Sherlock:</strong> Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don&#8217;t think for one second that I am one of them.</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> <em><strong>Moriarty:</strong> No. You&#8217;re not. I see. You&#8217;re not ordinary. No. You&#8217;re me. You&#8217;re me. Thank you. Sherlock Holmes. Thank you. Bless you. As long as I&#8217;m alive, you can save your friends. You&#8217;ve got a way out. Well good luck with that. [casually shoots self in the head]</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And that, my friends, was the end of Jim Moriarty, consulting criminal.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Rc7p5kddnaQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">11. <em>&#8220;Turn around and walk back the way you came.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Die Young</em> by Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>Why: This is a very poignant moment, requires a lot of character study. Definitely, my first thought for that moment was to put Sabbath, because Ronnie James Dio is God or something like that. In that moment, perhaps, we (and John!) are realizing, Sherlock is about to die. It&#8217;s real. He&#8217;s going to do it.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/r1ydm3AKW8Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">12. <em>&#8220;Okay, look up. I&#8217;m on the rooftop.&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Oh god.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Falling Away With You</em> by Muse.</p>
<p>Why: Look, Muse just fit this episode so well, that even I have to acknowledge it. I mean, I don&#8217;t even <em>like</em> Muse. Not even on Facebook. However, this song is absolute perfection when matched up with this moment. And here is why it&#8217;s utterly and completely perfect:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>And I&#8217;ll feel my world crumbling</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> I&#8217;ll feel my life crumbling</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> I&#8217;ll feel my soul crumbling away</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> And falling away</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> Falling away with you</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the moment John realized the phone call was a ruse, everything began to crumble. Seeing Sherlock on the roof, he knew, he knew Sherlock was about to kill himself, and everything fell apart. And then Sherlock fell. <span style="color:#e0e0e0;">No, that was not okay, I&#8217;m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/rAAuvXU9Hsg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">13.<em> &#8220;I want you to tell Lestrade, I want you to tell Mrs. Hudson and Molly. In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you&#8230; that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>In My Time of Dying</em> by Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>Why: You can see it written all over Sherlock&#8217;s face as he lies to John; he doesn&#8217;t want to be saying those things. To those of you who think that he should have told John that he was only faking his death and to act surprised&#8230; it wouldn&#8217;t have worked. You know why? Sherlock was about to take a swan dive off the roof of a building; a tall building at that. Sure, he had a plan. Sure, he survived. However, there was no guarantee that he would; after all, people generally don&#8217;t survive after they pirouette off of a rooftop, thank you very much! Those words could have been the very last words that Sherlock says to John, ever; this could just as easily have ended with Sherlock really dying. This is why I find the following lines in the song really poignant at this moment:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Oh, I did somebody some good. Somebody some good&#8230;</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Oh, did somebody some good. I must have did somebody some good&#8230;</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Oh, I believe I did</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>I see the smiling faces</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>I know I must have left some traces</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>And I see them in the streets</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>And I see them in the field</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>And I hear them shouting under my feet</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>And I know it&#8217;s got to be real</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s just me, but this is totally what I would have been thinking, were I forced to lie to the person I care for most in this world in order to save his life and then pretend to kill myself in a way which could potentially end with me <em>really</em> dying. I could always be wrong though.<span style="color:#e0e0e0;"> (No, I couldn&#8217;t, don&#8217;t be silly.)</span></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ILz-98hCnWQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">14. <em>&#8220;This phone call, it&#8217;s&#8230; it&#8217;s my note. That&#8217;s what people do, don&#8217;t they? Leave a note. &#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Leave a note when?&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Goodbye, John.&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Too Close</em> by Alex Clare</p>
<p>Why: Critique Geek and myself are in agreement that <em>Too Close</em> is <strong><span style="color:#00ccff;">the</span> </strong>definitive Johnlock theme song. As such, it is being put down as the song that goes with all of the Goodbye John moments ever, because oh god feels. The lyrics, combined with that powerful singing voice are just incredibly moving, and I get emotional when I hear this song. Just look at the lyrics. LOOK AT THEM. <em>YOU SEE BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><em><strong>You&#8217;ve given me more than I can return,</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> Yet there&#8217;s oh so much that you deserve.</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> There&#8217;s nothing to say, nothing to do.</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> I&#8217;ve nothing to give,</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> I must live without you.</strong></em></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <em><strong> You know we&#8217;re heading separate ways&#8230;</strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And then, down and down and down goes Sherlock&#8230; and our hearts break into a thousand little pieces. <span style="color:#ededed;">Goodbye, John. [jumps off chair]</span></p>
<p>Bonus feels round? You know that shot, where we see John as a little speck on the ground and then everything blurs? Everything blurs because Sherlock&#8217;s seeing everything as a blur <em>because he is crying</em>. Yup. You&#8217;re welcome for that one.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kuq7RYQ8Wa0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">15. <em>&#8220;You told me once that you weren&#8217;t a hero. There were times that I didn&#8217;t even think you were human&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Just Breathe</em> by Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>Why: Probably just as heartbreaking as watching Sherlock fall, is watching John say goodbye to Sherlock. John&#8217;s a soldier, and we&#8217;d wager he&#8217;s lost many people he knew in combat&#8230; but this is his best friend. His brilliant, witty, clever, infuriating best friend, Sherlock Holmes, who was almost larger than life at times. Dead. Gone. Which is why we feel the following lyrics are totally applicable:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>Did I say that I need you?</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Did I say that I want you?</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>Oh, if I didn&#8217;t I&#8217;m a fool, you see&#8230;</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>No one knows this more than me,</em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em>As I come clean.</em></strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Please excuse me while I weep great, big tears of sorrow and pain.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='611' height='374' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kQpFJXFjc6k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h4><span style="color:#008080;">16. <em>&#8220;One more miracle, Sherlock, for me. Don&#8217;t be&#8230; dead. Would you do that, just for me? Just stop it, stop this&#8230; [cut to Sherlock standing there looking sadfais]&#8220;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Strange Face of Love</em> by Tito &amp; Tarantula.</p>
<p>Why: Some of you might recognise this song as having been in <em>Desperado</em>, which by the way is a great movie. It&#8217;s about putting aside your emotions and desires, and dealing with revenge. In a way, this is what&#8217;s coming next over the next three years or so, as Sherlock seeks out Moriarty&#8217;s accomplices and destroys the tangled web. Only after Moran is dead and done with can Sherlock return to 221B and marry John and have his babies&#8230; No, wait, <em>Sherlock</em> isn&#8217;t the one with male pregnancies, that was <em>Doctor Who</em> and Jack Harkness being Jack Harkness. My bad.</p>

<h4><span style="color:#008080;">BONUS: <em>&#8220;What do you mean you&#8217;re not dead?&#8221;</em></span></h4>
<p>The song: <em>Laugh, I nearly died</em> by the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>Why: If you&#8217;ve read the original ACD canon (if you haven&#8217;t, go ahead and do it, we&#8217;ve still got almost a year til season 3), you&#8217;d know that Holmes mentions his travels the world over during the three years after he fell. While I was pondering how that could have translated over into the modern day, I hit upon this song on my Grooveshark. Just look at these lyrics and tell me it couldn&#8217;t possibly happen:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em>I&#8217;ve been travelling but I don&#8217;t know where </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> I&#8217;ve been missing you but you just don&#8217;t care </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> And I&#8217;ve been wandering, I&#8217;ve seen Greece and Rome </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> Lost in the wilderness, so far from home </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> Yeah, yeah </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#666699;"><strong><em> I&#8217;ve been to Africa, looking for my soul </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> And I feel like an actor looking for a role </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> I&#8217;ve been in Arabia, I&#8217;ve seen a million stars </em></strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> <strong><em> Been sipping champagne on the boulevards &#8211; yes</em> </strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">I&#8217;m just saying it now&#8230; come Season 3, you are going to want this song <em>so bad</em>. I&#8217;m just leaving it here now. You know. Just in case.</span></p>
