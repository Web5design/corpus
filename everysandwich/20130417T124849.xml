			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mushrooms1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7177]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7179" title="roasted garlicky mushrooms with pasta | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mushrooms1-500x402.jpg" alt="roasted garlicky mushrooms with pasta | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="402" /></a></p>
<p>I was a picky child and there really wasn&#8217;t too much that I liked. Tomatoes, onions, zucchini and mushrooms were all off the list. Strangely enough, I loved spinach, broccoli and turnips. Maybe I was less of a picky child and more of one with distinct tastes. I remember once being cornered by my aunt who shoved an entire raw mushroom covered in dip (I was not a fan of dips either) right into my mouth. I immediately burst into tears and ran to the bathroom where the whole thing ended up in a napkin and into the garbage. It took me years before I could attempt another try at mushrooms or dip.</p>
<p>But then I discovered that if you threw enough butter and garlic at a mushroom it became really freaking delicious. So enter this pasta dish which started off as a side dish and turned into the main course. A really, really rich and buttery main course and perfect for serving for company. You definitely want to serve a good, bitter green salad alongside to help cut the richness. It can definitely be treated as a lighter dish by cutting in half the butter and olive oil and subbing in some chicken stock instead to make something a little less dangerous too. Options!</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mushrooms.jpg" rel="lightbox[7177]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7178" title="roasted garlicky mushrooms with pasta | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mushrooms-500x426.jpg" alt="roasted garlicky mushrooms with pasta | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>Sure the butter and garlic play well here, but it&#8217;s those tangy, salty capers that add a good zing! Don&#8217;t leave them out. I also really loved the pasta shape that I used. Kind of a square, wavy little number that was pillowy and perfect. My pasta bag was all in Italian so I couldn&#8217;t distinguish anything from the packaging. But if you know what kind of pasta this is, please let me know in the comments. I got it at the Santa Barbara market on Commercial Drive in Vancouver in case you&#8217;re local and want to pick some up.</p>

<div class="print-this-content"><strong>roasted garlicky mushrooms with pasta</strong><br />
<em>(adapted from <a href="http://www.gourmet.com/recipes/2000s/2009/01/roasted-mushrooms">Gourmet</a>)</em><br />
1 lb mushrooms, I used sliced baby bellas, but cremini or buttons would work well too<br />
2 T capers<br />
4 large garlic cloves, minced<br />
2 T olive oil<br />
2 T unsalted butter, cut into pieces<br />
juice from 1 lemon</p>
<p>1/2 &#8211; 3/4 lb short pasta<br />
Parmesan cheese<br />
handful of parsley (optional)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450F with rack in the middle.</p>
<p>Toss mushrooms with capers, garlic, oil, and a good grind of pepper in a 2-qt shallow baking dish. Or split them up into 2 1 quart baking dishes like I did. Top with butter and roast, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and golden, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, get pasta going according to package directions, drain reserving 2 tablespoons of cooking water. Add cooking water, mushrooms and lemon juice and toss well. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and parsley, if using. Serves 4-6 people.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7159]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7162" title="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne1-500x360.jpg" alt="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s back on with the rain and the grey skies. My umbrella and rubber boots are ready by the door &#8211; and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be needing them soon. It kinda figures that with this weather comes sad news. The truth is that I&#8217;m really bummed about Roger Ebert&#8217;s death. It seems so strange that someone who I&#8217;ve never met could have such an effect on me. When I was in school I&#8217;d stay up on Sunday nights to watch <em>Siskel &amp; Ebert</em>. Actually, sneaking downstairs with the tv on low is how I watched it since it came on after midnight for some odd scheduling reason. I saw Wes Anderson&#8217;s film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115734/">Bottle Rocket</a> at the theater a week after seeing it reviewed on their show. Ebert alerted me to great and wonderful things. That tv show feuled my love of movies and when it came time to pick a major in university I went with Film Theory. While I didn&#8217;t really want to make movies, writing, reading and soaking up all I could about films was all I wanted to do. It didn&#8217;t give me a career nor did I expect it to, but I was happy with my choices. I know quite a few people who aren&#8217;t interested in studying films &#8211; they just watch and let the movie magic take over. But for me, digging in deep was what brings even greater joy and I can thank Roger Ebert for making me aware that it was possible to look at films differently and still find unabashed joy. Today, I watch movies constantly and I even write about them in <a href="http://sundanceapples.tumblr.com/tagged/movies">short snippets on my tumblr</a> blog.  I&#8217;m sure many of you have read Ebert&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2013/04/a_leave_of_presense.html">last blog post</a> (I still haven&#8217;t as I often like to save things for later like a treat), but I do love this piece, <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2012/07/roger_loves_chaz.html">Roger loves Chaz</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne.jpg" rel="lightbox[7159]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7160" title="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne-500x375.jpg" alt="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Anyway, onto cookies! Or benne wafers. These are a strange bird. For the past few months I&#8217;ve been craving Sesame Snaps, those snappy rectangles of sesame seeds held tight with sugar. While these aren&#8217;t those hippy snacks of my childhood, they do have lots of sesame flavour to love. They&#8217;re flat and thin as pancakes and I assumed that they&#8217;d be crispy like a wafer should be. Instead, these are chewy and have a slight bend. I liked them despite my initial preconceptions. They&#8217;re sweet and nutty and just lovely with a cup of tea on a rainy afternoon.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne5.jpg" rel="lightbox[7159]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7165" title="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/benne5-500x385.jpg" alt="benne wafers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>If you do try this recipe, make them smaller than I did. I think these would be even lovelier tiny! Instead of dropping a large spoonful of dough onto your cookie sheet, go with a small teaspoons worth.</p>
<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 2 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>benne wafers</strong><br />
<em>(recipe adapted from <a href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/benne_wafers/">Simply Recipes</a>)</em></p>
<p>1 c toasted sesame seeds<br />
1 c firmly packed dark brown sugar<br />
4 T unsalted butter, slightly cool<br />
1 large egg<br />
1/2 c all purpose flour<br />
1/2 t kosher salt<br />
1/8 t baking powder<br />
1 t fresh-squeezed lemon juice<br />
1/2 t vanilla extract</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 325 F.</p>
<p>If your sesame seeds are not toasted, toast them. It&#8217;s important. Just place them in a small to medium heavy skillet and dry toast them over medium heat until fragrant &amp; light brown. Watch them carefully, shaking the pan to keep them moving as they can burn quickly. Remove them immediately to cool.</p>
<p>In a medium sized bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add in the egg and beat until incorporated. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add these dry ingredients to the butter mixture and mix well. Stir in the toasted sesame seeds, vanilla extract, and lemon juice.</p>
<p>Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Use a teaspoon to drop dough onto a cookie sheet covered in parchment or a silpat liner. Leave plenty of space for the cookies to spread &#8211; I only did about 6 cookies per sheet, but then again, I made my cookies too large. I&#8217;d suggest a small teaspoon of dough! Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the edges turn slightly brown. Cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheets, then transfer to a rack to continue cooling.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal3.jpg" rel="lightbox[7140]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7144" title="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal3-500x383.jpg" alt="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="383" /></a></p>
<p>The spring weather that is visiting Vancouver sure is intoxicating. Cherry, magnolia and forsythia are just a few of the flowering trees that are in full bloom right now making a canopy of gorgeous blooms that seem to trail you wherever you turn. There&#8217;s also been all kinds of cute, fat chirping robins in the branches outside our windows and lots of sunshine to boost spirits. I&#8217;ve been cooking and baking up a storm these last few weeks, but there&#8217;s little evidence of that here. I haven&#8217;t been able to find my rhythm on these pixel pages. Maybe my mind is stuck in the blossoms or my thoughts are buried with ideas and I&#8217;m finding it difficult to get direction amid all the chaos. But this past easter weekend I made this baked oatmeal, watched old westerns and film noirs, played darts, went on a hike in a tee-shirt (no jacket required) and enjoyed the long weekend to the fullest.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7140]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7143" title="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal2-500x375.jpg" alt="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>So when I went back to my camera and saw how pretty the pictures turned out (all that sunshine sure helps), I decided that I just needed to focus, make it work, and share this amazing recipe with you. If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for the past few years, you might remember a <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/09/best-oatmeal-ever-baked-oatmeal-with-apples/">few recipes</a> for <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2005/10/oatmeal/">baked oatmeal</a> <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2006/10/baked-oatmeal/">along the way</a>. It&#8217;s one of my favorite ways to make oatmeal but I haven&#8217;t made one in quite a while – but a prompt from <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/2013/03/we-have-rhythm.html">Orangette</a> was all I needed to get back on the baked oatmeal train. This recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580082777/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1580082777&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=thesmalljoys-20">Super Natural Every Day</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thesmalljoys-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1580082777" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> isn&#8217;t that far off from one of my old recipes, but I like the casualness of it. Instead of mixing everything up in a bowl, the oats, fruit and dry ingredients are scattered in the baking pan while the wet stuff gets poured over top.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal6.jpg" rel="lightbox[7140]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7147" title="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oatmeal6-500x375.jpg" alt="baked oatmeal with blueberries, coconut, walnuts &amp; dried apricots | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This version is full of blueberries, dried apricots, coconut and walnuts and I love the mix. I used frozen blueberries that I had frozen myself from last summer (no need to defrost!) and figured that dried apricots would be a lovely pairing. It totally was. The crunch of the walnuts were perfect and I didn&#8217;t even toast them beforehand as was recommended. And because I can&#8217;t be too far from coconut, in went some of the unsweetened shredded stuff. As Molly suggests, coconut milk would be a good substitute for the whole milk. And if you&#8217;re looking for a vegan version, please try <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/09/best-oatmeal-ever-baked-oatmeal-with-apples/">this one</a> or <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2005/10/oatmeal/">that one</a> from my archives.</p>

<p>And if you&#8217;ve got some pourable heavy cream on hand, by all means, drizzle some over top of your bowl! It&#8217;s so worth the splurge.</p>

<p><em>I used vanilla sugar since I had some on hand and it gave the dish an extra jolt of vanilla essence. If you don&#8217;t have any, please just pour in additional maple syrup and add in another teaspoon of vanilla. </em></p>
<p>2 c rolled oats (large flake) &#8211; be sure to use gluten-free oats if that is a concern<br />
1/2 c walnuts, roughly chopped<br />
1 t baking powder<br />
1/4 t freshly grated nutmeg<br />
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
1 c blueberries (frozen work fine)<br />
1/3 c unsweetened shredded coconut<br />
6-8 dried apricots, sliced into strips<br />
2 c whole milk<br />
1/4 c maple syrup<br />
2 T vanilla sugar (see recipe headnote)<br />
1 large egg<br />
2 T cold butter + more for greasing the pan<br />
1 t vanilla extract<br />
heavy cream for serving over top (optional)</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375F and set oven rack to the bottom-middle position.</p>
<p>Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Dump in the oats, nuts, baking powder, nutmeg and salt and stir around with a fork. Scatter the blueberries and apricots over the oat mixture.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, maple syrup, sugar, egg and vanilla together. Slowly pour over the oat mix and use that fork again to gently prod the liquid down into the oat layer. Cut the butter into bits and scatter evenly over top of the oats.</p>
<p>Bake for 35 minutes, or until the top is golden and the oat mixture has set. Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes before serving. If you want to gild the lily (and I highly recommend it), pour each serving with a drizzle of heavy cream. Serves 4-6.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash.jpg" rel="lightbox[7124]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7125" title="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash-500x420.jpg" alt="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>I remember visiting my grandparents in Quebec when I was very little. We arrived fairly late in the evening after a long 8 hour car ride, but my grandparents had dinner ready on the table for us. There was some kind of roasted meat, a few dishes of vegetables, and mashed potatoes. I scooped out a big pile onto my plate and dug in. Something wasn&#8217;t right and I burst into tears. My grandmother&#8217;s mashed potatoes were full of cooked mashed carrots. I liked carrots, but the combination was an abomination to my tender tastebuds.</p>
<p>After all these years, I still haven&#8217;t tried putting together carrots and potatoes, the memory of those tears linger deep. But you&#8217;ll be happy to know, that I do love mixing other vegetables into my mashed potatoes. <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/03/hide-under-a-blanket-of-this-colcannon-with-leeks/">This colcannon</a> for one is delicious and I&#8217;ve been known to stir in sautéed cabbage into my mashed potatoes, thank you very much. I&#8217;m not a mashed potato brat anymore. And I&#8217;ve got this dish chockfull of rutabagas and broccoli to prove it.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7124]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7126" title="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash1-500x372.jpg" alt="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>Rutabagas and potatoes are an easy match. The former lends a buttery golden hue along with a hint of earthy sweetness to the simple potato. But as the potatoes and rutabagas were boiling away, getting softer and ready to mash, I decided that these golden vegetables needed a bit of green. So I chopped up a head of broccoli and added it into the simmering pot. Instead of mashing the whole shebang into velvety softness, I left things a little chunky. Smashing rather than mashing is the key word. Also, you&#8217;ll note that I leave the skins on the potatoes. It keeps this dish rugged and texturally interesting. After all, this isn&#8217;t fine dining.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to go heavy on the butter because there&#8217;s a lot of flavour going on. But I did decide to amp things up with a little bit of grated extra strong cheddar cheese. I leave the cheese as an option &#8211; if you&#8217;re vegan, leave it out and sub in some Earth Balance instead of the butter. However, as much as we all like to play around with recipes, <em>please, please, please</em>, do not leave out the green onions! It just isn&#8217;t as delicious without it.</p>

<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 4 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>smashed potatoes with rutabaga &amp; broccoli</strong><br />
1 lb potatoes, well scrubbed with skins on<br />
1 small rutabaga (aka swede), peeled<br />
1 small head of broccoli<br />
1/2 c whole milk<br />
1-2 T butter<br />
salt &amp; pepper<br />
1/3 c grated extra strong cheddar cheese (optional)<br />
2 green onions, diced</p>
<p>Chop potatoes into a large dice and add them to a large pot. Chop the rutabaga into a similar size and add to the pot. Cover with water, top with a lid and bring to the boil. Add a dash of salt to the water and reduce heat to medium low and cook until potatoes and rutabaga are nearly done, about 15-20 minutes. Chop the broccoli into florets and stems and add to the pot and let cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Drain water completely from the pot and add in the milk, butter, a half teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Mash well, but leave in some lumps. You may need to add more milk to get the texture you&#8217;re looking for. Add in the grated cheese and mash just a bit more. Taste to adjust seasoning and stir in the green onions. Transfer to a serving dish.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp6.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7106" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp6-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This past weekend felt like spring. I&#8217;m not saying that because of Daylight Savings Time which is always a bit of a jab, but because you could smell it in the air. The sun was out, we walked around our neighbourhood, bought a record from the new East Van Flea, and I took pictures of the crocuses on our lawn. But because this is Vancouver in the springtime, the nice days were short-lived. Soon enough the rains came back and out came the umbrella and rain boots&#8230;.again.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp14.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7109" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp14-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>But there was a sure sign of spring at the markets: asparagus. Nothing says &#8220;Hello Springtime!&#8221; like a lean bunch of asparagus. I hate to admit that this lovely bunch came from Mexico, but after days of rain, I became easily swayed. If Mother Nature couldn&#8217;t bring me sunshine, then I was going to have to get my fill of spring one way or the other. So I bought the asparagus &#8211; and some purple tulips too, because tulips are especially lovely for conquering grey days.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp11.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7107" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp11-500x380.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to asparagus prep, I was always on <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/prepping-asparagus-to-snap-or-115964">team snap</a>, but lately I&#8217;ve heard that cutting works best and leaves less waste, so that&#8217;s what I did here and it worked beautifully. Just chop off the woody ends and prepare as usual. Easy!</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp13.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7108" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp13-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a plan set out for the asparagus, so I decided to do as I always do and roast them. When I found some pancetta in the fridge, my whole meal came into place. Bacon, asparagus and poached eggs. A simple plan that works deliciously for breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7104" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp-500x398.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="398" /></a></p>
<p>To get the meal going, I roasted the spears with the pancetta while I got my water boiling and ready for poaching. I&#8217;ve always used <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/">this brilliant method</a> for doing my eggs and I suggest you do the same. But if you want to fry up an egg sunny side up or over easy, that would be lovely too. The roasting takes 10 minutes to get the asparagus tender-crisp and the pancetta to crispy. Divide onto two plates, plop a couple eggs on top and you&#8217;ve got a tasty little meal without much effort at all. Now you can just sit back and wait for spring to come into full effect. C&#8217;mon, I&#8217;m waiting.</p>

<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 5 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; eggs</strong><br />
1 bunch asparagus<br />
6 slices of pancetta<br />
1 t olive oil<br />
4 eggs<br />
kosher salt &amp; pepper</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400F.</p>
<p>Wash asparagus under cold water, giving them a soak to remove any grit. Slice off the tough ends with a knife. Shake dry and place on a baking tray, giving each stalk a bit of space. Tear the slices of pancetta and scatter over top. Give everything a light drizzle of olive oil and a good grind of black pepper. Pop into the oven to roast for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bring water to the boil and poach your eggs (<a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/">this is my favourite method</a>) until they&#8217;ve reached their appropriate done-ness (about 3-4 minutes for a good runny egg). Or fry an egg, leaving it sunny side up.</p>
<p>Divide asparagus and pancetta over two plates and place two eggs over top. Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper and serve.<div class="clear"></div></div>

<p>I grew up in a house that didn&#8217;t go for excess. Rather, we were proud of our thriftiness and resourcefulness. Okay, that&#8217;s a lie. When I said &#8220;we&#8221;, I meant &#8220;my parents&#8221; – because I wasn&#8217;t totally down with my parents miserly ways. Our meals didn&#8217;t come with rich sauces and desserts weren&#8217;t the norm. We also didn&#8217;t over do it with the cheese. As a kid, I&#8217;d escape with money in my pockets and stockpile sour candies from the corner store. If there were opportunities for junk food binges, i participated wholeheartedly. But now as an adult, I can appreciate some of those lessons from my childhood. While I still find it hard to have restraint with an open bag of chips, I&#8217;m on board with not over doing it with cheese.</p>
<p><em>No, really.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mac.jpg" rel="lightbox[7088]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7090" title="one pot mac &amp; cheese | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mac-500x374.jpg" alt="one pot mac &amp; cheese | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>Take this mac and cheese recipe which calls for 4 cups of cheese. That&#8217;s a whole pound worth. Calories are needed and delicious but I don&#8217;t want <em>all the calories</em> in my dinner, so I cut the amount of cheese in half. Be thankful that I didn&#8217;t title my post: I Cut The Cheese because I can be immature like that. However, reducing nearly 2 cups worth didn&#8217;t ruin this mac and cheese. Maybe because I used an extra strong white Cheddar I didn&#8217;t lose any of the flavour. It was still rich, creamy and deliciously cheesy. But if you want to go for that cheese-laden crust (go ahead, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/dining/04wint.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;">gasp at that NYT photo</a>), then go for the full pounder.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about this recipe is that everything from the cheese to the milk to the uncooked pasta gets mixed up in a bowl, dumped into a baking dish and baked. No need for the extra steps of cooking the pasta and making a sauce. It&#8217;s pretty much foolproof. Make sure to serve this rich dish with a green vegetable or two. Even without all that cheese, I like to feel a bit more virtuous. See? Those childhood lessons on austerity live on!</p>

1 c cottage cheese<br />

1 t dry mustard<br />
Pinch freshly grated nutmeg<br />

2 &#8211; 4 c aged cheddar cheese, grated (original recipe calls for 4 cups, I used 2 1/2 cups)<br />
2 1/2 c macaroni or other short pasta, uncooked<br />
1 T butter</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375F. You probably should butter up your baking dish. I did not and everything turned out fine (well, nothing that a little pan soaking in hot soapy water couldn&#8217;t solve).</p>
<p>Blend together the cottage cheese, milk, mustard, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a blender or food processor. In a blender or food processor, puree cottage cheese, milk, mustard, nutmeg, salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the milk mixture with the uncooked pasta and grated cheese (reserve 1/4 cup for the topping). Pour everything into your baking dish and cover with a lid or foil. Bake for 40 minutes, give the mixture a stir, dot with butter, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake uncovered for another 30 minutes or until the pasta is tender and the cheese on top is golden and crusty. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Serves 8.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7072]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7074" title="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon2-500x395.jpg" alt="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>In our neighbourhood, we&#8217;ve got a wonderful fish market that carries only sustainable, high quality fish. So when I had a recent hankering for salmon, I had the fish monger slice me up a couple fillets. On my walk home, I started playing over in my mind different ways that I could prepare the salmon. It&#8217;s kind of funny because a friend told me that for a while he&#8217;d spot me out in the neighbourhood and would say hi, but I&#8217;d never respond. He thought I was ignoring him. I wasn&#8217;t. I think he just didn&#8217;t try hard enough. Either that, or I was mulling over salmon recipes in my head.</p>
<p>It was one of those rare, gorgeous sunny winter days and I had a little skip to my step. It was beautiful outside and inside of my head, I was slowly putting together dinner. I was in my happy place. My first concern was to keep the recipe simple and let the flavours shine. This was a costly slab of fish, so there was no need to hide it under heavy sauces or flavours. My normal go-to salmon (or trout) recipe is <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2007/02/simple-can-be-fancy/">this slightly asian</a> one with soy, blood orange and ginger. It&#8217;s simple, no doubt, but I wanted something different. Instead, I started with salty, brined capers. Sharp red onion and local garlic that came wrapped in beautiful purple papery skin came next. And I discovered half a lemon and half an orange in the fridge. Yes! I was sure the flavour combination would be perfect. And it was. The salmon was served with <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2012/12/winter-salad-eats-arugula-2-ways/">my favorite arugula salad</a>, mashed potatoes and some steamed brussels sprouts. We cracked open a nice bottle of chilled white wine and ate happily.</p>

<p>I cooked the salmon in a cast iron skillet which isn&#8217;t necessary for this dish to work. Use a baking sheet or your favorite oven dish. The parchment paper liner makes clean-up a snap.</p>
<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 7 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers</strong><br />
3-4 salmon filets<br />
3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<br />
half a red onion, thinly sliced<br />
2 T capers<br />
juice &amp; zest from 1/2 lemon<br />
juice from 1/2 orange<br />
2 T olive oil<br />
salt &amp; pepper</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450F.</p>
<p>Line a cast iron skillet with parchment for easy clean up. Scatter half of the onion slices on the bottom of the pan and place the salmon fillets on top, skin side down. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter remaining onions on top of the salmon, along with the garlic, capers and lemon zest. Pour lemon juice over top and drizzle with olive oil.</p>
<p>Place in oven and cook for about 8-12 minutes or until salmon has just cooked through.  Salmon will flake easily when done.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7055" title="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip-500x655.jpg" alt="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="655" /></a></p>
<p>Last April we moved into our new place. It&#8217;s bigger than our last apartment, with lots of windows that fill our place with so much light that I sometimes have to pinch myself. Our kitchen is still small &#8211; just a plain apartment-style galley kitchen with 2 countertops that aren&#8217;t terribly useful and certainly not envy-inducing, but they do the trick. I don&#8217;t have a window above the sink (oh to dream) but I&#8217;ve got a dishwasher so I have no real right to complain. The kitchen isn&#8217;t my style but it&#8217;s new, and when we&#8217;ve got enough savings, we&#8217;ll tackle the job to put in the kind of cabinets and counters that will make the kitchen brighter and a happier place. And we still have artwork to put up on the walls, but I love our place with it&#8217;s open spaces and cheerful light. Here&#8217;s a couple photos taken on the greyest &amp; dreariest morning so you can see a little of what I see everyday.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7061" title="my dining room | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home1-500x312.jpg" alt="my dining room | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I told you it was small. Maybe you can see why my kitchen isn&#8217;t the greatest for &#8220;action&#8221; shots. But look, I found a cute little bookcase for $30 at a local vintage shop and it now stores all my cookbooks in easy reach of the kitchen. I love it.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7060" title="the kitchen &amp; living room | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home2-500x375.jpg" alt="the kitchen &amp; living room | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Oh hey, this blog turned 8 years old today. Sorry I picked out such a long and confusing blog name, but I&#8217;m glad that so many of you have found your way here to cook, comment and pass along my site to your friends and family. I&#8217;m super thankful. To return the thanks, I&#8217;d like to share some of my favorite food blogs. Sure, you can just run down to my <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/blogroll/">blogroll</a>, but I&#8217;d like to give some shout-outs to just a handful out of the many blogs who&#8217;ve inspired my cooking and made my kitchen a better place to be in.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sprinks.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7062" title="sugar saucers!!" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sprinks-500x350.jpg" alt="sugar saucers!!" width="500" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>First off, there is the fantastic Tim of <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com">Lottie &amp; Doof</a>. If I have a favorite blog, I think it&#8217;s this one. His site is a well curated list of photos and recipes that dare you to dig further and try something new. Case in point, these cheerful <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2013/01/sugar-saucers/">Sugar Saucers</a>. How can you resist colourful candied sprinkles? I thought I could, but apparently not. I made these recently to give as a gift and instead I wanted to keep them all for myself. Luckily, I have self-restraint and gifted half the batch. The other half, I ate happily and <a href="http://poppytalk.blogspot.ca/2013/02/better-than-hearts-sugar-saucers.html">wrote about it at Poppytalk</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is Tara at <a href="http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com">Tea &amp; Cookies</a>. I&#8217;ve met her in person and she&#8217;s lovely. She also makes one helluva mean <a href="http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com/2006/01/garlic-soup-at-midnight.html">garlic soup</a>. I&#8217;ve made this soup countless times and every bowl disappears before I have a chance to take a photo. It&#8217;s that good. Creamy, buttery, and mellow and warm with garlic. Don&#8217;t skip the parsley nor the fresh-made croutons (don&#8217;t skimp on store-bought when chopping cubes of bread &amp; toasting them in the oven is so easy). My husband,a well-documented soup hater, loves this soup. So there you go.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/">Orangette</a> is another blogger who I adore. Have you seen <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/2012/11/as-loud-as-i-wanted.html">June</a>? Totally adorable. Two words: <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/2013/01/a-small-revolution.html">oat cakes</a>. I haven&#8217;t yet made these, but this weekend I&#8217;ll whip up a batch. I know they&#8217;ll be great because some of my greatest hits have come from Molly&#8217;s Seattle kitchen.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another Tara, well east of here who you probably already know over at <a href="http://sevenspoons.net/">Seven Spoons</a>. Her photos and words are beautiful without being too precious. Years ago she sent me an extra cupcake cookbook that was sent to her so she&#8217;s got a giving soul too. I can&#8217;t wait to give this fruity <a href="http://sevenspoons.net/blog/2013/2/17/the-best-conversations">breakfast cobbler</a> a try. Yup, you heard right: breakfast cobbler.</p>
<p>Kimberley at <a href="http://theyearinfood.com/">The Year in Food</a>&#8216;s photos inspire me to take better pictures. I struggle with that one. Would I be a bad food blogger to say I&#8217;m not interested in learning how to use a fiddley camera when I love my little Canon point and shoot. But I&#8217;d love to learn to compose my photos without looking fussy instead of just a quick snap or two before I sit down to dinner. I love a good chai and <a href="http://theyearinfood.com/2013/02/chai.html">this one</a> seems spicy and warming. Perfect for today&#8217;s grey day.</p>
<p>And since it&#8217;s a blog birthday, there should be cake. I think this <a href="http://dinnerwithjulie.com/2013/01/24/spice-cake-browned-butter-frosting/">spice cake with browned butter frosting</a> from <a href="http://dinnerwithjulie.com">Dinner with Julie</a> would be a fitting tribute. That Julie makes it a money cake? Well, even better. Remember those? My mom never made me a money cake &#8211; probably because she feared I&#8217;d choke on a quarter &#8211; but whenever I was at a birthday party with a money cake, well, that was THE BEST.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip4.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7059" title="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip4-500x375.jpg" alt="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And because you come for the recipes, here&#8217;s one to share that I found over at <a href="http://nicoledula.com/recipes/whipped-lemon-feta-dip">Dula Notes</a> (who I met back in June &amp; is just lovely in person). This isn&#8217;t your grandmother&#8217;s feta. It&#8217;s whipped until light and fluffy that it almost doesn&#8217;t resemble the original cheese. Lemony and garlicky along with the salty tang, this makes an ideal dip with crunchy red peppers, cucumbers and slices of lightly toasted baguette or pita. Serve alongside glasses wine to a good group of friends and you&#8217;ve got a party worth remembering. My husband had no idea what was involved and thought there was yogurt in there. That sparked an idea to try next time to cut down on all that olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>elsewhere:</strong> Head to Poppytalk where you can continue the party with a <a href="http://poppytalk.blogspot.ca/2013/02/be-perfect-host-greek-style-baked-shrimp.html">Greek-style baked shrimp dish</a>. It&#8217;s easy and a fabulous meal to whip up for a dinner party.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7046" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup2-500x436.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="436" /></a></p>
<p>At the moment, my fridge contains a dark green cluster of bitter rapini, a bag of red-stained blood oranges and 2 bulbs of fennel. It&#8217;s food like this &#8211; bitter, sharp and interesting, that helps to make February &#8211; and what&#8217;s left of winter &#8211; a bit more bearable. But a few days back, my vegetable drawer contained only a few potatoes, half a head of green cabbage and a bag of gnarled carrots. Utilitarian and handy, for sure, but not anything to get excited about. But then I made this soup.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup4.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7048" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup4-500x433.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be anything special based on the ingredients, but it&#8217;s a deceptive little number. If you left this soup in it&#8217;s natural state, chunky, you&#8217;d learn all of its secrets. But with a wave of your magic wand, or your immersion blender, the soup becomes mysterious. As you&#8217;d imagine, it&#8217;s quick and simple to whip up on a weeknight evening. Soothing and hearty, you&#8217;ll happily go back for seconds and then slurp up the leftovers for lunch. I&#8217;m sighing contentedly just thinking about this dowdy, loveable soup.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup3.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7047" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup3-500x410.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="410" /></a></p>
<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 9 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>dowdy vegetable soup</strong><br />
2 T olive oil<br />
1 onion, diced<br />
1/4 t red chili flakes<br />
3 large cloves garlic, chopped<br />
4 large carrots, diced<br />
2 celery stalks, diced<br />
1/2 head small green cabbage, sliced into thin strips &amp; then into squares<br />
2 large potatoes, well-scrubbed &amp; diced (peeled or not, it&#8217;s up to you)<br />
1 t herbes de provence<br />
a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce (I used a vegetarian version)<br />
5-6 c flavourful h<a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2011/08/homemade-vegetable-stock/">omemade vegetable stock</a> or chicken stock<br />
salt &amp; pepper to taste<br />
strong cheddar, grated, to serve (optional)</p>
<p>In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions, garlic and chili flakes. Saute for 5 minutes until the onions and garlic turn soft and fragrant, but not brown. Add in the carrots, celery, cabbage, potatoes and dried herbs and let that get familiar with the onions for a good 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Shake in some Worcestershire sauce along with the stock of your choice and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, 25 minutes. Taste and stir in some salt and pepper if needed. Now, you can serve it as it is or use an immersion blender to puree it into something smooth and creamy without any lumps. Serve with toasted bread and a sprinkle of strong cheddar cheese.<div class="clear"></div></div>

<p>This isn&#8217;t pink or red or heart shaped recipe. Though, if you&#8217;re feeling sentimental and have marbles handy, you can make heart-shaped muffins <em><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Heart-Shaped-Cupcakes-without-a-Special-Pan/step2/Filling-The-Pans/">like so</a></em>. But this recipe is a good one to make for a Valentine&#8217;s Day breakfast. A moist and light banana muffin still slightly warm from the oven? Now that&#8217;s some pretty good love right there.</p>

<p>On the weekend, Cornelius was about to throw these growing-ever-more-fragrant spotty bananas into the freezer, when I told him to leave them out. Tomorrow, I said, I&#8217;ll make muffins. And because I don&#8217;t take baking proclamations lightly, the next morning I whipped up a batch to go with our dark, hot coffees. There&#8217;s no big surprises with the recipe or the flavour. Whole oats, all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour are all partners in adding bulk. I went with a half cup of brown sugar and loved the results &#8211; not too sweet, just right. But it&#8217;s the pecans that help to make these muffins a little bit nicer. Somehow, substituting walnuts wouldn&#8217;t be quite so special. And it goes without saying that these are great if you&#8217;ve got egg allergies, are vegan or just ran out of eggs. The texture is lovely and light, not dry. Perfect morning muffins.</p>

<p>So whip up a batch and say I love you.</p>
