			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash.jpg" rel="lightbox[7124]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7125" title="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash-500x420.jpg" alt="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>I remember visiting my grandparents in Quebec when I was very little. We arrived fairly late in the evening after a long 8 hour car ride, but my grandparents had dinner ready on the table for us. There was some kind of roasted meat, a few dishes of vegetables, and mashed potatoes. I scooped out a big pile onto my plate and dug in. Something wasn&#8217;t right and I burst into tears. My grandmother&#8217;s mashed potatoes were full of cooked mashed carrots. I liked carrots, but the combination was an abomination to my tender tastebuds.</p>
<p>After all these years, I still haven&#8217;t tried putting together carrots and potatoes, the memory of those tears linger deep. But you&#8217;ll be happy to know, that I do love mixing other vegetables into my mashed potatoes. <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/03/hide-under-a-blanket-of-this-colcannon-with-leeks/">This colcannon</a> for one is delicious and I&#8217;ve been known to stir in sautéed cabbage into my mashed potatoes, thank you very much. I&#8217;m not a mashed potato brat anymore. And I&#8217;ve got this dish chockfull of rutabagas and broccoli to prove it.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7124]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7126" title="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mash1-500x372.jpg" alt="green neeps &amp; tatties (smashed potatoes, rutabagas &amp; broccoli) | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="372" /></a></p>
<p>Rutabagas and potatoes are an easy match. The former lends a buttery golden hue along with a hint of earthy sweetness to the simple potato. But as the potatoes and rutabagas were boiling away, getting softer and ready to mash, I decided that these golden vegetables needed a bit of green. So I chopped up a head of broccoli and added it into the simmering pot. Instead of mashing the whole shebang into velvety softness, I left things a little chunky. Smashing rather than mashing is the key word. Also, you&#8217;ll note that I leave the skins on the potatoes. It keeps this dish rugged and texturally interesting. After all, this isn&#8217;t fine dining.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to go heavy on the butter because there&#8217;s a lot of flavour going on. But I did decide to amp things up with a little bit of grated extra strong cheddar cheese. I leave the cheese as an option &#8211; if you&#8217;re vegan, leave it out and sub in some Earth Balance instead of the butter. However, as much as we all like to play around with recipes, <em>please, please, please</em>, do not leave out the green onions! It just isn&#8217;t as delicious without it.</p>

<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 1 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>smashed potatoes with rutabaga &amp; broccoli</strong><br />
1 lb potatoes, well scrubbed with skins on<br />
1 small rutabaga (aka swede), peeled<br />
1 small head of broccoli<br />
1/2 c whole milk<br />
1-2 T butter<br />
salt &amp; pepper<br />
1/3 c grated extra strong cheddar cheese (optional)<br />
2 green onions, diced</p>
<p>Chop potatoes into a large dice and add them to a large pot. Chop the rutabaga into a similar size and add to the pot. Cover with water, top with a lid and bring to the boil. Add a dash of salt to the water and reduce heat to medium low and cook until potatoes and rutabaga are nearly done, about 15-20 minutes. Chop the broccoli into florets and stems and add to the pot and let cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Drain water completely from the pot and add in the milk, butter, a half teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Mash well, but leave in some lumps. You may need to add more milk to get the texture you&#8217;re looking for. Add in the grated cheese and mash just a bit more. Taste to adjust seasoning and stir in the green onions. Transfer to a serving dish.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp6.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7106" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp6-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>This past weekend felt like spring. I&#8217;m not saying that because of Daylight Savings Time which is always a bit of a jab, but because you could smell it in the air. The sun was out, we walked around our neighbourhood, bought a record from the new East Van Flea, and I took pictures of the crocuses on our lawn. But because this is Vancouver in the springtime, the nice days were short-lived. Soon enough the rains came back and out came the umbrella and rain boots&#8230;.again.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp14.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7109" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp14-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>But there was a sure sign of spring at the markets: asparagus. Nothing says &#8220;Hello Springtime!&#8221; like a lean bunch of asparagus. I hate to admit that this lovely bunch came from Mexico, but after days of rain, I became easily swayed. If Mother Nature couldn&#8217;t bring me sunshine, then I was going to have to get my fill of spring one way or the other. So I bought the asparagus &#8211; and some purple tulips too, because tulips are especially lovely for conquering grey days.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp11.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7107" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp11-500x380.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to asparagus prep, I was always on <a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/prepping-asparagus-to-snap-or-115964">team snap</a>, but lately I&#8217;ve heard that cutting works best and leaves less waste, so that&#8217;s what I did here and it worked beautifully. Just chop off the woody ends and prepare as usual. Easy!</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp13.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7108" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp13-500x375.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a plan set out for the asparagus, so I decided to do as I always do and roast them. When I found some pancetta in the fridge, my whole meal came into place. Bacon, asparagus and poached eggs. A simple plan that works deliciously for breakfast, lunch or dinner.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp.jpg" rel="lightbox[7103]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7104" title="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/asp-500x398.jpg" alt="roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; a poached egg | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="398" /></a></p>
<p>To get the meal going, I roasted the spears with the pancetta while I got my water boiling and ready for poaching. I&#8217;ve always used <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/">this brilliant method</a> for doing my eggs and I suggest you do the same. But if you want to fry up an egg sunny side up or over easy, that would be lovely too. The roasting takes 10 minutes to get the asparagus tender-crisp and the pancetta to crispy. Divide onto two plates, plop a couple eggs on top and you&#8217;ve got a tasty little meal without much effort at all. Now you can just sit back and wait for spring to come into full effect. C&#8217;mon, I&#8217;m waiting.</p>
<p>In other news, I was recently interviewed by two different websites. The first is <strong>Design Feaster</strong> and you can check out <a href="http://designfeaster.blogspot.ca/2013/02/bloggers-questionnaire-jeannette-ordas.html">my interview here</a>.

<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 2 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>roasted asparagus with pancetta &amp; eggs</strong><br />
1 bunch asparagus<br />
6 slices of pancetta<br />
1 t olive oil<br />
4 eggs<br />
kosher salt &amp; pepper</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400F.</p>
<p>Wash asparagus under cold water, giving them a soak to remove any grit. Slice off the tough ends with a knife. Shake dry and place on a baking tray, giving each stalk a bit of space. Tear the slices of pancetta and scatter over top. Give everything a light drizzle of olive oil and a good grind of black pepper. Pop into the oven to roast for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, bring water to the boil and poach your eggs (<a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2008/01/how-to-make-the-perfect-poached-egg/">this is my favourite method</a>) until they&#8217;ve reached their appropriate done-ness (about 3-4 minutes for a good runny egg). Or fry an egg, leaving it sunny side up.</p>
<p>Divide asparagus and pancetta over two plates and place two eggs over top. Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper and serve.<div class="clear"></div></div>

<p>I grew up in a house that didn&#8217;t go for excess. Rather, we were proud of our thriftiness and resourcefulness. Okay, that&#8217;s a lie. When I said &#8220;we&#8221;, I meant &#8220;my parents&#8221; – because I wasn&#8217;t totally down with my parents miserly ways. Our meals didn&#8217;t come with rich sauces and desserts weren&#8217;t the norm. We also didn&#8217;t over do it with the cheese. As a kid, I&#8217;d escape with money in my pockets and stockpile sour candies from the corner store. If there were opportunities for junk food binges, i participated wholeheartedly. But now as an adult, I can appreciate some of those lessons from my childhood. While I still find it hard to have restraint with an open bag of chips, I&#8217;m on board with not over doing it with cheese.</p>
<p><em>No, really.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mac.jpg" rel="lightbox[7088]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7090" title="one pot mac &amp; cheese | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/mac-500x374.jpg" alt="one pot mac &amp; cheese | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="374" /></a></p>
<p>Take this mac and cheese recipe which calls for 4 cups of cheese. That&#8217;s a whole pound worth. Calories are needed and delicious but I don&#8217;t want <em>all the calories</em> in my dinner, so I cut the amount of cheese in half. Be thankful that I didn&#8217;t title my post: I Cut The Cheese because I can be immature like that. However, reducing nearly 2 cups worth didn&#8217;t ruin this mac and cheese. Maybe because I used an extra strong white Cheddar I didn&#8217;t lose any of the flavour. It was still rich, creamy and deliciously cheesy. But if you want to go for that cheese-laden crust (go ahead, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/dining/04wint.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;">gasp at that NYT photo</a>), then go for the full pounder.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s also interesting about this recipe is that everything from the cheese to the milk to the uncooked pasta gets mixed up in a bowl, dumped into a baking dish and baked. No need for the extra steps of cooking the pasta and making a sauce. It&#8217;s pretty much foolproof. Make sure to serve this rich dish with a green vegetable or two. Even without all that cheese, I like to feel a bit more virtuous. See? Those childhood lessons on austerity live on!</p>

1 c cottage cheese<br />
2 c whole milk<br />
1 t dry mustard<br />
Pinch freshly grated nutmeg<br />
1/2 t salt<br />
1/4 t freshly ground black pepper<br />
2 &#8211; 4 c aged cheddar cheese, grated (original recipe calls for 4 cups, I used 2 1/2 cups)<br />
2 1/2 c macaroni or other short pasta, uncooked<br />
1 T butter</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375F. You probably should butter up your baking dish. I did not and everything turned out fine (well, nothing that a little pan soaking in hot soapy water couldn&#8217;t solve).</p>
<p>Blend together the cottage cheese, milk, mustard, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a blender or food processor. In a blender or food processor, puree cottage cheese, milk, mustard, nutmeg, salt and pepper. In a large bowl, combine the milk mixture with the uncooked pasta and grated cheese (reserve 1/4 cup for the topping). Pour everything into your baking dish and cover with a lid or foil. Bake for 40 minutes, give the mixture a stir, dot with butter, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake uncovered for another 30 minutes or until the pasta is tender and the cheese on top is golden and crusty. Let stand 15 minutes before serving. Serves 8.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7072]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7074" title="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon2-500x395.jpg" alt="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="395" /></a></p>
<p>In our neighbourhood, we&#8217;ve got a wonderful fish market that carries only sustainable, high quality fish. So when I had a recent hankering for salmon, I had the fish monger slice me up a couple fillets. On my walk home, I started playing over in my mind different ways that I could prepare the salmon. It&#8217;s kind of funny because a friend told me that for a while he&#8217;d spot me out in the neighbourhood and would say hi, but I&#8217;d never respond. He thought I was ignoring him. I wasn&#8217;t. I think he just didn&#8217;t try hard enough. Either that, or I was mulling over salmon recipes in my head.</p>
<p>It was one of those rare, gorgeous sunny winter days and I had a little skip to my step. It was beautiful outside and inside of my head, I was slowly putting together dinner. I was in my happy place. My first concern was to keep the recipe simple and let the flavours shine. This was a costly slab of fish, so there was no need to hide it under heavy sauces or flavours. My normal go-to salmon (or trout) recipe is <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2007/02/simple-can-be-fancy/">this slightly asian</a> one with soy, blood orange and ginger. It&#8217;s simple, no doubt, but I wanted something different. Instead, I started with salty, brined capers. Sharp red onion and local garlic that came wrapped in beautiful purple papery skin came next. And I discovered half a lemon and half an orange in the fridge. Yes! I was sure the flavour combination would be perfect. And it was. The salmon was served with <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2012/12/winter-salad-eats-arugula-2-ways/">my favorite arugula salad</a>, mashed potatoes and some steamed brussels sprouts. We cracked open a nice bottle of chilled white wine and ate happily.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon.jpg" rel="lightbox[7072]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7073" title="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/salmon-500x414.jpg" alt="roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="414" /></a></p>
<p>I cooked the salmon in a cast iron skillet which isn&#8217;t necessary for this dish to work. Use a baking sheet or your favorite oven dish. The parchment paper liner makes clean-up a snap.</p>
<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 4 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>roasted salmon with citrus &amp; capers</strong><br />
3-4 salmon filets<br />
3 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<br />
half a red onion, thinly sliced<br />
2 T capers<br />
juice &amp; zest from 1/2 lemon<br />
juice from 1/2 orange<br />
2 T olive oil<br />
salt &amp; pepper</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 450F.</p>
<p>Line a cast iron skillet with parchment for easy clean up. Scatter half of the onion slices on the bottom of the pan and place the salmon fillets on top, skin side down. Season with salt and pepper. Scatter remaining onions on top of the salmon, along with the garlic, capers and lemon zest. Pour lemon juice over top and drizzle with olive oil.</p>
<p>Place in oven and cook for about 8-12 minutes or until salmon has just cooked through.  Salmon will flake easily when done.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7055" title="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip-500x655.jpg" alt="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="655" /></a></p>
<p>Last April we moved into our new place. It&#8217;s bigger than our last apartment, with lots of windows that fill our place with so much light that I sometimes have to pinch myself. Our kitchen is still small &#8211; just a plain apartment-style galley kitchen with 2 countertops that aren&#8217;t terribly useful and certainly not envy-inducing, but they do the trick. I don&#8217;t have a window above the sink (oh to dream) but I&#8217;ve got a dishwasher so I have no real right to complain. The kitchen isn&#8217;t my style but it&#8217;s new, and when we&#8217;ve got enough savings, we&#8217;ll tackle the job to put in the kind of cabinets and counters that will make the kitchen brighter and a happier place. And we still have artwork to put up on the walls, but I love our place with it&#8217;s open spaces and cheerful light. Here&#8217;s a couple photos taken on the greyest &amp; dreariest morning so you can see a little of what I see everyday.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7061" title="my dining room | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home1-500x312.jpg" alt="my dining room | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I told you it was small. Maybe you can see why my kitchen isn&#8217;t the greatest for &#8220;action&#8221; shots. But look, I found a cute little bookcase for $30 at a local vintage shop and it now stores all my cookbooks in easy reach of the kitchen. I love it.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7060" title="the kitchen &amp; living room | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/home2-500x375.jpg" alt="the kitchen &amp; living room | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Oh hey, this blog turned 8 years old today. Sorry I picked out such a long and confusing blog name, but I&#8217;m glad that so many of you have found your way here to cook, comment and pass along my site to your friends and family. I&#8217;m super thankful. To return the thanks, I&#8217;d like to share some of my favorite food blogs. Sure, you can just run down to my <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/blogroll/">blogroll</a>, but I&#8217;d like to give some shout-outs to just a handful out of the many blogs who&#8217;ve inspired my cooking and made my kitchen a better place to be in.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sprinks.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7062" title="sugar saucers!!" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sprinks-500x350.jpg" alt="sugar saucers!!" width="500" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>First off, there is the fantastic Tim of <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com">Lottie &amp; Doof</a>. If I have a favorite blog, I think it&#8217;s this one. His site is a well curated list of photos and recipes that dare you to dig further and try something new. Case in point, these cheerful <a href="http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2013/01/sugar-saucers/">Sugar Saucers</a>. How can you resist colourful candied sprinkles? I thought I could, but apparently not. I made these recently to give as a gift and instead I wanted to keep them all for myself. Luckily, I have self-restraint and gifted half the batch. The other half, I ate happily and <a href="http://poppytalk.blogspot.ca/2013/02/better-than-hearts-sugar-saucers.html">wrote about it at Poppytalk</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is Tara at <a href="http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com">Tea &amp; Cookies</a>. I&#8217;ve met her in person and she&#8217;s lovely. She also makes one helluva mean <a href="http://www.teaandcookiesblog.com/2006/01/garlic-soup-at-midnight.html">garlic soup</a>. I&#8217;ve made this soup countless times and every bowl disappears before I have a chance to take a photo. It&#8217;s that good. Creamy, buttery, and mellow and warm with garlic. Don&#8217;t skip the parsley nor the fresh-made croutons (don&#8217;t skimp on store-bought when chopping cubes of bread &amp; toasting them in the oven is so easy). My husband,a well-documented soup hater, loves this soup. So there you go.</p>
<p><a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/">Orangette</a> is another blogger who I adore. Have you seen <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/2012/11/as-loud-as-i-wanted.html">June</a>? Totally adorable. Two words: <a href="http://orangette.blogspot.ca/2013/01/a-small-revolution.html">oat cakes</a>. I haven&#8217;t yet made these, but this weekend I&#8217;ll whip up a batch. I know they&#8217;ll be great because some of my greatest hits have come from Molly&#8217;s Seattle kitchen.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another Tara, well east of here who you probably already know over at <a href="http://sevenspoons.net/">Seven Spoons</a>. Her photos and words are beautiful without being too precious. Years ago she sent me an extra cupcake cookbook that was sent to her so she&#8217;s got a giving soul too. I can&#8217;t wait to give this fruity <a href="http://sevenspoons.net/blog/2013/2/17/the-best-conversations">breakfast cobbler</a> a try. Yup, you heard right: breakfast cobbler.</p>
<p>Kimberley at <a href="http://theyearinfood.com/">The Year in Food</a>&#8216;s photos inspire me to take better pictures. I struggle with that one. Would I be a bad food blogger to say I&#8217;m not interested in learning how to use a fiddley camera when I love my little Canon point and shoot. But I&#8217;d love to learn to compose my photos without looking fussy instead of just a quick snap or two before I sit down to dinner. I love a good chai and <a href="http://theyearinfood.com/2013/02/chai.html">this one</a> seems spicy and warming. Perfect for today&#8217;s grey day.</p>
<p>And since it&#8217;s a blog birthday, there should be cake. I think this <a href="http://dinnerwithjulie.com/2013/01/24/spice-cake-browned-butter-frosting/">spice cake with browned butter frosting</a> from <a href="http://dinnerwithjulie.com">Dinner with Julie</a> would be a fitting tribute. That Julie makes it a money cake? Well, even better. Remember those? My mom never made me a money cake &#8211; probably because she feared I&#8217;d choke on a quarter &#8211; but whenever I was at a birthday party with a money cake, well, that was THE BEST.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip4.jpg" rel="lightbox[7054]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7059" title="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dip4-500x375.jpg" alt="whipped lemon feta dip | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>And because you come for the recipes, here&#8217;s one to share that I found over at <a href="http://nicoledula.com/recipes/whipped-lemon-feta-dip">Dula Notes</a> (who I met back in June &amp; is just lovely in person). This isn&#8217;t your grandmother&#8217;s feta. It&#8217;s whipped until light and fluffy that it almost doesn&#8217;t resemble the original cheese. Lemony and garlicky along with the salty tang, this makes an ideal dip with crunchy red peppers, cucumbers and slices of lightly toasted baguette or pita. Serve alongside glasses wine to a good group of friends and you&#8217;ve got a party worth remembering. My husband had no idea what was involved and thought there was yogurt in there. That sparked an idea to try next time to cut down on all that olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>elsewhere:</strong> Head to Poppytalk where you can continue the party with a <a href="http://poppytalk.blogspot.ca/2013/02/be-perfect-host-greek-style-baked-shrimp.html">Greek-style baked shrimp dish</a>. It&#8217;s easy and a fabulous meal to whip up for a dinner party.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7046" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup2-500x436.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="436" /></a></p>
<p>At the moment, my fridge contains a dark green cluster of bitter rapini, a bag of red-stained blood oranges and 2 bulbs of fennel. It&#8217;s food like this &#8211; bitter, sharp and interesting, that helps to make February &#8211; and what&#8217;s left of winter &#8211; a bit more bearable. But a few days back, my vegetable drawer contained only a few potatoes, half a head of green cabbage and a bag of gnarled carrots. Utilitarian and handy, for sure, but not anything to get excited about. But then I made this soup.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup4.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7048" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup4-500x433.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="433" /></a></p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be anything special based on the ingredients, but it&#8217;s a deceptive little number. If you left this soup in it&#8217;s natural state, chunky, you&#8217;d learn all of its secrets. But with a wave of your magic wand, or your immersion blender, the soup becomes mysterious. As you&#8217;d imagine, it&#8217;s quick and simple to whip up on a weeknight evening. Soothing and hearty, you&#8217;ll happily go back for seconds and then slurp up the leftovers for lunch. I&#8217;m sighing contentedly just thinking about this dowdy, loveable soup.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup3.jpg" rel="lightbox[7043]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7047" title="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/soup3-500x410.jpg" alt="dowdy vegetable soup | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="410" /></a></p>
<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 6 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>dowdy vegetable soup</strong><br />
2 T olive oil<br />
1 onion, diced<br />
1/4 t red chili flakes<br />
3 large cloves garlic, chopped<br />
4 large carrots, diced<br />
2 celery stalks, diced<br />
1/2 head small green cabbage, sliced into thin strips &amp; then into squares<br />
2 large potatoes, well-scrubbed &amp; diced (peeled or not, it&#8217;s up to you)<br />
1 t herbes de provence<br />
a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce (I used a vegetarian version)<br />
5-6 c flavourful h<a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2011/08/homemade-vegetable-stock/">omemade vegetable stock</a> or chicken stock<br />
salt &amp; pepper to taste<br />
strong cheddar, grated, to serve (optional)</p>
<p>In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat, and stir in the onions, garlic and chili flakes. Saute for 5 minutes until the onions and garlic turn soft and fragrant, but not brown. Add in the carrots, celery, cabbage, potatoes and dried herbs and let that get familiar with the onions for a good 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Shake in some Worcestershire sauce along with the stock of your choice and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, 25 minutes. Taste and stir in some salt and pepper if needed. Now, you can serve it as it is or use an immersion blender to puree it into something smooth and creamy without any lumps. Serve with toasted bread and a sprinkle of strong cheddar cheese.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins3.jpg" rel="lightbox[7023]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7032" title="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins3-500x385.jpg" alt="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t pink or red or heart shaped recipe. Though, if you&#8217;re feeling sentimental and have marbles handy, you can make heart-shaped muffins <em><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Heart-Shaped-Cupcakes-without-a-Special-Pan/step2/Filling-The-Pans/">like so</a></em>. But this recipe is a good one to make for a Valentine&#8217;s Day breakfast. A moist and light banana muffin still slightly warm from the oven? Now that&#8217;s some pretty good love right there.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins5.jpg" rel="lightbox[7023]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7031" title="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins5-500x400.jpg" alt="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>On the weekend, Cornelius was about to throw these growing-ever-more-fragrant spotty bananas into the freezer, when I told him to leave them out. Tomorrow, I said, I&#8217;ll make muffins. And because I don&#8217;t take baking proclamations lightly, the next morning I whipped up a batch to go with our dark, hot coffees. There&#8217;s no big surprises with the recipe or the flavour. Whole oats, all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour are all partners in adding bulk. I went with a half cup of brown sugar and loved the results &#8211; not too sweet, just right. But it&#8217;s the pecans that help to make these muffins a little bit nicer. Somehow, substituting walnuts wouldn&#8217;t be quite so special. And it goes without saying that these are great if you&#8217;ve got egg allergies, are vegan or just ran out of eggs. The texture is lovely and light, not dry. Perfect morning muffins.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins1.jpg" rel="lightbox[7023]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7028" title="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/muffins1-500x391.jpg" alt="vegan banana pecan muffins | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="391" /></a></p>
<p>So whip up a batch and say I love you.</p>
<p><strong>elsewhere:</strong> Want a fun cookie that tastes amazing too? Bake up a batch of these colourful <a href="http://poppytalk.blogspot.ca/2013/02/better-than-hearts-sugar-saucers.html">sugar saucers over at Poppytalk</a>. Seriously, if I owned a bakery, these would become my signature cookie. Delicious!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola.jpg" rel="lightbox[7013]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7014" title="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola-500x373.jpg" alt="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="373" /></a></p>
<p>I made this granola the day after I made my first batch of <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2013/01/make-homemade-yogurt-in-a-slow-cooker/">homemade yogurt</a>. It seemed like the perfect pairing. Though I have to say this tahini ginger batch resulted from a pantry error. Originally the plan was to make a gingerbread granola but I was out of molasses. So instead, I went with maple syrup which works nicely to highlight and not cover up the earthy tahini flavour. Adding a double ginger component makes this breakfast sing.</p>
<p>Using a good runny tahini is always key. I used to buy organic tahini from my local co-op, but the texture sucked. Once opened, it got hard almost immediately–you could hear me screaming bloody murder just to wrangle the stuff out of the jar. Now I buy plastic jugs of the stuff that are imported from some faraway country. It&#8217;s the perfect texture every time.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola2.jpg" rel="lightbox[7013]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7016" title="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola2-500x397.jpg" alt="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="397" /></a></p>
<p>As I looked at my tahini jar recently, it seemed pretty average – but on closer inspection&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola11.jpg" rel="lightbox[7013]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7017" title="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/granola11-500x375.jpg" alt="tahini ginger granola | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;.I can only hope my tahini is crustacean-free! The tahini in the recipe not only replaces the oil, but it adds in a bit of protein and a nice mild sesame flavour (which I bumped up with the addition of actual sesame seeds).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got quite a few granola recipes on this site because I like to mix it up in the mornings. This tahini ginger version is a nice change of pace from the usual &#8211; especially if you&#8217;re looking to expand your tahini usage (it&#8217;s for more than just savoury dishes!). Lightly sweetened and the perfect morning companion with your yogurt and strong coffee.</p>

<blockquote><!-- Print This Section 8 Start -->
<div class="print-this-content"><strong>ginger tahini granola</strong><br />
3 c old fashioned rolled oats<br />
2/3 c sliced almonds<br />
1/4 c sesame seeds<br />
1/4 c ground flax seed<br />
1/4 c wheat germ<br />
2 T crystallized ginger<br />
1 t powdered ginger<br />
1 t cinnamon<br />
1/4 t freshly grated nutmeg<br />
1/2 kosher salt<br />
1/2 cup tahini<br />
1/3 cup maple syrup<br />
juice of 1/2 orange<br />
1/2 cup dried cranberries or cherries</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 275F and place the 2 oven racks in the centre of the oven.</p>
<p>In a large mixing bowl, combine everything from the rolled oats through to the kosher salt. Use your hands to make sure everything is throughly mixed.</p>
<p>In a large mixing cup, combine the tahini, maple syrup and orange juice. If the tahini you&#8217;re using isn&#8217;t runny, you may need to put some elbow grease into the stirring or add in a bit more orange juice, oil or water to thin it out. Pour over the granola and mix well with a wooden spoon until everything is good and coated.</p>
<p>Divide the mixture between 2 baking sheets covered in parchment paper and distribute the granola evenly. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring the mixture well at the 10 minute mark. Stir in the cranberries or cherries and then bake for another 10 minutes &#8211; for 30 minutes total baking time. Remove from oven and allow it to crisp up while it cools. Pack in an airtight jar.<div class="clear"></div></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex3.jpg" rel="lightbox[6873]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6999" title="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex3-500x375.jpg" alt="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I love snacks. I remember having a friend in University who hated the word &#8211; she&#8217;d repeat it over and over until it did sound like the most totally ridiculous word ever. Still, I love snacks and I won&#8217;t belittle the concept or the word further. And this party mix (aka Chex Mix) is the best snack that I&#8217;ve discovered recently.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex2.jpg" rel="lightbox[6873]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6998" title="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex2-500x375.jpg" alt="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t grow up with snacks like this &#8211; I&#8217;m new to this whole &#8220;party mix&#8221; game. But I&#8217;ve taken to it like a CHAMP. I made this to serve at our annual Boxing Day party and I loved it so much that I made another batch for <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2013/01/a-surprising-salad-tangy-parmesan-celery-salad/">our quiet New Years celebration</a>. Me + the husband + Ken Burns&#8217; Dust Bowl doc + party mix. Living it up right.</p>
<p>Also, anything that can be served right from a large empty yogurt container is a-okay in my books.</p>
<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex1.jpg" rel="lightbox[6873]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6997" title="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/chex1-500x411.jpg" alt="sweet, spicy &amp; salty party mix | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="411" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is any different from any of the legions of Chex mix-style recipes out there, but it&#8217;s a keeper. It&#8217;s got everything that I love – from the crunchy toasted cereals and pretzels to the salty-sweet-spicy buttery combination. It&#8217;s great for any gathering or party and I think you could play around with the flavours if you were so inclined. Me, I&#8217;ll be keeping this as is. Though, I should point out that the second time we made it, I used up some leftover &#8220;hard butter sauce&#8221; (aka rum flavoured butter + icing sugar from our xmas pudding)  instead of adding in the butter and brown sugar and I believe it was even better than the first time I made it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I&#8217;d like to mention that I&#8217;m super chuffed to have won in two categories for the <a href="http://www.ninjamatics.com/canadian-weblog-awards">THE NINJAMATICS&#8217; 2012 CANADIAN WEBLOG AWARDS</a> for &#8220;Best Designed Weblog&#8221; &amp; &#8220;Best Weblog About Food &amp; Drink &#8220;. Now that&#8217;s something to celebrate!! Party mix for all!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/millet.jpg" rel="lightbox[6989]"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6990" title="millet &amp; kale gratin | everybody likes sandwiches" src="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/millet-500x376.jpg" alt="millet &amp; kale gratin | everybody likes sandwiches" width="500" height="376" /></a></p>
<p>After the work frenzy that was December, I was hoping for a lull. A bit of managed space where I could re-focus, make notes and find time away from work. I was hoping to find inspiration, to get a grip on the reins, to take charge of my destiny (even just in the smallest ways). But instead of finding the quiet, I went to my friend&#8217;s <a href="http://nlnlvancouver.tumblr.com/">weekly dance night</a> where I danced in the dark on a recent Wednesday night and let loose for an hour. Afterwards I walked to a tiny neighbourhood pub where I chatted with old friends, talked to new people and realized that I&#8217;m pretty decent with a set of darts. One Sunday night, I walked to an actual movie theater, ate delicious popcorn covered in real butter while watching the new Tarantino film. So far this month, I&#8217;ve taken every opportunity to meet up with friends while laughing out loud over dinner, board games and beers. It&#8217;s something I need to do more. Reconnecting! Friends! More spontaneous opportunities for fun!</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a boisterous meal you&#8217;re looking at. It&#8217;s not spicy or decadent and it would make a lovely brunch dish. I made this on a weeknight when it was just Cornelius and I. It was cozy, delicious and simple to put together. It reminds me a bit of a crustless quiche and it&#8217;s healthy and the kind of comforting food I crave in January. While it&#8217;s nice on those quiet times, it would make a charming meal to serve alongside a couple of good friends. Glasses of wine, a great <a href="http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9049-foxygen/">new record</a> on the hi-fi, and maybe a <a href="http://everybodylikessandwiches.com/2012/01/lime-tart/">decadent, billowy dessert</a>? Yes to all!!</p>

<p>I took liberties with the recipe, making it less fussy in my opinion. I sautéed the kale, I threw in a bright red pepper and skipped the cream. Use whatever green you have on hand: chard, spinach, mizuna, mustard. I used some beautifully gigantic dark green Dinosaur kale from the co-op down the street. I loved the millet, but quinoa would be a good substitute here too.</p>

<div class="print-this-content"><strong>kale &amp; millet gratin</strong><br />
<strong></strong><em>(adapted from <a href="http://asweetspoonful.com/2013/01/deliberately.html">A Sweet Spoonful</a>)</em><br />
<em>The original recipe called to soak raw millet in warm water and then add it uncooked to the dish, resulting in a slightly crunchy &amp; chewy texture. I cooked the millet since I didn&#8217;t think the texture would go over too well with the other person in the room. It turned out beautifully. Whatever method you choose, I&#8217;m sure it will be lovely.</em></p>
<p>1/2 c millet<br />
2 T extra-virgin olive oil<br />
1/2 red onion, sliced thinly<br />
4 garlic cloves, minced<br />
1 small red pepper, diced<br />
1 large bunch of kale, ribs removed &amp; leaves sliced<br />
1 t herbs de provence<br />
2 large eggs, beaten<br />
1/2 c grated Parmesan (I used a mix of Parmesan and a bit of extra sharp cheddar)<br />
1 1/2 c milk<br />
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg<br />
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
Freshly ground black pepper<br />
1/4 t chili powder</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 375 F.</p>
<p>Cook the millet in 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil and then cover and simmer on low for 10 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit for another 10 minutes until the water is absorbed and the millet is fluffy.</p>
<p>Heat oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add in the onion, garlic, red pepper and herbs and saute for 3-4 minutes or until soft and fragrant. Add in the kale and cook until bright green and wilted. Remove from heat and stir in the millet.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, nutmeg, salt, black pepper and chili powder. Pour the liquid over the kale mixture and stir well to combine. Top with the Parmesan cheese.</p>
<p>Bake for 15 minutes, then increase the heat to 400 F and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until cheese is completely melted and lightly golden. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. Serves 4.<div class="clear"></div></div>
