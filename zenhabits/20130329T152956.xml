				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>How do you form the exercise habit &#8212; really make it stick?</p>

<p>Take the first step.</p>

<p>Then take another. Make each step so important that you can&#8217;t miss it. And enjoy each step.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s my method, honed from eight years of forming the exercise habit. It works, for me.</p>

<p>But everyone has a different method, and it&#8217;s inspiring and massively useful to learn from others who&#8217;ve successfully created the habit themselves.</p>

<p>Today, we&#8217;ll look at a great list of those methods, submitted by folks on Twitter who have overcome the odds and successfully formed the exercise habit.</p>

<p>First, thank you, to everyone who submitted their successful methods. It was more than I&#8217;d hoped for, and incredibly powerful reinforcement of what works. But there were so many submissions that I had to whittle it down, tossing out good ideas and picking others that I thought were more universally applicable. Many of the ones listed here were echoed many times over in the submissions.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dive in!</p>

<p>I asked people who had successfully created the exercise habit &#8212; what worked for them? They answered (note &#8211; ones without a name after them were submitted anonymously):</p>

<ol>
<li>Stop looking at it as a habit and instead as a lifestyle and an important part of my self-care. ~Lara Rininger</li>
<li>Work out first thing in the morning. You get it out of the way and it provides you with an abundance of energy for the rest of the day. ~Jen Zeman</li>
<li>Crank up your favorite music! I often see suggested play lists for workouts, but just listen to what excites you. It will get you moving. ~Jen Zeman</li>
<li>When I started running I started out at .5 miles and increased in .25 increments (I usually average 4 mile runs). It didn&#8217;t happen overnight &#8211; give your lungs and muscles time to adjust. Same with weight training &#8211; start light and build your way up. Results will start to show in about 3-4 weeks. ~Jen Zeman</li>
<li>Making it my #1 priority and doing it first thing in the morning.        </li>
<li>30 day yoga challenges for myself that I then give updates on my Blog. Accountability. ~Kira Elliott</li>
<li>If I workout in the morning, before my day starts, I &#8220;earn: chocolate/beer/carb later in the day. Otherwise, no treats for me!</li>
<li>No excuses. I never miss more than 2 days. You have to insist on it and protect it.</li>
<li>Also: just put your workout clothes on. Once you do that it feels silly not to start. Just commit to 10 minutes. You will probably do more.</li>
<li>Also: no one ever regrets working out. Is there anything else in the world you can do, and know 100% you won&#8217;t regret it?</li>
<li>This is the one that&#8217;s helped the most: I&#8217;ve made a point to really, really, REALLY notice how much better I feel now that I exercise regularly; I&#8217;m sleeping better, my mood is better, I&#8217;m much less sluggish. It took about 3-4 weeks to see it, but it&#8217;s helped a lot. ~Polly</li>
<li>Make it a habit, don&#8217;t rely on motivating yourself to workout, consciously think of it as just something you do after &#8216;x&#8217;. This was a huge aha moment for me. ~Mark Feinholz</li>
<li>On that note, do it in the morning, habits are much easier to establish in the morning. the triggers are much more dependable (finish cup of coffee &#8211; put on gym shorts). Morning triggers are always there and the day has not polluted your plans yet. </li>
<li>A daily morning ritual to mark the beginning of training. In my case, tying up my bandana on my head meant &#8216;It&#8217;s running time&#8217;. ~Alfonso Acosta</li>
<li>I started running consistently the month before I got divorced. In theory it was the lowest part of my life &#8212; but I&#8217;d never felt better. I couldn&#8217;t get over that. I was sold on exercise, though it took me a while to make running the nonnegotiable part of my schedule it is now. After I got married again and when our daughter was a baby I used to run at the high school track near our house. I&#8217;d pretend the bleachers were filled with people cheering me on. “Good job!” I imagined them hollering. “Way to go!” And, “It’s great you’re leaving the baby with Dad for a while on this beautiful summer evening to do something nice for yourself.” Well, nice &#8212; and hell. It was hell. I wasn’t in shape, I didn’t want to miss a second with our new baby, and that was that. The pretend cheerleaders must’ve helped. Certainly they didn’t hurt. Because eventually, through a series of learning and unlearning and relearning the importance of exercising, it’s what I do. No discussion. No bargaining out of workouts unless I’ve made them up in advance. It’s soothing, really. There are no decisions to be made about exercise. I just do it. To the extent anything else good happens, I attribute it to this: running is magic. ~Maureen Anderson</li>
<li>Fixed a time of the day that HAS to be the workout time. Cleared away tasks around that time to make sure I don&#8217;t get stuck with something else. ~Elle Kaiye</li>
<li>Mentally preparing myself during the day for the evening workout helped.Mental preparation was important to prevent talking myself out of workout on the pretext of being &#8220;&#8221;exhausted&#8221;" or having &#8220;&#8221;more important stuff to do&#8221;". ~Elle Kaiye</li>
<li>Sometimes even looking at the pictures of Victoria&#8217;s Secret Angels helped ;) ~Elle Kaiye</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t have a workout buddy now but that had helped me to stay on track in the past. Support from my Mom helped me a lot! ~Elle Kaiye</li>
<li>Doing a sport that you love and try new types of exercise/sports. ~Chris B.</li>
<li>Do it a few days in a row, you &#8211; your body and mind- will get used to it. ~Chris B.</li>
<li>Enter a race or contest. ~Chris B.</li>
<li>I had to stop setting goals &#8211; as is advised by pretty much every source out there! I just got discouraged that I wasn&#8217;t moving as fast as the &#8216;programme&#8217;, or that I still felt no closer to running a marathon I seriously didn&#8217;t want to.
>What works instead: feeling great about just turning up. I do what I feel able to when I&#8217;m there, and if it&#8217;s not much or not as much as last time &#8211; fine. I showed up. I get to say &#8220;I went to the gym&#8221; which impresses on its own, without me detailing what I did! ~Sarah</li>
<li>A lot of people take days off when they&#8217;re exercising, which I think is great and important for your body to recover. However, I&#8217;ve found the habit of going to the gym (or wherever you go to workout) is important for me to do EVERY DAY. I run and do some strength training most days, but when it&#8217;s time for a recovery day I still go to the gym- to play racquetball, take an easy walk, shoot a few baskets, whatever. ~Dave Hall</li>
<li>What worked for me was strong commitment to myself that I do exercise on these days on this time NO MATTER WHAT. I do not accept situations I wouldn&#8217;t exercise on my planned day if for example I felt tired, or couples of friends invited me for a meeting, or it was raining (running is essential part of my routine) or anything else. These are all small excuses that we have to actually struggle with. They are too small to prevent us from fulfilling the plan. I only omit my exercise session if I&#8217;m on vacation or if I&#8217;m seriously ill. In other cases there is no way to break the habit. ~Przemyslaw</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t think about it, just do it. Even though I&#8217;ve consistently worked for over 15 years, it doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have days that I just don&#8217;t feel like working out. I do have those days, but I push through it and do the work out anyway. ~Caroline</li>
<li>Schedule time for exercise and keeping to it like you would any other appointment or meeting. ~Katie</li>
<li>First I picked some awesome skills I wanted do be able to do from <a href="http://www.beastskills.com/tutorials/">this website for motivation</a>. While working towards them I basically only had a single goal: Do at least a single exercise every day, one pushup, pullup, sit up, &#8230; If I didn&#8217;t feel like it, wouldn&#8217;t do more, just a single one. Now I&#8217;m can do one armed pushups, one legged squads, l-seats and quite a few pullups. What also probably helped was that I didn&#8217;t need a single piece of equipment. ~Michael</li>
<li>I exercise every single day. Every. Single. Day. That&#8217;s my secret. I don&#8217;t give myself the choice of whether to exercise or not. Every time that you give yourself a choice, you give yourself the opportunity to decide not to do something. ~Mark Cancellieri</li>
<li>Sleep in my exercise gear (makes me feel mentally ready for action the next day). ~Ruth Seatter</li>
<li>Plan to exercise with a friend (running or gym class etc). $20 wager if you don&#8217;t make it. ~Ruth Seatter</li>
<li>Make it into a game or do it as a social activity with a friend. the more enjoyable it is the likelier you are to continue it. ~Matthew</li>
<li>Accountability. I am a very lazy person and I hate being answerable to people. I like to do things at my pace which is why I never stick to anything for long. But this time when it came to eating healthy and losing weight, I made myself answerable and accountable to my cook! I asked my cook to keep a check on what I eat and not offer me any junk or fried. So each time I entered to kitchen to grab some snacks, I saw him standing there and to avoid answering to his questions, I would step out with eating. This worked for me and now I am used to &#8216;not&#8217; eating when I am not hungry. ~Surabhi Surendra</li>
<li>Focus on effort: Set yourself goals around effort, not around results. ~Chiranth</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t let weather deter you. Once you do one or two runs in the rain you&#8217;ll see that they are liberating. ~Patty</li>
<li>I started very small. Starting small cancelled any excuse not to practice daily. I have refrained from overdoing in the first two weeks. This left me more energy to become more stable in practicing daily. I have committed with my girlfriend on a feasible outcome in a medium term, like being fit for our summer vacations. After some weeks the reason of my motivation shifted from being willing to satisfy the external source (girlfriend&#8217;s expectations) to being more confident and happy with myself. Starting one single habit is giving me the confidence to change other habits and the clarity to identify which other habits do I want to develop. ~Niccolo&#8217; Stamboglis</li>
<li>No more than 1 day off in a row. Find an exercise you really enjoy (I love lifting weights!). Try new types of exercise. You will be tired when beginning a new exercise program so eat well to fuel exercise and get enough sleep. Religiously stick with it for the first two weeks, then you will begin to notice an improvement in your energy levels that is very motivating. ~Patty</li>
<li>I joined a sports team (soccer), which is a fun way to exercise and ride my bike to work daily. This way I am physically active without really realizing it. I lack motivation to do exercises on my own. I almost need a team or coach or class to do well. (i.e. if I go to the gym solo, I get less results than if I joined a class). ~Bradlinn</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note</strong>: This is a guest post from Maneesh Sethi of <a href="http://hackthesystem.com">Hack the System</a>.</h6>

<p>It’s funny how long two minutes can be.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks ago, a package arrived: a Sonicare EasyClean Toothbrush. The toothbrush has an automatic timer which dings every thirty seconds until two minutes have passed.</p>

<p>It’s a strange thing, the mental passage of time. The first thirty seconds feel like a millennium&#8212;when the heck is this brush going to ding? By the second ding, I’ve begun walking, or pacing, or thinking, but it still feels like an eternity.</p>

<p>The third ding? I barely even notice it. And the fourth feels like barely an instant.</p>

<p>Of course, each ding really takes exactly thirty seconds, but time doesn’t always act like it should. Just like how the first five minutes of a jog feel longer than the rest, or how the first sentence of an article takes hours &#8212; but the rest seems to take minutes.</p>

<p>The Sonicare toothbrush, however, is an example of a <i>Failure-Proof Environment</i>. Once you decide to start brushing, once you hit that on-switch, the brush won’t stop until two minutes have passed. When I use a regular toothbrush, I usually quit after twenty seconds or less, but by constructing a failure-proof environment&#8212;in this case, by buying a fancy toothbrush&#8212;I <i>built a system</i> that forces me to succeed. Building this system&#8212;this failure-proof environemnt&#8212;is the key to any habit change.</p>

<p>So, how can you build a failure proof environment? How can you force yourself to build better habits?<b> </b></p>

<h3>How to Construct a Failure-Proof Environment</h3>

<p>Think about this: how many times have you promised yourself to eat better? It’s easy for your sane-superego to make a promise on January 1. But you know the rest: a couple days later, someone hands you a cookie. Your insane-emotional-id-self takes over, and forgets what the real you wants. All it can say is “cookie cookie cookie.”</p>

<p>Damn lizard brain.</p>

<p>The good news? There is a way to short-circuit this process. The secret is called <b>precommitment</b>.</p>

<p>Precommitment is the process of making a promise, when you are in your sane state, that will prevent your tempted insane-emotional-id-self from doing something bad. Imagine that on January 1<sup>st</sup>, you decide to take a flight to a deserted island, one without cookie-trees. It’s not so hard to say no to a cookie when they are impossible to find.</p>

<p>My first experience with precommitment was during a <a href="http://www.boss-inc.com/course_28-day-field_56.html">28 day trek</a> through the wilderness. I had no access to cookies, Facebook, or any other distraction. And I lost <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/how-to-lose-23-lbs-in-28-days-hint-it-requires-radical-system-hacking/">23 lbs in 28 days</a> &#8212; my first experience with a drastic environment change. For five days in a row, I was <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com/maneesh">alone in a cave</a> — just myself, a pen, and a notebook. Without access to distractions, there was no choice. I wrote more in those five days than I had written in the previous year.</p>

<p>Precommitment is the process of creating an enviroment that <b>forces</b> you to succeed.</p>

<p>You might not be able to find a month to hike in the wilderness, but there are still ways to use precommitment in your normal life. Let’s take a look at some examples.</p>

<h3>Precommitting via the Bet Switch Mechanism</h3>

<p>What’s another way to force yourself to stop eating that cookie?</p>

<p>After I returned from the wilderness, I quickly noticed the weight returning. I needed to get back in shape for a TV show I was filming, but I couldn’t just run away into a forest this time. So what did I do? I used the <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-bet-switch-mechanism-the-one-simple-tactic-that-will-make-you-lose-weight-eat-right-and-get-in-the-best-shape-of-your-life/">Bet Switch Mechanism.</a></p>

<p>The Bet Switch Mechanism is simple: you precommit to something using a bet. In the case of weight loss, I promised my friend that for every non-paleo-diet item I ate, I would pay $50 / item. In other words, that cookie wasn’t just a tasty dessert—it was $50. Instantly, my cravings disappeared. I no longer would use the excuse &#8216;let me just have one&#8230;&#8217; before engorging on a mountain of chocolate and ice cream and Love Actually.  I lost 15 lbs in 4 weeks. The incident worked so well that I <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/minimalist-guide">created a guide to help others hack their habits</a>.</p>

<p>I used the same tactic with Leo Babauta &#8212; for a week, I had to write for thirty minutes at 9am. Failure? $50. And <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/how-to-write-4x-more-words-than-you-ever-have-before-or-why-i-paypal-ed-leo-babauta-25/">Leo ended up getting paid</a>.</p>

<p>I use this tactic all the time. Heck, if I don’t finish the article you are reading now by 11:59 PST, I owe a friend $250 :p</p>

<p>Are you trying to finish something, but just not finding the motivation to do so? Find a friend to bet with. It doesn’t have to be money—one of my female friends puts her favorite dress on the line.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://stickk.com/">stickk.com</a> to find someone to bet with, if you don’t have someone nearby to work with.<b> </b></p>

<h3>Precommitting using the Craigslist Slapper Technique</h3>

<p>Still not feeling motivated? Precommit by hiring someone to force you to work.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I hired someone on Craigslist to sit down next to me. Her job was specific: every time I used Facebook, she was required to <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/">slap me in the face</a>.</p>

<p>Sure, it sounds stupid, but the act of hiring someone makes you much more likely to actually DO something. With my slapper, my productivity increased by 4x.</p>

<p>Today, when I have a project I just <b>have</b> to finish, I hire someone to sit next to me and force me to work. This way, even if my stupid lizard-brain wants to check Facebook and use Twitter, my slapper &#8212; my most powerful failure-proof precommitment tool &#8212; keeps me in check.</p>

<p>In the same vein, do you want to start going to the gym? Precommit by hiring a personal trainer for two months in advance. You will probably miss the gym on your own, but you won’t miss an (expensive) appointment with a trainer.</p>

<p>The key here is <b>set an appointment with someone else</b>. It’s easy to not show up to the gym alone, but you’re much less likely to do so if it means disappointing your trainer or friend.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>At the end of the day, it comes down to a decision &#8212; are you going to change your habits? Or are you going to live the same way you always have?</p>

<p>If you’ve made the decision to change, check out my <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/minimalist-guide">Minimalist Guide to Hacking Your Habits</a>. It’s a guide and set of worksheets that will show you the specific processes of habit change, and guide you along the way.</p>

<p>A year from now, you’ll wish you had started today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>Lots of people who start businesses try to control outcomes:</p>

<ol>
<li>A vision for your business&#8217;s success.</li>
<li>Goals to get you to the successful vision.</li>
<li>Try to get the most productive day (out of yourself, or employees).</li>
<li>Try to produce certain amounts, or hit certain metrics (pageviews, followers, revenue, sales).</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, the ability to control outcomes is an illusion. This is one of the fundamental lessons I&#8217;ve learned in my six years of being in business for myself.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t really know how things will turn out.</p>

<p>And this is OK.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#8217;s pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Yes, not knowing how things will turn out &#8212; day to day, month to month, year to year &#8212; is crazy scary. I&#8217;m not gonna front. It&#8217;s so scary you might wake up drenched in sweat.</p>

<p>But not knowing is what makes being an entrepreneur more amazing than working a regular desk job with a regular paycheck. We take risks, we fail, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, we not only put our toes into the waters of the unknown &#8230; we dive in, headfirst.</p>

<p>Yes, not knowing is scary. But <strong>if you embrace it</strong>, not knowing can be liberating, and can be an advantage.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at how it&#8217;s an advantage, and how to stay present in the middle of the unknown.</p>

<h3>The Advantage of Not Knowing</h3>

<p>Quiz question: What causes us the most anxiety? Million dollar answer: Wanting things to turn out a certain way. Wanting an outcome &#8212; wanting the person you love to love you back, wanting people at your meeting or presentation to like you, wanting a million customers, wanting to be the next Apple or Twitter or Starbucks. This is the cause of our anxiety, because when we want that outcome, we fear that it won&#8217;t come true, and we strive for it to come true, and of course it might not.</p>

<p>There are a million possibilities, and wanting just one of those possibilities is a little crazy. What&#8217;s wrong with the other 999,999? Will our worlds fall apart if that one outcome doesn&#8217;t become a reality? No. We&#8217;ll be just fine no matter what.</p>

<p>Seriously. You&#8217;ll be absolutely fine even if the outcome doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>

<p>So when anxiety comes up, if we learn to let go of needing that outcome, we can then let go of the anxiety.</p>

<p>So advantage #1: <strong>we have less anxiety</strong>. What happens when you have less anxiety? Well, you&#8217;re happier. You are happier when you meet with customers or clients or employees. They feel your happiness. They sense that you&#8217;re cool with how things are going. You are less desperate. You don&#8217;t need things to turn out a certain way &#8212; you don&#8217;t need this one sale. You do your best to make it happen, but you&#8217;re cool even if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Other people bet everything on making their outcome happen &#8212; but what if it doesn&#8217;t? Then they&#8217;ve lost everything, with no clear direction of where to go when it fails to happen.</p>

<p>So advantage #2: <strong>we aren&#8217;t as tied to one bet</strong>. That&#8217;s a single point of failure. Not a great idea. Instead, we are OK no matter what happens, and so any outcome of a meeting, a project, a launch &#8230; we are good with that, and no outcome really messes us up. We flow.</p>

<p>Another problem is that people who think they know how things will turn out &#8230; they&#8217;re fooling themselves. No one knows.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s advantage #3: <strong>we are more honest</strong>. Admitting to ourselves that we don&#8217;t know is much more honest than thinking, hoping, things will turn out the way we want. Honesty is important because if we&#8217;re going to act, we should do so with open eyes and a clear assessment of the situation.</p>

<p>Honesty with customers, readers, clients, employees is important too. Admit you don&#8217;t know. They will trust you more, because not only are you telling them you don&#8217;t know, you are clearly OK with that. You don&#8217;t know what will happen, but whatever happens, you&#8217;ll deal with it. That&#8217;s powerful.</p>

<p>Those are just a few advantages, but actually the advantages are many. You don&#8217;t have to plan as much because not knowing means you realize that detailed plans are useless, and actually a waste of your time. You spend less time worrying, more time executing. You aren&#8217;t consumed by the horrible fear that you&#8217;re doing the wrong thing, because you learn that there is never a  perfectly &#8220;right thing&#8221; to do &#8212; not generally for your business, or specifically right now.</p>

<h3>How to Walk the Not Knowing Path</h3>

<p>The Not Knowing Path of an entrepreneur is scary, but honestly, what path isn&#8217;t?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how to walk the path:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Admit you don&#8217;t know</strong>. This is obviously the first step, but it&#8217;s hard because we often want to think we know, or at least that we can make certain things happen the way we want them to. We think we can will things to happen. That&#8217;s not true. Many things fail despite Herculean efforts to make them succeed. We don&#8217;t control the future, we can&#8217;t know the future. We don&#8217;t know. Admit it to ourselves, and to others.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for anxiety</strong>. When you start feeling anxious (and that will always happen, probably numerous times a day), look inward for the source of the anxiety. What are you hoping will happen that&#8217;s making you anxious? This awareness is the key to everything.</li>
<li><strong>Tell yourself you&#8217;ll be OK</strong>. You become aware of an outcome you&#8217;re hoping for &#8230; now tell yourself that it doesn&#8217;t matter if that outcome happens. It really doesn&#8217;t matter, even if we&#8217;ve made up this story for ourselves that all depends on it happening. It doesn&#8217;t matter, and no matter what happens, we&#8217;ll be OK. Life-and-death situations are possibly the only exception to this, though I&#8217;m of the mind that even death is an outcome that I&#8217;d be OK with.</li>
<li><strong>Consider worst-case scenarios</strong>. What&#8217;s the worst thing that could happen? Someone doesn&#8217;t like you, doesn&#8217;t think as highly of you as you&#8217;d like, a meeting ends in anger, a sale doesn&#8217;t happen, the business fails. How bad is this worst-case scenario? How likely is it to happen? How would you cope if it did? Honestly, I think you&#8217;d be fine no matter what.</li>
<li><strong>Know your principles</strong>. Take some time to think about what should guide you, if you aren&#8217;t guided by trying to make something specific happen. If you&#8217;re not tied to an outcome or vision of the future you can&#8217;t control, what would guide you? Step back, reflect. What drives you? Why do you do what you do? For example, some of my guiding principles are wanting to help others, wanting to act compassionately, wanting to do things I love, and building trust by doing those things.</li>
<li><strong>Act on principles, not goals or detailed plans</strong>. Once you have your guiding principles, let them guide you on a day-by-day basis, moment-to-moment. You don&#8217;t know how something will turn out when you act, but you do know whether this action is in line with your principles.</li>
<li><strong>Breathe, and smile</strong>. In the end, not knowing can be scary, but liberating and profound. You are in the midst of a turbulent sea, and are afloat without knowing where anything will go. But that&#8217;s always true, even of people who don&#8217;t admit it to themselves. So enjoy the ride. Look at the amazing place you&#8217;re in, and smile. Because this path of not knowing &#8230; it is the path of life itself.</li>
</ol>

<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>Start with a simple statement: what do you want to be?</p>

<p>Are you hoping to someday be a writer, a musician, a designer, a programmer, a polyglot, a carpenter, a manga artist, an entrepreneur, an expert at something?</p>

<p>How do you get there? Do you write your intention on a piece of paper, and put it in a bottle and launch it to sea, hoping it will manifest? No. The universe isn&#8217;t going to make this happen. You are.</p>

<p>Do you set yourself a big goal to complete by the end of the year, or in three months? Sure, but that doesn&#8217;t get the job done. In fact, if you think back on most examples in your life, setting big long-term goals probably doesn&#8217;t work very often. How many times has this strategy been successful?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to lay down the law here, based on many many experiments I&#8217;ve done in the last 7 years: <strong>nothing will change unless you make a daily change</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried weekly action steps, things that I do every other day, big bold monthly goals, lots of other permutations. <em>None of them work except daily changes</em>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re not willing to make it a daily change, you don&#8217;t really want to change your life in this way. You only like the idea of learning to draw/speak Japanese/play guitar/program in php/etc. You don&#8217;t really want to do it.</p>

<p>So make a daily change. Let&#8217;s dig into how it&#8217;s done!</p>

<h3>How to Turn an Aspiration Into a Daily Change</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s name a few aspirations:</p>

<ul>
<li>lose weight</li>
<li>write a book</li>
<li>stop procrastinating</li>
<li>fall in love</li>
<li>be happy</li>
<li>travel the world</li>
<li>drink more water</li>
<li>learn Spanish</li>
<li>save money</li>
<li>take more pictures</li>
<li>read more books</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you turn those lofty ideas into daily changes? Think about what you could do every day that would make the change happen, or at least get you closer to the goal. Sometimes that&#8217;s not always easy, but let&#8217;s look at some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>lose weight</strong> &#8211; start walking every day, for 10 minutes at first, then 15 after a week, then 20 &#8230; once you are walking for 30-40 minutes a day, make another change &#8212; drink water instead of soda.</li>
<li><strong>write a book</strong> &#8211; write for 10 minutes a day.</li>
<li><strong>stop procrastinating</strong> &#8211; I can already hear the ironic (and original!) jokes about how people will deal with procrastination later (har!). Anyway, a daily action: set a Most Important Task each morning, then work on it for 10 minutes before opening your browser/mobile device.</li>
<li><strong>fall in love</strong> &#8211; go somewhere each day and meet/social with new people. Or do daily things that make you a fascinating person.</li>
<li><strong>be happy</strong> &#8211; do something each day to make the world better, to help people.</li>
<li><strong>travel the world</strong> &#8211; save money (see next item). Or start selling your stuff, so you can carry your belongings on a backpack and start hitchhiking. </li>
<li><strong>save money</strong> &#8211; start cutting out smaller expenses. Start cooking and eating at home. Sell your car and bike/walk/take the train. Start looking for a smaller home. Do free stuff instead of buying things.</li>
<li><strong>drink more water</strong> &#8211; drink water when you wake up, then every time you take a break (once an hour).</li>
<li><strong>learn Spanish</strong> &#8211; study Spanish sentences in Anki and listen to Pimsleur tapes 10 minutes a day.</li>
<li><strong>take more pictures</strong> &#8211; take pictures at lunch (but dear jeebus, not of your lunch) and post them to your blog.</li>
<li><strong>read more books</strong> &#8211; read every morning and before you go to bed.</li>
</ul>

<p>You get the idea. Not all of these are perfect ideas, but you could come up with something that works better for you. Point is, do it daily.</p>

<h3>How to Implement Daily Changes</h3>

<p>This method is fairly simple, and if you really implement it, nearly foolproof:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>One Change at a Time</strong>. You can break this rule, but don&#8217;t be surprised if you fail. Do one change for a month before considering a second. Only add another change if you were successful at the first.</li>
<li><strong>Start Small</strong>. OK, I&#8217;ve said this two bajillion times. No one ever does it, though. Start with 10 minutes or less. Five minutes is better if it&#8217;s a hard change. If you fail at that, drop it to 2 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Do it at the same time each day</strong>. OK, not literally at the same minute, like at 6:00 a.m., but after the same trigger in your daily routine &#8212; after you drink your first cup of coffee in the morning, after you arrive at work, after you get home, after you brush your teeth, shower, eat breakfast, wake up, eat lunch, turn on your computer, first see your wife each day.</li>
<li><strong>Make a huge commitment to someone</strong>. Or multiple people. Make sure it&#8217;s someone whose opinion you respect. For example, I made a commitment to studying/coding PHP at least 10 minutes each day to my friend <a href="http://tynan.com/">Tynan</a>. I&#8217;ve made commitments to my wife, to other friends, to readers of this blog, to readers of a newspaper on Guam, to my kids, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Be accountable</strong>. Taking my programming example with Tynan &#8230; each day I have to update a Google spreadsheet each day showing how many minutes I programmed/studied each day, and he can (and does) check that shared spreadsheet. The tool you use doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; you can post to Facebook or Twitter, email someone, mark it on a calendar, report in person. Just make sure you&#8217;re accountable each day, not each month. And make sure the person is checking. If they don&#8217;t check on you, you need to find a new accountability partner or group.</li>
<li><strong>Have consequences</strong>. The most important consequence for doing or not doing the daily habit is that if you don&#8217;t, the people will respect you less, and if you do, they&#8217;ll respect you more. If your accountability system isn&#8217;t set up this way, find another way to do it. You might need to change who you&#8217;re accountable to. But you can add other fun consequences: one friend made a promise to Facebook friends that he&#8217;d donate $50 to Mitt Romney&#8217;s campaign (this was last year) each time he didn&#8217;t follow through on a commitment. I&#8217;ve made a promise to eat whale sushi (I won&#8217;t fail, because eating a whale is repugnant to me, like eating a cow or a child). I&#8217;ve promised to sing a Japanese song in front of strangers if I failed. The consequences can also be positive &#8212; a big reward each week if you don&#8217;t miss a day, for example. Make the consequences bigger if you miss two straight days, and huge if you miss three.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy the change</strong>. If you don&#8217;t do this, you might as well find another change to make. If the daily action feels tedious and chore-like, then you are doing it wrong. Find a way to enjoy it, or you won&#8217;t stick to it long. Or find some other change you enjoy more.</li>
</ol>

<p>That&#8217;s it. Seven pretty simple steps, and you&#8217;ve got a changed life. None of these steps is impossible &#8212; in fact, you can put them into action today.</p>

<p>What daily change will you make today?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8216;A year from now you will wish you had started today.&#8217; <strong>~Karen Lamb</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I have a program designed to help you make changes in this way, with built-in accountability and step-by-step plans each month &#8212; the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/membership-signup/">Sea Change Program</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <p>&#8216;Men learn while they teach.&#8217; <strong>~Seneca the Younger</strong></p>

<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>It is a curious phenomena that when we try to change our habits &#8212; simplify our clutter, eat healthier, start exercising &#8212; the other people in our life don&#8217;t instantly want to be changed in the same way.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s as if they had their own minds!</p>

<p>Horrible as that might sound, it&#8217;s the reality we have to deal with if we have a family (or friends, roommates, coworkers, etc.). They often resist changes we make, or their possibly unhealthy habits stand in our way.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re trying to eat only whole foods, and yet your daughter eats goldfish crackers and pizza and Oreos. And she doesn&#8217;t seem to want to munch on asparagus instead!</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a habit changer to do? Abandon all attempts at change? No. Force change on family members? Tempting, but not effective.</p>

<p>The answer is that there is no simple answer. I&#8217;ll share what has worked for me, but that won&#8217;t work for everyone. When you&#8217;re single and living alone, it&#8217;s easy to make whatever changes you want to make &#8212; but if you&#8217;re married, you have to make compromises. You live in the space that is common between the two of you, and that is negotiated space. When you add kids to your life, you now live in a space that is common between all of you, also a negotiated space.</p>

<p>What works? Let&#8217;s take a look at some strategies. Try one, try two, or try them all, and figure out what works in your negotiated space.</p>

<h3>Getting Others On Board</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s a common scenario: you&#8217;ve read about some interesting challenge or change someone else has made, or perhaps read a magazine article or book on the topic, and have been giving it some thought, and finally arrived at the decision to make the change &#8230; and then you spring it on your significant other or entire family. They somehow aren&#8217;t as enthused as you&#8217;d like!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s because you have gone through an entire thinking process to arrive at the decision, and they are being asked to come in only at the end &#8212; after the decision has been made. That&#8217;s not fair to them, because they haven&#8217;t had time to go through the same thinking process, to consider the reasons, to find the motivation, to be included in the decision.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found a more effective method is to get all the people who will be affected in on the thinking process as early as possible. Don&#8217;t talk to them about it when you&#8217;re near the decision-making point &#8230; talk to them when you first hear or read about the idea. Talk about why it&#8217;s appealing to you. Get their input. Ask whether they&#8217;d consider that kind of change. Talk about your motivation. Include them every step of the way, until the decision is made, and even after.</p>

<p>What people don&#8217;t like is being forced to change, against their will. So never make people feel that way. Don&#8217;t ask them to change &#8230; ask them to help you change, once you&#8217;ve gotten to the decision. Say that their support is really important to you, and while they are welcome to join you (you&#8217;d love that!), they don&#8217;t have to change. Just help you make your change. Ask them to be your accountability buddy, someone to call on when you&#8217;re having trouble, someone to report problems and successes to.</p>

<h3>Setting the Example</h3>

<p>While not everyone will be instantly on board with your ideas for change, I&#8217;ve found the best method of persuasion is being a good model for change.</p>

<p>When I started exercising, most of my family wasn&#8217;t doing it. I tried to convince people, but I wasn&#8217;t as good at persuasion as I thought. When they saw me exercising, at first they thought I was a bit kooky. Then they saw the changes in me, and how much I enjoyed it, and I would share how great it was, and over time, it inspired some to think about it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what you can do &#8212; inspire people to consider something they wouldn&#8217;t normally consider, just by setting a good example. No one else will do yoga with you? That&#8217;s OK &#8230; keep doing it, and share your experiences. Do it in front of them as they watch TV. Try not to be annoying, though.</p>

<h3>Making Changes on Your Own</h3>

<p>If others won&#8217;t get on board with your changes, ask for a minimum amount of support: ask that they give you the space to make the change on your own, without their help. This isn&#8217;t a small thing sometimes &#8212; often people are threatened when someone in their life makes changes, or they don&#8217;t like the disruption of their routine of doing things with you (eating junk food together, for example). You doing something on your own is a big change for them.</p>

<p>Ask for the space to do it alone, and ask that they not criticize or otherwise make it hard on you. If they are resentful, this makes it more difficult, but you&#8217;ll have to make an effort to show that this is something that will make you happy, and you will do your best not to disrupt things for them. If that means you don&#8217;t spend mornings together because you are out running, then try to create other time together, like in the evenings or on weekends.</p>

<p>When you make changes on your own, without the support of others, it&#8217;s more difficult. You need to find other encouragement &#8212; I&#8217;ve joined running groups online, a smoking cessation group, and other similar groups. Facebook and other social networking tools can also be helpful in finding online support. Often there are groups in your area where you can meet people in person who are going through the same changes.</p>

<h3>Family Challenges</h3>

<p>One of my more successful strategies is creating challenges for my family. They aren&#8217;t required to do the challenges, of course, but sometimes people like the opportunity to rise to a challenge. And they like making changes with others.</p>

<p>My wife and I have created eating challenges to do with each other (we call them Lean Out Challenges, usually after we go on a trip and gorge ourselves on unhealthy food). With the kids, I&#8217;ve challenged them to do pushups, handstands, running, vegetarian experiments, daily drawing, and more.</p>

<p>Challenges are fun if you do them together. It can be fun to do it as a competition, or to offer rewards for people who complete the challenge.</p>

<h3>Notes on Eating Habits</h3>

<p>Eating changes can be especially difficult if your family isn&#8217;t doing it with you, because they can be eating junk food right in front of your face as you try to much on celery. Tough stuff.</p>

<p>Here are some notes from my experiences:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you do the cooking, cook food for the family, and cook your meals separately. Eva &amp; I often cook our healthy food in bulk and eat the same food for days, while the kids eat other things. For some reason they&#8217;re not big kale and quinoa fans. Kids.</li>
<li>Kids can change their taste buds, but slowly. They won&#8217;t instantly like big green salads, but you can introduce vegetables slowly, in soups and other dishes they might be used to. Dice carrots and kale can be added to chili and spaghetti sauce if you cut them small enough and add them when you&#8217;re cooking onions/garlic.</li>
<li>Kids will eat nearly anything if you add some baked fries to the dish.</li>
<li>If the kids are going to eat something especially tempting (pizza), I try to make myself scarce so I don&#8217;t have temptations. It&#8217;s too hard to avoid junk that I enjoy eating, if it&#8217;s right in front of me, so I&#8217;ll go for a run or go to my room to do some work &#8212; keep busy.</li>
<li>We try to find restaurants that has healthy food that the kids will like.</li>
<li>When I went vegetarian, Eva &amp; the kids weren&#8217;t vegetarian. I did get them to try some dishes, which they generally liked, and then would just eat my food separately from them. If I made my food especially delicious, it would be tempting for them to at least try.</li>
<li>Kids will go to any restaurant if there&#8217;s dessert at the end.</li>
<li>Many people don&#8217;t like the idea of vegan food, even if they&#8217;ve never tried it. Making delicious vegan cupcakes will often win them over, at least to try it. I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vegan-Cupcakes-Take-Over-World/dp/1569242739">Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World</a>. Truly amazing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Supporting Their Changes</h3>

<p>If you want others to support your changes, you should also support theirs. When my kids or wife express a desire to make some change, I do my best to help them achieve that:</p>

<ul>
<li>I share my experiences and what worked for me, and how I overcame some obstacles.</li>
<li>I share websites and books that help with that change, and often will buy books to help them.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll do a project with them, or create a challenge we can do together.</li>
<li>I run and workout with my wife, and created a workout log to help her track her fitness.</li>
<li>I share vegetarian recipes with my wife (who is now vegan), and with my daughter, who decided to try vegetarianism</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more possibilities, but these are a few examples. When they see you supporting them, they now have a model for how to act when you want to make changes in the future. It&#8217;s not an overnight change that you&#8217;ll see in your family, but slow gradual long-term changes. Play the long game when it comes to changing the culture of a family.</p>

<h3>Learn by Teaching</h3>

<p>The best way to make changes yourself is to help others. That means supporting them when they want to make changes, sharing the changes you&#8217;ve made and teaching them what you&#8217;ve learned, showing someone how to do something cool after you&#8217;ve learned how to do it.</p>

<p>You are teaching by making changes and sharing those changes with your family. They might not care about learning at first, but they will, over time. And when you teach, you learn more and more. As I am now, sharing with you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We&#8217;d like to think that making positive life changes is a straight line from beginning to where we want to go.</p>

<p>But life has taught us differently.</p>

<p>Experience shows us that you can start a new habit (let&#8217;s say working out) and things go great for awhile, and then life gets in the way. Things get messy. Things fall apart. We have a few bad days, or a huge project to work on at work, or relationship problems, or a family crisis, or we get sick.</p>

<p>What do we do when life gets messy and our habits fall to the wayside? Well, give up, obviously.</p>

<p>Actually, I take that back. We tend to give up, because when things get in the way and we mess up on our habits, it&#8217;s a little discouraging, even depressing.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be. There are a few things you can do instead:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Breathe</strong>. Pause for a moment, breathe, focus on the breath. Know that you are OK, in this moment. Give yourself a moment&#8217;s space to think about what&#8217;s going on in your life, and who you are.</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself a break</strong>. If things like relationship problems get in the way of your habits, allow yourself to pause the habits until you get your life in order and let your mind rest. Rest is important. Get plenty of sleep &#8212; this is important, because when stressful things are happening in our lives, our bodies and minds need plenty of rest to heal.</li>
<li><strong>Know that every habit has bumps in the road</strong>. There&#8217;s never a perfectly smooth path with no bumps. Seriously, no habit goes on a perfectly straight line &#8212; at least, none that I&#8217;ve created, and none that anyone I know has created. Expect the bumps, and don&#8217;t let them end everything.</li>
<li><strong>Allow yourself to experience the messy.</strong> Things will always come up, life gets messy, painful things happen. That&#8217;s OK. Give yourself the space to experience the pain with the joy, the mess with the beauty.</li>
<li><strong>Find a friend to help you get on track</strong>. It&#8217;s great if you can do habits by yourself, but it&#8217;s even better if you can find a friend who will do it with you, or at least hold you accountable, and help you get things back on track once things clear up for you.</li>
<li><strong>Keep smiling!</strong>. That&#8217;s the most important thing. Smile, and you&#8217;re doing it right.</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>What do you do when your job, or your personal life, is a constant source of busy-ness, rushing, nose-to-the-grindstone work, and stress?</p>

<p>Or what do you do if your life is simple and relatively stress-free, but something blows up and you are in the middle of chaos and high stress all of a sudden?</p>

<p>This is when we could use a dose of Zen Mind, or the <strong>Art of Letting Go</strong>.</p>

<p>What is this Zen Mind? To be honest, I&#8217;m still learning what that is, but what I&#8217;ve been practising is a constant letting go. Let&#8217;s take an example:</p>

<p>I have a major deadline approaching. It is stressing me out, man! But what is the source of the stress? It&#8217;s not the work, which is just a series of actions. It&#8217;s not the deadline, which is just a time constraint. It&#8217;s my reaction to those external events &#8212; my fear that I&#8217;m not going to make it, that I&#8217;ll mess up, that I&#8217;ll look stupid or incompetent. This fear that is causing my stress reaction is rooted in my wanting things to turn out a certain way &#8230; wanting to meet the deadline and get things perfect and look good.</p>

<p>What if I could let go of wanting things to turn out that way? This is a fantasy, an ideal, that I&#8217;m holding onto. It might turn out that way, sure, but it could turn out a dozen other ways, and the truth is I don&#8217;t have complete control over how it&#8217;ll turn out. All I can do is do the work, and the fantasy, the fear and the stress are only getting in the way. So if I can let go of this ideal, this fantasy, I can let go of the fear, and the stress.</p>

<p>This is the Zen Mind that I&#8217;m learning about. It&#8217;s simply letting go, and in doing so, you attain a peace of mind no matter what chaos and seemingly stressful event are going on around you. Again, I&#8217;m not good at this yet, but I&#8217;m learning. I&#8217;ll share what I know with you.</p>

<h3>The Art of Letting Go</h3>

<p>So these are the steps to letting go:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Notice why you&#8217;re stressed</strong>. What external event is stressing you? Why is it stressing you out? What fear do you have?</li>
<li><strong>Notice what you&#8217;re holding onto</strong>. If your response is fear, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re holding onto something. It&#8217;s probably a fantasy/ideal, or wanting to control something, wanting something to turn out a certain way, wishing things would meet the expectations you have. If you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;He should do this&#8221; or &#8220;It should be like this&#8221; then you&#8217;re holding onto an ideal/expectation/outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Realize that it&#8217;s not real</strong>. This fantasy, this expectation, this wishing you could control things &#8230; it&#8217;s just made up in your head. To be fair, we all do it. But it&#8217;s not a real thing &#8212; and it can be let go of.</li>
<li><strong>See that it&#8217;s hurting you</strong>. This thing you&#8217;ve made up is causing you stress, which is shortening your life, and making what short life you have less enjoyable. It&#8217;s causing pain in your life. Realize this.</li>
<li><strong>Let go</strong>. If something you&#8217;ve made up is causing pain, why hold onto it? It&#8217;s not worth it. By letting go, you release the pain, and are just left with you and the work you need to do.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Zen Mind in the Middle of Chaos</h3>

<p>So you work long hours and are stressed out. It&#8217;s work you love, perhaps, but still hard work, and still lots of stressors. Maybe you get to take some good breaks during the day, maybe you take weekends off, maybe you get some great vacations.</p>

<p>But the fact remains: no matter what kind of breaks and vacations you take, much of your life is spent doing the hard work, and stressed out. You need to be able to simultaneously work <em>and</em> be on vacation. This is the practice of Zen Mind that we&#8217;re talking about &#8212; letting go and being able to breathe and smile in the middle of a stressful workday.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only stressful, of course, because of stuff we&#8217;re making up in our heads. So if we can create a constant practice of awareness and letting go, we constantly let go of the stress.</p>

<p>Your boss dumps a new project on you with a close deadline. Yikes! You&#8217;re instantly stressed. Notice, and let go. Breathe. Feel the stress floating away as you let go of an ideal and an expectation. You are now free, and you can just do the first task &#8212; after all, that&#8217;s all you can ever do.</p>

<p>Your coworker or client is mad at you, and yelling at you. This is highly stressful. Until you realize that they are probably yelling for some problem that&#8217;s not really about you &#8212; they are stressed out, they are having a bad day, they have problems dealing with stress. And you are holding onto the expectation that everyone around you should behave perfectly, which of course is an absurd fantasy. You let go of that, and reach out in your heart to this fellow human being who isn&#8217;t happy. How can you make things better for this person, with an open heart?</p>

<p>Your son is stressing you out because he&#8217;s not doing what he should be doing. You&#8217;re mad! Why can&#8217;t he just do what you ask? Of course, this is a fantasy. Your kids (or friends, or spouse) are not going to live up to these expectations you have of how they should behave &#8212; these expectations aren&#8217;t anything real, just fantasies. You can&#8217;t control their behavior &#8212; wanting to do so just stresses you out. So let go of that expectation and the desire to control, and the stress goes away. Instead, open your heart, and be open to who they are.</p>

<p>OK, so that&#8217;s all easier said than done. In the real world, it takes a lot of practice. We often forget about this process when things hit the fan. That&#8217;s OK. Life is a constant practice. Keep practicing, and let go of wanting to be perfect at it. Just in the attempt, you&#8217;re already perfect.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <p>&#8216;Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis

  rushing toward the future.&#8217;
  <strong>~Thich Nhat Hanh</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>Yesterday I had tea with a <a href="http://www.lifeoftea.com/?page_id=2">Daoist tea monk</a> who said for tea to change you, you have to create a sacred space in your heart for the tea.</p>

<p>Imagine that space for a moment. How does it feel? What can reside in that sacred space? How different is it from mechanically drinking tea, without paying attention to it?</p>

<p>Now think about the difference between just drinking tea, as if you were drinking anything and not really paying attention &#8230; and drinking tea with that sacred space in your heart for that tea. It&#8217;s profoundly different, and it changes everything.</p>

<p>You can do that for anything, not just tea. Anything that&#8217;s important to you.</p>

<p>If you create a sacred space in your heart for something, it changes how you do it. It changes you, at the molecular level.</p>

<p>We crank through things these days &#8212; email, social networks, news, work tasks, calls, meetings, deadlines &#8212; and then the day is gone. This is a waste of a miracle, the day that we&#8217;ve been given.</p>

<p>Instead, create a sacred space for that which matters most:</p>

<ul>
<li>meditation, yoga, tea</li>
<li>reading at bedtime with your child</li>
<li>having tea with your spouse</li>
<li>a daily walk</li>
<li>writing</li>
<li>your most important and creative work</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps every moment should have a sacred space in our hearts, but we have to start somewhere. Pick something small but important, and create that space today.</p>

<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I advocate meditation as a great way to start your day, deal with stress, live in the present and more.</p>

<p>But what many people don&#8217;t realize is that meditation is perhaps the most important habit if you want to change other habits.</p>

<p>Recently I wrote about the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/habitses/">Four Habits That Form Other Habits</a> &#8212; and you might recall Habit 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be Mindful of Negative Thoughts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you learn to be mindful of your negative thoughts? Simple: you practice. And how do you practice mindfulness of your thoughts? By far the best method I&#8217;ve found is meditation.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at why meditation is so good for helping to change your habits, and how to form the meditation habit.</p>

<h3>How Meditation Helps Habits</h3>

<p>When we are unaware of our thoughts and urges, which arise in the back of our mind mostly unnoticed, they have a power over us. We are unable to change if these unbidden thoughts control us. But when we learn to observe them, we can then release their power over us.</p>

<p>Meditation is practice for observing those thoughts, for being more mindful of them throughout the day.</p>

<p>I will give you several examples in my own life, though actually there are dozens:</p>

<ol>
<li>When I quit smoking, I would get an urge to take just one drag on a cigarette, and it would get so strong I had a hard time beating it. At the same time, I had these rationalizing thoughts: &#8220;It&#8217;s OK to smoke just one &#8212; one cigarette doesn&#8217;t hurt you&#8221;, or &#8220;Why are you making yourself suffer like this? It&#8217;s not worth it!&#8221; And those thoughts and urges would have beat me if I let them, but I watched them. I didn&#8217;t act, I just watched. And the would rise and crest and then fade, and I would be OK.</li>
<li>When I started running, I wanted to stop when things got uncomfortable. But I learned that it was just a scared part of my mind that wanted to stop, a part of me that shied away from discomfort. I would watch that scared part of me, that makes me quit anything hard, and not let it control me.</li>
<li>When I write, I often get the urge to go do something else. When this urge goes unnoticed, I just act on it, and procrastinate. When I am mindful of this urge (and the accompanying rationalizations that come if I don&#8217;t act on the urge), then I can <a href="http://zenhabits.net/pause/">pause</a> and watch the urge and let it go, and return to the writing.</li>
</ol>

<p>This same process helped me <a href="http://zenhabits.net/7y/">change my eating habits</a>, run a marathon, <a href="http://zenhabits.net/zero/">change my clutter habits</a>, and <a href="http://zenhabits.net/my-story">much more</a>.</p>

<p>But none of that would have been possible if I didn&#8217;t learn to watch, to be mindful of my urges and rationalizations and negative thoughts that told me I couldn&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>How did I learn to watch and be mindful? Meditation. It is the one habit where all you&#8217;re doing is practicing this mindful observing, where everything else is stripped away in a beautiful simplicity that leaves just you and your thoughts and the present moment.</p>

<h3>How to Form the Meditation Habit</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple, but the doing is everything:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Commit to just 2 minutes a day</strong>. Start simply if you want the habit to stick. You can do it for 5 minutes if you feel good about it, but all you’re committing to is 2 minutes each day.</li>
<li><strong>Pick a time and trigger</strong>. Not an exact time of day, but a general time, like morning when you wake up, or during your lunch hour. The trigger should be something you already do regularly, like drink your first cup of coffee, brush your teeth, have lunch, or arrive home from work.</li>
<li><strong>Find a quiet spot</strong>. Sometimes early morning is best, before others in your house might be awake and making lots of noise. Others might find a spot in a park or on the beach or some other soothing setting. It really doesn’t matter where — as long as you can sit without being bothered for a few minutes. A few people walking by your park bench is fine.</li>
<li><strong>Sit comfortably</strong>. Don’t fuss too much about how you sit, what you wear, what you sit on, etc. I personally like to sit on a pillow on the floor, with my back leaning against a wall, because I’m very inflexible. Others who can sit cross-legged comfortably might do that instead. Still others can sit on a chair or couch if sitting on the floor is uncomfortable. Zen practitioners often use a zafu, a round cushion filled with kapok or buckwheat. Don’t go out and buy one if you don’t already have one. Any cushion or pillow will do, and some people can sit on a bare floor comfortably.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on your breath</strong>. As you breathe in, follow your breath in through your nostrils, then into your throat, then into your lungs and belly. Sit straight, keep your eyes open but looking at the ground and with a soft focus. If you want to close your eyes, that’s fine. As you breathe out, follow your breath out back into the world. If it helps, count … one breath in, two breath out, three breath in, four breath out … when you get to 10, start over. If you lose track, start over. If you find your mind wandering (and you will), just pay attention to your mind wandering, then bring it gently back to your breath. Repeat this process for the few minutes you meditate. You won’t be very good at it at first, most likely, but you’ll get better with practice.</li>
</ol>

<p>And that’s it. It’s a very simple practice, but you want to do it for 2 minutes, every day, after the same trigger each day. Do this for a month and you’ll have a daily meditation habit.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>By <a href="http://leobabauta.com">Leo Babauta</a></h6>

<p>We all long for genuine human connections, and even in a busy life with lots of people around us, these genuine connections can be hard to find.</p>

<p>We socialize online, but that&#8217;s not very genuine (why I <a href="http://zenhabits.net/fb/">quit Facebook</a>). We work with people, but often that&#8217;s task-oriented and not human connection-oriented. We might have family and friends in our lives, but when we are busy or distracted by the online world, those connections might fade.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I&#8217;ve made it a point to have fewer friendships, but with deeper connections &#8230; while also being open to the miracle of a random encounter with another human being. This philosophy has paid off in more genuine connections with my family and friends, but less busy-ness.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;ll share a few reasons for creating genuine connections, and my strategies for creating them.</p>

<h3>Why Genuine Connections Are Important</h3>

<p>There are many reasons, but these are the ones that strike me as important:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>We need it to be happy and fulfilled</strong>. All the money in the world, and the best job in the world, and all the material possessions in the world &#8230; won&#8217;t matter much if you&#8217;re alone and have no genuine human connections. We have a human need for this kind of connection, and there&#8217;s no doubt that it makes us happier, even if it complicates our lives a bit.</li>
<li><strong>It boosts creativity</strong>. I find that working in solitude is the <a href="http://zenhabits.net/creative-habit/">best way to create</a>, and <a href="http://zenhabits.net/solitude/">having some time for solitude</a> is important for reflecting on ideas &#8230; but having a genuine discussion with someone is really important for expanding on those ideas. When I get together with a friend, or talk something over with my wife, I inevitably walk away with several new (or reinvigorated) ideas that excite me.</li>
<li><strong>It creates opportunities</strong>. I am not in favor of &#8220;networking&#8221;, but when you make a connection with someone, new opportunities for collaboration and creation emerge that weren&#8217;t there before. For example, before I met Jesse Jacobs of <a href="http://www.samovarlife.com/">Samovar Tea Lounge</a>, I wasn&#8217;t a big tea guy. But after we became friends, I became interested in tea, and we sat down and recorded some lessons on tea (where I was the beginner student) and that turned into the excellent new <a href="http://www.samovarlife.com/ubg/">Ultimate Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Tea</a>. That wasn&#8217;t a realistic possibility before we connected. This has happened to me numerous times &#8212; I met <a href="http://liveyourlegend.net/">Scott Dinsmore</a> and later contributed to his new course, <a href="http://howtoconnectwithanyone.com/joinus/official-launch-2013/">Connect With Anyone</a> &#8230; I met Susan O&#8217;Connell of <a href="http://www.sfzc.org/">San Francisco Zen Center</a> and co-created the Zen of Work course with her &#8230; I met <a href="http://thinktraffic.net/">Corbett Barr</a> and contributed to his fantastic platform for people creating online businesses, <a href="http://fizzle.co/">Fizzle</a> &#8230; and so on and so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Life is better when you make genuine connections. You are happier, less isolated, more creative, with new opportunities.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at how to make these important connections.</p>

<h3>How to Make Genuine Connections</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing &#8230; you can&#8217;t just force a connection to be what you want it to be. Many people make this mistake in different ways: they try to create a connection with someone who doesn&#8217;t want it, or hope the person responds in a certain way, or want the other person to be something they&#8217;re not, and so on. The key to an unforced, genuine connection is openness.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s what works for me:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Be open to random connections</strong>. While I accept fewer invitations these days than I did a couple years ago, when I randomly meet someone, I try not to be closed to them. This means opening up, wondering who they are and setting aside any prejudgements that happen, sharing who I am openly and with a smile. I don&#8217;t know if this will be a connection to last a lifetime, but it can be one to brighten a moment.</li>
<li><strong>Make time for the important relationships</strong>. For me, this starts with my wife and kids. While work is important, it&#8217;s important to me to make time each day for them. Even just reading a book, or taking a walk, or sitting down and talking about something &#8212; if the relationship is important, I&#8217;ll make time most days for it. But it also extends to a small circle of friends who I might not see every day, or even every week &#8212; if I can, I&#8217;ll make time for them. We get together for tea or a workout usually.</li>
<li><strong>Be open to who they are</strong>. Try to notice your expectations of the other person, and let them go. Don&#8217;t pigeon-hole them, don&#8217;t try to make them someone they&#8217;re not &#8230; just explore who they are without knowing what you&#8217;ll find. Be curious. You&#8217;ll find the real them this way, and it&#8217;s much better than finding what you hoped to find.</li>
<li><strong>Be open to what happens</strong>. Many people go into a meeting with someone else with an agenda, and try to get that done. Like it&#8217;s a task that needs to be accomplished. But it&#8217;s not &#8212; a connection with someone else isn&#8217;t about productivity or goals. It&#8217;s about connection. It&#8217;s two very different human beings spending time together and merging their random personality traits into one experience. That&#8217;s true even if it&#8217;s a business meeting. Let your personality come out, and allow theirs to come out, and see what happens. It could be talking about a project, but it could be random topics and ideas, it could be a discussion of what&#8217;s been going on in your lives and what you have in common, it could be helping one or the other of you with a problem that you have, it could be a debate of ideas, and so on. Don&#8217;t try to force it.</li>
<li><strong>Be open about yourself</strong>. Often we try to present a certain good side of ourselves. We try to come across as competent, knowledgeable, interesting, accomplished, funny, smart, etc. But that&#8217;s  a front. It&#8217;s only a part of who we are &#8212; the good part. If it&#8217;s true at all. Why bother trying to connect with someone when we&#8217;re just going to give them a false identity, just a façade? Might as well stay home. Much better is to open yourself up, to show the real you. This is scary. It means <a href="http://liveyourlegend.net/create-trust-with-anyone/">being vulnerable</a>, and being willing to be embarrassed. That&#8217;s a huge amount of trust to put into a human being, especially if it&#8217;s not someone you know well. But it&#8217;s totally worth it. When you become vulnerable, you risk a lot, but you also get much, much more. You get trust from the other person. You get a deeper connection. You get a better friendship. They open up more too. And when you&#8217;ve done this a few times, you realize &#8212; there isn&#8217;t that much risk, because it never really ends up in a bad way. It&#8217;s pretty much all upside.</li>
</ol>

<p>There&#8217;s more to creating genuine connections, but you don&#8217;t want to read a book. If you do, I recommend you check out Scott Dinsmore&#8217;s new course, <a href="http://howtoconnectwithanyone.com/joinus/official-launch-2013/">Connect With Anyone</a>.
