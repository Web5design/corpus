				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was only in the past 2 weeks that I introduced my brother Oakley as Robin, the new partner in crime-solving to the notorious BATDOG (that&#8217;s me).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3653" alt="BATDOG and Robin Dog Costumes" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/batdog-and-robin.jpg" width="523" height="620" /><br />
We&#8217;re not your typical superheros &#8211; BATDOG being motivated by fame and glory and Robin by brotherly adoration and shiny things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, two weeks wasn&#8217;t a long time to get Oakley up to speed on everything us superdogs do.</p>
<p>First we kept watch from the balcony. I got him started for 5 minutes before I left to take care of some &#8220;public relations&#8221; as I told him (my way of saying fiddling around on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a>). I told him to holler if any wired hairs or broads came into sight.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>BATDOG and Robin on lookout. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vineportraits">#vineportraits</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23batdog">#batdog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23saturday">#saturday</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bTp6Ue6uUTB" href="https://t.co/zOmVyKHnOQ">vine.co/v/bTp6Ue6uUTB</a></p>
<p>— Crusoe Dachshund (@Celeb_Dachshund) <a href="https://twitter.com/Celeb_Dachshund/status/320648064031391744">April 6, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We also take regular playtime intervals. Gotta stay active to keep your focus..</p>
<p>Once I was comfortable that Oakley was ready, I decided I&#8217;d show him the real world by hitting the streets of downtown. Learn by experience as they say.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s exactly what we did. We strode right into the hardest neighborhoods our city has to offer and posted up on the block like we had nothing to hide.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3658" alt="BATDOG &amp; Robin in the ghetto" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/batdog-in-the-city2.jpg" width="567" height="398" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure we prevented at least several drug deals from going down just by being there.</p>
<p>And yet, we can&#8217;t be everywhere at once, so it was onto the next spot. We roosted on a ledge just off of a main downtown street with a lot of foot traffic. You might say this one was more for the public appearance.</p>
<p>We drew a little crowd of people who snapped their own photos as we posed proud and graciously for the camera. Luckily, Oakley has just recently learned <a title="My Lesson on Taking Celebrity Photos" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/04/12/how-to-take-celebrity-dog-photos/">how to take Crusoe-caliber celebrity photos</a>, so that came in handy here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3662" alt="BATDOG &amp; Robin" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/batdog-and-robin-in-the-city2.jpg" width="567" height="399" /></p>
<p>As we moved on, I kept telling Oakley that the cape needs to go at the back of him, not the front. A cape in the back is intimidating &#8211; a cape in the front is just, well, goofy.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>BATDOG and Robin on city patrol. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachshund">#dachshund</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23batdog">#batdog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23batman">#batman</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23superhero">#superhero</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bFp3UFeWOV1" href="https://t.co/VqdTKgnXpF">vine.co/v/bFp3UFeWOV1</a></p>

<p>He&#8217;s still working on that..</p>
<p>Now, my research has shown that bad guys tend to hang out in alleyways. So this was our next checkpoint.</p>
<p>We found a nice dark one and took to our practiced routine: we barked from the safety of the street opening. This tactic worked well, as we managed to scare away a cat and a few pigeons. We took a quick keepsake shot below.</p>
<div id="attachment_3663" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 577px"><img class=" wp-image-3663" alt="Alleyway superheros" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alleyway-superhero-dogs.jpg" width="567" height="401" /><p class="wp-caption-text">BATDOG &amp; Robin&#8217;s first alleyway.</p></div>
<p>Just like Spiderman used to set himself up for his own photos (Peter Parker was a newspaper photographer as well as Spiderman), we follow a similar routine.</p>
<p>A good photo of us chasing a bad guy means more to us than actually catching him.</p>
<p>Let that be a life lesson.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3666" alt="BATDOG" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/batdog-city-costume.jpg" width="567" height="398" /></p>
<p>Sadly, Oakley is leaving tomorrow to go back to his home in Toronto. He wants to take his Robin costume with him, but I told him that a Robin without a BATDOG is little more than a bird. So we should make this a strictly double-wiener kind of gig..</p>
<p>Not sure he understood exactly, but he agreed.</p>
<p>So for our last night together as two brothers in masks, we requested (or rather commandeered) Mum&#8217;s car for a ride around the neighborhood.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3667" alt="Crusoe &amp; Oakley cruisin'" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/funny-batman-dog-costume.jpg" width="567" height="431" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was a good &#8216;last round&#8217; for us superdogs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To my disappointment though, we didn&#8217;t come across any wired-hairs red-handed in any criminal acts, nor any babes outside hosing down their doghouses in bikinis &#8211; two things Dad told me he sees all the time on his way home from work.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I guess we just weren&#8217;t lucky.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3672" alt="Cute wiener dogs !" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cute-wiener-dogs.jpg" width="567" height="290" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">However, I did smell barbecue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cruisin-superdogs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3670" alt="Cutest dachshunds" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cruisin-superdogs.jpg" width="567" height="378" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And Robin did discover what the side mirror is for..</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was a long and hard day of looking tough and a lot of flexing. So we were long due for a nap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3675" alt="Cute Dachshunds Sleeping" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cute-dachshunds-sleeping.jpg" width="567" height="392" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3677" alt="mighty-milla-and-teckleman" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mighty-milla-and-teckleman.jpg" width="256" height="379" />I&#8217;ll definitely miss my bro, but I&#8217;ve been missing my own personal space a little lately as well. However, I&#8217;m sure in a couple weeks I&#8217;ll be missing that big lug next to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So that was the first episode of BATDOG<em> and</em> Robin. It may be a little while before we see Robin again, but it&#8217;s always something to look forward to.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In the meantime, BATDOG and his two other superdog sidekicks (as determined by a previous <a title="CONTESTS" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/dachshund-photo-contests/">photo contest</a> of mine); Mighty Milla and Teckleman will help keep things safe for the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep safe,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My little brother Oakley has been with me for about a week and a half now. I only see him every once in a while, and the little guy really looks up to me. So when he&#8217;s with me it&#8217;s like having a second shadow (who keeps trying to steal your toy).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no<em> secret (</em>rather ironically) that I am in fact the superhero dog who goes by the name of BATDOG. My brother Oakley has always idolized my superdogness, and has been bugging me for sometime to let him into the club &#8211; er, cave.</p>
<p>You may have seen my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=450698108352023&amp;set=pb.155275957894241.-2207520000.1365723548&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">post on Facebook</a> recently where I showcased for the first time BATDOG <em>and</em> Robin. But that&#8217;s not what this post is about. Ultimately, Oakley strives for the celebrity lifestyle &#8211; the flashing lights, the glamour, and of course the chicks.</p>
<h2>So for the past week and a half I&#8217;ve been teaching Oakley one of the key parts in being a celebrity dog, and that&#8217;s how to take celebrity photos.</h2>
<p>Now even though I&#8217;m usually the one in front of the camera, I am also a (self) acclaimed director. I introduced Oakley to my personal photo studio, where I had him take the set while I hopped up on the director chair. And as usual for a job like this, I needed my thinking glasses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3615" alt="Doxie Director" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dachshund-director2.jpg" width="576" height="383" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Tip 1: Don&#8217;t Be Shy</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">For Oakley&#8217;s first official studio modeling task, I had him sport a pair of neon pink undies while I proceeded to instruct him on how to properly &#8220;work it&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3619" alt="Doxie Photo Shoot" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/doxie-photo-shoot.jpg" width="576" height="383" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He was reticent at first to strut around in his pink underwear while under the gaze of a camera, but I explained to him that men who wear pink exude confidence &#8211; and that&#8217;s what you need to be a celebrity. Some people may presume that this is just my form of having some fun with my bro (which is possible to a degree), but I assure you I have his best interests at heart.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Tip 2: Provide an Attention Incentive</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">It can get distracting with all the flashing lights and camera shutters and whatnot (particularly for Oakley), so I had to keep his attention with nice incentives. For Oakley it&#8217;s a treat &#8211; for me it&#8217;s usually a squeaky ball.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also found that if I told Oakley a complicated or funny story, I got a good visual reaction from him.. Or in other words, it brought out his super-cute face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3621" alt="Dachshund Pink Underwear" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dachshund-wears-pink-for-bullying2.jpg" width="576" height="383" /></p>
<h2>Tip 3: Stay Still</h2>
<p>Focusing on a treat is one thing, but staying &#8216;still&#8217; is another. So learning to hold your composure for photos does take practice. I am quite used to it, but Oakley not so much. This is where I coached him on taking baby steps. I got him to stay still for only a few seconds by saying &#8220;stay&#8221;, and then rewarded him. We practiced this for a while, steadily working up to longer times. He found it fun and was proud he was doing such a good job!</p>
<p><em><strong>Sidenote</strong></em>: through this exercise I realized I should probably invest in some new lenses..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3629" alt="Funny Dachshund Glasses" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/funny-dachshund-with-glasses.jpg" width="576" height="864" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But in any case, they&#8217;re only meant to help me think more sophisticatedly, not actually to see better, so I guess it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Tip 4: Positive Reinforcement</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oakley is an attention-loving dog. So after a few good photos, he really appreciates some happy positive affection. For Oakley, just a pat on the back from his big bro (and maybe a little treat) is all he could ask for. When I&#8217;m on a shoot, my positive reinforcement usually comes from my sideline babes.</p>
<h2>Tip 5: Always be Flexin&#8217;</h2>
<p>I always make a point of flexing in front of the camera. It&#8217;s become second nature.</p>
<p>After Oakley started to get the rhythm of the camera clicks, I slipped off my director chair and joined him for a few shots (couldn&#8217;t resist when the weights came out). This is our body builder cover photo.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/doxie-weight-lifters-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3626" alt="Dachshund Weight Lifters" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/doxie-weight-lifters-2.jpg" width="576" height="394" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Notice the upright, proud and pronounced chests, high chins, and flexed shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And then for Oakley&#8217;s most exciting moment &#8211; the BATDOG &amp; Robin shot!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3631" alt="BATDOG &amp; Robin dog costumes" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/batdog-and-robin-dogs-costumes.jpg" width="576" height="407" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think just being Robin was all the positive reinforcement Oakley needed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He wasn&#8217;t raised under the camera, but he&#8217;s a natural (I guess that comes in being my brother).</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Tip 6 (and the only one you need): Make it Fun and Loving</h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, a truly great photo just represents the moment. So the more fun, entertaining, and loving the experience is, the better photos you get. I for one have come to recognize that the camera means personalized attention, playtime, fun, and affection &#8211; as well as the delayed benefits of fame, babes, and self-indulgence.</p>
<p>And after all that good work in the studio, one of our favorite things to enjoy together.. is ice cream : )</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dachshunds-eating-ice-crea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3646" alt="Crusoe and Oakley eating ice cream" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/dachshunds-eating-ice-crea.jpg" width="630" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That was a blissful moment, and the camera caught it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep clickin&#8217;,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most of you know, I just got back from a great little vacation to Florida. Although I try to enjoy my vacations, everything I do is under the spotlight. So it&#8217;s not as easy as you may think. I always have to be thinking about how I look, my angle towards the camera, what I&#8217;m wearing, and of course &#8211; always be flexin&#8217;.</p>
<p>I already covered a lot of my trip in one of my previous post called <a title="Florida Vacation in 6-Second Clips" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/03/24/dachshund-florida-vacation-vine-videos/">Florida Vacation in 6-Second Vine Videos</a>, but I got a<em><strong> special GoPro video</strong></em> for you in this post that&#8217;s <em>more</em> than 6 seconds (as by popular request ; )</p>
<p>It all started with my quest for manatees. However, I&#8217;m the type of dog who enjoys the journey, not just the destination. So on our intrepid boating expedition to find the manatees, we came across a few other things first.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3562" alt="florida-dachshund-small" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/florida-dachshund-small.jpg" width="560" height="307" /></p>
<p>Now as the captain of the ship, I have the sole privilege of sitting on Mum&#8217;s lap. This gives me a good vantage point for seeing ahead, since I wasn&#8217;t exactly blessed with long legs (but I make up for it in every other way).</p>
<p>Plus it&#8217;s warmer than sitting on the plain ol&#8217; seats. I may be a rugged adventurer, but I&#8217;m still a pampered celebrity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/captain-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3567" alt="Cute Crusoe Dachshund Captain!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/captain-small.jpg" width="537" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before I saw &#8211; er, heard our first creature.</p>
<p>It was something you might be surprised to hear about in Florida, and that&#8217;s monkeys!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, monkeys. And they lived on their own little island. Looks like they got stranded there with their boat, the USS Primate. Probably got washed up on those rocks in a bad storm..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3569" alt="Wiener Dog Sees Monkeys!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wiener-dog-sees-monkeys.jpg" width="576" height="419" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wonder they haven&#8217;t been rescued by now.</p>
<p>Usually I would go all Rambo on furry creatures like these, but I have a soft spot for monkeys (one of my favorite toys is a monkey). So I told Dad to swing the boat by the rocks and that I would hop onto the island to go save them.</p>
<p>He told me they might not be as &#8216;receptive&#8217; as I may think. Well heck, if they don&#8217;t want to be saved they can stay on their little rock.</p>
<p>Moving on, next stop was the gator hole. I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Duck Dynasty and Swamp People lately, so I&#8217;ve been aching to do some gator fishin&#8217; of my own.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3571" alt="Gater fishin' weenie" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gator-fishing-weenie-dog.jpg" width="576" height="433" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A lot of fans told me to &#8216;be careful&#8217; when I told them about this, but seriously, don&#8217;t worry about it. My middle name is danger-gator.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How many weenie dogs do you know that can say they&#8217;ve come close enough to smell gator breath?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3574" alt="Crusoe Smells Gator Breath" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gater-breath-mint-small.jpg" width="576" height="383" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Well I can. And it stinks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It wasn&#8217;t long before we starting spotting the circular ripples on the water&#8217;s surface. We had finally arrived to the manatees! Time to gear up and go see them for myself!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And well, this part is better described with my all-new GoPro video..</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q9_D1d3kv3E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope you took notice of my great doggy paddle. My front paws churn so much power I don&#8217;t even need to use my back legs.. ; )</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/picture-of-dog-swimming-underwater.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3577" alt="Swimming Dachshund Underwater" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/picture-of-dog-swimming-underwater.jpg" width="600" height="440" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The manatees were quite something to meet up close, and although I first looked at them as a giant trophy fish, they are extremely gentle giants. In fact, they&#8217;re having a bit of a tough time this year (with red tide and all), so if you&#8217;d like to lend them a helping paw, you can donate to the <a title="Save the Manatee" href="http://www.savethemanatee.org/" target="_blank">Save the Manatee Organization</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hope to swim with them again soon. And as always, looking forward to my next vacation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep paddlin&#8217;,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">~ Crusoe</p>

<p>Keep posin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Keep watch for the 2nd part to my recent <a title="Florida Vacation in 6-Second Clips" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/03/24/dachshund-florida-vacation-vine-videos/" target="_blank">Florida Vacation</a>, featuring my highly anticipated <em><strong>GoPro Vacation Video</strong></em> (if you thought the above video was good.. you ain&#8217;t seen nothin&#8217; yet) coming this week!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am almost finished my awesome little stay at my vacation home in Florida. As a celebrity, sometimes you just need to get away. At least that&#8217;s what I tell people, but in actual fact I&#8217;m such an international celebrity that there isn&#8217;t much escape. And Florida especially loves their wieners.</p>
<p>I usually do my vacation blog posts in multiple-part series. This time I&#8217;m doing it a little different. This post will feature my 6-second Vine videos from my trip, and my next post will be a little more in depth and feature my awesome new GoPro video (which you should be very excited for!)</p>
<p>First we need to back up a bit &#8211; to my hometown, that is. Mum always makes me pack my suitcase before we leave, reiterating several times that I should only bring &#8216;essentials&#8217; to minimize baggage. Easier said than done for a celebrity.</p>
<p>I consider all of my below toys essential necessities for celebrity dachshund survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if they don&#8217;t all fit, well heck, all the more reason for Mum and Dad to buy me the private jet I&#8217;ve been asking for.</p>
<p>Next stop is the airport, where I make sure &#8216;I&#8217;ll fit&#8217; and get checked in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a happy camper once I get to Florida. The heat, the sunshine, and of course the babes. If you don&#8217;t know me by now, just know that I&#8217;m all about my sun rays, squeaky toys, and sexy ladies. Now that&#8217;s a <em>dawg</em>&#8216;s life.</p>
<p>Once I got to my vacation home, I told Mum to chip chop and hook up the bike trailer. It&#8217;d been a while since I had been there and I needed to cruise the neighborhood to see if any new babes had moved in.</p>
<p>So here I am on babe patrol while sporting my classic Ray Bans. What girl wouldn&#8217;t drop jaw (and collar ; ) at this scene?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t spot any new girls on the block. But that&#8217;s ok, because I had some other super-exciting stuff to attend to.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am an <a title="Dachshund Gone Fishin’" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/09/02/dachshund-gone-fishing/">avid fisherman</a>, so when I saw picture of the giant fishy they call a &#8216;manatee&#8217;, I knew I had to see it for myself.</p>
<p>I had a hard time seeing from way up in the boat, so I had Mum rig me up this little lifeboat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-floating-on-raft.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3512" alt="Crusoe Looking for Manatees! " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-floating-on-raft.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>This was a much better vantage point for spotting them.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see in the below video, since we were now close to seeing them I decided to put on my snorkel gear. There was no telling when I might need to make a quick-decision dive attack on one of them. As a fisherman, I know how rare some opportunities can be, so I like to be prepared.</p>
<p>When we finally saw one, I was a bit disappointed. I told Mum &#8220;this is the most boring fish I&#8217;ve ever seen&#8221;. She told me it was just because it was sleeping, and that they aren&#8217;t actually &#8216;fishies&#8217;. Not sure how I felt about that..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Now snorkeling with manatees.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still wanted to get a closer look. So I took to the water to explore for myself.</p>
<p>I kept my snorkel tube but ditched the mask &#8211; because the dang thing kept fogging up and wasn&#8217;t that &#8216;waterproof&#8217; anyhow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, we finally found some that were moving around. Being the brave, intrepid explorer that I am, I swam right above it!</p>
<p>To be honest, manatees are a bit bigger than they looked in the pictures, so at the last minute I decided not to pursue my &#8216;from-above&#8217; dive-attack plan. Mum also explained to me that they&#8217;re endangered. An honorable fisherman/hunter knows how to respect a species that&#8217;s in trouble, and in fact, all species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Swimming with manatees. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23travel">#travel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachshund">#dachshund</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23manatee">#manatee</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bplb95ldEBw" href="https://t.co/hc09jpu4ZJ">vine.co/v/bplb95ldEBw</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I turned away at the last second.</p>
<p>Since I was already in the water though, I figured I might as well work on my doggy paddle to perfect my stroke. I am already a <a title="The Annual Wiener Dog Race" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/08/27/wiener-dog-race-montreal-2012/">champion racer</a> on land, and if there&#8217;s ever a water wiener race I need to make sure I&#8217;m on top of my game.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice in the below video that my two front shovels are in this case, two front paddles while my back legs are purely for stability and steering. I guess having a log-shaped body makes us prone to rolling over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The front paws are for power, the back paws for steering. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23loop">#loop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23travel">#travel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23underwater">#underwater</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bDb6MbETnX7" href="https://t.co/V6cf4E5AAE">vine.co/v/bDb6MbETnX7</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weight of my<em> actual</em> wiener also helps to prevent my from keeling over (that&#8217;s a hint to the ladies).</p>
<p>So to wrap up an awesome vacation, on the last day we went to visit <a title="Doggy Beach Florida" href="http://www.bringfido.com/attraction/98/" target="_blank">Fort Desoto Doggy Beach</a>. It wasn&#8217;t the nicest day though, so there weren&#8217;t many babes out (except Mum).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fort-desota-dog-beach-florida.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3518" alt="Crusoe &amp; Mum at the beach" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fort-desota-dog-beach-florida.jpg" width="585" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>But it was here that I got to put my original <em>two front shovels</em> to work digging in the sand. Dad told me there are treasures of hidden squeaky balls buried in all beaches, so I am on a forever quest to find them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my Florida vacation in 6-second clips (and a couple photos).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for my next post that will feature my Florida vacation GoPro video. And trust me, you don&#8217;t want to miss it.</p>
<p>Keep swimmin&#8217;,</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, my new contest is called the <strong>Centerfold Photo Contest</strong>. Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about..</p>
<p>This contest is designed to give all my fans a chance to be a &#8216;centerfold star&#8217; just like me! To enter, just take a photo of your doggy (or use a previous photo) in some sort of centerfold-worthy pose! It could be laying stretched out on the couch all seductively (like my Sunday Pin-Up Girls), a funny portrait, a cute naptime, a glam shot, a jump through the air, or anything else you think might do the trick!</p>
<p>This is your chance to put your dog under the spotlight! And both ladies and gents of all breeds are welcome!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some examples of what I consider to be some of my best &#8216;centerfold shots&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3457" alt="Sexy Centerfold Dachshund" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sexy-centerfold-dachshund.jpg" width="515" height="634" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3458" alt="cute wiener dog" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/brace-yourself.jpg" width="529" height="374" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3473" alt="Crusoe Runway Pose" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-runway.jpg" width="527" height="685" /></p>
<p>Now as you&#8217;ll likely learn from doing this, modeling is not as easy as you think. So all your work may just pay off. The winners will receive &#8216;royalties&#8217; for their work in the form of <a title="Barkbox" href="https://barkbox.com/" target="_blank">Barkbox</a> subscriptions! If you don&#8217;t know Barkbox, they send you a monthly box of awesome dog goodies in the mail, including everything from toys to treats to doggy cake mixes!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3466" alt="Photo Contest Prize: Barkbox !" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/barkbox-for-dachshunds.jpg" width="585" height="736" /></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. I have some very cool prizes of my own! Each of the top 2 winners will get a pack of my favorite <a title="My Favorite Squeaky Balls" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/store/#!/~/product/category=0&amp;id=18860208" target="_blank">squeaky balls</a>, and the first place winner will be the first person ever to receive my brand new,<em><strong> Crusoe t-shirt</strong></em> !!</p>
<p>My t-shirts will be going on sale shortly after the contest is over, but the question is &#8211; who will be the first to sport one?</p>
<div id="attachment_3467" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 564px"><img class=" wp-image-3467 " alt="Crusoe T-Shirt!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-dachshund-t-shirt.jpg" width="554" height="504" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is just a mock-up of the t-shirt design. Actual t-shirt may vary slightly.</p></div>
<h2>Here&#8217;s the official breakdown of prizes:</h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">6-month Barkbox subscription, 1 pack of my favorite squeaky toys, and a Crusoe t-shirt!</span></li>
<li>3-month Barkbox subscription and a pack of my favorite squeaky toys.</li>
<li>3-month Barkbox subscription.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the top 10 entries will also be featured on my blog &#8211; of course!</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s how it works:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Starting this Saturday, March 16, visit my <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to submit your entry. You&#8217;ll have only one week to submit entries!</span></li>
<li>Submissions close and voting starts March 23, where you&#8217;ll have one week again to get lots of people to vote for your photo!</li>
<li>Voting closes March 29 and the top 10 entries will go into a final draw to determine the top 3 winners!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exciting</em>, right?</p>
<p>So are you ready? Start thinking of your winning centerfold shot, and it might just win you some very cool stuff! But hey, it&#8217;s not just about winning. We&#8217;ll have lots of fun in the meantime. I can&#8217;t wait to see all the sexy ladies and cool shots you come up with.</p>
<p>Keep posin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 24px;">On today&#8217;s episode of Cooking with Crusoe, I&#8217;ll be making pizza! If you would like to follow this recipe but don&#8217;t have time to read the full post, just scroll to the bottom for my 6-second Vine video recap. Actually, forget that &#8211; just read the whole thing.</span></p>
<p>This past weekend when I was thinking about what to make, I found myself in a bit of a pickle (pun not intended this time). I knew I wanted to make something yummy, but being used to eating the same damn kibbles everyday, my imagination for culinary creations is somewhat bland.</p>
<p>So I do what I always do when I need to do some critical thinking &#8211; and that&#8217;s put on my thinking glasses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-dachshund-chef-big.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3423" alt="Crusoe Chef Costume &amp; Thinking Glasses" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-dachshund-chef.jpg" width="540" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>It was then that I had the brilliant idea to sift through Mum&#8217;s cooking magazines, where low and behold the first one I found was all about cheese. Talk about fate..</p>
<p>After looking through it I decided pizza contains the most amount of things I like. So here we go&#8230;</p>
<h2>Step 1: go buy some dough</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re probably disappointed in reading a recipe blog post and finding out the first step is to go buy something store-bought like this. But who really cares about the dough anyway? Just consider this the plate for all the delicious cheese and pepperoni that will be going on here.</p>
<p>Once you have your dough ready to go, you&#8217;ll want to spread around that white stuff again on your board or counter. I&#8217;ll admit, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cute-dachshund-paws-big.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3433" alt="Doxie Paws in Flour" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cute-dachshund-paws1.jpg" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<h2>Step: pretend you&#8217;re Italian</h2>
<p>I find you get the best results in life by pretending to be something you&#8217;re not &#8211; whether that&#8217;s a chef, a <a title="Bahamas Vacation Part 3 (Final)" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/11/29/bahamas-vacation-part-3-final/">scuba diver</a>, or a celebrity. Since Italians invented pizza, I figured that thinking &#8211; and<em> looking</em> like one might make me a better pizza chef. They do still all have curly mustaches, right?</p>
<p>I tried growing a mustache over the weekend for this post but that didn&#8217;t work. Plus, I didn&#8217;t want to end up looking like a wired-hair (sensitive issue).</p>
<p>So I just held this fake mustache in my mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3424" alt="Crusoe with his Mustache" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/italian-mustache-dog.jpg" width="540" height="760" /></p>
<h2>Step 3: add some paw</h2>
<p>The next step is to work-in the dough. But that&#8217;s not our only objective here. Really working your (or your dog&#8217;s) paws into the dough will transfer some of that salty Frito flavor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3425" alt="Doggy Pizza" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/doggy-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="856" /></p>
<h2>Step 5: roll it</h2>
<p>Now you want to take that big round stick and (don&#8217;t chew it) use it to flatten out the dough a bit. If you really have an overwhelming temptation, just chew the handles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3430" alt="Doxie Rolling Pin!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dog-rolling-pin-1.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<h2>Step 6: do like the Harlem Globetrotters</h2>
<p>Now this step might be a bit tricky for some of you. Just imagine how talented I must be to do this with my short little paws. Anyway, now you&#8217;ll want to toss it up in the air, spinning it like a basketball.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3426" alt="Crusoe throwing Pizza!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-throwing-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="856" /></p>
<p>Do this a few times until its a the width you want. Be careful not to have it land on your head &#8211; unless you like hair in your pizza, or fancy it as a hat.</p>
<h2>Step 6: add all the good stuff!</h2>
<p>Spread around that red glop everywhere onto the dough. Then add a healthy layering of cheese. Again, if you feel the temptation there&#8217;s nothing wrong with bending over and taking a quick nibble when no one&#8217;s watching.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3431" alt="Doxie Pizza !" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dog-eating-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="447" /></p>
<p>Then add pepperoni, bacon, more cheese, even more cheese and whatever else you want. Oh &#8211; and I also like to add a little sprinkle of kibbles (because I&#8217;m trying to eat healthy, too).</p>
<p>This is what your pizza should look like before it&#8217;s cooked. Toppings may vary.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3432" alt="Kibble Pizza" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kibble-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="441" /></p>
<h2> Step 7: cook it up, baby</h2>
<p>The last step is to throw the pizza in the oven and wait for about 2 hours. Well, that&#8217;s how long it seemed like anyway. Again, my cooking posts are not about measurements and all the specifics of cooking &#8211; but rather the fun of cooking.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s done, make sure to pose for a good picture with your creation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3434" alt="Doxie Pizza Chef" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/doxie-pizza-chef.jpg" width="600" height="816" /></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try a piece of it! I&#8217;m sure Mum and Dad will love it too!</p>
<h2>Vine video recap:</h2>
<p>And finally, here is the Vine video recap of making a pizza with Chef Crusoe:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Makin&#8217; a pizza! <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23food">#food</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dog">#dog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pizza">#pizza</a> <a title="http://vine.co/v/bHO69gxjWL9" href="http://t.co/nPJRLsQGSA">vine.co/v/bHO69gxjWL9</a></p>

Hope you enjoying this week&#8217;s Cooking with Crusoe post. I&#8217;ll have to do some more critical thinking on what to make next. Or, you could provide some suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next with your favorite celebrity? Well, in just a week and half I will be at 31,000 feet in the air on my way to sunny Florida for a vacation.</p>
<p>Keep cookin&#8217;,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have seen some of my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=431347490287085&amp;set=a.383449131743588.91325.155275957894241&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Facebook posts</a> this past Sunday of me practicing my red carpet walk and acceptance speech as if for the Oscars. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), it was the same day that I also found out I&#8217;m one of the 5 finalists for the prestigious <a title="Bloggies" href="http://2013.bloggi.es/" target="_blank">Bloggie Award</a> of Best Pet Blog! So it may have looked like I was just having some dress-up fun, but in fact I was so excited by my nomination that I just had an overwhelming desire to start running through the ceremony routine!</p>
<p>Now you may say, &#8220;Crusoe, aren&#8217;t you getting a bit ahead of yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but my whole celebrity success has revolved around me &#8220;thinking I&#8217;m more of a celebrity than I really am&#8221;, so I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stick with my strategy ; )</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s pretty fun to dress up all fancy-like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/crusoe-red-carpet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3361" alt="Crusoe Red Carpet Walk" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/crusoe-red-carpet.jpg" width="581" height="421" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I get too far I have to remember my manners, and in doing so say a big thank you to all my fans and especially to all those who helped nominate me! I wouldn&#8217;t be here without my supporting fans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But since I&#8217;m on the red carpet, I might as well throw out a few more poses for the camera ; )</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog-red-carpet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3364" alt="Red Carpet Wiener Dog - Crusoe!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog-red-carpet.jpg" width="600" height="795" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know that once I&#8217;m at the award show there will likely be a lot of cameras flashing and people trying to get at me for an interview. I need to make sure I keep perfect composure for all those photos, so I had Mum and Dad put me through a similar &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; to what the awards show would be like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check out my below red carpet Vine video (sound recommended). You&#8217;ll notice the award I have there is a mini version of an Oscar, marked as &#8216;Best Celebrity Dog&#8217;. This is what I&#8217;m practicing with ; )</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>At the Oscar-(meyer wieners), accepting my Academy Award for best celebrity dog. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23oscars">#oscars</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachsh">#dachsh</a>&#8230; <a title="http://vine.co/v/bggt5VmdEEL" href="http://t.co/8cyRNVl07A">vine.co/v/bggt5VmdEEL</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m in pretty good shape for the ceremony. After all, I&#8217;ve been under the spell of the camera for just about as long as I can remember now. As my fan Betsy Bishop said, &#8220;<em>you are a natural, Crusoe!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step will be for me to prepare my acceptance speech. I&#8217;ve already been working on it for the past two days. As you know, for any sort of critical thinking I must wear my &#8216;thinking glasses&#8217;. However, sometimes my excitement can cloud my thinking, so I need to balance my critical thinking with some casual relaxation. That&#8217;s why I am much more productive if I wear my glasses <em>and</em> play video games at the same time! (Dad taught me that).</p>

<p>— Crusoe Dachshund (@Celeb_Dachshund) <a href="https://twitter.com/Celeb_Dachshund/status/299666882422779904">February 7, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I won&#8217;t tell you exactly what my speech will say since there has to be some element of surprise, but here&#8217;s the gist of it:</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll do a quick scan of the audience to pick out the location of the cutest chicks. This will be the direction in which I wink throughout my speech.</p>
<p>The rest of the time I&#8217;ll just crack some jokes and ramble on about a few random stories, making sure to thank my managers (Mum &amp; Dad), my brother Oakley, and of course my fans at some point. But for the most part I&#8217;ll be throwing winks and making suggestive comments to the awesomeness of the after-party I&#8217;ll be having. I&#8217;ll just have to be careful that my winking frequency doesn&#8217;t come off as a twitch..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3377" alt="Bloggies Award - Best Dog Blog " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog.jpg" width="540" height="762" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a common misconception out there that us wiener dogs (dachshunds) don&#8217;t fare well in the cold and deep snow &#8211; that since we&#8217;re small in size we&#8217;re just a lap dog.</p>
<p>This is of course not true. We were bred to hunt badgers, so although we may be one of the cutest things you&#8217;ve ever seen, you stick us down a dark hole up against two pairs of giant claws and razor teeth and we&#8217;ll hold our own.</p>
<p>All this to say that we can brave the cold and snow. Even though I am now pursuing the celebrity life in the big city, I was raised in the Quebec countryside where the winters are cold and the snow is several feet deep. I&#8217;ve learned to enjoy it. But I&#8217;ll admit, sometimes I still need a kick in the butt (literally) to go outside, but once I&#8217;m out there I love it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/youtube-thumbnail.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3329" alt="Crusoe GoPro Action Shot" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/youtube-thumbnail.jpg" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>And to prove it to you, I&#8217;ve been collecting some footage over the past while with my new GoPro video camera that I got for <a title="A Celebrity Dachshund Christmas" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/12/26/dachshund-christmas-gifts/">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dog-wearing-gopro1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" alt="Crusoe Wearing his GoPro" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dog-wearing-gopro1.jpg" width="600" height="804" /></a></p>
<p>So I now invite you to grab a handful of popcorn, (or kibbles), sit back and enjoy my short but highly anticipated second GoPro video, entitled <strong>Winter Wienerland</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OhGXHtbAdic" height="335" width="600" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that look like fun?</p>
<p>You probably noticed my little bunny hops near the beginning. I do this to heighten my perspective when on a scent or trail. That&#8217;s why I said we have &#8216;back rabbit legs&#8217; in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=427341210687713&amp;set=a.156655384422965.40818.155275957894241&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Anatomy of a Dachshund</a> diagram on Facebook.</p>
<p>It may look like I had a lot of fun in this video, and I did, but I also take my expedition leadership very seriously. As said in one of my many <a title="QUOTES" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/dachshund-taglines/" target="_blank">#CrusoeQuotes</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Crusoe does not go on walks &#8211; he leads expeditions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wiener-dog-explorer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3319" alt="Wiener Dog Expedition" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wiener-dog-explorer-2.jpg" width="600" height="448" /></a></p>
<p>Expeditions are particularly fun in the winter because you can easily pinpoint a scent or spot tracks (as seen in the video). Whenever I do hear or smell something, I&#8217;m quick to hold the line by using just a paw signal. I&#8217;ve trained my humans well to recognize my different signals, which can include anything from &#8216;hold still&#8217;, &#8216;over there&#8217;, &#8216;give me a back rub&#8217;, or &#8216;go get me a beer&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/heard-something-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3321" alt="Adventure Wiener" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/heard-something-2.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>As you saw in my last <a title="Quality Time With My Bro" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/01/03/dachshund-winter-fun/" target="_blank">GoPro video post</a>, I am also a snowball fanatic. Mum says I need to go see a shrink (quack) about my obsession. In fact, they just passed a majority family rule that Dad is not allowed to make or throw snowballs for me while in the presence of other people. That&#8217;s how bad its gotten..</p>
<p>As you can imagine, I was not at all for passing that bill and will be doing whatever I can to undermine the system (probably by peeing on something).</p>
<p>I may be a celebrity, but no move is &#8216;too low&#8217; when there are snowballs at stake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/winter-dachshund-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3324" alt="Winter Dachshund - Crusoe" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/winter-dachshund-2.jpg" width="600" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>Another great part of winter is just blasting through the snow. There&#8217;s something particularly fun about it that just about any dog can enjoy.</p>
<p>Now, my fans are from all over the world so likely a good portion of them won&#8217;t even have snow. But what does winter mean to you and your doggy? Let me know in the comments or on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Keep filmin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first &#8216;Cooking with Crusoe&#8217; blog post! I know the anticipation has been high since I first introduced Chef Crusoe on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a> just earlier this week. Chef Crusoe may not know how to cook, but he does know what tastes good, so how hard can it be?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chef-crusoe-dachshund-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3182" alt="Dachshund Chef Costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chef-crusoe-dachshund-costume.jpg" width="567" height="392" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this episode of Cooking with Crusoe we&#8217;ll be making carrot cupcakes, since I love carrots and cupcakes are one of the most popular Valentine&#8217;s Day treats! And if I have any last minute babes over for Valentine&#8217;s Day I need to at least look like I was expecting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But seriously, what girl can resist a dog who knows his way around the kitchen?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-chef-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3184" alt="Funny wiener dog chef costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-chef-costume.jpg" width="550" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So onto the recipe! Please keep in mind that although I am a self-proclaimed professional chef (among other things), I don&#8217;t always know what I&#8217;m talking about, so please take whatever I say with a grain of salt (pun intended).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what you need to make these delicious carrot cupcakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">A bit more than a grain of salt.</span></li>
<li>Lots of carrots, as some may get eaten in the process.</li>
<li>A couple eggs (which taste better cooked, by the way).</li>
<li>White stuff.</li>
<li>Brown stuff.</li>
<li>Other stuff.</li>
<li>A touch of doxie paw.</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume you&#8217;ll just Google whatever parts I leave out.</p>
<h2>Prepare the carrots !!</h2>
<p>The first step is preparing the carrots. You&#8217;ll want to grate them so you have a good cup&#8217;s worth. If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;ll likely feel an overwhelming temptation to pose like Bugs Bunny first though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to do that..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-dachshund-carrot-in-mouth.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3188" alt="dachshund with carrot " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-dachshund-carrot-in-mouth.jpg" width="567" height="403" /></a></p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re going to pose like Bugs Bunny, you at least have to munch on the end of a carrot like him, too!</p>
<p>(This is why you need extra carrots).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-eating-carrot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3189" alt="dachshunds love carrots" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-eating-carrot.jpg" width="542" height="810" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Prepare the rest</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">After you prepare the carrots, you need to prepare the rest of the stuff in your mixer bowl &#8211; including the white, brown and other stuff. They say measurements matter in cooking, but I&#8217;m a realist, so I don&#8217;t bother with that. I call it &#8216;free-ballin&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep in mind that the white stuff (flour) might make you sneeze, wherein it could potentially end up all over you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-baker-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3191" alt="Funny dachshund picture baker costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-baker-costume.jpg" width="544" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But that&#8217;s ok. Part of being a good cook is being able to get messy. As you know, I&#8217;m all about my image when I do certain activities so the fact I have flour all over my face just adds to the &#8216;baker&#8217; look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now as you saw in my last blog post with my new <a title="My Life in 6-Second Clips" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/02/06/dog-to-follow-on-vine/">Vine videos</a>, my posts are no longer just photo productions, but will now also feature my 6-second clips from <a href="http://vineapp.com/" target="_blank">Vine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So check out my below video clip on the first segment of our carrot cupcakes!</p>

<p>— Crusoe Dachshund (@Celeb_Dachshund) <a href="https://twitter.com/Celeb_Dachshund/status/301149230502916096">February 12, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had to take a pause after this for my &#8216;crew&#8217; to clean me up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may also find that working in the kitchen gets pretty hot. I found it a nice relief to take off the big muffin hat I was wearing to cool off. Plus, Mum says I look super cute like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cutest-dachshund-picture.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3193" alt="cute dachshund picture costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cutest-dachshund-picture.jpg" width="547" height="810" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Put it in the muffin tray</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you mix the batter, you can spoon it into the muffin tray. This one was a bit tricky for me to do myself, so I had Mum do it for me while I watched curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a very <a title="An Observant Dachshund" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/03/25/observant-dachshund/">observant dachshund</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/funny-doxie-baking.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3196" alt="funny dachshund baking cupcakes" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/funny-doxie-baking.jpg" width="549" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I usually watch Mum cook from the floor, so it was interesting to finally see things from counter-level. It should be like this more often now that Chef Crusoe is in the house though ; )</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Bake for 20 minutes</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next step is to bake them for about 20 minutes. Us dogs have a pretty good internal clock, so I said heck with the timer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-baker-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3197" alt="Dachshund Baker Cooking Costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-baker-costume.jpg" width="569" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like many other things in this house (which are under ongoing discussion), the oven wasn&#8217;t made to be at doxie eye-level, so I had to use this dinky stool to see in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh well, at least I could enjoy those sweet carrot cupcake aromas and be nice and warm while sitting there.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Add icing and serve</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The last step is to add the cream cheese icing and serve them. Supposedly it&#8217;s rude to eat one before you serve others, but hey, carrots and cheese &#8211; how could I resist?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m sure no one will notice that one has been nibbled on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-cupcakes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3198" alt="Dachshund Pupcakes " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-cupcakes.jpg" width="567" height="394" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just hope I don&#8217;t eat them all before I have a chance to serve them to some nice ladies on Valentine&#8217;s Day. Speaking of that, I should probably hide them from Dad, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope you enjoyed my cooking lesson for carrot cupcakes. I aim to provide you more with lessons on having fun in cooking rather than the beginner stuff of ingredients, measurements, and steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And oh, hope everyone has a very romantic Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep free-ballin&#8217;,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">~ Crusoe</p>
