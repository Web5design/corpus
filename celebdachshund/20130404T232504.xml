<p>Thanks to all those who participated! As with any contest, unfortunately not everyone can win. But don&#8217;t worry, lots more cool and exciting contests to come (they&#8217;ll also be setup a little differently ; ) So stay tuned!</p>
<p>Keep posin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Keep watch for the 2nd part to my recent <a title="Florida Vacation in 6-Second Clips" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/03/24/dachshund-florida-vacation-vine-videos/" target="_blank">Florida Vacation</a>, featuring my highly anticipated <em><strong>GoPro Vacation Video</strong></em> (if you thought the above video was good.. you ain&#8217;t seen nothin&#8217; yet) coming this week!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am almost finished my awesome little stay at my vacation home in Florida. As a celebrity, sometimes you just need to get away. At least that&#8217;s what I tell people, but in actual fact I&#8217;m such an international celebrity that there isn&#8217;t much escape. And Florida especially loves their wieners.</p>
<p>I usually do my vacation blog posts in multiple-part series. This time I&#8217;m doing it a little different. This post will feature my 6-second Vine videos from my trip, and my next post will be a little more in depth and feature my awesome new GoPro video (which you should be very excited for!)</p>
<p>First we need to back up a bit &#8211; to my hometown, that is. Mum always makes me pack my suitcase before we leave, reiterating several times that I should only bring &#8216;essentials&#8217; to minimize baggage. Easier said than done for a celebrity.</p>
<p>I consider all of my below toys essential necessities for celebrity dachshund survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Packin&#8217; my suitcase for Florida. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23trave">#trave</a>&#8230; <a title="http://vine.co/v/bd3B5Y62r3H" href="http://t.co/cMSSA64VB0">vine.co/v/bd3B5Y62r3H</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if they don&#8217;t all fit, well heck, all the more reason for Mum and Dad to buy me the private jet I&#8217;ve been asking for.</p>
<p>Next stop is the airport, where I make sure &#8216;I&#8217;ll fit&#8217; and get checked in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a happy camper once I get to Florida. The heat, the sunshine, and of course the babes. If you don&#8217;t know me by now, just know that I&#8217;m all about my sun rays, squeaky toys, and sexy ladies. Now that&#8217;s a <em>dawg</em>&#8216;s life.</p>
<p>Once I got to my vacation home, I told Mum to chip chop and hook up the bike trailer. It&#8217;d been a while since I had been there and I needed to cruise the neighborhood to see if any new babes had moved in.</p>
<p>So here I am on babe patrol while sporting my classic Ray Bans. What girl wouldn&#8217;t drop jaw (and collar ; ) at this scene?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t spot any new girls on the block. But that&#8217;s ok, because I had some other super-exciting stuff to attend to.</p>
<p>As you may know, I am an <a title="Dachshund Gone Fishin’" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/09/02/dachshund-gone-fishing/">avid fisherman</a>, so when I saw picture of the giant fishy they call a &#8216;manatee&#8217;, I knew I had to see it for myself.</p>
<p>I had a hard time seeing from way up in the boat, so I had Mum rig me up this little lifeboat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-floating-on-raft.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3512" alt="Crusoe Looking for Manatees! " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-floating-on-raft.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>This was a much better vantage point for spotting them.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ll see in the below video, since we were now close to seeing them I decided to put on my snorkel gear. There was no telling when I might need to make a quick-decision dive attack on one of them. As a fisherman, I know how rare some opportunities can be, so I like to be prepared.</p>
<p>When we finally saw one, I was a bit disappointed. I told Mum &#8220;this is the most boring fish I&#8217;ve ever seen&#8221;. She told me it was just because it was sleeping, and that they aren&#8217;t actually &#8216;fishies&#8217;. Not sure how I felt about that..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Now snorkeling with manatees. Kind of. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23travel">#travel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23manatee">#manatee</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bDuKxBZ3x1b" href="https://t.co/FvfEv7iSK4">vine.co/v/bDuKxBZ3x1b</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still wanted to get a closer look. So I took to the water to explore for myself.</p>
<p>I kept my snorkel tube but ditched the mask &#8211; because the dang thing kept fogging up and wasn&#8217;t that &#8216;waterproof&#8217; anyhow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Doggy paddlin&#8217;. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23underwater">#underwater</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachshund">#dachshund</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bDubZ532M6E" href="https://t.co/QMBX4QL3fQ">vine.co/v/bDubZ532M6E</a></p>
<p>— Crusoe Dachshund (@Celeb_Dachshund) <a href="https://twitter.com/Celeb_Dachshund/status/314823748182237184">March 21, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, we finally found some that were moving around. Being the brave, intrepid explorer that I am, I swam right above it!</p>
<p>To be honest, manatees are a bit bigger than they looked in the pictures, so at the last minute I decided not to pursue my &#8216;from-above&#8217; dive-attack plan. Mum also explained to me that they&#8217;re endangered. An honorable fisherman/hunter knows how to respect a species that&#8217;s in trouble, and in fact, all species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Swimming with manatees. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23travel">#travel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachshund">#dachshund</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23manatee">#manatee</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bplb95ldEBw" href="https://t.co/hc09jpu4ZJ">vine.co/v/bplb95ldEBw</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I turned away at the last second.</p>
<p>Since I was already in the water though, I figured I might as well work on my doggy paddle to perfect my stroke. I am already a <a title="The Annual Wiener Dog Race" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/08/27/wiener-dog-race-montreal-2012/">champion racer</a> on land, and if there&#8217;s ever a water wiener race I need to make sure I&#8217;m on top of my game.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice in the below video that my two front shovels are in this case, two front paddles while my back legs are purely for stability and steering. I guess having a log-shaped body makes us prone to rolling over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The front paws are for power, the back paws for steering. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23loop">#loop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23travel">#travel</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23underwater">#underwater</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bDb6MbETnX7" href="https://t.co/V6cf4E5AAE">vine.co/v/bDb6MbETnX7</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weight of my<em> actual</em> wiener also helps to prevent my from keeling over (that&#8217;s a hint to the ladies).</p>
<p>So to wrap up an awesome vacation, on the last day we went to visit <a title="Doggy Beach Florida" href="http://www.bringfido.com/attraction/98/" target="_blank">Fort Desoto Doggy Beach</a>. It wasn&#8217;t the nicest day though, so there weren&#8217;t many babes out (except Mum).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fort-desota-dog-beach-florida.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3518" alt="Crusoe &amp; Mum at the beach" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fort-desota-dog-beach-florida.jpg" width="585" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>But it was here that I got to put my original <em>two front shovels</em> to work digging in the sand. Dad told me there are treasures of hidden squeaky balls buried in all beaches, so I am on a forever quest to find them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Diggin&#8217; at the doggy beach. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23beach">#beach</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23florida">#florida</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachshund">#dachshund</a> <a title="https://vine.co/v/bDrL73FzMbt" href="https://t.co/5icCZr8Lny">vine.co/v/bDrL73FzMbt</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s my Florida vacation in 6-second clips (and a couple photos).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for my next post that will feature my Florida vacation GoPro video. And trust me, you don&#8217;t want to miss it.</p>
<p>Keep swimmin&#8217;,</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right, my new contest is called the <strong>Centerfold Photo Contest</strong>. Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about..</p>
<p>This contest is designed to give all my fans a chance to be a &#8216;centerfold star&#8217; just like me! To enter, just take a photo of your doggy (or use a previous photo) in some sort of centerfold-worthy pose! It could be laying stretched out on the couch all seductively (like my Sunday Pin-Up Girls), a funny portrait, a cute naptime, a glam shot, a jump through the air, or anything else you think might do the trick!</p>
<p>This is your chance to put your dog under the spotlight! And both ladies and gents of all breeds are welcome!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some examples of what I consider to be some of my best &#8216;centerfold shots&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3457" alt="Sexy Centerfold Dachshund" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sexy-centerfold-dachshund.jpg" width="515" height="634" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3458" alt="cute wiener dog" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/brace-yourself.jpg" width="529" height="374" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3473" alt="Crusoe Runway Pose" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-runway.jpg" width="527" height="685" /></p>
<p>Now as you&#8217;ll likely learn from doing this, modeling is not as easy as you think. So all your work may just pay off. The winners will receive &#8216;royalties&#8217; for their work in the form of <a title="Barkbox" href="https://barkbox.com/" target="_blank">Barkbox</a> subscriptions! If you don&#8217;t know Barkbox, they send you a monthly box of awesome dog goodies in the mail, including everything from toys to treats to doggy cake mixes!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3466" alt="Photo Contest Prize: Barkbox !" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/barkbox-for-dachshunds.jpg" width="585" height="736" /></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. I have some very cool prizes of my own! Each of the top 2 winners will get a pack of my favorite <a title="My Favorite Squeaky Balls" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/store/#!/~/product/category=0&amp;id=18860208" target="_blank">squeaky balls</a>, and the first place winner will be the first person ever to receive my brand new,<em><strong> Crusoe t-shirt</strong></em> !!</p>
<p>My t-shirts will be going on sale shortly after the contest is over, but the question is &#8211; who will be the first to sport one?</p>
<div id="attachment_3467" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 564px"><img class=" wp-image-3467 " alt="Crusoe T-Shirt!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-dachshund-t-shirt.jpg" width="554" height="504" /><p class="wp-caption-text">This is just a mock-up of the t-shirt design. Actual t-shirt may vary slightly.</p></div>
<h2>Here&#8217;s the official breakdown of prizes:</h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">6-month Barkbox subscription, 1 pack of my favorite squeaky toys, and a Crusoe t-shirt!</span></li>
<li>3-month Barkbox subscription and a pack of my favorite squeaky toys.</li>
<li>3-month Barkbox subscription.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the top 10 entries will also be featured on my blog &#8211; of course!</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s how it works:</h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Starting this Saturday, March 16, visit my <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to submit your entry. You&#8217;ll have only one week to submit entries!</span></li>
<li>Submissions close and voting starts March 23, where you&#8217;ll have one week again to get lots of people to vote for your photo!</li>
<li>Voting closes March 29 and the top 10 entries will go into a final draw to determine the top 3 winners!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Exciting</em>, right?</p>
<p>So are you ready? Start thinking of your winning centerfold shot, and it might just win you some very cool stuff! But hey, it&#8217;s not just about winning. We&#8217;ll have lots of fun in the meantime. I can&#8217;t wait to see all the sexy ladies and cool shots you come up with.</p>
<p>Keep posin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 24px;">On today&#8217;s episode of Cooking with Crusoe, I&#8217;ll be making pizza! If you would like to follow this recipe but don&#8217;t have time to read the full post, just scroll to the bottom for my 6-second Vine video recap. Actually, forget that &#8211; just read the whole thing.</span></p>
<p>This past weekend when I was thinking about what to make, I found myself in a bit of a pickle (pun not intended this time). I knew I wanted to make something yummy, but being used to eating the same damn kibbles everyday, my imagination for culinary creations is somewhat bland.</p>
<p>So I do what I always do when I need to do some critical thinking &#8211; and that&#8217;s put on my thinking glasses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-dachshund-chef-big.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3423" alt="Crusoe Chef Costume &amp; Thinking Glasses" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/funny-dachshund-chef.jpg" width="540" height="381" /></a></p>
<p>It was then that I had the brilliant idea to sift through Mum&#8217;s cooking magazines, where low and behold the first one I found was all about cheese. Talk about fate..</p>
<p>After looking through it I decided pizza contains the most amount of things I like. So here we go&#8230;</p>
<h2>Step 1: go buy some dough</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re probably disappointed in reading a recipe blog post and finding out the first step is to go buy something store-bought like this. But who really cares about the dough anyway? Just consider this the plate for all the delicious cheese and pepperoni that will be going on here.</p>
<p>Once you have your dough ready to go, you&#8217;ll want to spread around that white stuff again on your board or counter. I&#8217;ll admit, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s for.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cute-dachshund-paws-big.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3433" alt="Doxie Paws in Flour" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cute-dachshund-paws1.jpg" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<h2>Step: pretend you&#8217;re Italian</h2>
<p>I find you get the best results in life by pretending to be something you&#8217;re not &#8211; whether that&#8217;s a chef, a <a title="Bahamas Vacation Part 3 (Final)" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/11/29/bahamas-vacation-part-3-final/">scuba diver</a>, or a celebrity. Since Italians invented pizza, I figured that thinking &#8211; and<em> looking</em> like one might make me a better pizza chef. They do still all have curly mustaches, right?</p>
<p>I tried growing a mustache over the weekend for this post but that didn&#8217;t work. Plus, I didn&#8217;t want to end up looking like a wired-hair (sensitive issue).</p>
<p>So I just held this fake mustache in my mouth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3424" alt="Crusoe with his Mustache" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/italian-mustache-dog.jpg" width="540" height="760" /></p>
<h2>Step 3: add some paw</h2>
<p>The next step is to work-in the dough. But that&#8217;s not our only objective here. Really working your (or your dog&#8217;s) paws into the dough will transfer some of that salty Frito flavor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3425" alt="Doggy Pizza" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/doggy-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="856" /></p>
<h2>Step 5: roll it</h2>
<p>Now you want to take that big round stick and (don&#8217;t chew it) use it to flatten out the dough a bit. If you really have an overwhelming temptation, just chew the handles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3430" alt="Doxie Rolling Pin!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dog-rolling-pin-1.jpg" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<h2>Step 6: do like the Harlem Globetrotters</h2>
<p>Now this step might be a bit tricky for some of you. Just imagine how talented I must be to do this with my short little paws. Anyway, now you&#8217;ll want to toss it up in the air, spinning it like a basketball.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3426" alt="Crusoe throwing Pizza!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-throwing-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="856" /></p>
<p>Do this a few times until its a the width you want. Be careful not to have it land on your head &#8211; unless you like hair in your pizza, or fancy it as a hat.</p>
<h2>Step 6: add all the good stuff!</h2>
<p>Spread around that red glop everywhere onto the dough. Then add a healthy layering of cheese. Again, if you feel the temptation there&#8217;s nothing wrong with bending over and taking a quick nibble when no one&#8217;s watching.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3431" alt="Doxie Pizza !" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dog-eating-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="447" /></p>
<p>Then add pepperoni, bacon, more cheese, even more cheese and whatever else you want. Oh &#8211; and I also like to add a little sprinkle of kibbles (because I&#8217;m trying to eat healthy, too).</p>
<p>This is what your pizza should look like before it&#8217;s cooked. Toppings may vary.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3432" alt="Kibble Pizza" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/kibble-pizza.jpg" width="600" height="441" /></p>
<h2> Step 7: cook it up, baby</h2>
<p>The last step is to throw the pizza in the oven and wait for about 2 hours. Well, that&#8217;s how long it seemed like anyway. Again, my cooking posts are not about measurements and all the specifics of cooking &#8211; but rather the fun of cooking.</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s done, make sure to pose for a good picture with your creation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3434" alt="Doxie Pizza Chef" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/doxie-pizza-chef.jpg" width="600" height="816" /></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try a piece of it! I&#8217;m sure Mum and Dad will love it too!</p>
<h2>Vine video recap:</h2>
<p>And finally, here is the Vine video recap of making a pizza with Chef Crusoe:</p>

Hope you enjoying this week&#8217;s Cooking with Crusoe post. I&#8217;ll have to do some more critical thinking on what to make next. Or, you could provide some suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next with your favorite celebrity? Well, in just a week and half I will be at 31,000 feet in the air on my way to sunny Florida for a vacation.</p>
<p>Keep cookin&#8217;,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have seen some of my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=431347490287085&amp;set=a.383449131743588.91325.155275957894241&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Facebook posts</a> this past Sunday of me practicing my red carpet walk and acceptance speech as if for the Oscars. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), it was the same day that I also found out I&#8217;m one of the 5 finalists for the prestigious <a title="Bloggies" href="http://2013.bloggi.es/" target="_blank">Bloggie Award</a> of Best Pet Blog! So it may have looked like I was just having some dress-up fun, but in fact I was so excited by my nomination that I just had an overwhelming desire to start running through the ceremony routine!</p>
<p>Now you may say, &#8220;Crusoe, aren&#8217;t you getting a bit ahead of yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is yes, but my whole celebrity success has revolved around me &#8220;thinking I&#8217;m more of a celebrity than I really am&#8221;, so I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stick with my strategy ; )</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s pretty fun to dress up all fancy-like.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/crusoe-red-carpet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3361" alt="Crusoe Red Carpet Walk" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/crusoe-red-carpet.jpg" width="581" height="421" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before I get too far I have to remember my manners, and in doing so say a big thank you to all my fans and especially to all those who helped nominate me! I wouldn&#8217;t be here without my supporting fans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But since I&#8217;m on the red carpet, I might as well throw out a few more poses for the camera ; )</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog-red-carpet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3364" alt="Red Carpet Wiener Dog - Crusoe!" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog-red-carpet.jpg" width="600" height="795" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know that once I&#8217;m at the award show there will likely be a lot of cameras flashing and people trying to get at me for an interview. I need to make sure I keep perfect composure for all those photos, so I had Mum and Dad put me through a similar &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; to what the awards show would be like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Check out my below red carpet Vine video (sound recommended). You&#8217;ll notice the award I have there is a mini version of an Oscar, marked as &#8216;Best Celebrity Dog&#8217;. This is what I&#8217;m practicing with ; )</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>At the Oscar-(meyer wieners), accepting my Academy Award for best celebrity dog. <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23oscars">#oscars</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dachsh">#dachsh</a>&#8230; <a title="http://vine.co/v/bggt5VmdEEL" href="http://t.co/8cyRNVl07A">vine.co/v/bggt5VmdEEL</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m in pretty good shape for the ceremony. After all, I&#8217;ve been under the spell of the camera for just about as long as I can remember now. As my fan Betsy Bishop said, &#8220;<em>you are a natural, Crusoe!</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step will be for me to prepare my acceptance speech. I&#8217;ve already been working on it for the past two days. As you know, for any sort of critical thinking I must wear my &#8216;thinking glasses&#8217;. However, sometimes my excitement can cloud my thinking, so I need to balance my critical thinking with some casual relaxation. That&#8217;s why I am much more productive if I wear my glasses <em>and</em> play video games at the same time! (Dad taught me that).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I won&#8217;t tell you exactly what my speech will say since there has to be some element of surprise, but here&#8217;s the gist of it:</p>
<p>First I&#8217;ll do a quick scan of the audience to pick out the location of the cutest chicks. This will be the direction in which I wink throughout my speech.</p>
<p>The rest of the time I&#8217;ll just crack some jokes and ramble on about a few random stories, making sure to thank my managers (Mum &amp; Dad), my brother Oakley, and of course my fans at some point. But for the most part I&#8217;ll be throwing winks and making suggestive comments to the awesomeness of the after-party I&#8217;ll be having. I&#8217;ll just have to be careful that my winking frequency doesn&#8217;t come off as a twitch..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3377" alt="Bloggies Award - Best Dog Blog " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/academy-award-dog.jpg" width="540" height="762" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And oh &#8211; I might need to remove the shades!</p>
<p>I would love to win the Bloggie (Weblog) Award for best pet blog, as it would really be confirmation that I&#8217;m more of a celebrity than I really am.</p>
<p>The winner for the award is determined by votes accumulated before March 31, 2013. So I would immensely appreciate your vote : )</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There seems to be a common misconception out there that us wiener dogs (dachshunds) don&#8217;t fare well in the cold and deep snow &#8211; that since we&#8217;re small in size we&#8217;re just a lap dog.</p>
<p>This is of course not true. We were bred to hunt badgers, so although we may be one of the cutest things you&#8217;ve ever seen, you stick us down a dark hole up against two pairs of giant claws and razor teeth and we&#8217;ll hold our own.</p>
<p>All this to say that we can brave the cold and snow. Even though I am now pursuing the celebrity life in the big city, I was raised in the Quebec countryside where the winters are cold and the snow is several feet deep. I&#8217;ve learned to enjoy it. But I&#8217;ll admit, sometimes I still need a kick in the butt (literally) to go outside, but once I&#8217;m out there I love it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/youtube-thumbnail.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3329" alt="Crusoe GoPro Action Shot" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/youtube-thumbnail.jpg" width="614" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>And to prove it to you, I&#8217;ve been collecting some footage over the past while with my new GoPro video camera that I got for <a title="A Celebrity Dachshund Christmas" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/12/26/dachshund-christmas-gifts/">Christmas</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dog-wearing-gopro1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3314" alt="Crusoe Wearing his GoPro" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dog-wearing-gopro1.jpg" width="600" height="804" /></a></p>
<p>So I now invite you to grab a handful of popcorn, (or kibbles), sit back and enjoy my short but highly anticipated second GoPro video, entitled <strong>Winter Wienerland</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OhGXHtbAdic" height="335" width="600" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that look like fun?</p>
<p>You probably noticed my little bunny hops near the beginning. I do this to heighten my perspective when on a scent or trail. That&#8217;s why I said we have &#8216;back rabbit legs&#8217; in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=427341210687713&amp;set=a.156655384422965.40818.155275957894241&amp;type=1&amp;theater" target="_blank">Anatomy of a Dachshund</a> diagram on Facebook.</p>
<p>It may look like I had a lot of fun in this video, and I did, but I also take my expedition leadership very seriously. As said in one of my many <a title="QUOTES" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/dachshund-taglines/" target="_blank">#CrusoeQuotes</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Crusoe does not go on walks &#8211; he leads expeditions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/wiener-dog-explorer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3319" alt="Wiener Dog Expedition" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wiener-dog-explorer-2.jpg" width="600" height="448" /></a></p>
<p>Expeditions are particularly fun in the winter because you can easily pinpoint a scent or spot tracks (as seen in the video). Whenever I do hear or smell something, I&#8217;m quick to hold the line by using just a paw signal. I&#8217;ve trained my humans well to recognize my different signals, which can include anything from &#8216;hold still&#8217;, &#8216;over there&#8217;, &#8216;give me a back rub&#8217;, or &#8216;go get me a beer&#8217;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/heard-something-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3321" alt="Adventure Wiener" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/heard-something-2.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>As you saw in my last <a title="Quality Time With My Bro" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/01/03/dachshund-winter-fun/" target="_blank">GoPro video post</a>, I am also a snowball fanatic. Mum says I need to go see a shrink (quack) about my obsession. In fact, they just passed a majority family rule that Dad is not allowed to make or throw snowballs for me while in the presence of other people. That&#8217;s how bad its gotten..</p>
<p>As you can imagine, I was not at all for passing that bill and will be doing whatever I can to undermine the system (probably by peeing on something).</p>
<p>I may be a celebrity, but no move is &#8216;too low&#8217; when there are snowballs at stake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/winter-dachshund-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3324" alt="Winter Dachshund - Crusoe" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/winter-dachshund-2.jpg" width="600" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>Another great part of winter is just blasting through the snow. There&#8217;s something particularly fun about it that just about any dog can enjoy.</p>
<p>Now, my fans are from all over the world so likely a good portion of them won&#8217;t even have snow. But what does winter mean to you and your doggy? Let me know in the comments or on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Keep filmin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first &#8216;Cooking with Crusoe&#8217; blog post! I know the anticipation has been high since I first introduced Chef Crusoe on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a> just earlier this week. Chef Crusoe may not know how to cook, but he does know what tastes good, so how hard can it be?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chef-crusoe-dachshund-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3182" alt="Dachshund Chef Costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chef-crusoe-dachshund-costume.jpg" width="567" height="392" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this episode of Cooking with Crusoe we&#8217;ll be making carrot cupcakes, since I love carrots and cupcakes are one of the most popular Valentine&#8217;s Day treats! And if I have any last minute babes over for Valentine&#8217;s Day I need to at least look like I was expecting them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But seriously, what girl can resist a dog who knows his way around the kitchen?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-chef-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3184" alt="Funny wiener dog chef costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-chef-costume.jpg" width="550" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So onto the recipe! Please keep in mind that although I am a self-proclaimed professional chef (among other things), I don&#8217;t always know what I&#8217;m talking about, so please take whatever I say with a grain of salt (pun intended).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s what you need to make these delicious carrot cupcakes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">A bit more than a grain of salt.</span></li>
<li>Lots of carrots, as some may get eaten in the process.</li>
<li>A couple eggs (which taste better cooked, by the way).</li>
<li>White stuff.</li>
<li>Brown stuff.</li>
<li>Other stuff.</li>
<li>A touch of doxie paw.</li>
</ul>
<p>I assume you&#8217;ll just Google whatever parts I leave out.</p>
<h2>Prepare the carrots !!</h2>
<p>The first step is preparing the carrots. You&#8217;ll want to grate them so you have a good cup&#8217;s worth. If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;ll likely feel an overwhelming temptation to pose like Bugs Bunny first though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wanted to do that..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-dachshund-carrot-in-mouth.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3188" alt="dachshund with carrot " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-dachshund-carrot-in-mouth.jpg" width="567" height="403" /></a></p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re going to pose like Bugs Bunny, you at least have to munch on the end of a carrot like him, too!</p>
<p>(This is why you need extra carrots).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-eating-carrot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3189" alt="dachshunds love carrots" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-eating-carrot.jpg" width="542" height="810" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Prepare the rest</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">After you prepare the carrots, you need to prepare the rest of the stuff in your mixer bowl &#8211; including the white, brown and other stuff. They say measurements matter in cooking, but I&#8217;m a realist, so I don&#8217;t bother with that. I call it &#8216;free-ballin&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep in mind that the white stuff (flour) might make you sneeze, wherein it could potentially end up all over you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-baker-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3191" alt="Funny dachshund picture baker costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-baker-costume.jpg" width="544" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But that&#8217;s ok. Part of being a good cook is being able to get messy. As you know, I&#8217;m all about my image when I do certain activities so the fact I have flour all over my face just adds to the &#8216;baker&#8217; look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now as you saw in my last blog post with my new <a title="My Life in 6-Second Clips" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2013/02/06/dog-to-follow-on-vine/">Vine videos</a>, my posts are no longer just photo productions, but will now also feature my 6-second clips from <a href="http://vineapp.com/" target="_blank">Vine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So check out my below video clip on the first segment of our carrot cupcakes!</p>

<p>— Crusoe Dachshund (@Celeb_Dachshund) <a href="https://twitter.com/Celeb_Dachshund/status/301149230502916096">February 12, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had to take a pause after this for my &#8216;crew&#8217; to clean me up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You may also find that working in the kitchen gets pretty hot. I found it a nice relief to take off the big muffin hat I was wearing to cool off. Plus, Mum says I look super cute like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cutest-dachshund-picture.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3193" alt="cute dachshund picture costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cutest-dachshund-picture.jpg" width="547" height="810" /></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Put it in the muffin tray</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once you mix the batter, you can spoon it into the muffin tray. This one was a bit tricky for me to do myself, so I had Mum do it for me while I watched curiously.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m a very <a title="An Observant Dachshund" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/03/25/observant-dachshund/">observant dachshund</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/funny-doxie-baking.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3196" alt="funny dachshund baking cupcakes" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/funny-doxie-baking.jpg" width="549" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I usually watch Mum cook from the floor, so it was interesting to finally see things from counter-level. It should be like this more often now that Chef Crusoe is in the house though ; )</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Bake for 20 minutes</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next step is to bake them for about 20 minutes. Us dogs have a pretty good internal clock, so I said heck with the timer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-baker-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3197" alt="Dachshund Baker Cooking Costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-baker-costume.jpg" width="569" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like many other things in this house (which are under ongoing discussion), the oven wasn&#8217;t made to be at doxie eye-level, so I had to use this dinky stool to see in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Oh well, at least I could enjoy those sweet carrot cupcake aromas and be nice and warm while sitting there.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Add icing and serve</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The last step is to add the cream cheese icing and serve them. Supposedly it&#8217;s rude to eat one before you serve others, but hey, carrots and cheese &#8211; how could I resist?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m sure no one will notice that one has been nibbled on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-cupcakes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3198" alt="Dachshund Pupcakes " src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-cupcakes.jpg" width="567" height="394" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I just hope I don&#8217;t eat them all before I have a chance to serve them to some nice ladies on Valentine&#8217;s Day. Speaking of that, I should probably hide them from Dad, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope you enjoyed my cooking lesson for carrot cupcakes. I aim to provide you more with lessons on having fun in cooking rather than the beginner stuff of ingredients, measurements, and steps.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And oh, hope everyone has a very romantic Valentine&#8217;s Day tomorrow!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep free-ballin&#8217;,</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have recently taken to the new mobile app/social network called <a title="Vine App" href="http://vineapp.com/">Vine</a> by Twitter. You may have heard of it, but in case not it&#8217;s like Twitter but with looping 6-second video clips. Their tagline reads appropriately as: &#8220;make a scene&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway, as an internet celebrity I need to stay at the forefront of the social and digital space. Plus, I figured if people like seeing my life in photos they might also like it in 6-second clips.</p>
<p>In fact, here&#8217;s the moment where <del>Dad</del> my manager told me about Vine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Vine you say? <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dog">#dog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a title="http://vine.co/v/b1A5LBHMz6X" href="http://t.co/WYwfs5ld">vine.co/v/b1A5LBHMz6X</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how it works. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p><em>(If for some reason you don&#8217;t see the video, just click the Vine link).</em></p>
<p>So what else can I do with this? Well, for one, I can now show off my tricks! Below is my <a title="4th Annual Wiener Dog Race: Another Victory" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2011/09/18/4th-annual-wiener-dog-race-montreal/">award-winning trick</a> &#8211; <em>BANG! - </em>followed by my reward (hey, I don&#8217;t work for free).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>BANG! <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pets">#pets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dog">#dog</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23cute">#cute</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23loop">#loop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vine">#vine</a> <a title="http://vine.co/v/b1eY2MO5gAu" href="http://t.co/FlzJBrJg">vine.co/v/b1eY2MO5gAu</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now expectantly, once I take a step onto a new scene (pun intended), I&#8217;m sure you know who is close to follow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about my cute and clandestine alter-ego &#8211; <em>BATDOG!</em> Plus he rarely makes video appearances, so this is one to enjoy.</p>

<p>But BATDOG still loves to pose for still shots. He&#8217;s gotten pretty good at showing up at the right place and time to be caught on camera by the press (he&#8217;s one of the few superheros who&#8217;s mainly in it for the fame).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BATDOG.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3158" alt="BATDOG" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BATDOG.jpg" width="545" height="545" /></a></p>
<p>Then as we all know, this past weekend was the Superbowl.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a particular preference when it comes to sports, except <a title="Bahamas Vacation Part 1" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/11/22/wiener-dog-bahamas-vacation-part-1/">beach squeaky ball</a>, but as long as there&#8217;s a ball involved, you can consider me intrigued.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-watching-football.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3145" alt="wiener dog with football helmet" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/crusoe-watching-football.jpg" width="567" height="394" /></a></p>
<p>I find football is really inspiring to watch not only for all the cheerleaders, but for all the &#8216;victory dances&#8217; the players do when they get a touchdown.</p>
<p>I had to try for myself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my &#8216;intrepid baller&#8217; victory pose with my favorite type of <a title="Crusoe's Squeaky Balls for Sale" href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/store/#!/~/product/category=0&amp;id=18860208" target="_blank">squeaky ball</a> tucked under my paw.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wiener-dog-football-helmet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3147" alt="funny dog with football helmet" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wiener-dog-football-helmet.jpg" width="561" height="810" /></a></p>
<p>But wait &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t end there!</p>
<p>This is where the beauty of Vine comes in, as you can now <em>watch</em> me practicing my catches with my football helmet, not just see a picture of it. It&#8217;s worth noting that I hardly miss and would make a great wide receiver.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure I would be very good at football. I would probably cause a lot of offsides and delay-of-games, as I am very impatient when it comes to balls.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s me doing my impatient paw shuffle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vine has pretty much become like a real-time documentary on myself, but filmed in 6-second intervals. Now you probably know me well enough to know that this won&#8217;t include just ball-throwing and mild-mannered antics..</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, be ready to see the most intimate and personal side of Crusoe &#8211; even if that means on the toilet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now you can watch me do my business in video &#8211; not just with a photo! What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been up to lately. But don&#8217;t worry, my photos still come first so there will be no shortage of those. If you&#8217;d like to <a title="Follow Crusoe the Dachshund on Vine" href="vine://user/908958824822607872" target="_blank">follow me on Vine</a>, you can sign up with a Twitter account or even just an email. The <a title="Vine App" href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/vine-make-a-scene/id592447445" target="_blank">Vine app</a> is only available for iPhone right now though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting the best ones on my blog as well.</p>
<p>Also, I should probably mention that Vine is still working out some issues in terms of age-sensitive material, so I&#8217;d recommend you be an adult to join (for the time being at least).</p>
<p>So as a fan, what do you think of Vine?</p>
<p>Keep shufflin&#8217;,</p>
<p>~ Crusoe</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re probably skeptical of this post&#8217;s title, and I fully understand. You may not picture such a womanizing, egocentric, virile, and stud muffin of a dog to even have a feminine side &#8211; and I can assure you, I didn&#8217;t know about it myself until this past weekend.</p>
<p>It all started when Dad went away to visit some friends, leaving Mum and I to &#8216;fend for ourselves&#8217; (as she puts it). The first night together she kissed and caressed me into a slumber, wherein when I awoke she was doing my nails! I should have suspected this sort of female deception like Dad always taught me to watch out for..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pink-nails.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2994" alt="pink-nails" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/pink-nails.jpg" width="567" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I may have been sleepy, but I wasn&#8217;t impressed. Mum was quick to take this opportunity to convince me otherwise though.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She told me how the ladies like a guy who is in touch with his feminine side. It shows you&#8217;re comfortable with yourself, therefore building confidence (which I know chicks dig), and it also lets you &#8216;relate&#8217; to them more, making it easier to get closer with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Her reasoning seemed viable, especially if it results in an increase in my sex appeal (that&#8217;s always my endgame).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So from our weekend together I compiled a list of steps &#8211; <em>based on my own observations</em> &#8211; to help others explore their feminine side as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you&#8217;re a dude, you might want to write these down..</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 1: spend hours looking at and admiring yourself in a mirror.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This one is absolutely no problem for me. I had been meaning to ask Mum to put a mirror down to floor-level anyway. Like what the heck? The one celebrity in the house doesn&#8217;t even have an eye-level mirror?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-in-mirror.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2998" alt="Dachshund Looking at himself in mirror" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-in-mirror.jpg" width="630" height="468" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If this was all I had to do to get in touch with my feminine side, then heck &#8211; call me a woman! (But seriously, don&#8217;t).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 2: weigh yourself often</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Mum says it&#8217;s not about weighing &#8216;less&#8217; and that it&#8217;s about weighing a &#8216;healthy&#8217; amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also see eye to eye with her on this one. Being a celebrity and an athlete, I have to watch my figure while still building muscle mass. So ya, I&#8217;ve used a scale a few times before..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-on-a-scale.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2999" alt="Healthy dachshund weight" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-on-a-scale.jpg" width="630" height="457" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I usually weigh between 11 to 13 pounds, depending on how much I&#8217;ve been working out.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 3: take a lot of candle-lit bubble baths</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll admit, I didn&#8217;t observe this from Mum but it is my basic understanding that women like to take a lot of bubble baths with candles. I guess it helps with relaxation and self-reflection?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, I figured I&#8217;d give it a try.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-taking-bath.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3000" alt="Wiener Dog Taking a Bath" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dachshund-taking-bath.jpg" width="630" height="436" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I don&#8217;t think I really got the gist of this one, because the whole time I only wanted to play with my ball.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Throw a few chicks in here and then talk to me about relaxation!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, taking a bath also means a good photo opportunity, which I can never pass up. So Mum (somehow) figured out Dad&#8217;s GoPro camera and was able to snap a few shots of me underwater.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&#8217;s a profile shot of me throwing a pose underwater.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/underwater-crusoe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3005" alt="dachshund underwater photo" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/underwater-crusoe.jpg" width="630" height="472" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The thing about women is that they&#8217;re always secretly throwing a pose. The trick is to always act like someone&#8217;s watching. You&#8217;ll be amazed at how much better you look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 4: sun tanning is important</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yes, yes it is. Here&#8217;s another one I&#8217;m already an expert at. In fact, I think most dogs out there are probably pretty good at this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-sleeping.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3003" alt="wiener dog sleeping cute" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cute-wiener-dog-sleeping.jpg" width="623" height="900" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But do you know what&#8217;s wrong with this photo?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;m wearing my collar. That means tan lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 5: take care of your skin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chicks like to put a lot of skin cream on to stay smooth and smelling nice. I&#8217;m not too big on this one, but once in a while I get a nice facial to rejuvenate my pores and and make my fur nice and shiny.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-facial-treatment.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3010" alt="Dog facial treatment" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dog-facial-treatment.jpg" width="582" height="810" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Step 5: don&#8217;t be afraid to get dressed up all fancy-like</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">A good way to get in touch with your feminine side is to get all &#8216;fancied up&#8217;. Women are creatures of beauty, after all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So here&#8217;s me, all dressed up by Mum, looking like miss Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/red-riding-hood.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3011" alt="Cute red riding hood dog outfit" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/red-riding-hood.jpg" width="630" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Like I said on <a href="http://facebook.com/crusoedachshund" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, at least I was nice and warm that day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So those are my observations on how to get in touch with your feminine side. I didn&#8217;t realize it until now, but it turns out I&#8217;m<em> already</em> pretty in touch with my feminine side. In fact, maybe that<em> is</em> why the ladies dig me so much. I never looked at it this way before, but now that I do, it makes sense.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So fans, did I miss anything? If you have any other tips for hookin&#8217; up with your feminine side, drop them in the comments!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep bubble-bathin&#8217;,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I may already have an immaculate smile, but even I have to go the the dentist now and then.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve decided that I won&#8217;t go to the <em>vet</em> for my dental work and checkups like &#8216;regular&#8217; dogs anymore. I find the atmosphere very stressful at the vet, and also very lacking in the comfort and entertainment department for a celebrity as well. I&#8217;d like to watch a little <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/" target="_blank">Animal Planet</a> or something while I&#8217;m getting my teeth cleaned at least. And I&#8217;d much prefer to sit in one of those comfy dental chairs rather than be pinned down to a cold metal table.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-at-the-vet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2847" alt="Dachshund at the VET" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-at-the-vet.jpg" width="623" height="415" /></a></p>
<p>So this past week I insisted that Mum and Dad take me to one of your &#8216;human dentists&#8217;. When they called for the appointment, the dental office said they don&#8217;t usually accept dogs but that they would make an exception for me.</p>
<p>(As I expected.)</p>
<p>I was quite impressed when I got there. For one thing there wasn&#8217;t even one fat lazy cat in sight! I never liked those sauntering felines that hang around the vet&#8217;s office like they own the place&#8230; always seeming to mock me somehow.</p>
<p>Anyway, once the hygienist led me to the room she had me sit in the big chair. I&#8217;ll admit, I was a little nervous at first, always glancing back to see what she was doing and what sharp tool she might be pulling out of her drawer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dogs-trip-to-dentist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2848" alt="Dachshund at the Dentist" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dogs-trip-to-dentist.jpg" width="630" height="429" /></a></p>
<p>She checked me with a mirror and a little pointy stick to which I have no idea what it&#8217;s called. It wasn&#8217;t so bad though, because I was just concentrating on the TV screen above her head which was playing an episode of <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/too-cute-kittens" target="_blank">Too Cute</a> from Animal Planet (where one of my photos appears at the end!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-teeth-dentist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2849" alt="Crusoe's trip to the dentist" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-teeth-dentist.jpg" width="608" height="411" /></a></p>
<p>That is until she told me that I had a couple stains on some of my teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what?&#8221; I demanded, to which she just said it can sometimes happen, and that it&#8217;s very hard to remove. She then went so far as to say I may not brush my teeth enough..</p>
<p>I was insulted not by the fact that she thinks my teeth are not clean enough (well, partly that) but mostly because she thinks I brush <em>my own</em> teeth! I have people to do that for me, thank you very much. So that&#8217;s when I concluded that this lady was a quack and that she doesn&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s talking about. She continued blabbing about something, but after that the only thing I heard coming from her mouth were noises ducks make.</p>
<p>I decided to take matters into my own <del>hands</del> paws, and in doing so told the hygienist I would not be requiring her services any further.</p>
<p>My plan was to do my own dental work just using a mirror, but maybe this was a bit ambitious. So I told Mum to hop up on the chair and that I would practice on her before doing myself. She refused at first, but didn&#8217;t delay for long once I gave her my <a title="One Grumpy Wiener.." href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/2012/02/22/grumpy-wiener-dog/">grumpy wiener</a> stare.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dog-dentist-costume.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2856" alt="dachshund dentist costume" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dog-dentist-costume.jpg" width="630" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>It was nice to be on the other side of the mask for once. I had to revel in the moment for a few seconds&#8230; while flexing of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/doggy-dentist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2853" alt="Doggy Dentist" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/doggy-dentist.jpg" width="630" height="426" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem quickly arose that I couldn&#8217;t hold on to any of the damn tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This was very frustrating, and it didn&#8217;t help that Mum found this to be funny. So I did what most dogs would do to clean her teeth (and to wipe that smirk off her face)..</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cleaning-dog-teeth.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2859" alt="dachshund cleaning teeth" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cleaning-dog-teeth.jpg" width="630" height="473" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So that worked well, and was much easier than using those dinky little tools. I don&#8217;t know why more dentists don&#8217;t use this technique..</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But the final test was analyzing Mum&#8217;s x-ray results.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dachshund-x-ray-exam.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2863" alt="dachshund xray exam" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dachshund-x-ray-exam.jpg" width="552" height="389" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After careful examination, my professional opinion was that her teeth looked awfully long in this photo &#8211; and that they should be shortened. I&#8217;ll be sure to recommend that to the dentist here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-dentist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2874" alt="Dr. Dachshund" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/dachshund-dentist.jpg" width="567" height="407" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I guess I&#8217;m a pretty good dentist after all. I knew it couldn&#8217;t be <em>that</em> hard, but I still decided I&#8217;ll practice on Mum a few more times before I try on myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And since my visit to the dentist, Dad has been on a strict schedule to brush my teeth every night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/crusoe-foto-friday-smiling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2864" alt="dachshund smiling" src="http://www.celebritydachshund.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/crusoe-foto-friday-smiling.jpg" width="567" height="568" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;d say I have a pretty good smile, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Keep brushin&#8217;,</p>
