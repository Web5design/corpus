			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/" target="_blank">Meat Free Week</a>, Day 2. As promised, I&#8217;m uploading a meat-free pasta dish which I tried out a few times last week; <strong>Rustic Mushroom, White Wine and Creamy Cheesy Spaghetti ~ </strong><a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/recipes/rustic-mushroom-white-wine-and-creamy-cheesy-spaghetti/" target="_blank">Recipe here</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I&#8217;ll be frank ~ this recipes isn&#8217;t exactly going to do you huge favours in the bikini department but it&#8217;s not <em>too</em> bad calorie-wise &#8230; The flip-side for me too is it&#8217;s not the most attractive dish in the world either to shoot from a food photographers point-of-view as it all tends to look a tad &#8216;beige&#8217; but it tastes great, is nice and &#8216;beefy&#8217; yet you don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s lacking the heartiness of meat. It&#8217;s basically a robust mushroom recipes using flavour-packed Swiss Brown and Shiitake mushrooms, creamy goat&#8217;s cheese and toasted pecans. Very easy to make too, throw the mushrooms into a food processor if you like along with the herbs ~ I find chopping mushrooms (and herbs) a bit of a nightmare on a flat board as they annoyingly tend to fly absolutely everywhere; worktop, floor, all over the shop (personally it drives me bananas).</p>
<p>It dawned on me today I will be unable to update the blog tomorrow with the pizza recipe I was planning, so I&#8217;m going to stick it up tonight too. A double veggo whammy. The pizza is my <strong>Roasted Pumpkin, Goat’s Cheese, Rosemary and Toasted Almond Pizza</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/recipes/roasted-pumpkin-goats-cheese-rosemary-and-toasted-almond-pizza/" target="_blank">Recipe here</a><strong>. </strong> It&#8217;s fab! You&#8217;d definitely not miss eating meat with this pizza as the roasted pumpkin give superb meaty-like texture, the goat&#8217;s cheese is a slightly-salty-ish creamy addition and the nuts offer lots of crunch and balance to the other ingredients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4460" title="Picture 3_3" src="http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Picture-3_31.png" alt="" width="310" height="220" /></p>
<p>Right, now down to the <strong>EXTRA</strong> exciting news and something which threw me a tad this morning&#8230; Today I found out I have been nominated for not one, but <strong><em>two</em></strong> <a href="http://www.jamesbeard.org/awards" target="_blank">James Beard 2013</a> finalist nominations! It&#8217;s all <strong><em>Wooohoooo</em></strong> here at the WKA household today and that&#8217;s been mixed with a good helping of complete shock/disbelief, but all-in-all I&#8217;ve had a rather large grin plastered on my face for most of the day <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Am thrilled and super excited, these occasions don&#8217;t come along that much in life, so when they do, you&#8217;ve got to grab them with both hands and go along for the ride.</p>
<p>The categories nominated are in the cookbook section:</p>
<p>Best Photography<br />
<em>and</em><br />
Best General Cooking Cookbook</p>
<p>All the nominations can be found here: http://www.jamesbeard.org/sites/default/files/static/additional/2013-jbf-nominees.pdf. Congrats too to all the people nominated in this year&#8217;s finalist list.</p>
<p>Hopefully, all going to plan, even thought it&#8217;s early days still, I&#8217;ll try and head over to NYC to attend the award ceremony on May 3rd, so I&#8217;ll keep you posted on any possibly book signings I can organise. On that note, I would be keen to find out from anyone stateside &#8211; esp. in NYC if that many of you would be keen for me to organise something where I can meet up with you all, maybe share a glass of wine and do a book signing? Let me know below if you can, that would be fab.</p>
<p>Cheers Kx</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4419" title="Print" src="http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/logo1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="725" /></p>
<p>This week sees the start of <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/" target="_blank">Meat Free Week</a> in Australia. Clearly from a lot of my recipes, I am a meat-eater but I promote strongly that we all support factory-free farming as I whole-heartedly believe we should only ever buy free-range eggs, poultry, pork and other meats. Whilst I personally am ok with eating meat, I don&#8217;t think you should do so unless you are committed to making sure the animals are well treated and you are aware where your meat is coming from. I thought taking on a challenge of eating for a full week without any meat in my diet, interesting and something different too, so that&#8217;s exactly what myself and my husband Mick are doing today, and for the next 7 days.</p>
<p>The message from the founders of Meat Free Week is not about suddenly becoming a vegetarian or giving up meat for life. All they are asking is that you give up meat for one week from the 18th to 24th March and ask some buddies (friends, family, work colleagues) to sponsor you for each day you go without. Or if you can and would like to, make a donation on the <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/donate" target="_blank">Meat Free Week website directly</a> to support factory-free farming.</p>
<p>Why are they asking you to do this? Simply because the organisers and supporters of <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/" target="_blank">Meat Free Week</a> would love you to think about the amount of meat you eat and most importantly, where that meat comes from.</p>
<p>Today I am uploading two recipes which feature in my current book ~ the superb <strong>Jill&#8217;s Veggie Roll</strong>, a spinach, ricotta and feta pastry dish which I originally sourced from a friend of mine, and also a fool-proof, easy-peasy <strong>Eggplant and Roasted Capsicum</strong> (red bell pepper) <strong>Relish</strong> which I make a lot here to pair with cheeses or to use in sandwiches.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find a loads of great meat-free recipes on the MFW <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/recipes" target="_blank">organisation&#8217;s website here</a> and as an <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/Chefs" target="_blank">official supporter</a> I&#8217;ve spent the past few days testing a load of veggie/meat-free recipes for the weeks &#8216;challenge&#8217; and I will be uploading one per day for the next 7 days on WKA. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll have a wonderful <strong>Mushroom, White Wine and Creamy Cheesy Spaghetti</strong> dinner idea, and Wednesday sees a super <strong>Roasted Pumpkin, Goat&#8217;s Cheese, Rosemary and Toasted Almond Pizza</strong>. There will also be another pasta and wonderful salad ideas towards the end of the week, culminating is a great 3 course entertaining menu for a weekend with friends which I&#8217;ll put up on Saturday morning. I veer towards coming up with recipes which are meat-free but where you really don&#8217;t notice texturally there is no meat, so I&#8217;ve tried to write and test recipes which have a nice hearty feel to them and which have good texture contrasts and layers.</p>
<p>For more info on Meat Free Week and their message and also to read about what really goes on in factory farming, you can check out their site <a href="https://meatfreeweek.com/animals" target="_blank">here</a>. Let me know in the comments box below what you think of the recipes each day and if you decided to take the plunge yourself and go meat-free for even a few days.</p>
<p>Thanks! Katie x</p>

<p>Hello all! I have been wanting to get a post up on the blog for some time now, but alas the last week went <strong>bananas</strong> for me work-wise after I took the week off previous to go to Melbourne. Sadly it seems now when I take time off it equates to the following week going haywire what with trying to catch up on work and mails and a gazillion other bits and pieces&#8230; I am going to quickly post this new recipe up now, but I&#8217;ll be back later <del datetime="2013-03-04T21:28:26+00:00">this</del> (now) Thursday afternoon with lots of amazing news regarding the book going on sale finally in the UK and Ireland, and a run-down on my week away in Melbourne and some links and ideas from places we ate ate over the week ~ and boy did we give the restaurants a good nudge down there, I think I came back 10 kilos heavier! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />  Hence why I am running out the door now to go to the gym! </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back in a bit with some more pics and restaurant links etc. </p>
<p>Until then x</p>

<p><strong>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day</strong> to all the lovey-dovey WKA readers out there all around the globe! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  *Note I have no clue how to do those love heart symbols which every, single, other, person on the <strong>entire</strong> planet knows how to type <em>other</em> than <strong>me</strong>&#8230; *_* (Hints on a postcard please? ~ tks!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I rarely celebrate this holiday (it&#8217;s just never really appealed to me) but I know a lot do so here are a few pasta recipes just in case you&#8217;re thinking to wine and dine your loved one at home ~ or just looking for something nice to muster up over the coming weekend&#8230;</p>
<p>Today also sees the on-sale date of <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/delicious/" target="_blank">my March feature in Delicious mag Aus</a> ~ and as ever it&#8217;s on sale at Zinio (<a href="http://au.zinio.com/browse/publications/index.jsp?productId=500646430&amp;categoryId=cat1960018" target="_blank">link here</a>). Am super chuffed to get a second cover in. a. row. (!) *happy dance*.. <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  I particularly loved this one as it&#8217;s all things&#8230; Italian ~ aka my favourite food on the planet! All recipes are available in this month&#8217;s Delicious mag but I&#8217;m uploading one here to WKA, which I exceptionally loved cooking for the shoot.</p>
<p>I am off to Melbourne tomorrow for 5 nights to mainly chill out and celebrate my wedding anniversary (ahhh!) and also experience some AMAZING food ~ note I am dining at the iconic <a href="http://www.vuedemonde.com.au/vue_de_monde" target="_blank">Vue du Monde</a> on Tuesday (= excitement overload!) and I am very much looking forward to it as well as some other great bookings I&#8217;ve made at places I have wanted to try out for yonks, but have never been organised enough in time to book and get a table&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have the camera with me, so I will take some snaps of the 5 or so days away and post late next week.</p>
<p>Until then, hope you all have a very &#8216;rosemantic&#8217; day, as we say in Dublin&#8217;s fair city&#8230;.</p>
<p>xx</p>

<p>I just got this recipe is up in time for anyone reading in the northern hemisphere, but alas maybe not for anyone in Oz ~ who are all now probably rolling around their sitting rooms and kitchens reeling from ingesting way too much egg, flour and milk overload! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This is a recipe from my book and features my favourite form of pancake ~ aka the thinner &#8216;crêpe&#8217; variety. I used to love eating and making these as a kid with simple caster sugar and lemon juice, my mum was an amazing crêpe maker and flipper. This is my recipe for <em>Buttermilk crêpes with citrus compote</em>. Feel free to use plums or peaches instead of citrus fruits if you like.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be back on Thursday evening with 4-5 great homemade pasta recipes, before I am off to marvellous Melbourne for a week on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Until Thursady&#8230;. Happy flipping! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>So this weekend just gone we celebrated Australia Day 2013, meaning we all got a day off too yesterday at the holiday fell on a Saturday ~ Woohoo! In fairness I didn&#8217;t get much time off as I was photographing and writing up all the recipes for the above all weekend, but I didn&#8217;t mind, it was rotten weather over most of the long weekend with buckets of rain falling from the skies in Sydney so staying at home, cooking and photographing suited me just fine. The rain also gave us a slight reprieve from the searing temps here and awful humidity ~ us pastry white Irish folk literally melt in the latter esp. minus air con! *bleurgh*</p>
<p>I really wanted to get these recipes up <em>before</em> Australia day but alas due to a rather hectic work schedule last week and the week before, it was not meant to be. That being said though, all these recipes are ones which you can make at any time and all ingredients are readily available in both the southern and northern hemisphere at this time of the year.</p>
<p>I have been meaning to rectify my now infamous &#8216;Katie&#8217;s 47˚C pavlova-gate fiasco&#8217; from a few weeks ago and due to writing some pav. recipes recently for an Aussie mag, I thought it would be a good idea to give another one a bash for this round of blog recipes. This isn&#8217;t the actual same recipe from the one which imploded so dramatically (still wishing I took a pic) rather this one contains a very Aussie candy/sweet item &#8211; honeycomb, and it is mixed with chocolate and almond ~ you could almost call it a &#8216;Toblerone Pavlova&#8217; but with the addition of cherries which are now coming to the end of their season here in Aus, so I thought it would be to get them while I still can and before the go to a gazillion dollars per kilo.</p>
<p>This post also see the introduction of some recipes from last year&#8217;s Australian Masterchef runner up; <a href="http://juliataylor.com.au/" target="_blank">Julia Taylor</a>. Julia was famed on the show for her passionate pastry chef interest and skills in this realm of cooking. An immensely creative, perfectionist and determined cook, she&#8217;s currently completing an internship at famed Aussie patisserie mastermind and pastry God; Adriano Zumbo. I look forward to featuring more of Julia recipes on WKA in the months which lie ahead, she&#8217;s going to be a big name I think in years to come in Australia, people with such drive, eye for detail and perfectionist streak rarely fail.</p>
<p>On Friday I&#8217;ll be announcing the winner of ~ what is possibly <strong>the</strong> most popular book giveaway of all my book giveaways on WKA; Claire Lloyd&#8217;s My Greek Island Home (<a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/a-sydney-scorcher-and-a-gorgeous-book-giveaway/" target="_blank">link here</a>) so you&#8217;ve got 3 more days to get your answers in and I&#8217;ll pick a winner on Friday eve my time. The book arrived from Penguin last week, so is sitting here ready to go out in the post.</p>
<p>My next post is a huge one featuring all things pasta. If there&#8217;s any particular pasta dish you&#8217;d like to see included please let me know by commenting below.</p>
<p>Until then, and a few quick recipes for weekday dinners in-between, I hope you enjoy the above recipes and pics <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Cheers Katie x</p>

<p>Happy Friday everyone! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Delighted to announce that the February edition of Delicious Magazine is out on sale now ~ with one of my pics on the cover! <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  It&#8217;s a great &#8216;all things Aussie&#8217; edition, just in time for Australia Day on the 26th. I&#8217;ll be doing a post and uploading next week with lots of ideas for what to eat on Saturday week to celebrate everything Aussie. Until then here&#8217;s a recipe from my Feb editorial which is all based around food ideas for a Summer picnic either at a location in a park or the beach or alternatively in the comfort of your own back garden. On of the recipes featured is my <strong>Apple and Blackberry Bars with Hazelnut Crumble topping</strong> ~ for which you can find the <a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/recipes/apple-blackberry-bars-with-hazelnut-crumble/" target="_blank">recipe here</a>.</p>
<p>For all my other recipes from this month&#8217;s edition (which you can read a little more about <a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/monthlyfeats/february-2013-picnic-food/" target="_blank">here</a>) grab a copy of <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/delicious/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> from your local Aussie newsagent or ~ as usual, for anyone not in OZ, <a href="http://au.zinio.com/browse/publications/index.jsp?productId=500646430&amp;categoryId=cat1960018" target="_blank">you can get a subscription here</a>. The fish tacos are fab and were a recipe I have wanted to feature on WKA for some time as I adore them and cook them all the time here at home for weekday dinners, healthy and super tasty. On day like today in Sydney (44˚C ~ ouch!) the <strong>Fruity Summer Cooler</strong> is a super idea to help cool off at the end of the day, along with my <strong>Chilli and Lime Aussie King Prawns with Smokey Chipotle Pepper Mayo</strong>. There&#8217;s also my <strong>Lemon Drizzle Friands</strong> which, thanks to the Delicious website you can find the recipe for <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/delicious/article/people/curtis+stones+lamingtons+and+katie+quinn+davies+friands,1715" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Wishing you all a wonderful weekend x</p>
<p><strong>P.S. A little update on the British and Irish expat picnic story, thanks to everyone who has contacted me, I haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. I will be in touch, a few commercial jobs have popped up for me and I am having to juggle dates around. I will make an announcement about what the go is with that in the next week. Thanks again.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tamari and Ginger Chicken with Nori Seaweed and Black Sesame Rice</strong> ~ <a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/recipes/tamari-and-ginger-marinaded-chicken-thighs-with-nori-seaweed-and-sesame-rice/" target="_blank">Recipe here</a></p>
<p>Last night I went out for dinner at one of my favourite local restaurants ~ <a href="http://lovefish.com.au/" target="_blank">Love.Fish</a>. I&#8217;ve written about this Sydney restaurant before a year or two ago (<a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/love-fish/" target="_blank">here</a>). It&#8217;s a super little local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozelle,_New_South_Wales" target="_blank">Rozelle</a> restaurant which is doing a roaring business since it opened its doors 2 years ago, almost to the day. As mentioned on the blog yesterday it was crazy warm here in Sydney, it hit 42˚C and was still 36˚C at 11.30pm, so we felt it was a good night to get out and into some air con! I must add though mind you compared to what some other poor souls are going through around OZ with the awful bush fires which come at this time of the year, every year in Australia, I really can&#8217;t complain as I have it good compared to some people who are not as fortunate right now and struggling to keep their homes and animals safe.</p>
<p><em>On that note, as I mentioned on the blog in 2010 this is an awful time for Australia&#8217;s wildlife, if you have a spare $ or two, please consider donating something to the RSPCA to help the animals being burnt and injured in the bush fires &#8211; esp. in Tasmania which has been very badly hit. You can donate here at the <a href="http://www.rspca.org.au/how-you-can-help/campaigns/tas-bushfires/" target="_blank">RSPCA website</a>. Thanks.</em></p>
<p>Tamari is a milder and more aromatic version of soy sauce. It&#8217;s fab for dressings and is not as salty as regular soy sauce meaning you can use more of it in cooking and sprinkled over cooked foods. Other than a continually changing selection of daily specials <a href="http://lovefish.com.au/" target="_blank">Love.Fish</a> is based upon the premise of providing simply grilled fillets of varied fish which you pair with a selection of salads and sides. One of my faves is their super simple &#8216;Steamed basmati rice with Tamari and Black Sesame&#8217; which I ordered last night. These two ingredients pair so well together and I found myself gobbling down a whole bowl of the this rice dish. I thought it would make for a nice side to pair with marinaded chicken as a recipe for the blog and it turned out great. The chicken is marinaded in fresh ginger, garlic, tamari, lemon juice and brown sugar and it provides a lovely sticky chicken which is sweet and sour with a little salty kick from the tamari. A great quick and easy option (once the chicken has been marinated) for a weekday dinner option.</p>
<p>BTW keep the comments coming on yesterday&#8217;s book giveaway post &#8211; some of the comments have been so amazing to read through, great food for thought for me for my European trip later this year and this book is SO worth winning. <a href="http://www.whatkatieate.com/a-sydney-scorcher-and-a-gorgeous-book-giveaway/" target="_blank">Link here.</a></p>

<p>Summer has officially arrived in Sydney, it&#8217;s currently 42˚C ~ I&#8217;m not kidding&#8230; it&#8217;s a day for not doing much and trying to stay cool. It also makes for a perfect day to get new recipes up on the blog and these are ones which I cooked recently for some new friends which we had over at the house just after Christmas (more about them a little later on in the post).</p>
<p>I love this time of the year here as like with anywhere in the world during summertime, it offers you great opportunities for outside eating and entertaining, plus it&#8217;s so much easier to eat a lighter and more healthy diet I find. Anyone who has my book or has followed the blog for a while knows that I love experimenting with salads and seeing what does/doesn&#8217;t work. Today I&#8217;m sticking up two new salad recipes ~ one of which I made for this aforementioned dinner to pair with some simply marinaded organic lamb cutlets (I always find it best to not muck around too much with beautiful, organic meat) and the other is a new recipe I tried out over the past weekend. Both can be served on their own, although the cous cous one does really need to be paired with a meat or fish as it&#8217;s not quite substantial enough to serve fully out-right, if you did want to turn it into more of a weeknight or weekend &#8216;meal&#8217; you could add some sliced chicken. Simply marinade the chicken in some oil, lemon juice and harissa paste for an hour or so, then BBQ and slice, the flavour of the chicken will pair with excellently all the other ingredients.</p>
<p>The other salad is a sort of &#8216;Asian-style&#8217; beef noodle salad interpretation. It&#8217;s got amazing texture and very tasty and light. Perfect to serve as an outdoor Sunday lunch dish with some chilled white wine or cold Japanese beer.</p>
<p>Before Christmas I was invited to a dinner party at the (gorgeous) apartment of my friend and publisher; Julie Gibbs. Julie was throwing a pre-Xmas dinner for some friends and authors and I was delighted to have been asked to join them. It was a superb night, great, great fun, amazing food and wonderful company. Julie cooked everything herself and it was all divine, especially her show-stopping dessert ~ a towering blueberry pavlova featuring layers of meringue with lemon curd and caramelised hazelnuts, it was incredible.</p>
<p>At the party I met the author of one of the most beautiful books I have seen this year ~ <a href="http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9781921382581/my-greek-island-home" target="_blank">My Greek Island Home</a> which is written and photographed by the most exquisite Claire Lloyd. Claire ~ is a virtual walking creative powerhouse ~ she&#8217;s a creative director, film maker, photographer and author. Claire moved to London from Sydney in 1983 after two and a half years at Australian Vogue. Since then, she has enjoyed a career in magazines, film, books and property. She has worked either as art director or contributing editor on a variety of magazines; fashion, lifestyle, and interiors.</p>
<p>Now Claire lives what most of us would consider an ultimate dream life ~ in a beautiful house on the Greek Island of Lesvos with her partner <a href="http://www.matthewusmarlauder.com/" target="_blank">Matthew</a> who is an artist and more importantly a super warm, incredibly funny and friendly guy. Together they are some of the most super people I have met in recent years. Sadly they are back to Greece in January so I decided I had to invite them over for a casual Friday night dins at our place before they left. We had a ball along with lots and lots of great Aussie wine. I am sad to see them go. But there will be a next time. You can read all about Claire on her <a href="http://clairelloydloves.com/" target="_blank">blog here</a> and <a href="http://clairelloyd.com/" target="_blank">website here</a>. And not forgetting also on the <a href="http://www.penguin.com.au/lantern/authors/claire-lloyd" target="_blank">Penguin website here.</a> Matthew&#8217;s site is <a href="http://www.matthewusmarlauder.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>My Greek Island Home is really so very beautiful. I haven&#8217;t been able to put it down since Julie handed me a copy in early December. The photography is really stunning and Claire writes in such a gorgeous manner that you really to know her as she is so open are warm in her writing and tone. The photos are raw and real, natural and candid, there&#8217;s no pretension in this book, it&#8217;s a subtle and elegant look at Claire&#8217;s life over the years and now with Matthew in Greece, and all the rescue pussy cats and dogs they have opened their home to <img src='http://www.whatkatieate.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  If you can get your hands on a copy I promise you won&#8217;t regret it, it would make for a beautiful gift too. Of all the books I have come across this year (and there have been a lot!) this is without a doubt one of my most treasured.</p>

<p>On an end-note and just quickly I thought I&#8217;d add, on Sunday just gone I did something I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for years ~ go on a tall ship on Sydney Harbour&#8230; For ages this is something I&#8217;ve had a hankering to do and God it was worth the wait. Utterly amazing! If you ever find yourself visiting Sydney or live here do yourself a favour and get out on one of these stunning ships on a gorgeous sunny day, it&#8217;s a wonderful experience. My husband Mick organised this for me out of the blue the other day and the two of us headed down to Campbell&#8217;s Cove on the harbour on Sunday morning and boarded the <a href="http://www.sydneytallships.com.au/our-fleet.html" target="_blank">&#8216;Soren Larsen&#8217;</a> tall ship for a 2 hour champagne brunch cruise. It was fab! Such an amazing way to spend a gorgeous day out on Sydney Harbour. The ticket price included food and unlimited beer, wine or champagne. The food was basic but perfect, very tasty and was free-flowing as were the drinks at the bar. You never wanted for anything. The staff were wonderful too. <a href="http://www.sydneytallships.com.au" target="_blank">Info is all here</a> if you&#8217;re interested in doing the same or going on one of their evening dinner cruises.</p>
