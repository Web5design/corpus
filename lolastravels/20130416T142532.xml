				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">OH Louis, how i LOVE thee!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-10-e1365895359180.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7213" alt="photo 3-10" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-10-e1365895359180.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i’ll be honest, i didn’t leave much room in my bags for purchases. c’mon, i was going for 30 days to Europe and i wanted/needed to look good. that meant lots of options and i wasn’t going to leave that up to shopping days. in reality, there were 2 days in all of the 30 days that were lent to some shopping time. anything else was a stumbled upon type of thing. it was the least shopped travel experience i can remember and the truth is i don’t even shop that much when traveling. PS &#8211; i didn’t miss it either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the things i bought i can practically count on one hand. a FAB poncho in Milan. a handbag in Positano. costumes in Barcelona. (yes, that) a fur scarf in Burgundy. a sweater &amp; boots in Paris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">and then there was one, iconic, impressive, important and expensive purchase. one i hadn’t planned on making. it may be that i bought next to nothing in 30 days and had intended on buying many things (like gold charms for my charm bracelet) that influenced this purchase. i like to think it was an “in the moment” situation. something i couldn’t pass up. something presented to me in such a way i could not say no. that would be a sign of true salesmanship and guess what, it was!</p>
<div id="attachment_7212" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-2-4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7212" alt="photo 2-4" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-2-4.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bonjour Mr. DiCaprio i mean Kevin</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kevin, aka personal shopper to the rich and famous at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.louisvuitton.eu/front/#/eng_E1/Louis-Vuitton-Homepage"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Louis Vuitton</span></a> </span>Paris, could not have been a better match for me. he looks like a more handsome version of Leonardo DiCaprio and knows the history of the fine leathers of Louis Vuitton like the back of his hand(bag). <img src='http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  HELLO&#8230;what’s not to love with all of that?! you may be wondering how i ended up with Kevin’s assistance that day. sheer luck and the fact that every sales associate was busy and Kevin didn’t have an appointment at that time. LUCKY ME!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i was traveling with my travel partner in crime, <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.leahtravels.com"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Leah</span></a></span><span style="color: #000000;">, as you probably recall.</span> we were dared to go into Louis Vuitton, check out some bags, take photos smelling the leather and then leave. first of all, you cannot take photos in the store. secondly, we have no willpower. this magical purchase started with Leah asking to see that bag, oh, and that one too. what about that one over there? and soon enough Kevin was pulling out a secret stash of bags that weren’t up on the wall. that’s when it happened. when i FELL IN LOVE. there was one bag screaming out at me to try on. so i did and that was it. it was decided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kevin explained that the graphic logo which is synonymous with the Louis Vuitton brand didn’t exist in Louis’ lifetime. in fact, it was a tribute to Louis from his son George on the fourth anniversary of his father’s death. the flowers that make up the monogrammed canvas are symbolic of George’s father’s deep religious roots and love of Asian art. another tidbit Kevin shared is that every bag is made with one single piece of leather.</p>
<div id="attachment_7211" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 487px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-121.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7211" alt="French champers sil vous plait" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-121.jpg" width="477" height="477" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">French champers sil vous plait</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">after we each decided on our bags, Kevin decided to give us a little VIP tour of the flagship store located on Champs-Elysees in Paris. as we walked the different floors he explained that you were meant not to notice that you were changing floors. the store just flows. everything has a point and a purpose. the thoughtfulness, care and craftsmanship is evident in everything. such amazing pride makes Louis Vuitton so exquisite. Kevin’s love for the brand and the information he shared only solidified my favorite purchase of a Louis Vuitton bag. it didn’t hurt that when excused himself to go wrap our purchases he brought us a glass of Veuve Clicquot to enjoy in the women’s shoe department. when he returned with our packages he had with him Ludovic, head of the concierge team, to also greet us in case we ever needed anything more. talk about service &#8211; TRES FAB!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Louis Vuitton was founded in 1854 and, consecutively every year since 1996, Louis Vuitton has been named the world’s most valuable luxury brand. YES the price tag stung but it’s a purchase i will never forget OR regret. i carry my LV bag practically every day and it is timeless. plus, purchasing it in France costs less than if i had bought the same bag in the USA. *BONUS* don’t forget your VAT tax ladies!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MERCI dear Kevin for giving me a day and a handbag that i truly amour!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">XO &#8211; lola</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a state slogan like VACATIONLAND you know that Lola likes Maine. Kennebunkport is an hour and half north of Boston in Southern Maine. A perfect place to go for a &#8216;One Day Stay&#8217;. Here you will find arts &amp; entertainment and pristine beaches plus fun places to shop, dine and drink.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.visitmaine.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7165" alt="Cape Porpoise harbor" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cape-Porpoise-harbor-1024x685.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DROP YOUR BAG</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.captainfairfield.com/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7161" alt="captain fairfield" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-4-31.jpg" width="540" height="540" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.captainfairfield.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Captain Fairfield Inn</span></a></span>, a cool 9 guest room boutique bed and breakfast, is located</span> in the heart of historic Kennebunkport, Maine. In a quiet neighborhood overlooking the river green and one block from the Kennebunk River and lively Kennebunkport harbor, this beautiful home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Captain Fairfield Inn was built in 1813 and will celebrate its 200th anniversary this year. One of the things I love most about this inn is its mindfulness to the historic charm of this Federal mansion yet breathing NEW LIFE into it with a modern twist in decor. <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.larkhotels.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Lark Hotels</span></a></span>, the innovative hotel company that owns Captain Fairfield, also just launched a unique partnership with lifestyle brand, Vineyard Vines. They are collaborating together to create designer suites within the Lark Hotels group. Captain Fairfield has the very first of these suites now available. The idea is to infuse a mix of coastal preppy chic with modern &amp; playful touches. I can&#8217;t wait to return so I can experience this one-of-a-kind VV beach vibe! Complete with deluxe amenities, a fantastic locally sourced gourmet breakfast &amp; a wine tasting room, Captain Fairfield Inn would satisfy any discerning traveler. <strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">LOLA APPROVED</span></strong> all the way!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DO</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.visitmaine.com/"><img class=" wp-image-7158 aligncenter" alt="Goose Rocks Beach" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Goose-Rocks-Beach-1024x685.jpg" width="400" height="267" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can&#8217;t go to coastal Maine and not mention the beaches. The Southern Maine Coast is unique for having many long sandy beaches unlike the rest of Maine where the coast is mostly rocky. If you&#8217;d like some seclusion, Parson’s Beach is for you or perhaps you prefer to be in the middle of the action at Kennebunk Beach. No matter what, Kennebunkport has a perfect spot for you to spend a sunny summer day at the shore. This beach bunny likes that!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7166" alt="photo 1-12" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-12-e1365350700143.jpg" width="327" height="382" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During my quick visit I discovered a great little wine shop, <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.downeastwine.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Down East Wine</span></a></span>, located in the lower village of Kennebunk &#8211; a short walk from downtown Kennebunkport. Dedicated to the discovery and enjoyment of unique wines, Down East Wine&#8217;s tagline is affordable quality. LOVE THIS! They were hosting a little wine tasting this particular Saturday and I&#8217;d like to think this a somewhat regular occurrence to help you discover delicious, well priced bottles.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DRINK</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-91.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7164" alt="old vingroni" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-91.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always in search of a good local watering hole for yummy drink, my visit to Kennebunkport was no different. I was recommended a couple of spots, Bandaloop and Pilot House, but decided on <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.oldvineswinebar.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Old Vines Wine Bar</span></a></span> as I heard stories about their legendary bartenders. With a name like Old Vines you can be sure they offer many incredible wines by the glass. Coming from dinner where I was enjoying a Negroni cocktail, I just wanted to stick with the same. Ben made me their version &#8216;Old Vingroni&#8217; which is made with gin, Aperol instead of Campari &amp; dash of rhubarb bitters. OUTSTANDING!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;">DINE</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://phosart.com/index.php"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7159" alt="50 Local Kennebunk Maine" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/527544_203901326386570_1656328042_n.jpg" width="576" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forever seeking out the hip &amp; happening, Lola was recommended <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.localkennebunk.com/Home"><span style="color: #ec099a;">50 Local</span></a></span> to try for this One Day Stay. Located in buzzing Kennebunk, as soon as I walked in I knew I was going to like this spot. Using the best of the area&#8217;s resources working with local farms &amp; fisheries, 50 Local is downtown Kennebunk&#8217;s newest neighborhood establishment. I enjoyed oysters from the Bagaduce River and a pork chop from local Breezy Hill Farm. UNBELIEVABLE! 50 Local offers traditional French Bistro dishes with an American twist, all served in a friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS &#8211; Kennebunkport is SO GOOD I actually have three honorable mentions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.alissons.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Alisson&#8217;s</span></a></span> for its award-winning famous lobster roll and bacon bloody mary. Perfect for a lunch option. MMMM<a href="http://www.jameshotels.com/miami/eat-drink/florida-cookery/"><br />
</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://daytripsociety.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Daytrip Society</span></a> </span>for its eclectic offerings in gifts &amp; home decor. I could have literally spent hours in this store finding all kinds of treasures. It certainly inspires the adventure of travel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.kennebunkportinn.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Kennebunkport Inn</span></a></span> for its fun renovation of their common rooms creating vibrant social spaces. You&#8217;ll wish to sit down and relax in this salty, sea captain environment inspired by Kennebunkport&#8217;s fishing &amp; shipbuilding history. PLUS they offer a <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.kennebunkportinn.com/packages-en.html"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Big Girls&#8217; Slumber Party</span></a></span> package including cocktails, chick flicks and a four course dinner. All you need to add are your BFFs &#8211; adore it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">The ABC&#8217;s of Washington, D.C.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spring has finally sprung and the cherry blossoms are blooming in our nation&#8217;s capital! Being the official capital of the USA, it&#8217;s of course where the President and his family live, but also where all three government houses sit. There is so much to see in this city half way between the North and the South of America. Now might be the perfect time to consider a city break to this great American city and see some of these amazing sights!</p>
<div id="attachment_7195" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 439px"><a href="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2456/3582223465_49a9b924c5_z.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7195" alt="capitol" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/capitol.jpg" width="429" height="640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>W – (The) White House:</b></span> home of the USA presidents. You’ll have to make do with an online interactive tour unless you reside in the USA, but you could join the annual Easter Egg hunt on the grounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>A – Arlington Cemetery: </b></span>walk around this huge cemetery with its memorials and gravesites or take the bus tour which visits the gravesite of John F. Kennedy, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Arlington House.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>S – Smithsonian Institute:</b></span> the largest Museum complex anywhere in the world. It includes 19 museums and galleries plus a zoo. There&#8217;s something for everyone here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>H – Hop on hop off trolley tour:</b></span> see all the main Washington, D.C. attractions. It’s a great way to travel between them too. There are <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.beatthebrochure.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">discount hotels</span></a></span> all over the district so getting accommodations should be easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>I – International Spy Museum:</b> </span>one of Washington’s newest museums opening in 2002 and dedicated to the history &amp; art of spying. It has a huge collection of spy artifacts and a new 007 exhibit, which includes 50 years of Bond villains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>N – National Mall:</b></span> the hub of Washington’s iconic memorials and museums with the Capitol Building standing proudly at the end. It&#8217;s a fantastic place to get an overview of the city and have a picnic!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>G – Gettysburg:</b></span> take a day trip to Gettysburg, the historic battlefield of the American Civil War.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>T – The Memorials:</b></span> many are flood-lit at night so take a tour then. Look out for the Lincoln Memorial, Martin Luther King Jr Memorial, the Kennedy&#8217;s Eternal Flame, the Washington Monument and of course, the White House.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>O – Octagon House: </b></span>tour this grand old house built at the very beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. It’s a National Historical Landmark building and now the home of the American Institute of Architects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>N – National Museums:</b></span> not all are housed at the Smithsonian, though you will find the National Air &amp; Space Museum there. Look for others such as the National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment, National Bonsai &amp; Penjing Museum and the National Archives in other parts of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>D – Duke Ellington Bridge over Rock Creek:</b></span> dedicated to the famous composer, pianist and big band leader who was a Washingtonian. He wrote more than 1,000 music compositions and was an important figure in the history of jazz.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><b>C – Capitol Building on Capitol Hill:</b></span> where the federal government meets. See its beauty from the National Mall or visit the Capitol’s Visitor Center.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">step aside Kate &amp; William &#8211; you&#8217;re not the only one getting the royal treatment</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_7138" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-9.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7138 " alt="lil Lola is quite comfortable in her French palace" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-3-9.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">lil Lola is quite comfortable in her French palace</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">as soon as you step inside Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris you will feel as though you are a part of a royal family. after all, since 1928 when the glamorous property opened its doors, it has been known for its &#8220;spirit of modern and elegant luxury&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris</span></a></span> located just off Champs-Elysees, reopened its doors in December 1999 after an extensive renovation project that restored the building&#8217;s key architectural features and re-created the original style to the tune of $125 million dollars. careful planning was put into place to recapture the original period charm in the decor, however, the property now has all the modern technologies and sophisticated facilities making it one of the world&#8217;s most luxurious hotels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OUI OUI i say! so the stage is set to say that this gorgeous and elegant hotel seems very much like a LUSH FRENCH PALACE. just have a look at one of the common areas where you can enjoy a cocktail or light fare, La Galerie. definitely a prime spot for people watching!</p>
<div id="attachment_7141" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/"><img class="size-large wp-image-7141" alt="the perfectly posh La Galerie" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FSP-lounge-1024x681.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">the perfectly posh La Galerie</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">if you are in the mood for a more upscale experience fit for a prince or princess, <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/dining/restaurants/le_cinq/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Le Cinq</span></a></span> is your place. for starters, the 2 Michelin-starred restaurant has its very own signature china &amp; silver created only for this legendary hotel. can you say FANCY?! it was an absolute pleasure to receive a THREE HOUR royal banquet of a meal at this spectacular restaurant. there were more staff than clientele and they were as delicious as the meal. what a feat to have one of the best restaurants in Paris AND one of the best staff! MERCI BEAUCOUP.</p>
<div id="attachment_7136" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 496px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-2-121.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7136  " alt="can you see why it would take four hours to eat this?" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-2-121.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">let them eat&#8230;EVERYTHING!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Le Cinq&#8217;s menu of course has classic French culinary items but the restaurant also embraces newer, lighter cooking styles and incorporates the freshest regional ingredients. the lamb shoulder that was prepared with spices and slowly cooked for 17 hours was divine. BUT my favorite was the cheese course. something you cannot miss when in France. Le Cinq has the most amazing cheese cart i&#8217;ve ever laid my eyes upon!</p>
<div id="attachment_7144" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/paris/"><img class="size-large wp-image-7144" alt="a beautiful Premier room - definitely perfect for any princess!" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/FSP-bed-1024x681.jpg" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">a beautiful Premier room &#8211; definitely perfect for any princess!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">now about Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris&#8217; sleeping quarters. there are many options for all kinds of guest needs inside this landmark building. With 244 rooms in total at Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris &#8211; i had the princess treatment in my Premier room. the room was incredibly decorated and spacious BUT the closet and bathroom were almost just as big! i particularly enjoyed my view of the stunning Marble courtyard.</p>
<div id="attachment_7140" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-51.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7140" alt="photo 5" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-51.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Le Bar&#8217;s Twister cocktail</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">as one must know, i am the QUEEN of cocktails and so i just had to go see what they might be mixing up down in Le Bar. i opted for the Twister off the &#8216;Creation Cocktail&#8217; list which is a Hendricks gin infusion with fresh cucumber, lime, fresh basil leaf &amp; sugar. although its price tag is steep (26 €) if this is the only way you can experience some of the majestic luxury of Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris, i say it&#8217;s worth every penny.</p>
<div id="attachment_7139" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 394px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy-16.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7139" alt="photo copy 16" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-copy-16.jpg" width="384" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Princess Lola for the day at Four Seasons Paris</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">even though i&#8217;m really not royalty, i appreciated being the invited guest of Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris, so that i could have an idea what that lifestyle must be like. not that i can live my life in this regal manner every day BUT it&#8217;s an experience that is 100% <strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">Lola Approved</span></strong>! <a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lola_blackpink.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3792" alt="lola_blackpink" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lola_blackpink-150x150.png" width="105" height="105" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="color: #ec099a;"><i>Premier Room</i></span> features Louis XVI style furnishings, which mirrors the traditional grace of French living.  The marble bathroom offers a full range of comfort and conveniences, such as a separate shower and bathtub. The room is attributed with a comfortable sitting area, a convenient desk for business purposes and a large king-size bed, or two twin-size beds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>The daily rate for the Premier Room is 1,275 Euros, taxes and service included. </i></p>

<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">#1</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">let&#8217;s start with this. the region begins at Barcelona. one of my favorite places. i don&#8217;t think i could tire of it. i arrived a day &amp; a half before my Costa Brava tour to get a small taste of the best of Barcelona and SI, did i!</p>

<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">#3</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i also love the lore of Costa Brava. so much history in so many ways. part of their history is tied to piracy. i&#8217;m infatuated with pirates so visiting this region and playing pirate for the afternoon was my dream!</p>
<div id="attachment_7088" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/601516_226847244121332_1209167211_n.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7088  " alt="c'mon say ARG! i'm commandeering this boat." src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/601516_226847244121332_1209167211_n.jpg" width="461" height="306" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">c&#8217;mon say ARG! i&#8217;m commandeering this boat.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">our final house with Charming Villas was in Besalu. it was this charming &amp; incredible 18th century farmhouse. i could have stayed here a long, long time. one of my favorite features of this villa was the stunning pool &amp; outdoor areas. oh, and the on site caretakers who were wonderful!</p>

GRACIAS for being amazing humans.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">NOW for my MINUS 1</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the awful cold winds that can affect Costa Brava called TRAMUNTANA. no gracias!</p>
<div id="attachment_7119" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 458px"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-17.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7119 " alt="if it looks cold, it's because it was!" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/photo-1-17.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">if it looks cold, it&#8217;s because it was!</p></div>
<p>from <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.cadaques.co.uk/index.php?page=home"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Cadaques</span></a></span> website:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the winter months, Cadaqués and the north of Costa Brava can be subjected to Tramuntana, an impressive wind the blows off the Pyrenees in much the same way as the Mistral blows in France.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tramuntana is a katabatic wind, which is a wind that blows off a mountain system due to the cool denser air at altitude in the mountains sinking, and funneling off into the coast. If you are looking for a relaxing beach holiday, then best to avoid Tramuntana, as this can whip things up. You should be fine in the summer months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is how Costa Brava, which translates as &#8220;Wild Coast&#8221; gets its name. You can be out walking in the Cap de Creus, and the Med will literally look like it is boiling. Not for the faint hearted, but it will certainly blow away the cobwebs!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">DESPITE BEING COLD, MY TIME IN COSTA BRAVA WAS PICTURE PERFECT! </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">thank you <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.charmingvillas.net/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Charming Villas</span></a></span> for inviting me to come find more reasons to fall in love with Costa Brava.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS &#8211; i cannot take all the photo credit. several are from <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://FestivalXplorer.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Festivalxplorer</span></a></span> &amp; <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.leahtravels.com"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Leah Travels</span></a></span> as well as Charming Villas!</p>
