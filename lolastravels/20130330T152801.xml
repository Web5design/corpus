				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/miami.jpg"><img class="wp-image-7049 aligncenter" alt="miami" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/miami.jpg" width="360" height="540" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you know much about Lola, you certainly know that Miami is one of my favorite places to visit. Why? It is easy to get to from practically anywhere. Certainly from chilly Boston but this visit I actually flew direct from Barcelona. How about that? Then there&#8217;s the whole great food, great cocktails, great hotels, great beaches &#8211; the list goes on! Finally, since I love international travel, Miami is a perfect place for me with so many people from all over the world visiting and living there. Here&#8217;s my &#8216;One Day Stay&#8217; round up of Lola&#8217;s visit this time to Miami.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DROP YOUR BAG</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.jameshotels.com/miami/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7054" alt="The James Royal Palm" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-3-6.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Newcomer on the Miami South Beach scene, <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.jameshotels.com/miami/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">The James Royal Palm</span></a></span> debuted in November 2012. This luxury boutique hotel originally built in 1939, has 179 guest rooms and 211 studios and suites, most with ocean views. Tres bon! A totally prime location being steps off the beach and world-famous Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue, The James Royal Palm has two swimming pools, a poolside bar, a fun lobby lounge and a full-service spa. The hotel serves as a modern tribute to the Royal Palm&#8217;s rich history keeping the European-influenced Art Deco style and playing up the style&#8217;s vertical elements and horizontal lines meant to denote movement and fluidity. Also, on property are two fabulous signature restaurants &#8211; Florida Cookery and CATCH. Yummy! The James brand has 2 other properties &#8211; one in New York and one in Chicago. I look forward to checking out these locations as well as this hipster hotel is completely <strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">&#8216;Lola Approved&#8217;</span></strong>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DO</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-2-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7055" alt="Delano Cabana Day" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-2-10.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn&#8217;t new Lola Miami news. When I get to South Beach, I cannot resist a cabana day at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.delano-hotel.com/en-us/#/explore/?id=/delano-miami-beach-club/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Delano</span></a></span>. Everything is always &#8220;just right&#8221; at this posh destination. It&#8217;s the way to chill &amp; play amongst the cool set. You can rent a cabana for the day and enjoy all the perks the guests of Delano have but at a fraction of the cost. How does little hourly treats from the gorgeous staff sound? What about complimentary neck or foot massages? YES&#8230;I thought you&#8217;d like that. Plus, the crowd is always fun and friendly. I&#8217;ve truly been hard pressed to find a better day long pool scene. TRUST ME ON THIS!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DRINK</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-15.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7056" alt="ultimate gin &amp; tonic at SLS Miami" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-15.jpg" width="482" height="482" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you know I&#8217;m not one to shy away from a good cocktail. During my most recent visit to Miami, I had a few that I could carry on about. Every drink at Delano during my annual cabana day tasted amazing for starters but, then again, don&#8217;t most poolside cocktails?!  Nevertheless, my favorite cocktail of this adventure was the ultimate Gin &amp; Tonic at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://slshotels.com/southbeach/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">SLS South Beach</span></a></span>. It tastes delicious but the presentation is so pretty, it&#8217;s a drink you hope lasts all evening!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DINE</span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thrillist.com/eat/miami/fl/miami-beach/khong-river-house_great-cocktails_lounges_asian_comfort-food_thai_feature/occasion_type/cuisine_type_ve"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7058" alt="Khong River House" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Khongscheftable.jpg" width="500" height="340" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.khongriver.com/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Khong River House</span></a></span> is one of the newer hot spots to try in Miami. Serving fabulous Thai-inspired food, the best loved dishes are the Burmese Noodle Wraps, Roast Chicken, Crispy Shrimp and Coconut Cake. Also known for their yummy cocktail list and attentive staff, Khong River House is a hip and trendy place without any of the attitude. HOW DELICIOUS!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS &#8211; an honorable mention goes to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.jameshotels.com/miami/eat-drink/florida-cookery/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Florida Cookery</span></a></span> at The James Royal Palm. Your experience here is meant to be innovative and fluid, serving globally influenced seafood. All I can say is my server, Ashley, was one of the most knowledgable I&#8217;ve ever had and after describing all her favorite dishes, that is what I promptly ordered. AMAZING!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img class="aligncenter" alt="thegreatescape" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thegreatescape.png" width="400" height="276" /></div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Welcome to Copenhagen, Denmark &#8211; capital of the happiest country in the world</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">Well, apparently not anymore but it was the reason I wanted to go. Who wouldn&#8217;t want to know the happiest country on earth?!  </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many words that are synonymous with Copenhagen these days. Architecture. Design. Foodie. Cool. What I find fascinating about Copenhagen is that it&#8217;s on SO MANY people&#8217;s TO-DO lists but so few have been YET. I managed to tack it onto a trip to Europe by adding a few extra days to explore and I&#8217;m so glad I made it a <strong><span style="color: #ec099a;">&#8216;Great Escape&#8217;</span></strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://http://www.copenhagenmediacenter.com/#/photo/1198"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6883" alt="Nyhaven" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ee00fef5f19979a732ebef6d42d62296.jpg" width="485" height="244" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Copenhagen is a compact city that is super easy to navigate. In fact, more than 50% of Copenhageners commute by bike. Awesome &#8211; right?! It&#8217;s got everything you want in a big city &#8211; culture, shopping, gastronomy &#8211; yet you&#8217;ll never feel overwhelmed here. The vibe that is Copenhagen is laid-back, open-minded, cutting-edge &amp; cosmopolitan. Definitely all the makings of a VERY Lola Approved destination.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="eat" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/eat.png" width="154" height="94" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">noma</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.copenhagenmediacenter.com/#/photo/1273"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6884" alt="noma" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/844676f5031b96108affe4ddfb4a5e43.jpg" width="485" height="323" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless you are a complete foodie or really &#8220;in the know&#8221;, you may not realize the TOP RESTAURANT in the world for 3 years running is in Copenhagen. Well, I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s for sure. <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://noma.dk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">noma</span></a></span>, a 2 Michelin starred restaurant, was at the forefront of the Danish food movement known as &#8216;New Nordic Kitchen&#8221;. What is that? It&#8217;s the reinvention of Nordic cuisine taking fresh, local ingredients and mixing that with gastronomic diversity instead of looking abroad for influences. AND clearly it&#8217;s been a WINNER. Pssst though&#8230;the head chef of noma is starting a new venture in mid-summer.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Manfreds &amp; Vin</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6890" alt="manfreds &amp; vin" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-21.jpg" width="403" height="403" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://manfreds.dk/en"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Manfreds &amp; Vin</span></a></span> is a hotspot amongst the hipster locals serving everyday rustic food with quality ingredients. The force behind the restaurant is none other than the team from <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://restaurant-relae.dk/en"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Relæ</span></a></span>, another famous 1 Michelin star Copenhagen restaurant started by two alumni of noma fame. Both Manfreds &amp; Vin and Relæ are located on Jaegersborgadd, an up-and-coming address.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I particularly enjoyed the tasting menu for dinner with wine pairings. Manfreds &amp; Vin is Copenhagen&#8217;s first natural wine bar. How cool! Serving small plates of in-season organic roots &amp; vegetables as well as organically raised meats like lamb and pig. The herbs and sauces couldn&#8217;t have complimented the courses any better. AND it was a hopping little spot. Definitely a see and be seen affair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.copenhagenmediacenter.com/#/photo/1253"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7030" alt="royal celebration" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/0ed55c552c1de71e1e88f85d74a68f91.jpg" width="485" height="316" /></a></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Halifax</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Copenhagen has been experiencing a gourmet burger movement over the past few years and offers several different options for places to get your next BEST burger. <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.halifax.nu/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Halifax</span></a></span> is one of the top places frequented by locals, offering a big selection of exotic burgers inspired by different parts of the world. Sounds delicious!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="drink" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/drink.png" width="210" height="94" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Wine Bar</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6895" alt="photo 2-2" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-22.jpg" width="384" height="384" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lola was lucky enough to have a local Copenhagener to show me some of the top spots for drinks. <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://bibendum.dk/info/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Bibendum</span></a></span> is one of Copenhagen’s best wine bars located in a cosy, rustic cellar on trendy Nansensgade. We enjoyed a delicious Italian red amongst locals but with over 30 selections of wines almost any wino would be happy!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Champagne Bar</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.copenhagenmediacenter.com/#/photo/498"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7031" alt="copenhagen cocktails" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/322ed5024ca77c6936747cf0ee826f1c.jpg" width="280" height="388" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://balthazarcph.dk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Balthazar</span></a></span>, located at Hotel d’Angleterre &#8211; which will reopen in May 2013, is Denmark&#8217;s first champagne bar. Offering a selection of more than 200 champagnes, Balthazar is the place to start a party. Plus, you can enjoy tapas, caviar service and live DJ’s on weekends.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Hand-crafted Cocktail Bars</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6893" alt="photo 1-10" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-10-285x300.jpg" width="285" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6892" alt="1150" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4-1-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now for my favorite of drink finds, Salon 39 and 1105. Lola has a love for the hand-crafted cocktail and these two places did not let me down. <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.salon39.dk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Salon 39</span></a></span> had a FAB cocktail menu. I tried the Cowboy Negroni because I&#8217;m currently having a love affair with the Negroni cocktail. It was the VERY BEST Negroni I&#8217;ve had to date. BUT this wasn&#8217;t the cocktail winner. Corporate Stooge gets the prize here. Made with Fighting Cock, D.O.M. Benedictine, Maple Syrup, Orange Curacao &amp; Celery Bitters, it was tasty but its presentation is really the bomb! Corporate Stooge is served in a hip flask hidden inside a book &#8211; how fun is that??!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My final cocktail in cool Copenhagen was partaken at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.1105.dk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">1105</span></a></span>. The mixmaster behind the bar whipped up something special called &#8216;Unfaithful&#8217; &#8211; a classic cocktail with licorice, which is quite popular in Denmark. Listed on Condé Nast Traveler’s exclusive list of the trendiest, international bars, 1105 is a stylish spot that makes you feel instantly welcome. The name of the game here is classic drinks skillfully crafted with top-quality ingredients.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="stay" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/stay.png" width="201" height="94" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Ibsens</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.brochner-hotels.dk/en/our-hotels/ibsens/"><img class="wp-image-7017 aligncenter" alt="ibsens hotel" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-10.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.brochner-hotels.dk/en/our-hotels/ibsens/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Ibsens</span></a></span> is where fresh, funky and functional intersect. This 3-star, 118 room hotel had so much to offer in terms of comfort and culture for Copenhagen. Located on Nansensgade, which is known with Danes to be the very essence of &#8216;Nordic Cool&#8217; &#8211; the hipsters hang out here. There aren&#8217;t any well-known brands or chain stores only charming cafes, original designers, art galleries and second-hand book shops. What&#8217;s truly amazing about Ibsens is that they&#8217;ve brought this spirit inside their property. Everything from room key chains, pillows &amp; tables, even books &amp; records are brought in by local designers! Ibsens is so completely HIP &#8211; they are the first hotel to accept <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.artmoney.org"><span style="color: #ec099a;">artmoney</span></a></span> as a form of payment. (more about this below) Other awesome features of Ibsens is their breakfast bar with healthy organic sandwiches and breakfast in a glass concept as well as their daily wine hour. Whether you are a solo traveler or with others, this is such a fantastic way to socialize with the staff and other guests. Bottom line, if you are looking for the essence of what is Copenhagen, Ibsens is the place for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-42.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6889" alt="canal tour" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-42.jpg" width="403" height="403" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even on an icy cold January day the <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.stromma.dk/en/CANALTOURS/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Canal Tours Copenhagen</span></a></span> was one of the best ways to see Copenhagen. I always say if a city is surrounded by water, you have to get out on it to see the city from another prospective. So much of Copenhagen&#8217;s history is steeped in maritime stories of trade and defense from this vantage point. The tour takes you through old &amp; new Copenhagen, traveling by way of narrow idyllic canals and visiting some of the most important buildings in the capital city.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Design Museum</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.designmuseum.dk/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7023" alt="designmuseum denmark" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hovedindgang.jpg" width="480" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get a real sense of Denmark, a visit to the <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.designmuseum.dk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Designmuseum Denmark</span></a></span> might be in order. Danish design has been hailed from all over the world for its timeless simplicity, quality &amp; functionality. Designmuseum Denmark is the perfect place to gain an understanding into how design and society influence one another bringing together the themes of Danish furniture, design and architecture.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ec099a;">Shopping</span></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.copenhagenmediacenter.com/#/photo/1317"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6885" alt="stroget" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/51f559101ebe001b06c34034c0fb9158-249x300.jpg" width="249" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/shopping/stroget/382"><span style="color: #ec099a;">StrØget</span></a> </span>is Copenhagen&#8217;s largest shopping area and incidentally Europe&#8217;s longest pedestrian street. Running through the heart of central Copenhagen, StrØget is the premier shopping street with something for everyone. As you branch off StrØget, you can find other Danish fashion all over the city. Located in the GrØnnegade Quarter are many independent designers so if you&#8217;re looking for the next hot thing to come out of Scandinavia this is the place for you. In the Latin Quarter are cheaper hipster stores &#8211; both new and second-hand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DEAR COSTA BRAVA &#8211; i fell in love with you!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-copy-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6976" alt="photo 1 copy 12" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-copy-12.jpg" width="461" height="451" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i was lucky enough to attend a conference in late September in Spain. specifically in Costa Brava. i spent the first few days there attending sessions &amp; parties and not really seeing much of the charming city of Girona. it was a wicked, wicked tease. FORTUNATELY, i had planned to stay on an extra couple of days for some blogger excursions. the excursion i was treated to through the Costa Brava Tourism office was called &#8216;surf &amp; turf&#8217; while i was only able to participate for one full day &#8211; it was enough to whet my whistle for a return trip. i&#8217;m a big fan of Southern France &amp; the Cote d Azure but, i gotta say, the Costa Brava coastline may have surpassed my love of France&#8217;s coast. for one, it lacks the cheese factor found in France. LOVELY!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costa Brava&#8217;s coastline is less well-known &amp; therefore, more of hidden secret. my guess is prices are better too. the food is exceptional and there are plenty of luxury hotels &amp; resorts to choose from. the day i was able to dedicate to Costa Brava was spent in Tossa del Mar and Blanes, two gorgeous coastal towns. i heard, after the fact, that the rest of the &#8216;surf &amp; turf&#8217; tour was even more breathtaking.</p>
<div id="attachment_6975" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://saltyapron.com"><img class="size-large wp-image-6975" alt="beautiful Cadaques - i'm smitten!" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cadaques-view-from-rocks-1024x683.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">beautiful Cadaques &#8211; i&#8217;m smitten!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">luckily, i was invited back to tour Costa Brava with <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.charmingvillas.net/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Charming Villas</span></a></span>, a villa rental company specializing in high quality homes in Catalonia. i knew i wanted to go back to Costa Brava, but didn&#8217;t expect it to be so soon. i&#8217;m more than psyched for many many reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">first, let me give you a run down of some of the things you can expect to see me doing while there. i&#8217;m not going to reveal every detail but here&#8217;s some of the highlights.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">listen, i&#8217;m usually the first one to poo poo a contest. i believe there&#8217;s so much talent out there and often it&#8217;s the same people awarded time and time again. when i learned about these &#8220;Bloggies&#8221; i thought, oh boy&#8230;here we go again. well, apparently they are kind of a big deal. AND i really cannot believe it but my blog is a finalist in the <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">&#8216;Best Kept Secret&#8217;</span></a> </span>category. maybe i don&#8217;t deserve to win but it would be really *<span style="color: #ec099a;">cool</span>* if i did.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">how many travel blogs have you seen where the writer dresses up like a matador in Barcelona?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">or how about wanders around a Parisian neighborhood dressed like a modern-day naughty Marie Antoinette and acts like it&#8217;s normal?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">too many cooks in the Italian kitchen? never!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0418.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6853" alt="lola" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0418-680x1024.jpg" width="400" height="602" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">everyone has asked me about my favorite this and my favorite that from my 30 day stint over in Euroland. the truth is everything was my favorite and it&#8217;s a really hard question to answer. BUT if i had to pick&#8230;i guess i could really say there were some things that topped the rest. in an effort to share these favorites, i give you my favorite day in my 30 days in Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">it started off at the early hour of 8:30am when the owner of the Florence apartment was coming to check me out. i needed to schlep my belongings to the train station and hop a train to Chiusi-Chianciano, which is on the border of Tuscany and Umbria. OK. easier said than done but with the help of the gracious apartment owner, a cab was called and i was on my way. once in Chiusi, one of the proprietors of the farmhouse informed me that the region had suffered from flash flooding and that 2 out of 3 roads were closed to get the farmhouse. the only open road which was the &#8220;long way&#8221; was also virtually impassable unless you had an SUV type of vehicle. this day looked to either be a massive failure or an amazing adventure. only time would tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">after a long car trip, i arrived at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.countryslowliving.com/wp/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Il Fontanaro</span></a></span>. it looked like what all the movies make Tuscan farmhouses out to be. it was beautiful. it was rustic. it was cozy &#8211; like home. the owners, mother &amp; daughter, were warm and welcoming. it seemed as if the day would be saved. only other thing is, i was there to take a day of cooking lessons and i really don&#8217;t cook. insert the UH OH here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6854" alt="photo 2-2" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-2-e1361656716594.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alina (daughter) and Lucia (mother) said let&#8217;s start off by looking at the menu we&#8217;ll be preparing &#8211; intimidating for the non-chef &#8211; but then handed over a plate of cheese, meat and a bottle of wine. ok&#8230;i can eat &amp; drink and then the cooking will come &#8211; right?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-122.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6855" alt="photo 1-12" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-122-e1361656903351.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">things to make:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">saffron &amp; pumpkin rice</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">home-made tagliatelle &amp; Umbrian meat ragu</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">slow cooked beef fillet</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">Alina&#8217;s spaghetti carbonara</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">Lucia&#8217;s apple strudel</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i&#8217;ll just say that Alina &amp; Lucia made it easy to &#8220;help&#8221; and i felt as though i were really cooking. everything was spectacular. the entire day was spent making the menu come to life and enjoying it along the way at lunch and then dinner. even better than the delicious homegrown organic food we made into meals was the company. you can&#8217;t help but get to know people as you spend an afternoon cooking, eating &amp; drinking wine together. and, it turns out we&#8217;re kindred spirits as mother and daughter fully endorse wine in every dish! what&#8217;s not to amore?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6861" alt="the menu" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-7.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">so why was this my favorite day? well, i guess because i was surprised how much i enjoyed a day of cooking. i learned about making different things, of course, but i also learned about the history of the farmhouse and a lesson in wine, to boot. Alina is a certified sommelier and gave a quick history lesson in Super Tuscan wines, which are of particular interest to me. Alina &amp; Lucia treated me like a friend not a stranger taking a cooking class and staying overnight in one of their farmhouse villas. So much so that the next morning Lucia delivered me to the Chiusi train station with Alina as an escort to Rome.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="filet of beef" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-4.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the best news is, the story is far from over. for one, i&#8217;ve enjoyed making some of the dishes i learned to make at Il Fontanaro since returning home. it&#8217;s a souvenir that keeps on giving in the reliving of the day and the enjoyment of a delicious meal. secondly, i&#8217;ve booked a week-long stay to go to Il Fontanaro this summer and cannot wait to return and discover more about cooking, the medieval village of Paciano and wines of the region as well as seeing my friends, Alina and Lucia, again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-161.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6862" alt="wine cellar" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-161-e1361663466456.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.countryslowliving.com/wp/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Il Fontanaro</span></a></span> is on the border between Umbria and Tuscany, just 2 hours from Florence and Rome. staying as a guest of Il Fontanaro affords you the opportunity to have a slow, eco-organic country living experience. MOLTO BENE!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRAZIE to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.walksofitaly.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Walks of Italy</span></a></span> for giving me such a wonderful experience of cooking at Il Fontanaro. you made my favorite day possible and, clearly, i&#8217;m a fan since i&#8217;ll be returning!</p>
