				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DEAR COSTA BRAVA &#8211; i fell in love with you!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-copy-12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6976" alt="photo 1 copy 12" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-1-copy-12.jpg" width="461" height="451" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i was lucky enough to attend a conference in late September in Spain. specifically in Costa Brava. i spent the first few days there attending sessions &amp; parties and not really seeing much of the charming city of Girona. it was a wicked, wicked tease. FORTUNATELY, i had planned to stay on an extra couple of days for some blogger excursions. the excursion i was treated to through the Costa Brava Tourism office was called &#8216;surf &amp; turf&#8217; while i was only able to participate for one full day &#8211; it was enough to whet my whistle for a return trip. i&#8217;m a big fan of Southern France &amp; the Cote d Azure but, i gotta say, the Costa Brava coastline may have surpassed my love of France&#8217;s coast. for one, it lacks the cheese factor found in France. LOVELY!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costa Brava&#8217;s coastline is less well-known &amp; therefore, more of hidden secret. my guess is prices are better too. the food is exceptional and there are plenty of luxury hotels &amp; resorts to choose from. the day i was able to dedicate to Costa Brava was spent in Tossa del Mar and Blanes, two gorgeous coastal towns. i heard, after the fact, that the rest of the &#8216;surf &amp; turf&#8217; tour was even more breathtaking.</p>
<div id="attachment_6975" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://saltyapron.com"><img class="size-large wp-image-6975" alt="beautiful Cadaques - i'm smitten!" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cadaques-view-from-rocks-1024x683.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">beautiful Cadaques &#8211; i&#8217;m smitten!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">luckily, i was invited back to tour Costa Brava with <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.charmingvillas.net/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Charming Villas</span></a></span>, a villa rental company specializing in high quality homes in Catalonia. i knew i wanted to go back to Costa Brava, but didn&#8217;t expect it to be so soon. i&#8217;m more than psyched for many many reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">first, let me give you a run down of some of the things you can expect to see me doing while there. i&#8217;m not going to reveal every detail but here&#8217;s some of the highlights.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">can you say you&#8217;ve seen a travel blog where the writer sandwiches a blow up doll?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">too many cooks in the Italian kitchen? never!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0418.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6853" alt="lola" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DSC_0418-680x1024.jpg" width="400" height="602" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">everyone has asked me about my favorite this and my favorite that from my 30 day stint over in Euroland. the truth is everything was my favorite and it&#8217;s a really hard question to answer. BUT if i had to pick&#8230;i guess i could really say there were some things that topped the rest. in an effort to share these favorites, i give you my favorite day in my 30 days in Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">it started off at the early hour of 8:30am when the owner of the Florence apartment was coming to check me out. i needed to schlep my belongings to the train station and hop a train to Chiusi-Chianciano, which is on the border of Tuscany and Umbria. OK. easier said than done but with the help of the gracious apartment owner, a cab was called and i was on my way. once in Chiusi, one of the proprietors of the farmhouse informed me that the region had suffered from flash flooding and that 2 out of 3 roads were closed to get the farmhouse. the only open road which was the &#8220;long way&#8221; was also virtually impassable unless you had an SUV type of vehicle. this day looked to either be a massive failure or an amazing adventure. only time would tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">after a long car trip, i arrived at <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.countryslowliving.com/wp/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Il Fontanaro</span></a></span>. it looked like what all the movies make Tuscan farmhouses out to be. it was beautiful. it was rustic. it was cozy &#8211; like home. the owners, mother &amp; daughter, were warm and welcoming. it seemed as if the day would be saved. only other thing is, i was there to take a day of cooking lessons and i really don&#8217;t cook. insert the UH OH here.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6854" alt="photo 2-2" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-2-e1361656716594.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alina (daughter) and Lucia (mother) said let&#8217;s start off by looking at the menu we&#8217;ll be preparing &#8211; intimidating for the non-chef &#8211; but then handed over a plate of cheese, meat and a bottle of wine. ok&#8230;i can eat &amp; drink and then the cooking will come &#8211; right?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-122.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6855" alt="photo 1-12" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-122-e1361656903351.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">things to make:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">saffron &amp; pumpkin rice</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">home-made tagliatelle &amp; Umbrian meat ragu</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">slow cooked beef fillet</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">Alina&#8217;s spaghetti carbonara</span></li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #ec099a;">Lucia&#8217;s apple strudel</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i&#8217;ll just say that Alina &amp; Lucia made it easy to &#8220;help&#8221; and i felt as though i were really cooking. everything was spectacular. the entire day was spent making the menu come to life and enjoying it along the way at lunch and then dinner. even better than the delicious homegrown organic food we made into meals was the company. you can&#8217;t help but get to know people as you spend an afternoon cooking, eating &amp; drinking wine together. and, it turns out we&#8217;re kindred spirits as mother and daughter fully endorse wine in every dish! what&#8217;s not to amore?!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6861" alt="the menu" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-3-7.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">so why was this my favorite day? well, i guess because i was surprised how much i enjoyed a day of cooking. i learned about making different things, of course, but i also learned about the history of the farmhouse and a lesson in wine, to boot. Alina is a certified sommelier and gave a quick history lesson in Super Tuscan wines, which are of particular interest to me. Alina &amp; Lucia treated me like a friend not a stranger taking a cooking class and staying overnight in one of their farmhouse villas. So much so that the next morning Lucia delivered me to the Chiusi train station with Alina as an escort to Rome.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="filet of beef" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-4.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">the best news is, the story is far from over. for one, i&#8217;ve enjoyed making some of the dishes i learned to make at Il Fontanaro since returning home. it&#8217;s a souvenir that keeps on giving in the reliving of the day and the enjoyment of a delicious meal. secondly, i&#8217;ve booked a week-long stay to go to Il Fontanaro this summer and cannot wait to return and discover more about cooking, the medieval village of Paciano and wines of the region as well as seeing my friends, Alina and Lucia, again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-161.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6862" alt="wine cellar" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-161-e1361663466456.jpg" width="336" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.countryslowliving.com/wp/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Il Fontanaro</span></a></span> is on the border between Umbria and Tuscany, just 2 hours from Florence and Rome. staying as a guest of Il Fontanaro affords you the opportunity to have a slow, eco-organic country living experience. MOLTO BENE!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRAZIE to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.walksofitaly.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Walks of Italy</span></a></span> for giving me such a wonderful experience of cooking at Il Fontanaro. you made my favorite day possible and, clearly, i&#8217;m a fan since i&#8217;ll be returning!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Zurich is pretty European city and Switzerland&#8217;s largest. You cannot help but fall in love with Zurich with its stunning Lake Zurich and the surrounding Alps. It seems like it&#8217;s straight out of a fairy tale. Zurich was named one of the &#8220;best quality of life&#8221; cities in the world and is definitely a destination worth a longer visit with all the fantastic places to stay, eat &amp; drink and shop. This doesn&#8217;t even take into account all the culture that is available in Zurich. Here&#8217;s my &#8216;One Day Stay&#8217; round up of Lola&#8217;s time in Zurich.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DROP YOUR BAG</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bauraulac.ch/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6833" alt="baur au lac" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/baur-au-lac.jpg" width="486" height="486" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had the opportunity to stay in the gorgeous <span style="color: #ec099a;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.bauraulac.ch/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Baur au Lac</span></a></span> hotel </span></span></span>for my overnight in Zurich. Dating back to 1844, this historic 5 star Leading Hotel of the World has had a guest line up full of royalty, presidents, artists &amp; actors. And, who couldn&#8217;t <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://destinia.co.uk/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">enjoy the views</span></a></span> from this address?! Looking onto Lake Zurich, the Alps &amp; its own private park, Baur au Lac epitomizes luxury, elegance and legendary service. I can vouch, first hand, that the service was extraordinary from the mere fact that even with shift changes, the staff always knew who I was and greeted me by name. Might I add, with a recent multi-million dollar renovation, Baur au Lac has individually designed and decorated rooms with high quality furnishings custom-made for the hotel. Baur au Lac has married the old with the new in a luxurious yet contemporary fashion. PERFECTION that&#8217;s definitely Lola Approved.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DO</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.globus.ch/en/index.html"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6825" alt="GLOBUS" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/image2.jpg" width="508" height="203" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Zurich is a lovely city with plenty of culture. In the short time I was there I enjoyed a cocktail at a famous sweets spot, Felix Cafe, and walked the streets of the quaint city. My favorite &#8216;DO&#8217; of my One Day Stay was stopping into <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.globus.ch/en/index.html"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Globus</span></a></span>, Switzerland&#8217;s premier, high-class department store. The flagship store, which is located in the heart of Zurich, is for those who appreciate quality, aesthetics &amp; innovative products. I particularly liked their food market as well as their own line of Globus clothes for women.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DRINK</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bauraulac.ch/en/rive-gauche-_content---1--1049.html"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6834" alt="barbaur" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/barbaur-1024x682.jpg" width="440" height="293" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can enjoy a cocktail a multitude of places, that&#8217;s for sure. Wine with lunch at Globus, an afternoon bellini at Felix Cafe, famous for its chocolate creations, or post-dinner drinks at the lively terrasse restaurant. My favorite &#8216;DRINK&#8217; was, in fact, at the trendy hot spot, <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.bauraulac.ch/en/rive-gauche-_content---1--1049.html"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Rive Gauche Restaurant &amp; Bar</span></a></span> at Baur au Lac. Right in the city center, you can mingle with the cosmopolitan Zurich set here.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">DINE</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bindella.ch/gastronomie/ueberblick-ristoranti/restaurant/restaurant-terrasse/39/show/"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6826" alt="terrasse-Restaurant-Zurich-Bellevue-Limmatquai-01" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/terrasse-Restaurant-Zuerich-Bellevue-Limmatquai-01.jpg" width="472" height="230" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m quite sure there are many fantastic options for delicious dining in Zurich. Staying overnight on a Sunday, however, presented a bit of a challenge as many restaurants are not open on Sunday or close quite early. Thanks to a tip from an &#8220;in-the-know&#8221; local, I was directed to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.bindella.ch/gastronomie/ueberblick-ristoranti/restaurant/restaurant-terrasse/39/show/"><span style="color: #ec099a;">terrasse</span></a></span>, a hip Italian dining spot with a Lake Zurich view. The food and service were great and the restaurant was quite busy with a handsome crowd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">DANKE to Baur au Lac for hosting my stay in Zurich. You were everything I expected and so much more. As always, if I didn&#8217;t <span style="color: #ec099a;"><strong>‘Lola Approve’</strong></span> it, I&#8217;d say otherwise. Plus, thank you to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/the-great-escape-verbier-switzerland-edition/www.myswitzerland.com"><span style="color: #ec099a;">Switzerland Tourism</span></a></span> for the first class SWISS train pass, which got me safely from Geneva to Zurich &amp; The Dolder Grand for divine lunch. The views here are mine!</p>
<div id="attachment_6836" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.thedolderresort.com/en.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-6836" alt="photo by Daniel Szelényi" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/doldergrand-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo by Daniel Szelényi</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PS &#8211; an honorable mention goes to <span style="color: #ec099a;"><a href="http://www.thedolderresort.com/en.html"><span style="color: #ec099a;">The Dolder Grand</span></a></span>. Your city resort is spectacular and I hope to further explore it on my next visit to Zurich. Between your fine dining options, bar, spa &amp; fitness facilities (I&#8217;ve never been so impressed) and sporting activities offered, I can imagine one wouldn&#8217;t even feel the need to leave your lovely property.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #ec099a;">Dear Montreal, I heart you!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6808" alt="downtown montreal" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-2-31.jpg" width="512" height="512" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i don&#8217;t know how it can be that we only now discovered each other, Montreal, but i think we are kindred spirits. never have i met a city that has done everything right and yet has a bit of a naughty rebellious streak. it&#8217;s quite fascinating and a fairly familiar concept to me. after all, that is what Lola kind of is. &#8220;just the right amount of wrong&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-16.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6809" alt="entering Quebec" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-1-16.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">with your history aligned with France, you speak your own version of French even though you were eventually ruled by England. i tres adore the fact that French is your first language. it makes you so attractive. but i also like that you don&#8217;t make me feel stupid that i really don&#8217;t know much French myself. i don&#8217;t get any &#8220;pouah&#8221; for not knowing. merci beaucoup for that!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">i loved learning that you are the only place in the world that never banned Absinthe. SUCH. A. REBEL. and not too long ago you made it a law that when a couple gets married, a woman CANNOT take the man&#8217;s last name as her own. it&#8217;s AGAINST THE LAW. or how about the fact that once you were super religious but then you went and decided that you&#8217;d have a quiet rebellion against religion and now you have the least number of people who attend churches. churches are actually now being repurposed for other things like museums and condos.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">yeah, i think it&#8217;s awesome, too, that you recommend your local cuisine, poutine &#8211; a dish  made with french fries, topped with brown gravy and curd cheese. sounds decadent, right?! and, you think it tastes the VERY BEST at 3am. because, yep, you&#8217;ve been out all night drinking and partying it up. i&#8217;m in LOVE with you that this is a normal behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">or how about the fact that most look for shelter in the frigid winter weather. but not you, Montreal. you like to throw parties in the freezing cold and wear loads of layers &amp; puffy ski gear. you take a bad situation and make it good&#8230;every time!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">finally, and most importantly, i love your swear words. sorry, people, but i think swearing is kinda funny and when i requested knowing some Canadian French swear words it just sealed the deal on my love for Montreal. did you know that many of Montreal&#8217;s swear words are based on religious objects? see if you recognize any similarities. first of all, they call swears SACRES &#8211; which to most means &#8220;sacred or holy&#8221; but not to Montrealers. it means naughty swear words.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6811" alt="sailor's chapel in Montreal" src="http://www.lolastravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/photo-4-3.jpg" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">here&#8217;s a few common swear words in Montreal:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><i>câlice</i> (<i>calice</i>) &#8211; &#8220;chalice&#8221;</li>
<li><i>sacrament</i> (<i>sacrement</i>) &#8211; &#8220;Sacrament&#8221;</li>
<li><i>tabarnak</i> (<i>taberacle</i>) &#8211; &#8220;tabernacle&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">they all pretty much mean the same thing and depending on how you say them determines the severity and meaning. basically, it&#8217;s their version of damn or f*ck. there&#8217;s a whole lesson to be learned here and i&#8217;m thinking i need a return trip to visit you, Montreal, just to become better versed in your swearing. and, anyway, it&#8217;s easier than learning French altogether.</p>
