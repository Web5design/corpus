				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After such a nice weekend of running last weekend it was quite a shock to hear about the Boston Marathon tragedy. I don&#8217;t really have any words to explain how on so many levels this is such a sad and tragic event.</p>
<p>If nothing else, training for the Montreal-New York Challenge has taught me how much a great community the running community is. Runners have such a respect for all other runners, no matter your performance level. You can always count on a friendly nod, wave of the hand or thumbs up when you cross another runner. We run for charity, we cheer each other along the way. Monday after the explosions you could see in the media coverage runners <a href="http://www.irunnerblog.com/running/running-community-uniting-supporting/">running towards others to help</a>.</p>
<p><em>I am proud to be a runner. The runners&#8217; spirit is a strong spirit. We push ourselves to be the best that we can be.</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever been witness to the emotions of the finishing line of any running race you know how the emotion at the end is magic. Seeing a struggling runner suddenly lifted up as their child runs with them the last few yards of the race. The grown man fall to the ground in triumph after completing a grueling race. The cancer survivor who makes a statement. The ordinary person who invested years of training to get to that magical moment and the realization that I DID IT! If there was a way to bottle up all that positive energy at the end of the race it would be the most valuable substance ever created. It would carry you through any obstacle you face.</p>
<p><strong>Even if you are not a runner I encourage you to visit the finish line of the next race organized in your neighborhood to encourage runners as they finish their race. Let&#8217;s not let Monday&#8217;s Boston bombing get the better of us. The runners community is stronger than any force of evil.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you describe spending 30 hours in a motorized vehicle with 8 other runners and running 44kms in 8 km intervals with no sleep in between? I don&#8217;t think anyone can really understand the mental challenge this represents unless you have lived it. We all have our challenges in life. Some are imposed on us by life, others we impose on ourselves so we can test our limits. The preparation challenge the Montreal-New York Challenge was a self-imposed challenge worth every minute.</p>
<p>24 hours later I still don&#8217;t have all the words to describe how I feel after this challenge. I am proud of what I personally accomplished, but also what my team and all the other participants accomplished. I&#8217;ve said it before; the old Nancy would never have dreamt of being able to accomplish this feat of running 44km in 30 hours. Whether you had to be helped for a few kms (that was my case) or you pushed even harder to help others around you who were struggling themselves (that too was my case) everyone had something to be proud of.</p>
<p>I started this pre-challenge with the optic of challenging myself and pushing my physical limits. The one moment of true discouragement came after the 2nd relay where I had struggled throughout most of the relay. My cardio wasn&#8217;t keeping up with the pace of the rest of the group, the hills seemed like mountains and I had someone&#8217;s hand on my back for the majority of the 8kms. I still had 3 more relays to complete. Everyone seemed to be feeling ok and not at their maximum capacity. How was I going to make it?</p>
<p>I struggled with the decision of changing running pace group and going to the next time slot. Making the switch would mean that I could more easily complete the remaining relays, but not within the time frame I had given myself. As I struggled, one of the coaches asked me one question that made all the difference: &#8220;Are you having fun?&#8221; Thank you Martine for that question.</p>
<p>When I first started this aventure I thought I needed to be constantly pushing myself beyond my limits. If I wasn&#8217;t going faster and harder I thought I was failing myself. No one was coerced in this challenge. Just the mere fact of running 44km in 30 hours was a big challenge for me. In the end, whether I took more time than expected to complete the kilometers doesn&#8217;t make a difference. What makes a difference when I look back on the challenge is whether I can reflect and feel proud about what I accomplished. I decided I wanted to have fun during this challenge and not doubt my capacities throughout the entire process, and so I made the decision to change groups.</p>
<p>In the rationalizing of my decision I realized (with the help of my teammate Laurence) that I had a pattern putting myself in situations that pushed my limits too far. It is ironic for a conservative, risk-intolerent person like myself. I have a desire to push myself, but sometimes I seem to be unrealistic in my expectations of myself and focus only going even further and harder. I place myself in situations where I tell myself &#8220;you can&#8217;t really do this. You are not good enough.&#8221; <em>Why do we do this to ourselves?</em> Why do I start running and just 5 months later I find myself running a half marathon? I like pushing the limits, but I put myself in extreme situations where I keep asking myself am I good enough. These are all questions I don&#8217;t yet have the answers to. I am, however, confident that this challenge will help me gain a greater sense of introspection that will allow me to grow as a person.</p>
<p><strong>To all the participants of <a href="http://espritdecorps.biz/en/foundation/montreal-new-york" target="_blank">Montreal-New York </a>I truly admire all of you. We will rock it when we arrive in Time Square on June 2!</strong></p>
<p>I encourage everyone to find a something that pushes you outside your comfort zone. <em>Live the experience. Learn from the experience. But, most of all enjoy the experience.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This challenge is teaching me more and more everyday about how much this is more than a physical challenge. It is a mental toughness challenge. It is a team collaboration challenge. It is a challenge about accepting your limits; accepting that others can help you along the way.</p>
<p>Our coaches are constantly teaching us about team collaboration. We have a technique where your fellow runners can put their hand on your lower back and slightly push you forward. This allows you to catch your breath and recuperate a little while continuing to run. I usually appreciate the hand on my lower back. I feel that it is giving me the physical and moral support I need. I can&#8217;t help but thank the person afterwards for their support. Other times, the hand feels like an extra load has been put on my shoulders. This load on my shoulders is a psychological one. A self-imposed load. Sometimes when I can&#8217;t catch my breath and my legs are killing me and I don&#8217;t think I can continue any further the helping hand pressures me into continuing something I think I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s that mental hamster that starts acting up again.</p>
<p>The other day when I was struggling and my coach put his hand on my back, the hamster started playing tricks on me. All I could think was &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can keep going, and now he&#8217;s pushing me to go even faster.&#8221; But that couldn&#8217;t be farther than the truth I later found out. Afterwards when my coach asked me how I felt when he put his hand on my back I told him about the pressure I created for myself to go even faster. But after talking it out a bit I realized that it wasn&#8217;t the case. The hand was simply there to help me catch my breath so I can continue going farther not faster. I realized that I should be welcoming the helping hand, without it I probably would have stopped long before we did.</p>
<p>I have a feeling I will need a few of those helping hands this Saturday as we run through our preparation challenge. Across the span of approximately 24 hours each participant will be running 5 relays of 8kms. That&#8217;s 40km in 24 hours. A lot of that journey will be uphill and probably in not so nice weather (weather forecast is rain rain rain for the whole day). It will be a test of how we handle both the physical and the mental part of the challenge.</p>
<p>My promise to my fellow participants is to accept the helping hands and embrace them as gifts that will allow me to go further, and not peer pressure to go faster.</p>
<p>How have you come to accept help in your life? What has it done for you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many different schools of thought when it comes to exercise and nutrition. I am no nutritionist and I don&#8217;t pretend to be one. My philosophy is simply to be smart and try to make healthy choices as often as possible.</p>
<p>I recently met a young woman, Virginie Vigneault, who had no other choice but to start paying closer attention to her nutrition. Diagnosed<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease" target="_blank"> Celiac</a> last year Virginie had to think about what she was putting into her body more than ever before. Put very simply Celiac disorder is an autoimmune disorder of the small intestine. People suffering from the disorder will have symptoms that include pain and discomfort in the digestive tract, chronic constipation and diarrhoea, and fatigue. People who are Celiacs cannot therefore properly tolerate gluten.</p>
<p>For the last few months Virginie has adapted her diet to include gluten-free foods, but also more natural and organic food choices. &#8220;I am going back to the basics. I prepare and cook the meals I eat! And when I want a little sweet treat I bake it myself. It is so much better!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Virginie you don&#8217;t need to be Celiac to eat gluten-free and organic. These choices can be for everyone. The one piece of advice Virginie would give for anyone interested in eating healthier: &#8220;There is a gluten-free craze going on right now. Just because a package says gluten-free doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s necessarily a healthy choice. If you are interested in eating healthy start by trying to eliminate boxed foods.&#8221; Virginie has an insider&#8217;s view on this as she works in the food industry. &#8220;Even if gluten-free is mentioned on the packaging, some companies replace the gluten in their products by adding a whole lot of ingredients of poor nutritional value.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need to be careful of the packaging and go beyond the marketing to see what are the ingredients. At <a href="http://www.cuisinesoleil.com/" target="_blank">Cuisine Soleil </a>(Virginie&#8217;s employer), the focus is on organic and gluten-free. Their products are also free of the top 8 allergens. The products they produce are all products steming from organic agriculture and free of chemical pesticides. Cuisine Soleil is but one example. If you are interested in making the switch to organic check the web for possible producers/manufacturers/vendors.</p>
<p>Personally, although I may not be ready to completely switch to organic, I am trying to make healthier choices on a daily basis. One trick that I&#8217;ve adopted recently is using maple syrup instead of white sugar to sweeten my morning coffee. The more I workout out the more I realize just how important what we put in our mouths is.</p>
<p>What small changes have you made to your diet recently?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the training I&#8217;ve been doing recently my legs have been feeling it. They&#8217;ve been stiff, achy, tight, sore and any other synonym of pain you can think of. After last week&#8217;s grueling exercise of climbing up 260 steps 10 times it goes without saying that I was walking around like a penguin!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a new craze, but I must have heard about foam rollers by at least 6 different sources in the last 2 weeks. What is a foam roller? It&#8217;s a pretty innocent looking piece of hard foam in the shape of a long tube. Similar to those colorful large-size noodle looking toys for the pool. You roll on the foam roller to obtain a massage and relieve muscle tension.</p>
<p>When I first heard that you massage your legs with this innocent looking piece of foam I though this sounds like fun! Don&#8217;t be fooled! This thing hurts!!! I used it after the stair climbing exercise and I couldn&#8217;t help but to grimace and moan because of the pain it caused me. It was actually pretty funny to see both my boyfriend and I on our living room floor grimacing in pain because of a $20 piece of foam. Despite the pain we do plan on continuing to use the foam roller and hope for results!</p>
<p>If you would like more info on foam rollers take a look at the following:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week was our dreaded Mount-Royal step climbing workout&#8230;we had heard nightmare stories about it. People wanting to quit or barely being able to complete climbing them. Most of us were anticipating what was to come. Would we be able to get through it? I know I was stressed out. I had been feeling sick for the last 2 days, I had had tough days at work, but worst of all I didn&#8217;t want a repeat of the <a href="http://www.living4impact.com/2013/03/08/moment-of-discouragement-moment-of-realization/">previous week&#8217;s workout.</a> I had struggled and hit my wall last week. I wasn&#8217;t prepared to do that again this week. Would the infamous steps get the best of me?</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with the Mount-Royal steps there are approximately 260 of them. Our task was to climb them over and over again&#8230;until we&#8217;ve completed 10 rounds of 260 steps. If an average flight of stairs is approximately 12 steps, we climbed almost 10 flights of stairs&#8230;10 times!!!</p>
<p>We did the first climb at a slow pace. Even at a slow pace by the time I got to the last 10 steps I could really feel the burn. But, overall I felt good. One down, nine more to go. Of course we weren&#8217;t going to be climbing each time at a slow pace. This is a physical challenge after all! The next three climbs had to be done at a faster speed with a quicker completion time then our slow climb. As a group we now had to complete the climb up the 260 steps in about 15 seconds faster than the first climb. This was a challenge. But we now had 4 climbs done.  Climb 5 was a recuperation climb &#8211; as much as anyone can recuperate climbing up 260 steps!!</p>
<p>Climb 6 through 8 entailed having at least one person of our team being carried up the steps at all times during the climb. For most in the group these climbs were easier than the individual climb up because the focus was about making sure we didn&#8217;t drop our team member. I didn&#8217;t really feel the same &#8211; all the climbs were tough!! Climb 9 was supposedly our last climb up so we had to go as fast as possible. After a few weeks of training with the coaches of Montreal-New York I know very well that this wasn&#8217;t going to be the case. Of course, 9 climbs was not enough, 10 was a much better number! Again we went up as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Wow 260 steps 10 times! What an accomplishment! Especially after all the stress of the days before seeing the posts on Facebook from the other participants about the toughness of the week&#8217;s challenge. I had gotten wrapped up in all the hype and let it get to my head. I had doubts that I would be able to get through it. The hamster in my head (as one of my fellow participants, Marie-Lou, likes to refer to the negative self-talk we create for ourselves) was running wild! Funny how that hamster never tells us we&#8217;ll be able to get through the challenge in front of us. Well after accomplishing this physical challenge I can say I shut that damn hamster up!</p>
<p>Going down those 260 steps for the last time after having officially completing the climbs left me feeling so satisfied and proud of myself and everyone else who had completed the challenge. We did it! We did it as a team! I could barely see the steps as I was going down that last time as tears were overflowing. I had proved to myself that I can. Last week was a blimp in the road; a challenge that pushed me to have more faith in my abilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been working on my running technique. With the coaches of the Montreal-New York Challenge we were able to record on video ourselves running on a treadmill and analyse what we saw as a group.</p>
<p>The video allowed us to see for ourselves how we run. I had suspected that my running technique was not optimal, but seeing it on tape was proof that I had elements to work on. For one, I was surprised to see that my center of gravity when landing was pretty much under my body. This is good. Ideally, you want your foot to fall down in line with your upper body. This will allow a lessening of pressure on your lower back that may be caused if you lean too far forward.</p>
<p>Before even watching myself on tape I expected to see my heel hitting the ground before my forefoot. I know this is not good, and this is exactly what I saw. Your foot should be hitting the ground near the middle foot area and not the heel. A good image to keep in mind when trying to correct this error in technique is to think about being barefoot in your bathroom and suddenly the phone rings and you rush off to answer. Does your heel land first or does your mid-fore foot? Naturally you will start that dash for the phone with your forefoot. By landing this way you are able to achieve maximum power while you push-off. You also save valuable energy.</p>
<p>One last pointer that stuck with me is that running should be a fluid movement that does not generate too much noise. You shouldn&#8217;t be pounding the pavement. Running should be a fairly silent process. Your movement should be springy and light.</p>
<p>In my last few runs I&#8217;ve paid particular attention to these elements of my running. I can see and hear the difference. My body is thanking me for the small corrections I am making with each run.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Sometimes you need to take two steps back to be able to move forward. Last night I probably took 10 steps back. There is what happened.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hit a physical and mental wall last night. It was our weekly group training and boy was I not ready for what was to come. We had to run and cover a certain distance in 15 seconds, 15 seconds rest and repeat and repeat and repeat&#8230;all of this in about 8 inches of snow. I found the first sprint hard. By the 4 or 5th one I could barely catch my breath before starting the next sprint. After about 6 repetitions I thought my torture was over. The mental wall really came when we were told we would be doing it all over again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No. I can&#8217;t. How? Please make it stop. Those were the only things going through my head. Those 15 seconds seemed like huge mountains. I know it&#8217;s all a question of perspective and if you put your mind to it you can achieve anything. But I just couldn&#8217;t get there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The worst was the pressure I created for myself seeing all the other participants pushing through their own pain and doing it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then I really cracked. With two sprints left I stopped. I couldn&#8217;t do it anymore. The group went ahead and did their two last sprints. I could hear them. I wanted to turn around and encourage them to keep going, but I couldn&#8217;t. I felt like such a traitor. They were struggling. They were hurting. But, they were doing it. It killed me to think that I let them down and didn&#8217;t push through. Emotional breakdown.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I disappointed myself. I let the doubts take over. I disappointed my team.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I can&#8217;t manage to run a few 15 second sprints how will I ever get to New York?</div>
<div> </div>
<blockquote>
<div>Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success. Dale Carnegie</div>
</blockquote>
<div>What amazed me is how supportive everyone was. They comforted me. They reassured me that I wasn&#8217;t a disappointment. Their words and gentil touch made all the difference. This is why we push each other physically during the challenge. We get to see that despite the pain, despite the struggles and the mental breakdowns we survive. We survive hopefully to be stronger. Stronger together.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I always put lots of pressure on myself to keep up with the group. I don&#8217;t want to break the pace. But in the back of my head I always have that perception of myself as a non-athlete. I can&#8217;t keep up because I&#8217;m not as strong as the others. I don&#8217;t have the natural ability or the cardio. I always put myself at the bottom of the pack.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way home in my car after the workout last night I realized something&#8230;I was out there. I was running with everyone. I wasn&#8217;t at home on my couch listening to tv. I was moving. I was participating in a sport. I wasn&#8217;t being lazy. I&#8217;ve run 5km races. 10km races. A half-marathon for God&#8217;s sake. Fuck that, I AM AN ATHLETE!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night made me realize that I need to be nicer to myself. Just like my team was with me. I am part of the team. I can measure up. I am not a non-athlete as I often refer to myself. I can compete. I can push my limits. <strong><em>I am an athlete. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</em></strong></div>
<div> </div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend I was working out at the gym; after a few leg exercises I decided to do squats. I go in position, squatted down and pushed back up until&#8230;a sharp pain in my left knee. I managed to get back up in a standing position and figured it was just a false movement. I got in position again and squatted down. Again a sharp pain in my left knee on the way back up. After 5-6 tries I decided squats were definitely not a good idea for me at the moment.</p>
<p>I was able to walk without too much pain, but the idea of squatting down again and injuring myself more freaked me out too much. That was pretty much the end of my workout for the day. Back home my boyfriend convinced me to ice my knee. Then I made the mistake many people make&#8230;I got on the internet and started researching sharp knee pain. The scare of a torn meniscus was just too much. I have a big running challenge coming up. I&#8217;ve invested countless hours of training and lots of energy trying to raise money for the cause. Doing all of this and not being able to participate in the challenge would be horrible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been very lucky in the last year since I&#8217;ve started running more seriously. Aside from some sheen pain for a few weeks last year I&#8217;ve been injury free. Last year before the Montreal half marathon a friend suffered an injury that stopped him from participating in the marathon. Reading his updates online on whether he would be able to run or not was heartbreaking. I know what kind of training a long distance race takes, and getting to a few days before the big race day and realizing you will not be able to race after all is a horrible feeling.</p>
<p>It made me think of the olympic athletes and all the years of training and sacrifice they go through to get to the games&#8230;and the disastrous news that an injury will not allow them to participate. I can&#8217;t imagine. It takes great courage to manage through that.</p>
<p>If you want to see real courage and determination through injury watch this video. It will surely inspire you (it inspires me every time I watch it):</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='584' height='359' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/rCAwXb9n7EY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Thankfully, in the end, after some ice and rest my knee is thankfully doing much better.  <img src='http://www.living4impact.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few Sundays ago was our first full group training. We usually train weekly with 2 other teams (we are teams of 8 so typically our weekly workouts are with 24 other participants), but this workout was with all of the 250 participants in the Montreal-New York City challenge.</p>
<p>I typically workout on my own, so every week it&#8217;s an adaptation for me to workout with 24 other people&#8230;250 other people is a whole different ballgame!</p>
<p>It was great! It was like being back in grade school at recess time! We were all running around trying to catch each other, rolling on the ground, and just having a great time. It was great to see all the different types of people participating in this challenge. Athletes, non-athletes, young, older&#8230;this is a challenge for ALL.</p>
<p>Before all this play and fun we were given a conference on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biofeedback">biofeedback</a> and nutrition. All great information. I especially liked the biofeedback part, more specifically the cardiac coherence part. In layman&#8217;s terms, cardiac coherence is about getting your breathing in line with your heart rate. Cardiac coherence will release chemicals in your body and allow you to more effectively face the physical challenge ahead. It is amazing everything the human body does when faced with different stressful situations. The example that stuck out for me was in front of a hill you can either choose to breath and take it one step at a time or be unfocused and struggle all the way up. The hill is the same &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t suddenly become steeper. The physical condition of the person running it is the same. The mindset is different. </p>
<p>A lot about running, and physical exercise in general, is about mental strength. You can have the best conditions lined up for a great workout and it turns out to be disastrous and vice versa. Last week for example, I had had bad news on the family front, I was tired and I decided to go for a run in the evening after supper. I never run in the evening, much less on a full stomach. But I knew I needed that run. I knew that it would do me a world of good. I knew I would be happy I did it. I decided to try some cardiac coherence and I adopted the right mindset. In the end it served me well because it was a great run.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning a lot of valuable information with this challenge and I&#8217;m excited to apply it more regularly in my individual training.</p>
