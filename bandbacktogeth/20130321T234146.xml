Often, new symptoms can appear or worsen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, one of my best friends struggled with her family life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father is a &lt;a title="Bipolar Disorder Resources" href="../../../../bipolar-disorder-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bipolar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Schizophrenia Resources" href="../../../../schizophrenia-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/a&gt; who has attempted &lt;a title="Suicide" href="../../../../suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; several times. After the &lt;a title="Divorce Resources" href="../../../../divorce-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt; her mother struggled with &lt;a title="Addiction" href="../../../../addiction-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;. My friend is an bright, intelligent, driven, talented young lady, but this post isn't about her, really. I love her dearly, but one of the biggest roles she's played in my life is opening my eyes to how difficult life can be for &lt;a title="Loving Someone With Bipolar Disorder" href="../../../../coping-loving-someone-with-bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank"&gt;those who love individuals with psychological health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm bipolar with the added bonus of recovering from &lt;a title="Bulimia Resources" href="../../../../bulimia-nervosa-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../anxiety-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. I found out when I was 19. I'm 22 now, almost 23. I managed to get my college degree and now I have my dream job. I moved to a new city. I'm living on my own, proving I "can do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, the "crazy" is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where once self-awareness and self-care were enough to keep me fairly stable through my ups and downs, I think I'm hitting that place where my disorder matures into what it will be for the rest of my adulthood. I was warned this might happen, that I might hit a groove and become "stable" for some time, but that my brain wasn't fully matured and therefore my chemical imbalances might change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cycle is off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My emotions are...something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't really have words for what life is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective part of my brain says, "Things are going pretty well." I have friends, in my new city and back home, and in other places, that show me often and profoundly how loved and valued I am in ways small and large. I have the job that every recent college graduate dreams of, the one that blends my passions with my skills into an amazing sort of this-is-meant-for-me thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found a church that I absolutely love, full of loving, welcoming people who legitimately care about me. I have volunteer projects I adore, that help remind me how fortunate I am. I've even lost weight! Thirty pounds, actually. Five more pounds and I'll have lost all of the weight I gained during my collegiate battle with bulimia. (And, it's been lost the right way...the healthy way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except my brain isn't good. My brain is awful, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last two, almost three years, I've had the relief of being unmedicated. I made the choice to go the "sheer willpower and stubbornness" route of &lt;a title="Mental Illness" href="../../../../mental-illness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; because I had two years of my life go down the drain when we couldn't find the medical cocktail that worked for me. I either felt too much, was spending too much time at one end of the bipolar spectrum or the other, or I was feeling nothing at all. I even got addicted to a particular fast-acting anxiety medication that stole several months of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I'd eventually have to try the route of medication again someday, but knowing it might happen doesn't mentally prepare you for the day it actually comes. I'll be talking about this with my &lt;a title="Therapy" href="../../../../therapy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;therapist&lt;/a&gt; at our next appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not every day is good, there's good in every day. Life unmedicated hasn't been unkind to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this is an option anymore, though. I'm reminded of what a lifelong diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Fear" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I feel fear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not anxiety, not stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear, legitimate FEAR. I'm 22, I'm young. I want to meet someone, &lt;a title="Marriage and Partnership" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;get married&lt;/a&gt;, maybe even someday have a family. I want to move out to the country, have a ragtag pack of dogs, maybe some horses and a few cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to live my dreams and fulfill my goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think back to the stories I heard about my friend's dad. He was bright, passionate, engaged, popular, a pillar of his community, until he began exhibiting symptoms. Then, over a multi-year period, he became the person I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those terms are ones that have been applied to me. Is this the start of the avalanche? Is this where a lifetime of being a burden, being someone else's inconvenient responsibility and source of heartache, begins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most days, I'm very, very good at finding the silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm an optimist by nature, even when I'm on the low end. But, these last few days, it's all replaced by the turmoil of emotions I can't control, and fear. Fear of the future and what I'll become, and fear of whether or not medications will work or if this is really the earnest start of my troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3734/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>No, I Still Don't Want To Go Back To Teaching</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/DkjtYaII0yc/</link><description>She shares a unique look at a day in the life of a teacher.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3746/</guid><category>Childhood</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Stress</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical day in the life of an elementary school teacher...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/A_Day_In_The_Life_Of_An_Elementary_School_Teacher.jpg" alt="A Day In The Life Of An Elementary School Teacher" width="600" height="250" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;7:30 am: Arrive at school. Grade papers, change bulletin boards and write lesson plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:15 am: Crazy, &lt;a title="Alcoholism Resources" href="../../../../alcoholism-resources-2/" target="_blank"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt; parent who is not allowed to go to my classroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows up in there anyway. Fortunately I am in the office and my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; principal coerces him into the cafeteria, which is where he is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; supposed to go anyway, to watch his violent child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:20 am: Crazy, drunk parent returns to my room, leaving child to hit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; people in cafeteria while I am at my desk. I manage to slip past him&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and go into the cafeteria to find my principal. The parent always seems friendly but he has left messages threatening me on the school voice mail system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:25 am: Students enter classroom. Must explain to challenging child that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; she is going to have a change her routine today and she needs to stay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the classroom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:26 am: See 8:25 am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:28 am: See 8:25 am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;8:50 am: Finally receive bus list that must be filled out for the field&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; trip that we are going on in 5 minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;9:00 am: Take class into freezing rain to get on the bus. Must stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; outside in the rain (eight months &lt;a title="Pregnancy Resources" href="../../../../pregnancy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;) to break up fight before getting on the bus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;9:25 am: As we file into W. High School to watch the Junior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; League of Johnson County perform Pinocchio, the only parent attending tells me that I&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"look like shit."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;10:00 am: The worst play I have ever seen, including elementary school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; performances, begins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;10:45 am: As I nod off, I am startled by the sounds of violent vomiting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; behind me. Student vomits all over his coat as well as the coat and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; shirt of student sitting next to him. Only one other (also eight months pregnant) teacher (even&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;though there are five others there) offers to help me alert custodian,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; get student cleaned up and move the entire class as quickly and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;quietly as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;11:00 am: Ride bus back to school holding onto sick student. Fortunately he does not actually throw up on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;11:10 am: Return to school to find out that they still haven't figured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; out a schedule for school picture day, even though it IS school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; picture day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;12:05 pm: Lunch is delayed, but do find out that we will be taking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pictures at 12:45 pm. Also find out that there is an assembly at 1:30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pm that principal forgot to mention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;12:50 pm: Bring students to photographer, who is not ready for us. Play&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Simon Says to practice things like step vs. jump and up vs. down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;1:10 pm: Begin pictures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;1:30 pm: Assembly delayed, but fortunately students are in library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; skills and it is not my problem. Continue grading papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:10 pm: Called to bring students to assembly, but since I do not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; have my students, I cannot follow this direction. Go look for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; students in the gym. They are not there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:20 pm: Find students. Bring them to assembly. Remind three of them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we do not hit people just because they are not walking fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:50 pm: Must go get students now. Am frightened. Assembly still not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:20 pm: Assembly still going strong, even though the buses will leave in five minutes and no students are packed up to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:23 pm: Send all my bus riders out of the assembly to get their homework, backpacks and coats on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:26 pm: Jog back to classroom with the rest of the students. Make sure all have homework, coats and bookbags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:31 pm: Drunk parent from this morning now looks very tired and smells bad. I wave cheerfully to campus police officer to make him go away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:37 pm: Where is T's grandfather?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:40 pm: Go inside to call T's grandfather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:48 pm: All of my students have now been picked up. I am leaving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:51 pm: See four students who have not been picked up. No one is waiting with them. Feel responsible because some of them are my former students. Decide to wait with them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;4:10 pm: All students are picked up.

You can&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand how, even though I tried to get past it, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to &lt;a href="../../../../trust-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; you again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I have never understood how in the hell you thought it was a great idea to tell me on Christmas Day. You could have waited a day or two, but no - you had to do it &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; day. Now for the rest of my life I will remember it. It is part of my Christmas every year. I have a national holiday to remind me of the day you decided to tell me you wanted a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did know that it was coming thanks to a mutual friend we had at the time, but I really didn&amp;rsquo;t think you were so coldhearted as to tell me on Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been three or four years since it happened and I still remember the day like it was yesterday. I keep hoping that in time the pain will fade but who knows if it will or not.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; People think I am crazy for refusing to pay for the divorce just to get it done and over with, but because of how heartless you are I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to make things easy for you. Since I never have to see you and being married doesn&amp;rsquo;t really affect me, I figure we can stay married until you decide to pay for it or you want to get &lt;a href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; again. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I hope one day someone will hurt you like you hurt me!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - Your Wife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3747/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Sound-Check Wednesday - March 20, 2013</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/K32PtOiZYYc/</link><description>SuperTeala shares news and updates about The Band.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3751/</guid><category>Sound Check </category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is I,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a style="font-size: 14px;" href="http://meltintothetext.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SuperTeala&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;back&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;with our Sound-Check Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Sound_Check_Wednesday_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only Wednesday, and I've already had a long week.

We had our cultural differences but I  am studying a good bit of Latino studies and Spanish at college, so the culture isn't foreign to me; I am mostly bilingual. I have been living with my fiance and future relatives for about a month and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the typical &lt;em&gt;machista&lt;/em&gt; stuff. He told me what to wear, how to cut my hair, how to wash dishes, mop floors, do laundry, and any other household chore you can think of. He told me how frequently I should bathe, when I could &lt;em&gt;descansar&lt;/em&gt; ('rest' in Spanish), and when I should be working. He didn't &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; me to help with dinner, but would instead tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I confronted him on how he &lt;a title="Emotional Abuse Resources" href="../../../../emotional-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;spoke to me&lt;/a&gt; he would say, "This is how I am and if you don't like it I'll find another woman who doesn't mind." If I were smart I would've told him to go find her, but instead I endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking I would convince him that I was good - good enough to merit being spoken to with respect. I thought if I did enough chores, or was good enough in bed, or made his life easier (including getting up at 4:00am to pack his lunch and help him get ready for work), that he would grow to appreciate me. I should've known better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now have &lt;a title="Social Isolation Resources" href="../../../../social-isolation-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;no friends&lt;/a&gt; - my fiance and I got in a fight after I got coffee with my best girlfriend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By some miracle my family found it within themselves to forgive me for ignoring them for months. I am now back at my mother's house. If I hadn't had a place to go, I wouldn't have left.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 21 years old and a full-time college student. For the past month and a half I have been pulling double duty on four hours of sleep or less a night doing house chores and schoolwork. I could only do schoolwork in the morning after he left for work because if I sat for any length of time in front of him he would call me lazy and tell me to go get some chores done. I would get my week's worth of schoolwork done in the morning after he left between the hours of 4:00 and 8:00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how I pulled off the grades I'm getting this semester. He would always ask me what my degree is for if I am going to be in the house all day. If I was ever even ten minutes late getting in from classes he would  freak out and scream at me and tell me I didn't really love him, that he  was going to get tired of me and leave me and then no one would want me  because I am used goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I had a family emergency. My mother called to tell me my cousin two states away had a &lt;a title="Stroke Resources" href="../../../../stroke-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and was in the hospital with partial paralysis. I wanted to be with my mother but I knew I couldn't talk to him about it and I needed his permission to leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my mother called I sat down on the bed. Tears fell silently from my cheeks as he entered the room. He took one look at me and gruffly asked, "&lt;em&gt;Tu que tienes? No te dije que te apures?&lt;/em&gt;" (What's wrong with you? Didn't I tell you to hurry up?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't tell him that I was upset or why I was upset because I knew as painful as the situation was for me, he couldn't feel sympathy for anything I might have to say. So I simply answered "&lt;em&gt;nada.&lt;/em&gt;" There is nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said, "Then hurry up. We are leaving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were leaving to do the week's grocery shopping with the rest of the family, eight of us total. It was my least favorite activity while living with my fiance and future in-laws because I was frequently shamed and yelled at for being culturally incorrect (in my own country).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I just couldn't go on that day. I couldn't pretend nothing was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad, who has been basically absent my entire life except for around birthdays, Christmas, and the odd little league game, had just sent me a series of texts telling me that even though he hadn't really been there, he is proud of who I am and that no man will ever deserve me. I couldn't believe it - still don't - but his messages gave me the nudge I needed to make the decision I'd spent a month agonizing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hurry up, we're leaving," my fiance called.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, "Babe, I don't want to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He replied, "you don't &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to? I didn't ask. We're going; get your coat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied, "I just said I don't want to. I don't want to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exchange went on a few times, then he jerked around violently and came closer. I was afraid he was going to hit me. He has never hit me but there have been several times when I thought he might.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of hitting me, he said a lot of ugly things, including several swear words in Spanish - cursing my friends and my family, saying that they were always coming between us and between me and my duties as a wife. I reminded him that he promised when I moved in that I could see my family whenever I wanted. He said, "Yes, whenever you want. Just not now because we're going grocery shopping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said, "You go. I'm staying."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he said, "If you don't come with me, I don't ever want to see you in this house again when I come home." I asked him if he was sure and he said yes - he didn't want a wife that cared more about other people than him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reminded him that he shouldn't talk that way to me, that if he was serious I would leave. I wouldn't stay where I wasn't wanted, and I told him he might regret it later when his anger passed. He said he might and left with his family. Then he sent me a message telling me he wanted me to get my things and leave. I asked him again if he was sure. He said yes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I packed quickly and was out in 30 minutes. I left my ring and the jewelry he bought me. My sister and mother say I should've kept them, but something about that felt icky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came home from his shopping trip and texted me - told me he couldn't believe I had moved out. That it hurt him that I left my ring, that it was a gift given in love and that he would flush it down the toilet. He said he would never let another woman make him cry; he never wanted another wife. He said so many things. He is still texting me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I write it all out like this I wonder why I was even still there. But when you are actually living it and you love the  person and you are accustomed to a certain level of abuse in your home  environment, the lines get very fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't go back, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won't go back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3731/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>I'm Not Strong</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/5kaoWelLPkg/</link><description>She's not feeling strong while grieving the loss of her partner.</description><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3741/</guid><category>Rape/Sexual Assault</category><category>Help With Loss</category><category>Helping Someone Who Is Grieving</category><category>How To Help Someone Who Has Lost A Spouse</category><category>Grief</category><category>Loss</category><category>Partner Loss</category><category>Adult Children of Childhood Sexual Abuse</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Sadness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm broken, &lt;a title="Fear Resources" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;afraid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Grief resources" href="../../../../grief-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;grieving&lt;/a&gt;, mourning the &lt;a title="Loss Resources" href="../../../../loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt; of the man I still love. I'm in constant &lt;a title="Pain Resources" href="../../../../pain-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;. I miss my life before the accident, before I was broken. And yet you pat my hand and say, "You're so strong. You're handling this so well." You refuse to acknowledge that I don't feel strong. You refuse to see that I'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My pain, my suffering makes you uncomfortable. We don't talk about these things in our family.  I want to break down and cry, I want to wail and ask why this happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that life is not fair. I have known it since I was &lt;a title="Child Sexual Abuse Resources" href="../../../../incest-child-sexual-abuse/" target="_blank"&gt;molested&lt;/a&gt; by a relative when I was five years old. I was reminded when I was &lt;a title="Rape/Sexual Assault Resources" href="../../../../rape-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;raped&lt;/a&gt; at seventeen. I had my nose broken when I was eighteen on Martin Luther King Day because my skin was the wrong color. I've never thought that life is fair, I know better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never brought those things up because I was taught that strength is suffering in silence. Strength is not talking about your feelings. Strength is keeping other people's secrets, even when you shouldn't. Strength is taking care of everyone even though your heart is breaking. Strength is putting others' needs first, even when you can barely take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I can't do it anymore. I'm not that strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/I_Just_Need_You_To_Listen.jpg" alt="I Just Need You To Listen " width="600" height="445" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I refuse to hide my pain. I need you to bear witness. Just listen to me when I cry, hand me a tissue, hold my hand. I don't expect you to fix things, there is no fix. I just need you to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don't tell me I shouldn't  feel broken, useless, discouraged, and so terribly hurt. This is how I feel. If my feelings haven't changed  in the last 531 days what makes you think you can change them by telling me not to feel this way? I'm not strong and you saying I'm strong doesn't make it true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please just be there when I cry. Hold my hand in the car because I still have &lt;a title="PTSD Resources" href="../../../../ptsd-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;flashbacks&lt;/a&gt;. Listen to me when say I'm hurting and just need to talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday I'll be strong again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3741/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Self-Loathing</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/gJwFlgqset4/</link><description>The author struggles to find a positive self-image.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3738/</guid><category>Childhood Bullying</category><category>Self-Image</category><category>Self Esteem</category><category>Self-Loathing</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme self-loathing can distort a person's body image and lead to depression and isolation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how and why I am consumed with &lt;a title="Self-Loathing Resources" href="../../../../self-loathing-self-hatred-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;self-hatred&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day seem so exhausting and painful. I am truly disgusted by myself. Mostly, my body. My hair, arms, legs, and anything on my body is so unattractive. Some days I feel so ugly and unwanted that I lay in bed for hours and cry. I spend a lot of money on makeup so that I will look nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most days I am late for work or class, because I am so insecure about myself that I stare in the mirror for too long or I try over and over and over again to fix the "elements of ugly." My makeup takes almost an hour to do, because I want to hide what I hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, I am truly disgusted by myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really hate my fat body. I always say, "I am a skinny chick living in a fat chick's body." I believe that it is true. I have a theory. My theory is that I am in the wrong body. Everything else is great about me. I am a great friend and lover, really smart, and I have a great personality, but I look like a monster. I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I am walking somewhere, I feel so cautious. I feel like everyone is looking at how fat and out-of-breath I am. It exhausts me to write this, it is almost too hard to write. When I am walking or out somewhere, if someones laughs I get paranoid because I think they are possibly talking about me and laughing at how ugly and fat I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Every since I was a small child, I remembered being &lt;a title="Childhood Bullying Resources" href="../../../../childhood-bullying-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bullied&lt;/a&gt; about my image. I also noticed how fat I was, how I was larger than all the other children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I cannot live my life or be happy in this skin. It is so gross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Everything bad that happens, I blame myself and I always say that if I was beautiful and thin, my life would be better. I would feel good about myself. I could wear beautiful clothes. I would have more friends. I could shop wherever and find clothes in my size. I could walk in confidence knowing that most people admire my thinness and beauty. I could be the loud, funny, smart and desirable girl that everyone would like to say "hello" to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But instead I am this fat, short, chubby, ugly, gross monster that is always &lt;a title="Loneliness Resources" href="../../../../loneliness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;alone&lt;/a&gt;. I am gross. In the mirror, my reflection sickens me. I just want to be beautiful. That is all I want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;It is hard to live in skin that you hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3738/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dose Of Happy: Sunrise On Love</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/RFXP9GCYX9w/</link><description>She found her happy while at the beach for a wedding.</description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3740/</guid><category>Marriage and Partnership</category><category>A Dose of Happy</category><category>Love</category><category>Happiness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="174" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;textarea id="textarea" style="height: 150px; width: 150px; margin-top: 10px;" readonly="readonly"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3740//"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Last weekend my fiance and I had the great honor to be a part of a beautiful wedding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;The ceremony was simple, sweet, and performed by the father of one of the other bridesmaids.

No fun for my mother. When she was delivered via &lt;a title="Cesarean Section Resources" href="../../../../cesarean-section/" target="_blank"&gt;C-Section&lt;/a&gt;, the umbilical cord was around her neck. She was immediately rushed to another hospital 40 miles away - this was in the 70's before Life Flight helicopters existed - fighting for her life. Mom didn't even get to hold her before she was taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amazing thing is that she survived. In fact, she beat the odds and lived to be 41 years old. My parents were told by other parents with a child like Jenny that she wouldn't live past her 21st birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny was unable to walk. She had &lt;a title="Scoliosis Resources" href="../../../../scoliosis-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;scoliosis&lt;/a&gt;, was wheelchair bound, and was tube-fed. She was unable to speak but made sounds like a baby. Because of her condition, she had to go through endless surgeries and numerous hospital visits. My childhood involved long car rides to hospitals and hours in waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of her condition her organs often shifted. She would sometimes  have a bloated and hard stomach with blocked bowels, which  meant more trips to the hospital. She also suffered from horrible allergies  and could get sick at the drop of a hat. She was often hospitalized for  pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister actually was close to death countless times. In fact, my  Grandfather helped pay for her headstone and her funeral was already  paid for. How many people do that? Who has their own child's death  planned and paid for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister graduated in 1993, then was placed in a group home under a program called Mosaic that was able to provide a home for my sister and her long time roommate, and could provide the around the clock care that my parents couldn't because my mother's early symptoms of &lt;a title="Multiple Sclerosis Resources" href="../../../../multiple-sclerosis-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; surfaced at that time. Dad had his hands full with a fifteen year old &lt;a title="Autism Resources" href="../../../../autism-asdresources/" target="_blank"&gt;autistic&lt;/a&gt; son, and nine year old (normal) me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accepted my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never asked why Jenny was the way she  was, or my mom, or my brother. It was normal for me. I tend to be more  compassionate towards people because of this. One of my best friends has  CP too and gave birth to my super cute nine month old nephew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister did lead a normal life regardless. She went to the  casinos in Branson and she loved music, including Polka. She was a very  bubbly and happy woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the hard shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 7, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her death was so sudden. I can replay like it was yesterday. I was on the night shift at our local hospital where I work the switchboard. My Dad came by my office window, stricken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first I thought&amp;nbsp;it was Mom (she had just home from her hospital stay that Monday) but Dad tearfully said it was Jenny. She was not breathing and was being rushed in. I hugged him and told him I would be there as soon as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept going "shit, shit, shit." My sister was not breathing. I would have to make the announcement that a cardiac arrest patient was coming in. Fuck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat in agony waiting for the dreaded code phone to ring. It didn't. The call came through on the switchboard, but I knew already. I somehow made the announcement overhead and got a hold of everyone. I called the Hospital Chaplain who knows my family situation, but because of HIPAA I couldn't tell him it was my sister. I squeaked out he needed to come for a code patient and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat at the desk with my head in my hands taking deep breaths, praying that I could be relieved so I could be with my dad and Jenny. Within minutes the other shift arrived. I hastily explained what had happened and was out the door in a flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran into the arms of the staff member who was with my sister when she stopped breathing. She explained to me Jenny's stomach was so hard that she screamed out in pain. As they had tried to move her to her wheelchair, she had stopped breathing. I began to cry "I called the code on my own sister."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the ER the doctor pulled us aside and said the dreaded words. "It doesn't look good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically there was one choice to be made: turn off the machines and let her&amp;nbsp;go. She had gone without oxygen for a few minutes between her house and the hospital, so her chances of pulling out of this one (she had pulled through once before six years ago) were slim. I had seen her brown eyes; they were glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I admired my dad for making that call, even though she already had a "do not resuscitate" order. I don't think I could have. Forty-one years gone, just like that. She laid there turning blue and cold. I'll never forget that image.&amp;nbsp;We're pretty sure it was her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hated myself afterward because I had so much &lt;a title="guilt resources" href="../../../../guilt-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;guilt&lt;/a&gt;. Because of my work schedule, I hardly made it over to visit her. The last time I saw her was her birthday in October. I labeled myself the "bad sister."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was a blur. We had to start making the arrangements and phone calls. I stepped up to be a good daughter. I felt I&amp;nbsp;owed it to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was telling Mom. Dad and I told her, but she just kind of looked at our tear-stained faces, said "Well this was something I didn't want to hear" and changed the subject. I almost wanted to shake her and scream "Your daughter&amp;nbsp;just died!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I later asked Dad if it even sank in because of her MS. Dad said it would eventually. He later told me he spoke to staff at the nursing home to make sure they would sit down with her and explain to her what was going on and that it was okay to be &lt;a title="Sadness Resources" href="../../../../sadness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;sad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother was a concern too. Being autistic, we weren't sure how he'd handle it. Dad said he seemed to understand. He volunteered to be a pallbearer. He doesn't like crowds or being around people that much, but he held his own and was happy to return to his job and activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt all kinds of hurt in the days after her passing and her funeral. I'd never experienced this kind of pain and I'd been through the worst. I'm no stranger to death, either. I've lost three &lt;a title="Grandparent Loss Resources" href="../../../../grandparent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;grandparents&lt;/a&gt;, and had a cousin that committed &lt;a title="Suicide Resources" href="../../../../suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone says it's different when you lose someone closer to you like a &lt;a title="Parent Loss Resources" href="../../../../parent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;parent&lt;/a&gt; or sibling. The two-week mark was the hardest. I cried so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like this has aged me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always joke that I'm 29 going on 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a month later and I still get sad. I foolishly tried to rush the grieving process along because normally I'm a pretty happy person, despite all the struggles my family faces. Everyone says it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3736/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Is This Really Happening?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/zXYWzGHEfDg/</link><description>She looks back at how her relationship has progressed to this point.</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3733/</guid><category>Relationships</category><category>Marriage and Partnership</category><category>Flings Glitter!</category><category>Happyness</category><category>Love</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday I became engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a title="Romantic Relationship Resources" href="../../../../romantic-relationship-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;boyfriend&lt;/a&gt; of two years took me to the house that we are in the process of purchasing after dinner, had electric candles lit and lining the sidewalk up to the door and proposed right there on the front porch. I was completely in shock and cried hysterically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I said yes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very strange feeling, looking down at the ring on my finger and realizing, "Wow, I'm going to be someone's wife. I'm going to have a husband!" Never in a million years would I have ever thought I was going to get &lt;a title="Marriage Resources" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I met my now fiance, I was the&amp;nbsp;notorious&amp;nbsp;"Lone Ranger." The hard, sometimes cold, crass, asshole friend that every group seems to have. She could drink the men under the table, cuss like a&amp;nbsp;sailor, spout off disgusting jokes that could make the most&amp;nbsp;perverted&amp;nbsp;blush, and never seemed to take relationships seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was me, and I played the role well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After growing up and hearing over and over that I needed a man to complete me, make me happy, and to take care of me, I started to become a little resentful. I set out to prove that I didn't need a fucking man to do anything for me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most girls my age were planning their dream weddings or popping out babies, I was working 50 hours a week, paying my own bills and joking with my friends that if my vibrator could mow the lawn, I'd be all set! It was my life, I made it, and I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, as most things do, it all changed in a flash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met him. He was hilarious, loved the same music and movies, was just as&amp;nbsp;outrageous&amp;nbsp;and crude as I was and had the most beautiful green eyes I had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was smitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sent me flowers, wrote little poems, stayed up until the wee hours of the morning just to make sure that I got home from work okay. We would spend our weekends drinking, sharing secrets, listening to music, and having the most mind-blowing sex I had ever&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came as a complete shock, but I was falling in &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; with him. I had never been in love before, nor I had never allowed myself to, so this was a brand new&amp;nbsp;experience. It was nothing like how it's described in books or the media. It was the most raw, painful thing I had ever felt, but it was so natural I couldn't help but embrace it. My heart&amp;nbsp;literally&amp;nbsp;ached and my breath caught in my chest whenever I spoke about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it scared the hell out of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had never allowed myself to be&amp;nbsp;vulnerable, how the hell did this happen!? I had severe trust issues due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Trauma Resources" href="../../../../trauma-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;traumatic&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;experiences&amp;nbsp;in grade school (a story for another day, I'm not strong enough to write that one yet), but somehow it was so easy to open up to him, because he was broken just like I was. But we fit together perfectly, our burned, stomped on, self-deprecating pieces fit. He makes me feel beautiful and I make him feel strong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And 2 years later, I am still as in love with him as the first time he kissed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still sinking in, but I couldn't be &lt;a title="Happiness Resources" href="../../../../happiness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;happier&lt;/a&gt; to be his wife and I couldn't (literally) imagine living the rest of my life with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3733/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A Letter I Will Send To My Father</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/c-2w9eSJe3A/</link><description>She wants to email her father to be able to discuss their estrangement.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3726/</guid><category>Childhood</category><category>Relationships</category><category>Estrangement</category><category>Loss</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Anger</category><category>Sadness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am writing an email to my father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I saw him, we were at a park. I went there to have a conversation with him about my childhood. It was a hard conversation. Uncomfortable. Painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation developed as I expected it would:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He denied the truth; I provided evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He put up walls of flimsy excuses; I knocked them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He banged his hands down on the picnic table, stood up, and walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he left, he yelled across the parking lot that he would always love me, but his actions that day yelled something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also things that I didn't expect (but probably should have), like the way he lied to everyone who would listen about why we no longer had a relationship, and the the way he said terrible, untrue things about my husband to those same people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/Confront_The_Dark_Parts_Of_Yourself.jpg" alt="Confront The Dark Parts Of Yourself" width="600" height="349" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That conversation happened &lt;a title="Estrangement Resources" href="../../../../estrangement-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;seven years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Almost eight. I did not get to say all the things I wanted, &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt;, to say before he walked away. But I grew to be okay with that. It was clear that my father did not want to take the steps necessary to have a relationship with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mourned the &lt;a title="Loss Resources" href="../../../../loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;loss&lt;/a&gt; of my father, and moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the phone calls started.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He called last year, and talked like nothing was wrong, like no time had passed. I spent weeks afterward jumping every time the phone rang; preparing myself to hear his voice again, and to tell him that we had to talk about that conversation in the park. It would be six months before he called again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week the phone rang. It was a quick call, but in the few minutes we spoke, he mentioned making plans to drive down here for a visit. He has my address. I do not want to turn my father away at the door, but I will, because it is unacceptable for him to have contact with my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is why I am writing an email.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to give him one last chance. I want to give myself one last chance, too. This time I will say &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the things I wanted to say seven years ago, and not hold back. I will have time to choose my words very carefully. And he will be afforded the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to have a father again. I hate to admit that - it feels weak after so many years of standing firm in my &lt;a title="Emotional Boundaries Resources" href="../../../../emotional-boundaries-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;boundaries&lt;/a&gt;, but I love him. &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I love him&lt;/a&gt;, and I want him to choose me over his pride, over his denial, over the carefully maintained public persona he maintains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accountability is not his forte, and accountability is exactly what I am going to require of him if he wants to have a relationship with me or my family. I do not have high expectations for a positive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how (or if) he answers, it may very well be the last contact I ever have with him. I thought I had mourned and moved forward, but suddenly I feel like the same person I was seven years ago. Once again I am sitting at the picnic table, staring into my father's eyes as he lies to me and makes excuses. I am watching him walk away, and wishing he would just choose me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that was seven years ago, and this is now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I am stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3726/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Getting Pregnant Led To My Infertility</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/weGH45jzG0w/</link><description>Her recurrent pregnancies resulted in her infertility.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3718/</guid><category>Infertility</category><category>Secondary Infertility</category><category>Pregnancy</category><category>Pregnancy After A Loss</category><category>Prenatal Complications</category><category>Grief</category><category>Ectopic Pregnancy</category><category>Recurrent Pregnancy Loss</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a title="Secondary Infertility Resources" href="../../../../secondary-infertility-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Secondary infertility&lt;/a&gt; can occur as a result of illness, certain types of lifestyle choices, or by damage to the reproductive system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, you read that title and are all &amp;ldquo;whaaa??&amp;rdquo; Unfortunately that is what happened to me after my fourth and final pregnancy. I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a title="Pregnancy Resources" href="../../../../pregnancy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; four times and have one living child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first pregnancy was completely uneventful and totally successful. I gave birth to a wonderful baby girl in May of 2006. She is the light of my life and it goes without saying that I &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; her more fiercely than I&amp;rsquo;ve ever loved anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My second pregnancy, in June of 2007, ended in a &amp;ldquo;planned&amp;rdquo; &lt;a title="Abortion Resources" href="../../../../abortion-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;termination&lt;/a&gt;. I chose the word planned because it was a decision that my husband and I made together. It was undoubtedly the hardest decision of my life. I had to do what was right for me and my family at that time in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My third pregnancy in December of 2010 was my first &lt;a title="Ectopic Pregnancy Resources" href="../../../../ectopic-pregnancy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;ectopic pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started spotting four days after I got a positive home pregnancy test. I called the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office and for the two weeks following that positive pregnancy test I went every other day to the doctor&amp;rsquo;s office for a blood draw to check for increasing hormone levels and for intermittent ultrasounds to try and find the pregnancy. My levels increased, not at the normal rate but they were increasing. However, in all the ultrasounds that I had done the pregnancy was never found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late one Saturday night I began to have severe cramping and went to the ER right away. After thorough exams and an extremely painful ultrasound it was determined that I was going to need emergency surgery. Right then. At 3:30 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was alone and scared. A few hours after the operation, when I was in a not so drugged state, I was told that my body was trying to expel the pregnancy and I was beginning to bleed internally from the damage. The result of the surgery was not only the loss of my third pregnancy but the loss of my right ovary and fallopian tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fourth pregnancy in August of 2011 was my second ectopic and final pregnancy. Again like the first ectopic I starting having severe cramping a couple of weeks after my positive home test and headed to the ER. Unfortunately the timing of this couldn't have been worse; the day I went to the ER and found out that I was again having an ectopic pregnancy was the due date of the baby I lost from the first ectopic in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately this ectopic was found right away on the ultrasound that was done in the ER. Since this pregnancy was found and could be clearly diagnosed as an ectopic I did have the option of receiving an injection to terminate the unsuccessful pregnancy. The doctor and I chose the shot because of the fact that another surgery could be risky and I stood a chance of losing my remaining tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hindsight opting for the shot was by far, for me, the worst decision. After receiving the shot I had to have weekly blood draw appointments at my doctor&amp;rsquo;s office to make sure the hormone levels came down to zero. I went to these appointments for seven weeks after the shot was given. Each week was a reminder of the failure of my reproductive system. The failure of myself as a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months after my second ectopic pregnancy I elected to have an IUD placed. After the placement a routine ultrasound was performed and my doctor found something &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo; near my remaining ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an additional ultrasound was performed four weeks later it was determined that I had a couple ovarian cysts, that we would keep an eye on them and that they would probably go away. They didn&amp;rsquo;t go away. Seven months later I found myself faced with the decision of having surgery to go in and clean out the cysts. My doctor and I were hesitant to go the surgery route because of the risks. I ultimately chose to move forward with the surgery as I just wanted this nightmare to be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the operation in May of 2012 a damaged - damage sustained from the previous ectopic pregnancy - portion of my remaining left fallopian tube was removed. The portion of the remaining tube was &amp;ldquo;clipped&amp;rdquo; off as they would do in a tubal ligation. My doctor knew my wishes going into surgery and she did discuss this with my husband prior to completing the ligation and I am glad that she made that final determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up not having ovarian cysts but rather small pockets of damaged tubal tissue that had filled with fluid. Those were also removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a total of five years to get here but I am now at a point in my life where &lt;a title="Infertility Resources" href="../../../../infertility-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I will no longer be able to have any more biological children&lt;/a&gt;. I never thought this day would come. Even as a child I dreamed of being a mom to many children. &lt;a title="Adoption Resources" href="../../../../adoption-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Adoption&lt;/a&gt; is not totally out of the question but for now I need time for my soul to &lt;a title="Grief resources" href="../../../../grief-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I do have now are answers and closure. This door has closed but perhaps another one will open. I can take this information and move forward with my life and be the best possible &lt;a title="Parenting Resources" href="../../../../parenting-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;mom&lt;/a&gt; to the one child I do have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3718/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>How To Save A Life</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/T9IQ1EPaEwQ/</link><description>A woman shares her story of a suicide attempt and how someone saved her life.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3696/</guid><category>Relationships</category><category>Marriage and Partnership</category><category>How To Help Someone Who Is Depressed</category><category>Love</category><category>I Am The Face of Mental Illness</category><category>Depression</category><category>Teen Depression</category><category>Teen Self-Injury</category><category>Teens: Mental Illness</category><category>Teen Suicide</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 in 12 teens attempt suicide every year in the United States.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Teen Suicide" href="../../../../teen-suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I was sixteen years old and I wanted to die&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not because the emotionally &lt;a title="Teen Dating Abuse" href="../../../../teen-dating-abuse-resources-parents/" target="_blank"&gt;abusive&lt;/a&gt; jerk I had been dating dumped me for the third time, not because my mother had started taking more of her &lt;a title="Prescription Drug Abuse" href="../../../../prescription-drug-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;prescription pain medication&lt;/a&gt; than recommended, and not because I was failing geometry. &lt;a title="Understanding Common Motives Behind Suicide" href="../../../../understanding-common-motivation-suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I wanted to die because I already felt dead inside&lt;/a&gt;, so why not go for a matching set?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I met him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was three years older than me, and at the time that made him seem like the most mature of adults. He wasn't, of course, but when you're smacked by &lt;a title="Love" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; at first sight you think up all sorts of nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while, life seemed better. I could forget the slurred speech at home, the disappointed voice of my band director, even the gnawing little voice that said it would be so nice to just &lt;a title="Teen Self-Injury" href="../../../../teen-self-injury-self-harm-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;cut yourself&lt;/a&gt; a little bit more because no one would notice. All my focus was on this great guy who loved me, no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Teen Depression" href="../../../../teen-depression-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Then the dark thoughts came back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't matter that I was in love, or that The Dad had finally stopped cleaning his guns whenever my guy came over, or even that I was finally passing all my classes and had my music down pat. The dark thoughts come back, and being &lt;a title="Happiness" href="../../../../happiness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt; only makes them worse. Because if it's so dark when you're happy, &lt;a title="Depression" href="../../../../major-depressive-disorder-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;how much darker is it going to be when you aren't&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a bottle of pills - I can't remember if they were mine or hers - and I was holding them in my hand when he called. He said he was just thinking about me and wanted to talk. It hit me then that if I gave in to the dark thoughts, I would never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how they tell teenagers that &lt;a title="Suicide" href="../../../../suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;suicide&lt;/a&gt; isn't like the movies? That you're not around to see how much everyone misses you? I couldn't have cared less about any of that, but the thought that I'd never hear his voice again shook me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I broke down and told him what I was planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told me he was coming over, not to do anything until he got there. I told him I would try, but I didn't know if I could be strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I hung up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We lived in a semi-shady part of town that had a police station and an EMS station just around the block so when he called 911, they didn't have far to drive at all. The police arrived with an ambulance hot on their heels, knocking on my door in that authoritative way you see on television, ready to break it down if I didn't answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I answered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police asked if I was all right, if I had taken any pills. I told them the truth; I had flushed them down the toilet as soon as I got off the phone with my boyfriend. Just as they were telling the ambulance that they weren't needed, said boyfriend came tearing around the corner in his truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things moved very quickly after that. The police took my name and statement, gave me a lecture about dating a nineteen year old (apparently saving my life wasn't a good enough recommendation for them), and left me with my boyfriend. He didn't yell at me or tell me off, he just held me and apologized for calling 911, but he was afraid he would lose me. I told him I wasn't &lt;a title="Anger" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt; and that I would always be grateful for what he'd done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I married that guy six months ago. We haven't had the easiest life together but we're still just as in love as we were the day we sat on the sofa together and &lt;a title="How to Help Someone Who's Depressed" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;he told me that no matter how bad things get, he'll always be there for me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still believe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hasn't let me down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3696/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Project Self-Love: Puzzle Pieces</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/t9Zy9rQ77EU/</link><description>She is discovering how to begin loving herself.</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3729/</guid><category>How To Increase Self-Esteem</category><category>Project Self-Love</category><category>Self-Image</category><category>Self Esteem</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all do so much for other people. But do we do enough for ourselves? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's take a break for ourselves in March. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you take care of  yourself, The Band? How do you manage to do the little things when life  feels overwhelming?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I came across &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a video this morning that changed the way I see myself. Honestly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I'm not writing this to blame anyone. I  didn't even realize what was going on until today. I've always  bottled things up really tightly, so I can't expect anyone else to  notice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;See, here's the thing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was always really &lt;a title="Social Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../social-anxiety-disorder-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;awkward around people&lt;/a&gt;, especially as a kid. I was overweight and way too smart for my own good and didn't take care of myself, (What kid does, really?) and never really figured out the whole "social interaction" thing. As a result, I spent most of my formative years isolating myself and, more importantly, being &lt;a title="Social Isolation Resources" href="../../../../social-isolation-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; by other kids. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the time I became aware of this, I had already internalized the message that I wasn't good enough and wasn't worth helping. It meant that I ended up not liking myself much; I felt like I was a failure of a human being and ended up filtering and twisting everything I experienced to support that conclusion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I carried this weight with me right through to adulthood in the form of wicked, persistent &lt;a title="Self-Esteem Resources" href="../../../../self-esteem-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;self-esteem&lt;/a&gt; issues that fueled my &lt;a title="Depression Resources " href="../../../../depression-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. It also led me to hide my issues, because I figured nobody would really care about what the hell was going on inside my head. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even after I broke my silence and started trying to help myself, I still struggled with staying motivated enough to do it because I didn't feel like I was worth the effort it took to actually heal myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think that's changed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Something in that video clicked for me and made me see that it WASN'T MY FAULT that I ended up like that. I always blamed myself for my depression and self-image issues, but looking back I can see how they actually came about. I picked up the "you're worthless" message from the isolation I experienced and fully assimilated that into my internal monologue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel like a puzzle piece has clicked into place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/Puzzle_Piece_Has_Clicked_Into_Place.jpg" alt="Pieces Of A Puzzle" width="600" height="360" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I couldn't start changing until I figured out why I hated myself so much. Now that that's happened? Well, let's just say I think I'm ready to move on and maybe, just maybe, start really learning to like myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Band Back Together has been nominated for Best Group or Community Weblog in the 2013 Bloggies! &lt;a title="2013 Bloggies" href="http://2013.bloggi.es/" target="_blank"&gt;Visit their site&lt;/a&gt; to vote and check out the other categories!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3729/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Broken</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/ECWqC0-wIuU/</link><description>She feels she's a burden because of a recent accident.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3735/</guid><category>Heartbreak</category><category>Things That Suck</category><category>Relationships</category><category>Caregiver</category><category>Health and Wellness</category><category>It's Complicated</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Guilt</category><category>Sadness</category><category>Stress</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traumatic injuries can cause mental stress that can make it hard to heal physically and emotionally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel useless. Worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 30th, I hydroplaned off a country road and into a tree at nearly 50mph. I'm a damn good driver, but when your brakes are so coated with water they refuse to work at all, there's just not much you can do but pray and say oh shit when you realize you won't miss that thing hurtling toward you at high speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got out of it with only two broken bones and a crapton of bruises. Unfortunately, one of those broken bones was my tibia. I had my foot so hard on the brake when I hit that I managed to break the very bottom of my tibia vertically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine pulling apart string cheese but stopping just short of the middle, and that's basically my bone. Split right up the middle from where my ankle joint is almost halfway up. Originally, they thought I'd need surgery. I avoided that, thank god. Lucky again. So why do I feel so &lt;a title="guilt resources" href="../../../../guilt-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I've become a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, the accident wasn't my fault, no I didn't ask for it. But the results are the same. My poor girlfriend is left to &lt;a title="Caregiver Resources" href="../../../../caregiver-resource-page/" target="_blank"&gt;care&lt;/a&gt; not only for me, but our three young girls, one dog, three cats, three bedroom home, and all the shit that comes along with all of those things. Sometimes literal shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot put our children to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot do most of the daily/weekly household cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is left with all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watch her struggle knowing I cannot help, and knowing that 95% of what she does cannot be put off or ignored entirely. It has to be done, so she has to do it. I've priced out hiring a maid service to help her while I'm down and out -- our &lt;a title="Economic Struggles Resources" href="../../../../poverty-economic-struggles-hardship-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;budget&lt;/a&gt; just can't stretch that far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so much for such a prolonged time is killing her body. She goes to bed in more &lt;a title="Pain Resources" href="../../../../pain-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; each night. I can't even hold her while she cries at being overwhelmed, because between my ribs being so severely bruised and aching and having a club of a cast attached to me, it's just plain impossible to find a position that won't hurt one of us. She goes to sleep at night and I cry. If I cry when she can see me I only add to her &lt;a title="Stress Resources" href="../../../../stress-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I can't fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3735/</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
