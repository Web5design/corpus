I don't expect fairness from the world at large. But I feel like - and maybe this is me being a spoiled only child - we should try to be fair to those we supposedly love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's an &lt;a title="Alcoholism Resources" href="../../../../alcoholism-resources-2/" target="_blank"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt;, I know that too. He tells me so all the time, whenever I complain about his behavior or his attitude. Or whenever he feels bad. He's trying to fight his demons, he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I'm &lt;a title="Anger Resources" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt;. I'm supposed to be the bigger person and I am so fucking angry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We made a decision about today's schedule last night. Last night when he was perfectly sober, I must add. Today I followed that schedule and it turns out he is mad that I did. He feels like I left him out, even though that's what we decided last night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I'm the bitch. I'm starting the fight, because I wanted to know why he'd called me so angry. He is mad that his family wasn't there when he woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision wasn't even 12 hours old, but he changed his mind and is resentful that I didn't know that, that I didn't follow his new wishes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate that. I hate not being able to make plans, not even 12 hours in advance, because he doesn't know what kind of mood he'll be in. He might change his mind and he will be a resentful fucking child if he's committed to something and then changed his mind about it. Or he'll be mad at us if we've gone somewhere without him, because he told me he wanted to sleep late.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Marriage Problems Resources" href="../../../../Marriage-Problems-Resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I don't feel like I have a partner&lt;/a&gt;, I feel like I'm being bossed around by a petulant child.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that he is hurting. I know that he is trying to get better. I know that in a few hours, he will be my real husband for a while - the one who doesn't act like a petulant child. But then nighttime will come, he will have his five drinks after the kids go to bed - and he will be perfectly nice at that time too - and then in the morning he will be an asshole.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like I live with two people and one of them is a total dick. We can't afford &lt;a title="Therapy Resources" href="../../../../therapy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;counseling&lt;/a&gt;, rehab, or to live apart, really. I don't even know what's actually wrong with us. Are other men so resentful if they don't get to wake up whenever they choose? I know he has &lt;a title="Insomnia Resources" href="../../../../insomnia-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, which is his reason for drinking, but it just seems weird for someone in his thirties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gets resentful if I'm not available for sex whenever he wakes up, but he's also resentful if I wake him up early to have sex before I have stuff to do. He's resentful whenever I'm on the computer, but that's a big source of our income right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's like he doesn't know how to be a grownup anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3773/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A Letter I Can't Send: To My First Love</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/k4cYchdSDlc/</link><description>She writes a letter to her first love.</description><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3771/</guid><category>Breakups</category><category>Heartbreak</category><category>Relationships</category><category>Help With Relationships</category><category>Love</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all  have letters we'd like to  send,     but know that we can't.

Happy anniversary baby, I wish I would be able to say that to you on that day. I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to and there&amp;rsquo;s no one to blame except me.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m so &lt;a title="Fear Resources" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;scared&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like I made the wrong choice, but I had a good reason why I did what I did. I know I &lt;a title="Relationship Breakup Resources" href="../../../../relationship-breakup-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;broke your heart&lt;/a&gt;. I heard it in your voice during our last phone call. I can&amp;rsquo;t even express how much it hurt to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t love you - it felt like someone was ripping my heart out. I never felt so hurt in my life, but I will never be able to know how badly I hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I make the wrong choice though? You weren&amp;rsquo;t just my boyfriend, you were my best friend and I lost you. You&amp;rsquo;re no longer mine. I want to move on, but the reason I broke up with you wasn&amp;rsquo;t even you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's so hard to move on when I can&amp;rsquo;t even hate you. I&amp;rsquo;m still in love with your eyes, your laugh, your voice, the way you held my hand, the way you cared for me, the way you loved me. I miss you so much. Why does it hurt so much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want you back in my life. I can&amp;rsquo;t even make sure you&amp;rsquo;re okay because I live so far away. You don&amp;rsquo;t deserve this. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for what I did, I really am. If I could just hold you one last time, hear you say you loved me one last time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I let myself be so vulnerable with you. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid one day I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to see you be happy with some one else, and all I can do is accept it and be happy for you. I promised you "no matter what," and I broke that promise. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t blame you if you hated me. Sometimes I just wish I never met you. Maybe it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have hurt this much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still love you though, so much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3771/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Project Self-Care: Dharma</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/klOnsR-pl1Q/</link><description>She describes how her religion helps her practice self-care.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3728/</guid><category>Project Self-Care</category><category>Project Self-Love</category><category>Stress</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all do so much for other people. But do we do enough for ourselves? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let's take a break for ourselves. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do you take care of  yourself, The Band? How do you manage to do the little things when life  feels overwhelming?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am Buddhist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like to ask me, "Since when have you been Buddhist?" as if I just made the decision yesterday. I chose Buddhism when I was in college because I was frustrated with religion and no longer believed what my Catholic professors were telling me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like people say, Buddhism isn't a religion, it's a philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been an interesting road, to say the least. I had no idea there were so many sects! After reading up on every kind of Buddhism I could find, I knew I'd made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/04/One_Can_Always_Begin_Again.jpg" alt="Buddha Quote" width="600" height="264" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We practice mindfulness and living in the now, not looking behind us at the past or getting too worked up about the future. I'm not gonna lie, it's hard. But it gives me the opportunity to practice self-care because I know that the only thing I can truly control is myself, and that if I'm going to be successful I need to be calm, rational and &lt;a title="Compassion" href="../../../../compassion-compassionate-empathy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;compassionate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation is one way I use Buddhism to take time for myself. By simply slowing down, sitting in the quiet with some rain sounds or in the shower with the water running, I'm able to clear my mind of &lt;a title="Stress" href="../../../../stress-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;everything that stresses me out&lt;/a&gt; and simply &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;be &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;for a little while. And when I'm done, the path I need to take is a little clearer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddha once said, "No matter how hard the past, one can always begin again." To do that takes a tremendous amount of self-love and courage, but it is possible and the best way to start is with doing little things to strengthen our relationship with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a walk. Read a book. Meditate. No matter what, remember that we all have the potential for enlightenment inside us and &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is all the more reason to &lt;a title="Love" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namaste!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3728/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Marry Me, Dr. Adler</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/b53KNBPqS7U/</link><description>She talks about a potential hard diagnosis and its outcome.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3745/</guid><category>Things That Suck</category><category>Parenting</category><category>Brain Disorders</category><category>The Gratitude Project</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Fear</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Okay, maybe not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The fact that I love my &lt;a title="Marriage Resources" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;husband&lt;/a&gt; deeply might cause problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And I noticed you already had a wedding band (don't ask me why I noticed, I just did. I was single for a long time, sheesh). But there must be some way to show the world how deeply I esteem you. How deeply I appreciate you. You have made our family so &lt;a title="Happiness Resources" href="../../../../happiness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt;. You are one great doctor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Are you all wondering whether I've had liposuction? Or maybe if my &lt;a title="Ulcerative Colitis Resources" href="../../../../ulcerative-colitis-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;colitis&lt;/a&gt; has been cured? Or that I've grown five inches? No. Dr. Adler is neither a plastic surgeon nor a gastroenterologist. Dr. Adler is a pediatric neurosurgeon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month when we brought Lovebug in for his 12 month check up, his pediatrician was worried about his head shape. Specifically, that the plates might have fused too early. Unfortunately, we were moving less than a week after the appointment so we had to get it checked out in New Jersey. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The pediatrician here was also concerned. He wanted us to see a neurosurgeon - to skip the in-between step of the neurologist altogether. Naturally, our insurance is not accepted by most doctors in Bergen County. The ones that did accept our insurance could see us in October.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;By that point, I had done some research. While Lovebug's head did not resemble any of the misshapen heads of babies with craniosynostosis, I was still &lt;a title="Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../anxiety-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;worried&lt;/a&gt;. If they did not fix it soon, there could be pressure on his brain. The pediatricians had barely talked to me about anything else, like his behavior and whatnot, so worried were they about his head. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;So between my mother talking to her doctor, a doctor he knew (and his kind appointment maker) and me talking to my insurance company, we found a pediatric neurologist. I made the regular pediatrician give us a referral to the pediatric neurologist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yesterday we went to our first appointment. Dr. Adler came out to the waiting room and brought us back to the exam room himself. He was warm, kind and clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He chatted with Lovebug and felt his head.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Adler explained everything in layman's terms and even offered to show us pictures of babies with real problems on his computer. We declined, having already seen them. The bottom line was that while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the space between &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lovebug's skull plates may have fused early, this had not affected his head size (which is very large, to tell the truth), his head shape, or his behavior (since he walks, talks a bit and does not have seizures).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Adler declared him perfectly fine. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;After imagining MRIs and CT scans, rounds with specialists and surgery, yesterday's appointment could not have gone better. But if something had been wrong, you can bet for damn sure that I would want Dr. Adler to fix it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wrote this post nearly 6 years ago.

We here at Band Back Together  are shining the spotlight on ALL survivors. Depression, Abuse, Trauma.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's time to take back the power.&amp;nbsp;Tell us how YOU have taken the power back in your life!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society talks a lot about empowerment. Let's empower the women, let's empower the minorities, let's empower the dogs, empower the trees, empower the third world, empower the whales, empower the children, empower the differently abled. There's nothing wrong with any of that; these are all very noble pursuits. These are all things that need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I could never figure out how any of that applied to the real world as I understood it. Of course, having trouble figuring out how anything applied to the real world as I understood it wound up being a huge part of my &lt;a href="../../../../substance-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;. I tried to make life fit my world-vision rather than trying to understand my place in the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the process of working the 12 steps, I have learned that life will never fit my world-vision. That's okay today, because the flip side is that once I accept that life is life (and I can't change it) I can begin to harness the power of the universe, and I can live happy, joyous, and free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having survived addiction, more than one &lt;a href="../../../../how-to-help-friend-abusive-relationship/" target="_blank"&gt;abusive relationship&lt;/a&gt;, car accidents that should have killed me, &lt;a title="Successful Reintegration After Incarceration" href="../../../../successful-reintegration-incarceration/" target="_blank"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;, and other random shit, I realized that I was powerless over a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, how does powerlessness over addiction or diseased thought processes relate to our April theme "Take Back The Power"? How does accepting my individual powerlessness relate to taking back the power? Well, let me try to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I admitted that I was powerless over my &lt;a href="../../../../addiction-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; (and the sick thought processes that go along with it that led me into abusive relationships, reckless driving, prison, and other random shit), I had to seek some power from some other source. It was too painfully obvious that I, alone, had none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where did I find this power? From fellow &lt;a href="../../../../recovery-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;recovering addicts&lt;/a&gt;; from you beautiful folks here at The Band; from a power greater than myself. My Higher Power speaks to me through all of you, through other people in recovery (whether it is recovery from addiction, surgery, &lt;a title="Cancer" href="../../../../cancer-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever else), and through the wonders that surround me every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding power, for me, started when I admitted and accepted that I had no power on my own. That is not to say that I am a weak, useless creature. It just means that I had no way of doing anything BY MYSELF. It took a fellowship of like-minded people to help me stop using, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live. It took people who cared about victims of &lt;a href="../../../../help-I%27m-domesic-abusive-relationship/" target="_blank"&gt;domestic violence&lt;/a&gt; to help me find a way to break the cycle and find a healthy relationship based on dignity and trust. It took a whole Band of strangers to help me realize that we are all connected, regardless of the individual circumstances that make any of us feel different and alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/04/We_Can_Recover.jpg" alt="Together We Can" width="600" height="400" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, together, we together can do what not one of us can do alone. Together, we can recover, we can break the cycle of violence, we can survive loss, we can survive illness. Although each of us alone may be powerless over something, together we can harness the power of the human spirit and do some powerful shit. Together, we are damn near unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took admitting I was powerless for me to find some power and strength. It took admitting I had a problem to find a solution to what ailed me and my life. It took a lot of help to do that; I didn't do it alone. It took a village to raise this child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, each and every one, for being part of my village. Thank you, each and every one of you (addicts and earthlings alike) for helping me find the power to recover from addiction. Thank you for helping me harness the power of God as I understand it and break the cycle of domestic abuse. Thank you, each of you, for your quiet, loving acceptance that helps me keep my prison time in the past and gives me a chance to be a normal human being today. Thank you, all of you, for the love that flies through cyberspace when the pain from old injuries prevents me from functioning like ME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes a village to raise a child. Together, WE can do what I cannot do alone. Take back the power. And if you are powerless over something, let's harness our collective power. It's why we're here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3780/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Letter I Can't Send To The Man Who Killed My Fiancé </title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/jZS68vmDEgQ/</link><description>She writes a letter to the man who was responsible for her fiance's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3765/</guid><category>Help With Loss</category><category>A Letter I Can't Send</category><category>Love</category><category>Partner Loss</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Anger</category><category>Sadness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all  have letters we'd like to send,     but know that we can't.

We met at a fireworks display on a Friday in May.  He made me laugh and we had a lively discussion about books we had both read and books we would like to read in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been single on purpose for almost eight years. I had spent the first five years working on being the best person I could be, improving my physical, mental, and emotional health.  Sometimes I enjoyed being single and felt no pressure to be involved in a &lt;a title="Romantic Relationship Resources" href="../../../../romantic-relationship-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;relationship&lt;/a&gt;. There were dates and casual relationships but nothing serious. I traveled, spent time with my family, worked at a challenging, demanding job that I loved and all was well in my world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting Dave threw me for a loop. I never expected to fall in &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; again, especially with a man who was 21 years older than me, but I did. Things moved pretty quickly and in September of 2011 he asked me to marry him and I said yes. We both knew that I would most likely outlive him and I was okay with that because I planned to make the most of the time we had together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On October 2, 2011 Dave and I were on our way to have brunch with my family to tell them that we were getting married and to get my parents' blessing. As we were nearing our exit we got a flat tire. Dave quickly pulled off the freeway and onto the shoulder. We got out the spare tire and jack and I gave my mom a quick call to let her know we would be late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had just dropped my phone in my purse and started to turn to Dave with the owner's manual when I heard the sound of metal on metal. I turned towards Dave and that chilling sound and there you were, losing control of your motorcycle and careening towards us at high speed. I called out Dave's name hoping that he could get out of your way and then you and your motorcycle slammed into us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I flew through the air and landed in front of our car.  I knew I needed to quickly determine the extent of the damage to me so I could help Dave. There was so much pain and I could smell blood and hot asphalt.  I raised my head to check my legs and realized that both of my lower legs  were badly broken and I was in danger of bleeding to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn't see or hear Dave so I kept calling his name but he didn't answer. I panicked and started screaming for someone to help us. I knew then that Dave was dead. An ambulance came and I was rushed to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was later determined that you had been speeding, driving recklessly without insurance, racing your motorcycle, and were not qualified to ride a powerful motorcycle. Your decisions cost me more than I could bear to lose.  You killed Dave and a part of me &lt;a title="Loss Resources" href="../../../../loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;died with him&lt;/a&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should know something about the man you killed. He was a retired Marine who survived combat and duty in South America during the war on drugs. He was fighting &lt;a title="Cancer Resources" href="../../../../cancer-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; until  the day he died. He was a father, a brother, a son, and the love of my life.  He was intelligent with a dry and irreverent sense of humor.  He was learning to play the guitar and he loved the ocean. There are too many things to write here, but I just want you to know he was a good man who was greatly loved and is still missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spent four months in the hospital and am still in physical therapy. I had over twenty surgeries to rebuild my legs and I had learned how to walk again. Last month the screws holding my left leg together snapped and so I'm back in the wheelchair again while we wait for the insurance company to approve or deny the request for surgery. I may lose this leg if it can't be rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in constant pain and nothing really helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="PTSD Resources" href="../../../../ptsd-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;PTSD&lt;/a&gt; has been horrible, I barely leave the house. The flashbacks and nightmares are debilitating and scary, but I am trying to work on them. I have so many physical and emotional issues that I can't list them all here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to know why you did this to us. I want to know why you were so reckless, popping wheelies and speeding. Was it worth it? Do you care about the man you killed and the lives left in shambles? I can't &lt;a title="Forgiveness Resources" href="../../../../forgiveness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; you  and I can't forget what happened when I am faced with horrific scars everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can't wish you the best because I'm very &lt;a title="Anger Resources" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Sadness Resources" href="../../../../sadness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;sad&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a title="Pain Resources" href="../../../../pain-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, and I &lt;a title="Grief resources" href="../../../../grief-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;miss&lt;/a&gt; Dave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope someday you experience what I have experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3765/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dose Of Happy: Moving Day</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/z4AfYPe7emo/</link><description>Her fiance's father has a new home and this makes her happy.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3776/</guid><category>Multiple Sclerosis</category><category>What To Expect With Multiple Sclerosis</category><category>A Dose of Happy</category><category>Happiness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="174" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;textarea id="textarea" style="height: 150px; width: 150px; margin-top: 10px;" readonly="readonly"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3776//"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;He's all moved in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;For the last month or so, my fiance and I have been working hard to find a new Assisted Living Facility for his father. His dad has MS and as the disease progresses, his level of care needs continues to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Late in February, he was transported to a local hospital after a fall. It was quickly made clear that his current home would no longer be able to meet his medical needs. Because of insurance red tape, finding him a new home was not as simple as one might hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;Last week, that all changed. A new facility was found within a short drive from our own home. The new facility will be able to meet my future father-in-law's needs, even on the worst of days. Friday was spent clearing out his old room and moving him into his new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;It was an enormous amount of work and I'm exhausted both physically and mentally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;But he's all moved in. He's in a safe place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;He'll be getting the care he needs. The care he DESERVES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;My heart is happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;**************************&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's your Happy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't think you have one?

When they occur together it can be even harder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that a man can shave his head and have no one comment on it, but if a woman is bald it is a huge deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just hair.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people I&amp;rsquo;ve run into since getting my new &amp;lsquo;do just ignore it. After all, if you don&amp;rsquo;t mention it, it isn&amp;rsquo;t there, right? The few who have commented assume I have some sort of &lt;a title="Cancer Resources" href="../../../../cancer-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and start with the &amp;ldquo;I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing okay. Is the chemo going well?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started by using a simple answer of &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have cancer, I just got carried away with the clippers&amp;rdquo; and made a joke of it. Then I started giving a slightly more accurate answer of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not cancer. I shaved my head because my &lt;a title="Lupus Resources" href="../../../../lupus-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt; rash was spreading to my scalp and it&amp;rsquo;s easier to treat.&amp;rdquo; People don&amp;rsquo;t like that answer as much. It&amp;rsquo;s not funny, and lupus isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;fashionable&amp;rdquo; illness like cancer is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one wants to think of rashes. Rashes are yucky and make you think of oozing sores and things like that. And my talking about it draws their attention to all the things they obviously try very hard to ignore, like the sores and scars all over my face that I am no longer bothering to hide with make-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday even that answer wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it for me and I went for brutal honesty. Part of it was that I was in a very bad mood and was too tired to go anywhere. Part of it was that I am sick of how our society completely ignores &lt;a title="Mental Illness Resources" href="../../../../mental-illness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt; in all its forms. So, when confronted with the &amp;ldquo;cancer&amp;rdquo; comment from a former friend/acquaintance I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard from in years, I told the whole truth. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t have cancer. My lupus rash - which you can see here all over my face - spread to my scalp and I had to shave my head to make sure it was just a rash and not worms coming out of my head. Being sick like this makes it hard to control my &lt;a title="Schizophrenia Resources" href="../../../../schizophrenia-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and I just had to be sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that conversation didn&amp;rsquo;t last long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I really give a shit. It&amp;rsquo;s just hair. I should be able to shave my head without it being a public issue. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be shunned because my illness isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;fashionable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends and strangers come out of the woodwork to rally behind you if you have cancer, but most of those same people will turn and run if you mention schizophrenia or &lt;a title="Bipolar Disorder Resources" href="../../../../bipolar-disorder-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This needs to change - and fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, those of us with mental illness are usually unable to stand up for ourselves. And our family and friends are too busy trying to pretend it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3761/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>My Rape Story </title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/VOdnKRmdEWw/</link><description>She shares her story of date rape.</description><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3766/</guid><category>Date/Acquaintance Rape</category><category>I Am The Face Of Rape</category><category>Intimate Partner Rape</category><category>Rape/Sexual Assault</category><category>Teen Rape</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One in five women reported she had been raped or sexually assaulted in her lifetime.

He seemed so perfect, and he made me happier than I thought I ever could be. He was the sweetest and nicest guy that I thought I could have in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then things changed. He thought that we needed to hang out everyday, so everyday he would come down. He would &lt;a title="Emotional Abuse Resources" href="../../../../emotional-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;follow me everywhere I went&lt;/a&gt;. I couldn't go anywhere without him or he would get mad and accuse me of &lt;a title="Infidelity Resources" href="../../../../infidelity-relationships/" target="_blank"&gt;cheating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night I stayed at his house. He got drunk and wanted me to have sex with him. I said no. He pushed me on the bed and got on top of me. I tried to push him off but he was too strong and he wouldn't let me get up. Screaming wouldn't have helped me because no one but us was at his house. I didn't know what else to do so I just laid there scared out of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pulled my pants and underwear down and I pulled them back up, so he took them off again and threw them across the room. I was so scared. Then he was in me and it hurt so bad that I started crying. I was paralyzed the whole time. Finally he got off of me and I went and got my clothes. I laid in the bed, shocked and horrified.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't know what to do and it hurt so bad that I just laid there curled up and crying. He took my phone so I couldn't find it to call for help or call my parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've held this in for 8 months because I was so &lt;a title="Fear Resources" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;scared&lt;/a&gt;, and my family had enough problems to deal with before this all happened. I'm not with him now because he was &lt;a title="Substance Abuse Resources " href="../../../../substance-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;doing drugs&lt;/a&gt; and I didn't need that in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, I was a very bright and outgoing person. I would do stuff with my family and friends, but after the &lt;a title="Rape/Sexual Assault Resources" href="../../../../rape-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;rape&lt;/a&gt; I am so &lt;a title="Depression Resources" href="../../../../depression-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;depressed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Suicide Resources" href="../../../../suicide-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;suicidal&lt;/a&gt; that I just don't know what to do. It's so hard to deal with something like this. It's hard for me to sleep at night because I &lt;a title="PTSD Resources" href="../../../../ptsd-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;have nightmares&lt;/a&gt; about the whole incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just needed to tell someone my story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3766/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Fuck Cancer</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/nhPCyVT9M-s/</link><description>Her sister is battling cancer and she's scared.</description><pubDate>Fri, 29 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3762/</guid><category>Cancer</category><category>Breast Cancer</category><category>How To Help A Friend With Cancer</category><category>Grief</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Anger</category><category>Fear</category><category>Sadness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diagnosis of cancer affects the entire family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, my sister was diagnosed with &lt;a title="Breast Cancer" href="../../../../breast-cancer-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;stage four breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was 35 at the time, had a twelve year old son, ten year old daughter, and a three year old daughter. She underwent months of &lt;a title="What To Expect During Radiation Treatments" href="../../../../what-to-expect-radiation-treatments/" target="_blank"&gt;radiation&lt;/a&gt;, a double &lt;a title="Mastectomy" href="../../../../mastectomy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;mastectomy&lt;/a&gt; and then months of chemotherapy. Six lymph nodes were also affected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few of months ago she got the all clear from her oncologist that he didn't need to see her anymore, that she was cancer free.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been having a lot of pain in her hip the last few weeks and finally had a CT scan on Friday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Cancer" href="../../../../cancer-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;It's cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point we don't know if it's on the bone or in the bone, if it's metastasized, or if it's a whole new cancer. We know the odds are it has metastasized. We have been hoping and praying that it's a misdiagnosis or just a new cancer that can be treated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="How To Help A Friend With Cancer" href="../../../../how-to-help-a-friend-with-cancer/" target="_blank"&gt;Hope for the best and prepare for the worst&lt;/a&gt;, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister lives about 3500km away from our family. We do have some family where she is, but no one that is close to her. &lt;a title="Parent Loss" href="../../../../parent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Her husband's mom died&lt;/a&gt; in September and she was really the only family they had. Our mom and our brother live where I do.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want so badly to be there, but I just can't right now. We were planning a visit in June but it seems so far away. I want to be there with her right now. She's scared, her husband and kids are scared, I'm scared. She doesn't deserve this.

Now that I've put the pieces together, it seems so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I describe the feeling as running down a hill and not being able to stop. I do and say things that I wouldn't otherwise because I can't stop running. I can't stop seeking approval from others. I can't stop being disruptive even when I can see the consequences. And when I get to the bottom of the hill I hate myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a name for that state as a whole, but the behavior and feeling is &lt;a title="Impulse Control Disorders Resources" href="../../../../impulse-control-disorders-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;poor impulse control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night I lapsed into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about being on a new antidepressant. It has been amazing once I got adjusted to it. I feel so much more even-tempered and I don't agonize as much over &lt;a title="Social Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../social-anxiety-disorder-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;social situations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I forgot to take my pill (I'm terrible at remembering to take pills, but I've been pretty good so far, missing only two doses in two months) and so midway through my Sunday night tabletop roleplaying game I realized that I was running down that hill again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was being disruptive. I was interrupting and being snarky and rude. I was chafing against authority figures in and out of character. I was telling things that weren't mine to tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cried last night afterward, hating myself for my poor impulse control. Realizing that even if I wasn't fully in control of my behavior, I am fully in control of whether or not I take my pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a hard lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3759/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Ask The Band: What Do You Do When You Can't Dream?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/lMCu07T20MY/</link><description>She asks The Band how to chase dreams for herself now that she's a mother.</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3768/</guid><category>Parenting</category><category>Relationships</category><category>Ask The Band</category><category>Feelings</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here at The Band, we believe in kicking stigmas to the curb,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Glitter Flinging Resources" href="../../../../flings-glitter-resource-page/" target="_blank"&gt;flinging glitter&lt;/a&gt;, and shining a light into the dark.

That's what kept me moving forward. But now, I can't afford to be that person anymore. I can't reach for a life on the stage or in an art studio or out on a battlefield, trying to capture the story as it happens. I have my daughter; a dream that came true so much sooner then I ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where does that leave me? I have my dreams for my life with her, but what about just me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clung to the idea while, &lt;a title="Single Parenting" href="../../../../single-parenting-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;as a single mum&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;I would always be &lt;a title="Loneliness" href="../../../../loneliness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;alone&lt;/a&gt;. I hoped and wished for a man willing, strong enough, and good enough to deserve a chance into our lives. I never expected one to come out of no where, my old childhood friend now the &lt;a title="Love" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; of my life. But I thank God every day he is here. I can't imagine a world without him, nor would I want to. He is my dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once again, I have my dreams for my life with him, but what about just my life with me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Ask_The_Band_3.jpg" alt="Ask The Band" width="640" height="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go to a private art school. I love my field, but I'm tired of being &lt;a title="Adult Bullying" href="../../../../adult-bullying-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bullied&lt;/a&gt; by my department head, tired of being treated less then everyone else by everyone thanks to how I prefer to work and what I photograph. I'm so close to graduating (this time next year, I will be in my last half of a semester), but right now, I just want to give up. Photography is my love, my connection with &lt;a title="Parent Loss" href="../../../../parent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;my late mum&lt;/a&gt;, but it has NEVER been my passion. My passion was dance and the stage. But after an injury and birth of my daughter, that is never to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to finish, I know I need to, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I get yelled at for not wearing the right shoes to a gallery talk. I watch as those who have hurt me to the point I don't know I can ever &lt;a title="Forgiveness" href="../../../../forgiveness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; them get special treatment, while if I fail to do something after taking care of my sick daughter rather then going out to listen to a pointless talk, I fail the class. I'm tired of a school that looks away when we have problems. I'm so tired of this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm tired and sick of photography. If this continues, I will never pick up a camera again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I have a project in my studio class I'm excited for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to dream, want that goal to work towards, but I don't feel like I'm allowed to have that anymore. I don't even know what I would want. I miss the stage, I miss dance, but the adult side of me keeps laughing and telling me to stop wishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will never happen. So what do I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3768/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Drought Years</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/j4Z5ujp6x64/</link><description>A poem about love and relationships.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3753/</guid><category>Relationships</category><category>Love</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;you are beached bone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a study in severity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a man with crescent moon fists.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;desperate for what i thought you offered me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;i mistook &lt;a title="Anger Resources" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; and despotism&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for passion and instruction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;loving you,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;seeking the water in your desert,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;i settled in the dust.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a picture of contradiction&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you preached to me of love&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;though you knew nothing of it&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you know nothing of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;love overflows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;gentle and selfless,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;it heals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love corrected&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love dismembered&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love left me wandering.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you cannot find it within you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because it doesn't dwell there&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I pray for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;even as your tongue cuts me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and your delusions singe me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pray for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt; dwells in me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I've been blessed with an abundance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and it pours forth&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for him&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for everyone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because that's what love is&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;how it works&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;what it does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I &lt;a title="Forgiveness" href="../../../../forgiveness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; your words&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and your lies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I will always root for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a man in desperate need of transformation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;of love&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;of healing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and don't you know I tried?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;couldn't you feel the salve of my tongue?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;the presence of something bigger than you?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you walk on glass&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;purposely ignorant to the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;comfort available to you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I comfort myself, too&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and say&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;"nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3753/</feedburner:origLink></item></channel></rss>
