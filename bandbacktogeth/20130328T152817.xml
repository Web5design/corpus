And now?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your bandmate needs a sounding board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's time to &lt;a title="Ask The Band Category" href="../../../../category/ask-the-band/" target="_blank"&gt;Ask The Band!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always been a dreamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always tried to reach almost impossible goals. That's what kept me moving forward. But now, I can't afford to be that person anymore. I can't reach for a life on the stage or in an art studio or out on a battlefield, trying to capture the story as it happens. I have my daughter; a dream that came true so much sooner then I ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where does that leave me? I have my dreams for my life with her, but what about just me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I clung to the idea while, &lt;a title="Single Parenting" href="../../../../single-parenting-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;as a single mum&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;I would always be &lt;a title="Loneliness" href="../../../../loneliness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;alone&lt;/a&gt;. I hoped and wished for a man willing, strong enough, and good enough to deserve a chance into our lives. I never expected one to come out of no where, my old childhood friend now the &lt;a title="Love" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; of my life. But I thank God every day he is here. I can't imagine a world without him, nor would I want to. He is my dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once again, I have my dreams for my life with him, but what about just my life with me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Ask_The_Band_3.jpg" alt="Ask The Band" width="640" height="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I go to a private art school. I love my field, but I'm tired of being &lt;a title="Adult Bullying" href="../../../../adult-bullying-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bullied&lt;/a&gt; by my department head, tired of being treated less then everyone else by everyone thanks to how I prefer to work and what I photograph. I'm so close to graduating (this time next year, I will be in my last half of a semester), but right now, I just want to give up. Photography is my love, my connection with &lt;a title="Parent Loss" href="../../../../parent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;my late mum&lt;/a&gt;, but it has NEVER been my passion. My passion was dance and the stage. But after an injury and birth of my daughter, that is never to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need to finish, I know I need to, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I get yelled at for not wearing the right shoes to a gallery talk. I watch as those who have hurt me to the point I don't know I can ever &lt;a title="Forgiveness" href="../../../../forgiveness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; them get special treatment, while if I fail to do something after taking care of my sick daughter rather then going out to listen to a pointless talk, I fail the class. I'm tired of a school that looks away when we have problems. I'm so tired of this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm tired and sick of photography. If this continues, I will never pick up a camera again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the same time, I have a project in my studio class I'm excited for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to dream, want that goal to work towards, but I don't feel like I'm allowed to have that anymore. I don't even know what I would want. I miss the stage, I miss dance, but the adult side of me keeps laughing and telling me to stop wishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will never happen. So what do I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3768/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Drought Years</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/j4Z5ujp6x64/</link><description>A poem about love and relationships.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3753/</guid><category>Relationships</category><category>Love</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;you are beached bone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a study in severity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a man with crescent moon fists.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;desperate for what i thought you offered me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;i mistook &lt;a title="Anger Resources" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; and despotism&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for passion and instruction.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;loving you,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;seeking the water in your desert,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;i settled in the dust.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a picture of contradiction&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you preached to me of love&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;though you knew nothing of it&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you know nothing of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;love overflows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;gentle and selfless,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;it heals.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love corrected&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love dismembered&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;your love left me wandering.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you cannot find it within you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because it doesn't dwell there&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I pray for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;even as your tongue cuts me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and your delusions singe me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I pray for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Love&lt;/a&gt; dwells in me&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I've been blessed with an abundance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and it pours forth&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for him&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;for everyone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;because that's what love is&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;how it works&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;what it does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I &lt;a title="Forgiveness" href="../../../../forgiveness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; your words&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and your lies&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I will always root for you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;a man in desperate need of transformation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;of love&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;of healing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and don't you know I tried?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;couldn't you feel the salve of my tongue?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;the presence of something bigger than you?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;you walk on glass&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;purposely ignorant to the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;comfort available to you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and I comfort myself, too&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;and say&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;"nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3753/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Sound-Check Wednesday - March 27, 2013</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/MG64lQu8HWA/</link><description>SuperTeala shares updates from behind the scenes at Band Back Together.</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3767/</guid><category>Sound Check </category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh!

Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving along, I can't believe next week marks the first week of April. A new month means a new World Tour theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For April, the World Tour theme is&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Take Back The Power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;Most of us, well, we've been through some garbage in our lives - and we've given power to a lot of people who simply don't deserve it. It's time to take back the power - why don't you tell us about how you came through it all... and survived.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep those stories coming!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter who you are or what you do, YOU have a story worth sharing. You never know, you might connect with someone through your story. Give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comments! They are so important. You never know how much one word could cheer up someone's day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drafts! I'm seeing quite a few posts in drafts. I myself have a habit of leaving a story in drafts because I thought I'd hit the submit button.

I was going to take the bull by the horns as it were and ride...or so I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I turned 20 I freaked because I knew I wasn't a teenager anymore. That meant I &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to be responsible. Okay, so you're not a "real" adult until you're 21 (so you can drink) or 25 (when you can rent a car), but for some reason I went through sort of a mid-life crisis then. I know it's funny now; I can laugh my ass off and say "what an idiot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now? Turning 30? &lt;a href="../../../../fear-resources/"&gt;I'm freaking terrified&lt;/a&gt;. Here's why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. I am still single - not married, no kids. Most of the people my age already have one, the other, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I am STILL NOT in the career I went to school for. I have a degree in Graphic Design and haven't had ANY experience at all in the field. I've been turned down for countless jobs because of that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Thanks to said schooling, I am knee deep in student loan hell. Most the time I'm broke, just barely keeping my head above water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. I'm in a dead-end job. Honestly. I'm not going to sugar coat it - I really don't like it. Before this I worked nine years at a job that was just as bad, and ended up getting fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Oh and my awesome 30th birthday plans? They may not happen due to my car having a major flat and costing quite a bit for repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I haven't accomplished anything great. The only thing I've done that's worth mentioning is that I graduated from college. I lived on my own for three years after the "roommate experience," and I lost 56 pounds in a year and so far have managed to keep it off. Wooo right on track!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I look back at my 20's &lt;a href="dhttp://bandbacktogether.com/sadness-resources/"&gt;I see a lot of hurt&lt;/a&gt;. Losing my last grandparent, breaking up with my then-boyfriend for the final time,&amp;nbsp;putting my cat to sleep, Dad having cancer, moving out of my childhood home, then moving my parents out of it, putting Mom in the nursing home, losing my job and being unemployed for six months, losing my best friend, and most recently the death of my sister...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now my life seems to be at a total standstill. I've always stayed in Nebraska because I felt "needed." I never wanted to be too far away in case something were to happen - then I could be right here without needing to spend money I don't have on a flight home or gas money to drive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked, "Why don't you move?" the anwser was always the same: my family needs me. It's what a good daughter does. Dad just has me now. Mom sure as hell can't help and my brother doesn't understand so the decision making is on my shoulders just as much as it is on Dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most women my age are picking out white dresses, china patterns, or colors for the nursery. Me? I picked out what my &lt;a title="Grief Resources" href="../../../../grief-resources/"&gt;sister was going to be buried in&lt;/a&gt;, casket flowers, what was going to played at the funeral, and what kind of vase she was going to have on her headstone. There is no preparing for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since my sister has passed I find myself wondering what I am supposed to do. Where would I go, and what would I do if I left? I feel like&amp;nbsp;I don't have a reason to stay close anymore. I no longer feel needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always felt I have&amp;nbsp;put my own life on hold because of what was going on with my family. My motto has always been "family first;" however, I can't keep doing that anymore. I'll never get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet I have a low threshold for guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, maybe my 30's won't be as bad as I'm thinking. I am gainfully employed even if I hate my job. I am perfectly healthy, skinnier (no six-pack abs, but hey), I&amp;nbsp;can wear the jean size I did in high school, and have not had a single broken bone or stitches EVER even though I am pretty damn clumsy. I have some pretty kickass friends and a super cute nine-month-old nephew. I will be getting my third tattoo soon - a memory one for my sister. I drive an awesome car and I have a roof over my head, plus my very own studio so I can create to my heart's content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest is just details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 20's are actually the end of a very long era, and the more I think about it, the happier I am it's almost over. It's kind of like New Year's Day - a chance to start over and make things right. I'm sure it's not going to always be sunshine and lollipops but I will lace up my custom designed Converse kicks (this is what I really want for my birthday) and hold on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm ready for you, bull - let's ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3737/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A Letter To A Woman I'll Never Meet</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/Xfzv-3hPzLs/</link><description>She writes a letter to the mother in law she'll never get to meet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3750/</guid><category>Parenting</category><category>Relationships</category><category>Marriage and Partnership</category><category>Help With Loss</category><category>A Letter I Can't Send</category><category>Love</category><category>Loss</category><category>Parent Loss</category><category>Feelings</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all have letters we'd like to send,     but know that we can't.

While he may have his dad's twinkle in his eyes, it's your dimples that I fell in &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; with from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's your open mind that I know I can share anything with, that I know will understand me when I don't understand myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I'll watch a romantic comedy or those silly &lt;a title="Marriage Resources" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;wedding&lt;/a&gt; shows on TV and I have a brief thought that I'm lucky to not have to worry about having a mother-in-law that I don't get along with. But my heart lurches with that thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want so badly to know you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want your help as we make these tentative plans for our future. I want lunches with you where you tell me stories of when he was younger and we can giggle over how much he hasn't changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to tell you what an amazing son you raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know that you raised someone who puts everyone else's needs before his own? That he is so giving of himself that he puts himself last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you get to see how caring and sweet he is? Did you get to know this wonderful heart that he's given to me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watch him so often and wonder which of his little quirks he learned from you. I see him so often with his dad, I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what he picked up there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know that he misses you so very much? That his heart &lt;a title="Loss Resources" href="../../../../loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;aches&lt;/a&gt; for you even on the most benign of days?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Parent Loss Resources" href="../../../../parent-loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Your loss&lt;/a&gt; changed him in ways that I may fully never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that you're still watching over him. I hope you can see how wonderfully he takes care of me, of his dad. How he's taken my son in and loves him SO GREATLY. How he works so very hard to provide for us and how he's still playing the music you inspired within him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know he sings now? That he's come out of his shell a bit? Occasionally he'll walk around the crowd while playing his guitar. Your shy son does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess I said all that to say this: You've raised a gem, a true diamond in the rough. He is my world and he's promised me a future together. I promise I won't take him for granted, this gift you've given me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for raising the man I love.

He was sweet. He was leaning into my conversations, going out of his way to talk to me. Within a month we were dating. He was wonderful in every way; always taking care of me, listening to my worries, making me laugh. I knew that all the years of holding out for a good one had paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning he said he wanted to take it slow physically, knowing about my lack of experience. He knew I wanted to save sex for &lt;a title="Marriage Resources" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;. He didn't agree, but he went along with it. At first, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly he started pushing me to do things I didn't want to do. When I told him no or pushed his hand away, he would persist. These were little things though, in the "gray area," so eventually I would give in. If I didn't, I had to deal with his &lt;a title="Anger Resources" href="../../../../anger-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;anger&lt;/a&gt; and pouting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was becoming more and more &lt;a title="Depression Resources" href="../../../../depression-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;depressed&lt;/a&gt;, but I didn't know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, I cried when I was alone. But I just hated school so much. I was &lt;a title="Stress Resources" href="../../../../stress-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;stressed&lt;/a&gt; all the time. Not sleeping. Not eating. I just needed to toughen up. He was right there the whole time, making sure I ate, walking my dog, letting me cry. He was a godsend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was around this time that he began the &lt;a title="Emotional Abuse Resources" href="../../../../emotional-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;emotional abuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never appreciated him enough. I was selfish. There was no end to the ways that his ex-girlfriend was better than me. I spent my days tiptoeing around, never sure what would set him off. He was wonderful, though. We were just going through a rough patch. I needed to be the bigger person, forgive, and move on. He was so good at apologizing after a blow-up. He didn't mean any of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowly he started pushing harder and harder and wanting to go farther and farther physically. Four, five, six times I would pull away, but he wouldn't relent. What was I supposed to do, scream? He was my boyfriend, he loved me. He just got carried away. I talked to him about it on several occasions, explaining that what he was doing wasn't right. I tried to explain that "no means no."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you know what you're accusing me of?" he exploded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not accusing you of anything, I'm just trying to tell you how I feel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't matter. I learned not to bring it up. I blamed myself for it. After all, a guy will go as far as a girl lets him, right? Each time he pushed, I eventually gave in. It was my fault. I had trained him not to take my protests seriously. If only I were stronger, it wouldn't be a problem. But it was too late now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began not to protest at all. I couldn't understand what force was keeping me silent, but I was paralyzed when he touched me. I tried to accept that these were things I did now. I tried to put it from my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, he took my clothes off. When it was all over, he said that he had &lt;a title="Intimate Partner Rape Resources" href="../../../../intimate-partner-rape-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;entered me&lt;/a&gt;. I was confused. I hadn't felt anything. The next day I talked to him about it. I told him how upset I was. I reminded him, for the thousandth time, that this was not what I wanted our relationship to look like. I told him again, as I had in the beginning and so many times in between, that this was the final, absolute line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was not a gray area, this was wrong. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, he berated me for "ruining his first time." He brushed aside my distress, telling me how special he wanted his first time to be and how I had ruined it by not being there emotionally. How could I be so selfish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I begged him that day not try it again. I told him it would destroy me. I told him I would never be able to forgive him or myself. That very same night he pushed me into going all the way. This time I felt it; the pain. I felt so helpless. Silent, paralyzed, horrified at my weakness, I let it happen. As usual, it was my fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the support of my mom and a &lt;a title="Therapy Resources" href="../../../../therapy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;therapist&lt;/a&gt;, I finally left him, but the damage remains. The worst part is not having a name for what happened. &lt;a title="Rape/Sexual Assault Resources" href="../../../../rape-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Rape&lt;/a&gt; isn't quite right. But I felt so forced, so helpless. It would almost have been better if he had held me down screaming. At least then I would know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tell myself it wasn't my fault, but when my guard is down that little voice still whispers, "You let it happen. Slut. Easy. Weak." I just want to feel wholesome again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure I ever will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3755/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dose Of Happy: Jailbreak</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/AypNC-ocdvA/</link><description>Her dose of happy is a great personal accomplishment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3752/</guid><category>A Dose of Happy</category><category>EYE OF THE MOTHERFUCKING TIGER</category><category>Flings Glitter!</category><category>Things That Rule</category><category>Happiness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg" alt="" width="337" height="174" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;textarea id="textarea" style="height: 150px; width: 150px; margin-top: 10px;" readonly="readonly"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3752//"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Dose_Of_Happy_Monday.jpg"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last week I participated in a race called The Jailbreak. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actually, it was more of an adventure. I just wasn't content to try a regular old 5K, I had to go for the one that included obstacles. Things like crawling through a drainage pipe, climbing a wet and muddy A-frame with a soaking wet rope, carrying concrete weights while weaving through barrels, and crawling through a mud pit to get to the finish line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Climbing the cargo net was possibly the single scariest thing I've ever done in my life - especially when I had to go over the top - but I made it, shaky hands and all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/2013-03-16_13.07.34.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;After an extremely long, thorough shower, I discovered some spectacular cuts and bruises under all that mud that I consider to be proof of my bravery. I also discovered one heck of a sunburn, thanks to running in Texas in the afternoon with no sunblock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;All in all, I'm pretty proud of myself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A couple of months ago I couldn't even get behind the wheel of a car I was so scared, and now I'm an official Jailbreak Escapee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/2013-03-17_12.40.15.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You'd better believe I'm doing it again next year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;**************************&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's your Happy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't think you have one?

I was just starting to move on and there you are. Just like every time I leave. This time is different, though. I no longer want what we had, but I am still very angry. And hurt. And angry because I'm still hurt.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On some days, I wonder if it will make me feel better if I sent you something. Maybe start me down the road of &lt;a title="Break Ups" href="../../../../relationship-breakup-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;finally forgetting you&lt;/a&gt;. Moving on to a life I so deserve. But I know that you still think that it was my decision and if I had only stayed, things would have gotten better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know nothing would have changed. For 3 years, nothing changed. The empty promises never changed. The looks of disgust you reserved solely for me never changed. &lt;a title="Emotional Abuse" href="../../../../emotional-abuse-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;The venom you spat&lt;/a&gt; never changed. The repetitive but half-hearted apologies never changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We never changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate that I have to live with the &lt;a title="guilt resources" href="../../../../guilt-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;guilt&lt;/a&gt; of walking away when it was your decision to not take your medication that drove us apart. I hate that five months later, my heart hurts as much as it did the day I finally said good-bye to you - to us. I hate you for loving yourself more than you loved us. Your selfishness is plain to me now. I never was going to win. And that is what breaks my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You finally got me to admit that I loved you. Told me I had nothing to worry about. That what we had was special. Forever. That I no longer needed to be strong, because you would always be there to comfort me and be my protector. I no longer had to run from love but succumb to it, so I opened my heart. Wide the fuck open. But I knew. I wanted to deny it but I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A part of me wept for the day I knew would come. The day you would finally tell me that you didn't really love me. You say that you didn't mean it when you said it. That you only said it because you knew it would hurt me, but you were wrong. It didn't hurt me. It destroyed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here I am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broken. Hurt. &lt;a title="Loneliness Resources" href="../../../../loneliness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;Lonely&lt;/a&gt;. Angry. Alone. Longing for &lt;a title="Love Resources" href="../../../../love-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt;, and it hurts. I hate that you awakened something that you were incapable of caring for. I hope to my core for nothing but good things for your life, but I also really wish I could tell you just how much you hurt me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here is my letter to you that I will never send. Maybe now I will begin to find some peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, I hope so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3757/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Unwelcome Reminders</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/R6Uar00ZYXk/</link><description>Reminders of her childhood sexual abuse have surfaced after a conversation with her mother.</description><pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3754/</guid><category>Abuse</category><category>Child Sexual Abuse</category><category>Adult Children of Childhood Sexual Abuse</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nine out of ten victims of child sexual abuse know their abusers. Many times, the abuser is a member of their family.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today my mother told me my dad told her that it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be true that I wasn't lying about my grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother is, as they say, an unreliable narrator. She said it like this, "Well, your dad said to me once, 'I'm only going to tell you this one time. &lt;a title="Child Sexual Abuse" href="../../../../incest-child-sexual-abuse/" target="_blank"&gt;The girls may have been telling the truth about what happened to them&lt;/a&gt;.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp hope that welled within me surprised me. I have a memory of my father, very drunk, asking me to accompany him as he took the baby sitter home. I was little. I had been asleep, I think. We dropped her off then my dad looks at me and begs, "Is it true?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was uncomfortable, &lt;a title="Fear" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;scared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I told him yes, his anguish was unbearable for me. His tears. I only ever saw him cry that day. Not when his mother or his brother &lt;a title="Loss" href="../../../../loss-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt;. Not even when his father, the grandfather in question, died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Acoholism" href="../../../../alcoholism-resources-2/" target="_blank"&gt;Instead my father was always drunk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the years he would volley this, "You girls and your lies ruined my family, ruined my father's life." The message was always: &lt;a title="Shame" href="../../../../shame-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;it was my fault&lt;/a&gt;. I was a liar. I hurt everyone and ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope that came with my mother's ridiculously casual announcement today isn't as freeing as it needs to be from the chains of all those other statements. I don't know that I &lt;a title="Trust" href="../../../../trust-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; her. I don't know if he ever really said it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my heart, I don't believe he believes it, believes me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he did believe me, why did nothing happen to my grandfather? Why did he get to move in with us, years after I accused him? Why was I forced to spend time with him, day after day, living in fear of his eyes, his hands?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If my father believed me, why didn't he protect me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I guess he didn't believe me, right? If he did, and he didn't protect me, what is so wrong with me that I didn't deserve protection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of healthy acceptance under my belt, and her one casual sentence today brings me to my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3754/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>I've Held This In Too Long</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/CH9-Ik0pkic/</link><description>She shares her story of being a victim of date rape and how she was blamed for it.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3739/</guid><category>Date/Acquaintance Rape</category><category>Rape/Sexual Assault</category><category>Relationships</category><category>How To Help A Friend After A Rape </category><category>Friendships</category><category>Shame</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual assault doesn't always have to be violent, but it is always devastating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is her story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to sleep around a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dated in a way stereotypically reserved for men throughout most of my twenties and then met my now husband at age 26. In high school boys treated me like I had the plague. Then I graduated and my phone suddenly started ringing off the hook, offering up the pick of the litter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also never exclusive with anyone until we&amp;rsquo;d had The Talk. If we hadn&amp;rsquo;t had The Talk then chances were you weren&amp;rsquo;t the only one I was sleeping with. One day whilst visiting my parents my mother said &amp;ldquo;oh, I thought you slept with all the guys you dated.&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t, but I could see how she would have thought that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always believed that I was in control of my body. I didn&amp;rsquo;t give two fucks if I threw myself at you and you didn&amp;rsquo;t respond. I was so insecure I&amp;rsquo;d just go sleep with whoever drunk called that night. I knew I was being used but all I wanted was the attention, the comments on my runner's body or how nice my natural tits were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then there was someone I threw myself at who didn&amp;rsquo;t respond, and I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t care that he wasn't into me at all. I found it fun to try and flirt with him anyway and always make it known that I&amp;rsquo;d be down for it. I knew he&amp;rsquo;d never be down for it so I just kept at him. If he ever wanted to tell me to move on he never did, and so I didn&amp;rsquo;t. He was mysterious and hot, kinda dirty looking, exactly what I went for at the time, and his best friend was my best male friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were all out at the bar and we were drunk. He looked particularly good that night; he wore a brown leather jacket and I could smell it from where I sat drooling over him. As usual we didn&amp;rsquo;t speak much that night, and it was all me making comments about him and - as usual - I received zero response. That bar closed and we moved on to a bar down the street, then we headed back to my place to drink some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best friend was passed out in my bed and I was still out in the living room listening to Tool with Him. Out of nowhere he pulled me down towards him and we started to kiss. He was groping me and saying extremely sexual things to and about me; they were flowing out of him like poetry. This was exactly what I thought I had wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost instantly a red flag rose in my brain and I stopped him. I used the excuse that our best friend was in the very next room, then basically got up off the couch and went into my bedroom. If only I&amp;rsquo;d have caught the ridiculously bright shade of red that flag was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all woke in the morning hungover and hungry. Our best friend seemed none the wiser that anything had happened between us. I didn't flirt with Him that morning. I was already in observation mode, trying to figure out what the fuck had happened and if it meant anything. How could someone who barely spoke to anyone suddenly turn into a sex-crazed dirty talker out of nowhere? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brunch, I returned to my home to nurse my hangover with some playoff hockey. I heard pebbles tapping at my window. This was not uncommon; at this time my suite was right off the alley and friends would toss pebbles. I&amp;rsquo;d huck them my keys or pop down to the door. I looked out my window to see Him there on his bike. I thought nothing of it, went down to the door, and let him in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say I thought nothing of it I mean that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think he was there to harm me. Having already analyzed the night prior I thought maybe he was into me after all and felt bad that he&amp;rsquo;d tried to accost me with his best friend in the next room. Maybe having been rejected by me made him realize he was interested in me. How silly, naive and stupid. I trusted his best friend, my best friend, that&amp;rsquo;s the main reason I let him in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could still smell the beer from the previous night on him. We sat on my couch and I specifically remember that I tucked my legs up into myself and didn&amp;rsquo;t spread them out over him like I wanted to in my head. He started rubbing my legs and I sorta play kicked him trying to make it clear that I was watching hockey and that he should too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not take any hints and tried to kiss me. &lt;a title="Date/Acquaintance Rape Resources" href="../../../../Date-or-Acquaintance-Rape-Resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I flat out said NO&lt;/a&gt;. He persisted, I said NO. I knew in my head that he was not leaving. I knew I should not have let him in. I knew that I was fucked. Did I want to be viciously &lt;a title="Rape/Sexual Assault Resources" href="../../../../rape-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;assaulted&lt;/a&gt; or could I take some control? I made what I still believe was the correct decision to this day and had sex with him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, he sat on my couch and cried. He told me that he&amp;rsquo;d lost his virginity to a prostitute. He told me that he&amp;rsquo;d gone over to our best friends&amp;rsquo; place and watched him sleep on the couch and thought to himself, &amp;ldquo;Can I do it? Can I go back over there and have sex with that girl?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked him to leave and he left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, at first I was completely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I had a girlfriend over. I told her that I&amp;rsquo;d had sex with Him, but I did not tell her exactly how it had happened. I know this is going to sound fucking insane but I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully grasp just how fucked up everything was until I told my dad over email on the Tuesday morning back at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as quick as flipping a switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was now a shaking, crying mess and the slut-shaming started immediately. My boss told me that if I&amp;rsquo;d just hung out with doctors it would have never happened. At first I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about people believing me because He came clean to our best friend. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that people didn&amp;rsquo;t ask me inappropriate questions. The worst of all to this day is why did I give in, why didn&amp;rsquo;t I keep saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I should have only had to have said NO once.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost a lot of friends. I think most people who&amp;rsquo;ve been through this know how hard that part is. I felt helpless. I felt so much &lt;a title="Shame Resources" href="../../../../shame-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;shame&lt;/a&gt;. My best friend did not support me for long. Very soon after I was expected to have let it go, to be over it and totally able to hang out at parties where He&amp;rsquo;d be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to be very forgiving, so when I was left with no other choice but  to end my friendship with my best friend I kept the email he sent  me so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t ever forgive him. In it he told me "you&amp;rsquo;re the one that drooled over  the guy and told him you&amp;rsquo;d fuck him, and when he came for it and you  didn&amp;rsquo;t want it, you let him have it anyways."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still slut-shame myself and blame myself. But no. NO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He did not have the right to even put me in that position&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That day robbed me of a piece of myself that I have yet to get back. It  robbed me of many things I have been able to reattain but one. That  one thing haunts my life every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3739/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Security </title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/gwueqbZLCA8/</link><description>Making some changes to her apartment allowed her to feel secure and more stable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3748/</guid><category>Economic Struggles</category><category>Relationships</category><category>How To Have Healthy Romantic Relationships</category><category>Love</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Happiness</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best feelings is knowing you can be sure of something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last August, my &lt;a title="Romantic Relationship Resources" href="../../../../romantic-relationship-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;boyfriend&lt;/a&gt; and I moved into a tiny apartment in a new part of town. A few weeks later we got a dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we are young and our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Economic Struggles Resources" href="../../../../poverty-economic-struggles-hardship-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;finances are still crazy&lt;/a&gt;, we accepted a lot of hand me down furniture and whatnot. We had one of those bed frames on wheels that collapses. My father picked it up for about $10. My boyfriend kept his clothes in a Rubbermaid storage container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I was really happy to be living with someone I love completely, my whole life seemed ready to be picked up and moved at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;That feeling no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/Thoreau_Quote.jpg" alt="Thoreau Quote" width="563" height="376" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovering from a couple of really big and unfortunate expenses, I finally went out and bought a real bed frame. No more wheels for us! I also got my boyfriend a dresser so he doesn't have to snap his clothes into a box anymore. It opened up a bunch of under the bed storage, so now we can free up some more space where we need it.  Honestly, this took care of a lot of &lt;a title="Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../anxiety-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; I had been feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't live in the biggest or best apartment but it's ours for now, and I want it to feel that way. This was both a tiny and huge step forward for us. A bed frame and dresser doesn't seem like a huge deal, and in the grand scheme of things it's not. But it is a more permanent solution. It recognizes that we're here and we're &lt;a title="Happiness Resources" href="../../../../happiness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;happy&lt;/a&gt;.  It even inspired my boyfriend to be more willing to put money into fixing up what we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've never been one to believe that money fixed everything, but in this case it allowed me to feel secure and comfortable. It was a way for me to say that we're here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is all I've ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3748/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Am I Turning Into My Worst Nightmare?</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/J8WbxX2Je4Y/</link><description>She wonders if needing medication for mental illness will turn her into a person she doesn't want to become.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3734/</guid><category>Relationships</category><category>Help With Mental Illness</category><category>Loving Someone With Bipolar Disorder</category><category>Anxiety</category><category>Bulimia Nervosa</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Fear</category><category>I Am The Face of Mental Illness</category><category>Mental Illness</category><category>Bipolar Disorder</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental illness can evolve and change throughout a person's entire life.

After the &lt;a title="Divorce Resources" href="../../../../divorce-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt; her mother struggled with &lt;a title="Addiction" href="../../../../addiction-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt;. My friend is an bright, intelligent, driven, talented young lady, but this post isn't about her, really. I love her dearly, but one of the biggest roles she's played in my life is opening my eyes to how difficult life can be for &lt;a title="Loving Someone With Bipolar Disorder" href="../../../../coping-loving-someone-with-bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank"&gt;those who love individuals with psychological health issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm bipolar with the added bonus of recovering from &lt;a title="Bulimia Resources" href="../../../../bulimia-nervosa-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;bulimia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Anxiety Resources" href="../../../../anxiety-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. I found out when I was 19. I'm 22 now, almost 23. I managed to get my college degree and now I have my dream job. I moved to a new city. I'm living on my own, proving I "can do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, the "crazy" is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where once self-awareness and self-care were enough to keep me fairly stable through my ups and downs, I think I'm hitting that place where my disorder matures into what it will be for the rest of my adulthood. I was warned this might happen, that I might hit a groove and become "stable" for some time, but that my brain wasn't fully matured and therefore my chemical imbalances might change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My cycle is off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;My emotions are...something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't really have words for what life is like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective part of my brain says, "Things are going pretty well." I have friends, in my new city and back home, and in other places, that show me often and profoundly how loved and valued I am in ways small and large. I have the job that every recent college graduate dreams of, the one that blends my passions with my skills into an amazing sort of this-is-meant-for-me thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found a church that I absolutely love, full of loving, welcoming people who legitimately care about me. I have volunteer projects I adore, that help remind me how fortunate I am. I've even lost weight! Thirty pounds, actually. Five more pounds and I'll have lost all of the weight I gained during my collegiate battle with bulimia. (And, it's been lost the right way...the healthy way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except my brain isn't good. My brain is awful, actually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last two, almost three years, I've had the relief of being unmedicated. I made the choice to go the "sheer willpower and stubbornness" route of &lt;a title="Mental Illness" href="../../../../mental-illness-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; because I had two years of my life go down the drain when we couldn't find the medical cocktail that worked for me. I either felt too much, was spending too much time at one end of the bipolar spectrum or the other, or I was feeling nothing at all. I even got addicted to a particular fast-acting anxiety medication that stole several months of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew I'd eventually have to try the route of medication again someday, but knowing it might happen doesn't mentally prepare you for the day it actually comes. I'll be talking about this with my &lt;a title="Therapy" href="../../../../therapy-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;therapist&lt;/a&gt; at our next appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not every day is good, there's good in every day. Life unmedicated hasn't been unkind to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this is an option anymore, though. I'm reminded of what a lifelong diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Fear" href="../../../../fear-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;I feel fear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not anxiety, not stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear, legitimate FEAR. I'm 22, I'm young. I want to meet someone, &lt;a title="Marriage and Partnership" href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;get married&lt;/a&gt;, maybe even someday have a family. I want to move out to the country, have a ragtag pack of dogs, maybe some horses and a few cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to live my dreams and fulfill my goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think back to the stories I heard about my friend's dad. He was bright, passionate, engaged, popular, a pillar of his community, until he began exhibiting symptoms. Then, over a multi-year period, he became the person I knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those terms are ones that have been applied to me. Is this the start of the avalanche? Is this where a lifetime of being a burden, being someone else's inconvenient responsibility and source of heartache, begins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most days, I'm very, very good at finding the silver lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm an optimist by nature, even when I'm on the low end. But, these last few days, it's all replaced by the turmoil of emotions I can't control, and fear. Fear of the future and what I'll become, and fear of whether or not medications will work or if this is really the earnest start of my troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3734/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>No, I Still Don't Want To Go Back To Teaching</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/DkjtYaII0yc/</link><description>She shares a unique look at a day in the life of a teacher.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3746/</guid><category>Childhood</category><category>Feelings</category><category>Stress</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical day in the life of an elementary school teacher...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/03/A_Day_In_The_Life_Of_An_Elementary_School_Teacher.jpg" alt="A Day In The Life Of An Elementary School Teacher" width="600" height="250" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;7:30 am: Arrive at school.

Only one other (also eight months pregnant) teacher (even&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;though there are five others there) offers to help me alert custodian,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; get student cleaned up and move the entire class as quickly and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;quietly as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;11:00 am: Ride bus back to school holding onto sick student. Fortunately he does not actually throw up on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;11:10 am: Return to school to find out that they still haven't figured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; out a schedule for school picture day, even though it IS school&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; picture day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;12:05 pm: Lunch is delayed, but do find out that we will be taking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; pictures at 12:45 pm.

Continue grading papers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:10 pm: Called to bring students to assembly, but since I do not&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; have my students, I cannot follow this direction. Go look for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; students in the gym. They are not there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:20 pm: Find students. Bring them to assembly. Remind three of them&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we do not hit people just because they are not walking fast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:50 pm: Must go get students now. Am frightened. Assembly still not over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:20 pm: Assembly still going strong, even though the buses will leave in five minutes and no students are packed up to go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:23 pm: Send all my bus riders out of the assembly to get their homework, backpacks and coats on their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:26 pm: Jog back to classroom with the rest of the students. Make sure all have homework, coats and bookbags.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:31 pm: Drunk parent from this morning now looks very tired and smells bad. I wave cheerfully to campus police officer to make him go away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:37 pm: Where is T's grandfather?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:40 pm: Go inside to call T's grandfather.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:48 pm: All of my students have now been picked up. I am leaving.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:51 pm: See four students who have not been picked up. No one is waiting with them. Feel responsible because some of them are my former students. Decide to wait with them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;4:10 pm: All students are picked up. Leave.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3746/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A Letter I Can't Send To My Husband</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/LEWqouzmXcg/</link><description>She writes a letter to her husband that she can't send.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3747/</guid><category>Heartbreak</category><category>Divorce</category><category>Marriage and Partnership</category><category>Marriage Problems</category><category>A Letter I Can't Send</category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We all have letters we'd like to send,     but know that we can't. A letter to someone we no longer have a     relationship with, a letter to a family member or friend who has died, a     letter to reclaim our power or our voice from an abuser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Letters where actual contact is just not possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a &lt;a href="../../../../category/letter-i-cant-send/" target="_blank"&gt;letter you can't send&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why not send it to The Band?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Husband,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to write this letter to you for years now but I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever found the words to write what I really needed to say to you. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You will never know or understand just what you did to me when you told me through a text message on Christmas Day that you wanted a &lt;a href="../../../../divorce-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;divorce&lt;/a&gt;. You can&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand how, even though I tried to get past it, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t seem to &lt;a href="../../../../trust-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;trust&lt;/a&gt; you again.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I have never understood how in the hell you thought it was a great idea to tell me on Christmas Day. You could have waited a day or two, but no - you had to do it &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; day. Now for the rest of my life I will remember it. It is part of my Christmas every year. I have a national holiday to remind me of the day you decided to tell me you wanted a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did know that it was coming thanks to a mutual friend we had at the time, but I really didn&amp;rsquo;t think you were so coldhearted as to tell me on Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been three or four years since it happened and I still remember the day like it was yesterday. I keep hoping that in time the pain will fade but who knows if it will or not.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; People think I am crazy for refusing to pay for the divorce just to get it done and over with, but because of how heartless you are I don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to make things easy for you. Since I never have to see you and being married doesn&amp;rsquo;t really affect me, I figure we can stay married until you decide to pay for it or you want to get &lt;a href="../../../../marriage-partnership-resources/" target="_blank"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; again. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I hope one day someone will hurt you like you hurt me!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; - Your Wife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><feedburner:origLink>http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3747/</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Sound-Check Wednesday - March 20, 2013</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BandBackTogether/~3/K32PtOiZYYc/</link><description>SuperTeala shares news and updates about The Band.</description><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2013 08:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bandbacktogether.com/post/3751/</guid><category>Sound Check </category><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is I,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a style="font-size: 14px;" href="http://meltintothetext.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SuperTeala&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;back&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"&gt;with our Sound-Check Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.bandbacktogether.com/media/images/2013/02/Sound_Check_Wednesday_1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's only Wednesday, and I've already had a long week.
