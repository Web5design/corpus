<p>Sheffield, Hallam, Liberal Democrat</p>
<p>1: I passionately believe that climate change is one of the greatest problems we face today. It is essential that</p>
<p>politicians take rapid action to address this issue at local, national and international levels. As a Westminster</p>
<p>MP I, along with my Liberal Democrat colleagues, support a Climate Change Bill which would set binding,</p>
<p>independently monitored, annual targets for reducing emissions, but I also recognise the need for additional policy</p>
<p>measures to make this happen. As a first step the Lib Dems are currently promoting a &#8216;Green Tax Switch&#8217;, which</p>
<p>would introduce and increase green taxes on high emission vehicles and aircraft, whilst reducing income taxes</p>
<p>elsewhere.</p>
<p><span id="more-11973"></span></p>
<p>2: Britain should and can lead the way with regards to tackling climate change, using its unique influence in the</p>
<p>many international organisations to which it is a member. However, to have any credibility in this respect we must</p>
<p>first put our own house in order, cutting UK emissions which currently represent 2% of the global total. As with</p>
<p>Kyoto the EU will have a major role to play and Britain should work constructively to support this.</p>
<p>3: I am installing energy saving light bulbs throughout my home and I try to use public transport as far as</p>
<p>possible. I recycle recyclable waste at home, try to cut down on the unnecessary use of paper in the office, and</p>
<p>unplug all unused electrical appliances. Energy consumption will certainly be a far greater consideration next time</p>
<p>I look to purchase a new car or household appliances such as a fridge or kettle. I am also looking into switching</p>
<p>to more environmentally responsible gas and electricity suppliers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over on Talkshop <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/suggestions-3/comment-page-1/#comment-48706">Suggestions</a> Gray quotes nicely so here it is</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rainy-race.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11969" alt="rainy-race" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rainy-race.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>By Roger Harrabin</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21967190">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21967190</a></p>
<p>Last spring’s forecast has been obtained by BBC News under Freedom of Information.</p>
<p>The Met Office three-monthly outlook at the end of March stated: “The forecast for average UK rainfall slightly favours drier than average conditions for April-May-June, and slightly favours April being the driest of the three months.”</p>
<p>A soul-searching Met Office analysis later confessed: “Given that April was the wettest since detailed records began in 1910 and the April-May-June quarter was also the wettest, this advice was not helpful.”</p>
<p>In a note to the government chief scientist, the Met Office chief scientist Prof Julia Slingo explains the difficulty of constructing long-distance forecasts, given the UK’s position at the far edge of dominant world weather systems.</p>
<p>She says last year’s calculations were not actually wrong because they were probabilistic.</p>
<p>The Met Office explained it this way: “The probabilistic forecast can be considered as somewhat like a form guide for a horse race.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Something does not compute, the BBC using FOI with the end effect of mocking the Met Office?<br />
<span id="more-11960"></span></p>
<p>The story is covered various other places, <a href="http://www.bishop-hill.net/blog/2013/3/29/met-office-or-bookies-office.html" target="_blank">Bishop Hill</a> being one worth a read.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Julia slingo came out with this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I think it was quite right that we looked at this particular forecast last year because in March we were facing really very serious pressures on water resources &#8211; a major drought that had been going on for nearly a couple of years &#8211; and I felt when I looked at the seasonal forecast at that time that I would be not being fair to the Government if I didn&#8217;t emphasise the fact that we did see a slightly enhanced risk of the drought continuing.</strong><br />
<strong> Likewise, I did also emphasise that there was also quite a chance that April would also be wetter than normal but in the context of where we were at that particular point as a country I felt it was right to emphasise the risk of dry conditions continuing as a <em>precautionary principle</em>.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Slingo&#8217;s wet phase.<br />
</strong>For goodness sake Slingo either scram or grow up although back to school might be a good idea, oh, school doesn&#8217;t get it yet either.</p>
<p>My take is that natural world physics is teaching an engineering lesson, that natural variability is much wider and operates on longer timescales than the likes of Slingo want to take on board. Low rainfall, high rainfall and every other shade of grey, sunshine, and snow white.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t answer for her brain but I can for the weather. Most of the weather and climate is not random as accepted and taught in statistics. This has been known for years. See <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/02/07/hurst-exponent-a-long-omitted-subject-from-the-talkshop/">here</a> and <a href="http://itia.ntua.gr/en/docinfo/537/">here</a> where there are many papers and links to investigate.</p>
<p>The name here is Hurst-Kolmogorov, the way the kind of random fluctuations show in weather. Koutsoyiannis has even derived a more correct statistical formula which not only give the gauss answer but are generalised if the Hurst exponent is not 0.5, which is the normal random case. (ranges from 0 which would be a completely cyclic behaviour to 1 which is highly random periodic)</p>
<p>Rainfall in the UK, temperature, probably most things have an exponent around 0.7, check the first of the &#8220;here&#8221; links, where I show this is the case with CET. This characteristic has the periodic behaviour such as spells of wet, dry, cold, hot, windy, calm, familiar to all Brits.</p>
<p>A twist though, came across a CSIRO tome which claimed indirectly Hurst does not apply, on what I spotted is flawed justification. I must drag that out and write it up. Recent floods in Oz. odd that, so they don&#8217;t get periods of dry and periods of wet? Except in politics.</p>
<p>This stuff seems to link in to log-log behaviour, maximum entropy and few other way out things which seem to be so but can&#8217;t be proven as such. I suppose that makes it deniable. No-one can actually know.</p>
<p>The AGW community are in strong denial of this, logical given that admission of there being much greater natural variation would make a mess of their doomsaying. FGS it&#8217;s weather, get on with it.</p>
<p>Rant by Tim Channon, co-mod<br />
(I usually don&#8217;t, looks bad, yet boy could I say some things including not so politely)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Steven Hayward: Climate Change Endgame In Sight?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hawkins-cmip5.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11956" alt="hawkins-cmip5" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hawkins-cmip5.png?w=614"   /></a>In my Weekly Standard cover story about the fallout from the “Climategate” email scandal three years ago, I offered the following question by way of prediction:</p>
<p>Eventually the climate modeling community is going to have to reconsider the central question: Have the models the IPCC uses for its predictions of catastrophic warming overestimated the climate’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases?</p>
<p>The article then went on to survey emerging research (U.S. government funded!) casting doubt on high estimates of climate sensitivity, along with alternative explanations on some climate factors, such as “black carbon.” The question in my mind the time was how long this would take to begin to break out into the “mainstream” scientific and media world.</p>
<p><span id="more-11955"></span>That day appears to have arrived. The new issue of The Economist has a <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21574461-climate-may-be-heating-up-less-response-greenhouse-gas-emissions">long feature</a> on the declining confidence in the high estimates of climate sensitivity. That this appears in The Economist is significant, because this august British news organ has been fully on board with climate alarmism for years now. A Washington-based Economist correspondent admitted to me privately several years ago that the senior editors in London had mandated consistent and regular alarmist climate coverage in its pages.</p>
<p>The problem for the climateers is increasingly dire. As The Economist shows in its first chart (Figure 1 here), the recent temperature record is now falling distinctly to the very low end of its predicted range and may soon fall out of it, which means the models are wrong, or, at the very least, that there’s something going on that supposedly “settled” science hasn’t been able to settle. Equally problematic for the theory, one place where the warmth might be hiding—the oceans—is not cooperating with the story line.</p>

<p>There is a lesson to learned from events last month in Europe's poorest country, Bulgaria, well actually there are 2 lessons to be learned, both unfortunately need to be learned by politicians in the rest of Europe, or the world when it comes to it.</p>
<p>The first lesson is that people will not put up with ever increasing electricity bills in the name of saving the planet while a few fat cats and crony capitalists cream off huge profits from Green subsidies on ordinary people's and businesses energy bills, the second lesson is that Green intermittent renewable energy wreaks havoc on electrical grids, ultimately leading to brown outs and black outs as the grid cannot cope with the sudden Green energy spikes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article by Frazer Nelson, editor of the &#8216;The Spectator’ eloquently expresses the issue which I find it hard to write about without lapsing into anglo-saxon. Please take the time to read it in full over at the Telegraph. This is a campaigning issue for me personally, and one which goes to the heart of the difference between ordinary people and those pushing the catastrophic man made global warming agenda.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>It’s the cold, not global warming, that we should be worried about</strong><br />
No one seems upset that in modern Britain, old people are freezing to death as hidden taxes make fuel more expensive<br />
Frazer Nelson 29 March 2013</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-cold.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11952" alt="old-cold" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-cold.jpeg?w=614"   /></a>A few months ago, a group of students in Oslo produced a brilliant spoof video that lampooned the charity pop song genre. It showed a group of young Africans coming together to raise money for those of us freezing in the north. “A lot of people aren’t aware of what’s going on there right now,” says the African equivalent of Bob Geldof. “People don’t ignore starving people, so why should we ignore cold people? Frostbite kills too. Africa: we need to make a difference.” The song – Africa for Norway – has been watched online two million times, making it one of Europe’s most popular political videos.</p>
<p>The aim was to send up the patronising, cliched way in which the West views Africa. Norway can afford to make the joke because there, people don’t tend to die of the cold. In Britain, we still do. Each year, an official estimate is made of the “excess winter mortality” – that is, the number of people dying of cold-related illnesses. Last winter was relatively mild, and still 24,000 perished. The indications are that this winter, which has dragged on so long and with such brutality, will claim 30,000 lives, making it one of the biggest killers in the country. And still, no one seems upset.<br />
<span id="more-11951"></span></p>
<p>Somewhere between the release of the 1984 Band Aid single and Al Gore’s 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, political attention shifted away from such problems. The idea of people (especially old people) dying in their homes from conditions with which we are all familiar now seems relatively boring. Much political attention is still focused on global warming, and while schemes to help Britain prepare for the cold are being cut, the overseas aid budget is being vastly expanded. Saving elderly British lives has somehow become the least fashionable cause in politics.</p>
<p>The reaction to the 2003 heatwave was extraordinary. It was blamed for 2,000 deaths, and taken as a warning that Britain was horribly unprepared for the coming era of snowless winters and barbecue summers. The government’s chief scientific officer, Sir David King, later declared that climate change was “more serious even than the threat of terrorism” in terms of the number of lives that could be lost. Such language is never used about the cold, which kills at least 10 times as many people every winter. Before long, every political party had signed up to the green agenda.</p>
<p>Since Sir David’s exhortations, some 250,000 Brits have died from the cold, and 10,000 from the heat. It is horribly clear that we have been focusing on the wrong enemy. Instead of making sure energy was affordable, ministers have been trying to make it more expensive, with carbon price floors and emissions trading schemes. Fuel prices have doubled over seven years, forcing millions to choose between heat and food – and government has found itself a major part of the problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Davey Kingston &amp; Surbiton, Liberal Demorat.</p>
<p>1: Climate change is the most important issues  facing us today ­ and has been for some time. The consequences if we do not tackle this urgently and fully are potentially catastrophic for the whole human race and life on the earth. The problem to date has been persuading enough people to recognise the threat, and despite Al Gore et al., I remain alarmed at how few people still really understand the scale of the problem and how fast we need to move.</p>
<p><span id="more-11939"></span></p>
<p>2: We must lead ­ lead the debate and lead the action. If Britain does commit itself unilaterally to largescale reductions in greenhouse gas emissiomns say to the oft discussed 60% target by 2050 ­ that will be an excellent start, if, at the same time, we set out a credible pathway, with policy changes starting now.The list of policies is well known ­ but worth repeating. Top comes the need to accelerate significantly the development of renewable energy and investment in energy conservation and efficiency, particularly for existing housing, where standards are still very low. We need to promote actively a decentralised energy system based more on microgeneration, using solar panels, small wind turbines and combined heat and power units to make buildings net generators of electricity ­ reducing reliance on the centralised and relatively inefficient system of major power stations. The EU should lead too, with a much tougher Emissions Trading Scheme. Reducing emissions from transport is also an urgent priority, where we must improve public transport, reducing the environmental impact of motor transport and aviation, and reducing the need to travel in the first place.We should also be prepared to look at even more radical measures, from personal carbon allowances to new international agencies with teeth, from a global emissions trading system to new WTO rules that link free trade and carbon reduction. The tough international challenge is to tackle climate change whilst making poverty history and that will require leadership that is consistent, principled and prepared to say tough things to friendly and less friendly countries alike.</p>
<p>3: Just as Government must lead the debate and lead by example, that&#8217;s what all MPs who believes this is serious should be doing. Personally I&#8217;ve done some of the easier things. I&#8217;ve written about it, delivered leaflets about it, spoken about it and had high street stalls to campaign on climate change. I&#8217;ve got energy efficient light bulbs, have good loft insulation, have a LPG car and use the train to work. I now have to take this forward and urge the local council in showing leadership in our community.</p>

<p><em><strong>Warmer temps linked with ice shelf break-ups</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>By Summit Voice</strong></p>
<p>SUMMIT COUNTY — The melt season on the Antarctic Peninsula is growing longer — in some cases it has doubled, and several major ice shelf breakup events in the region coincided with longer than usual melt seasons, according to a a new study that analyzed data from 30 weather stations.</p>
