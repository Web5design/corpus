				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Via<a href="http://www.betteroffout.net/roger-helmer-mep-takes-on-herman-van-rompuy/"> Better Off Out</a>: Roger Helmer MEP (UKIP) Tells Herman von Rompuy how it is:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/roger-helmer.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11817" alt="Roger-Helmer" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/roger-helmer.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300" width="226" height="300" /></a>Mr. President, The report on last week’s Council calls for “differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation” — a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>It wants to “restore normal lending”, to “promote growth and competitiveness”, to tackle unemployment and modernise public administration.</p>
<p>If there were a prize for clichés and wishful thinking, gentlemen, you would win it. These objectives are motherhood and apple pie, but you have no idea how to deliver them.</p>
<p>You should take a leaf from Konrad Adenauer’s book, and have a bonfire of the regulations. You are drowning Europe in a sea of red tape.</p>
<p>You need to promote a low-tax, growth-friendly Europe.</p>
<p>And you need to dismantle the €uro. Again and again you declare the crisis over, but it comes back to bite you.</p>
<p>Now it’s Cyprus. You talk of a Europe of values, with the rule of law and property rights. Yet you planned to confiscate the funds of savers and pensioners, while protecting senior bondholders.<br />
<span id="more-11816"></span></p>
<p>You’re breaking the promise of your European Bank Deposit Guarantee scheme.</p>
<p>You try to evade your obligations by calling it a “tax”. But you have form in playing with words. You avoided further referendums on the European Constitution by calling it a Treaty. You broke your “no default” promise in Greece by calling it a haircut.</p>
<p>Now you break your deposit guarantee by pretending that confiscation is a tax. This is not a tax. This is EU theft with a fancy name. This is the very symbol and measure of your failure and breach of faith.</p>
<p>Former British Chancellor Lord Lawson described the €uro as “Possibly the most reckless political adventure of the post-war era”. And he was maybe under-stating the problem, at that.</p>
<p>You, Gentlemen, have presided over unemployment, and hardship, and poverty, and misery, in Southern Europe, on a scale we have not seen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Yet you sit in your gilded offices, on your inflated salaries, and you fiddle while Rome burns. You have no answers to the problems of European citizens.</p>
<p>Let me quote a great Englishman, Oliver Cromwell:</p>
<p>“You have sat here too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!”</p>
<p>The speech was recorded and is available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_V0D6oKZ6M">here.</a></p>

<p>WHAT do Peter Lilley, Andrew Tyrie, Philip Davies, Christopher Chope and I have in common? We were the only MPs to vote against the 2008 Climate Change Bill, which is to say we had by then considered all the evidence and found it wanting.</p>
<p>For years we have endured insults. Behind the scenes Fiona Bruce, normally the most courteous of broadcasters, called me a “flat-earther” to my face. Others branded us “deniers” as if we were disputing the holocaust. The Al Gore film was accorded the status of Holy Writ. David Bellamy lost his job. Doubting scientists were scorned. Nigel Lawson found it difficult to get his book An Appeal To Reason published.</p>
<p><span id="more-11798"></span></p>
<p>In short there was an orthodoxy which was enforced with all the rigour of communism or fascism or, for that matter, the Spanish Inquisition. Dissenters must not be heard and global warming became a religion. Well the dissenters have now been proved right. Heaven knows how many billions of pounds later the world is now being told that actually the warming is so far off predictions that all bets are off and indeed the world’s temperature is static or falling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Despite the complete lack of evidence that human CO2 emissions cause any warming of the atmosphere, millions will be driven into fuel poverty as the snow continues to fall on chilly Britain. Even the MET Office has revised its five year forecast downwards to show almost no warming over the next five years, as revealed here at the Talkshop in early January. This unsound measure will cost jobs and drive industry abroad. We need some organisations with deep pockets to mount  a legal challenge to this madness. People will die as a direct result of this irresponsible and scientifically unsupported government climate policy.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Britain&#8217;s carbon tax: unfair and ineffective</strong><br />
Gerard Wynn - Reuters market analyst</p>
<p>The tax, called &#8220;carbon price support&#8221; by the British government, is [to be] levied on suppliers of fossil fuels to power plants and these will pass on the cost to electricity consumers.</p>
<p>It has uniquely united environmentalists and energy-intensive industries in opposition.</p>
<p>The tax will be applied when the price of European Union allowances (EUAs) is lower than a rising price floor per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) under the British scheme.</p>
<p>The idea is to send a clearer, long-term signal to investors in low carbon energy who may be deterred by the volatility of EUA prices.</p>
<p>The tax will be an important part of the British government&#8217;s support package to attract investment in new nuclear power.</p>
<p>By raising wholesale power prices by more than 10 percent by 2015, however, it will also provide an unmerited windfall for existing low carbon generation including nuclear power and wind farms.</p>
<p>Applying the tax inversely to the price of EUAs seemed to be a clever way to avoid charging polluters twice, as a flat-rate British carbon tax would have done.</p>
<p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is also the scheme&#8217;s biggest weakness.</p>
<p>First, European carbon price have collapsed, making them far cheaper than the UK floor price and increasing the size of the tax.</p>
<p>Second, insofar as the scheme succeeds in cutting emissions by factories and power plants, it will decrease demand for EUAs, which can then be snapped up by other European polluters, simply displacing emissions in an effect called carbon leakage.</p>
<p><span id="more-11794"></span>It may have been better for Britain to focus instead on sectors not embraced by the European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS), such as transport.</p>
<p>Finance minister George Osborne will give an update on the scheme in his budget on Wednesday. [Details below]</p>
<p>The best economic outcome may be to guarantee that all the tax receipts &#8211; estimated at about 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) a year &#8211; are redistributed to compensate households for higher power prices; to pay for efficiency investments by energy-intensive industry; and to invest in low carbon research and development.</p>
<p>Britain has had little time for such hypothecation in the past, however, and so far has only offered various limited compensation which it may further elaborate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pressure will therefore grow to remove or weaken the carbon price floor at the earliest opportunity, probably in 2020, threatening the aim of a long-term investment signal.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/19/column-wynn-carbon-uk-idUKL6N0CB4M820130319">Read the rest here.</a></p>
<p>Here is what the wednesday budget clarified:</p>
<p>A tripling of support for low carbon<br />
generation, providing up to £7.6bn by 2020</p>
<p>From April 2013, a new carbon price floor</p>
<p>1.90 The Government is acting to give private investors the confidence to invest in the UK’s<br />
energy sector. From April 2013 the carbon price floor announced at Budget 2011 will come<br />
into effect, providing a clear and credible long-term signal to support investment in low carbon<br />
electricity generation.<br />
1.91 The Energy Bill, currently making its passage through Parliament, will introduce Electricity<br />
Market Reform. By providing stable revenues for investors at a fixed level known as a strike price,<br />
Contracts for Difference, as set out in the Bill, will provide long-term certainty for investors in<br />
low carbon generation. This will lower the cost of capital and help developers secure the large<br />
upfront amounts of capital investment required. Support available for low carbon electricity<br />
investment through the Levy Control Framework up to 2020 will rise to £7.6 billion a year<br />
(in 2012 prices), more than triple the £2.35 billion available in 2012-13. Together with the<br />
Government’s Energy Bill and Gas Generation Strategy, published in 2012, this will provide the<br />
framework needed for new energy investment.44</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find reference 44 in the text, but did come across this other piece of lunacy:</p>
<p>1.92 The Government intends to take forward two Carbon Capture and Storage<br />
projects to the detailed planning and design stage of the competition. This represents<br />
the next step in the £1 billion Carbon Capture and Storage commercialisation programme<br />
and follows a period of intensive commercial negotiations with a number of bidders. The<br />
Department for Energy and Climate Change will set out the details of the preferred bidders, next<br />
steps on these front end engineering and design studies, and the process to final investment<br />
decision.</p>
<p>Who is going to save the poor bloody public from these public school plus PPE idiots?</p>

<p>Image right is for 7am tomorrow morning, raining hard here, will be snow approaching Rog in Leeds, a weather front fighting cold air further north.</p>
<p>The notoriously difficult to forecast blocking conditions are now modelled as continuing probably into April.</p>
<p>Growing conditions continue to be bad, running about a month later than last year here in southern England.</p>
<p><span id="more-11788"></span></p>
<p>I do have first spring blossom out but that is a miniature Japanese cherry in a pot.</p>
<p>This photo is dated 2nd March 2012</p>

<p>This shrub is fully exposed except for it&#8217;s back from an east wind, was out a month earlier last year but this year only showed first bud colour a few days ago, some way off opening.</p>
<p>The eating cherry, normally early flowering, shows no sign at all of bud movement.</p>
<p>Same date.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 260px"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-560.jpg?w=250&#038;h=188" width="250" height="188" align="left" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Snowdrop clump</p></div>
<p>Here is my reference clump of snowdrops last year, at end of flowering where right now nearly a month later are not as far over.</p>
<p>North side of a hazel and fence.</p>
<p>Have some cheer. This was cherry Stella 12th April 2012, can click for full size.</p>

<p>And 2012 was a <strong>late</strong> year. Yes we did get a small crop of fruit, as ever a headache netting to try and stop the birds. One poor apple last year, very little fruit on anything apart from raspberries, no jam. Few sticks of rhubarb but at least that is through this year.</p>
<p>Back to what is forecast.</p>
<p>Running left to right, top to bottom all at 7am. You can see the edge of the blocking in the Atlantic to the south-west.</p>

<p>The winter blocking, fortunately without intense cold or snow seems becoming more common. North polar weather rotation stalls. The presumption by me and I expect many more is related to the reduced solar activity. If true the magnetics bode ill, we have more to come.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that perhaps we are now seeing how nature pumps warm and cool at the horticultural limits, where plants and animal push but eventually find hostile conditions, spread is killed. Wet and cool is England.</p>
<p>I am waiting on complaints from the many who have planted tropical, and for dry conditions.</p>
<p>Whether this can control infestations is another matter. For example Harlequin ladybirds. Found and reported those a couple of years ago. In hindsight we found a host conifer too, a mixed colony, a fight going on.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Don&#8217;t clobber bloggers with Leveson</strong></p>
<p>Lord Leveson’s regulations are being applied to UK websites – in ways that could catch more or less anyone who publishes a blog. Ordinary bloggers could be threatened with exemplary damages and costs. If this happens, small website publishers will face terrible risks, or burdensome regulation – and many may simply stop publishing.</p>
<p>We have until Monday to stop this happening.</p>
<p>Lord Leveson said he wanted to regulate print media. He proposed that judges be allowed to award exemplary damages and full costs against unregulated publishers. These are stringent and controversial measures, but he only envisaged them applying to large and powerful publishers. Not websites, unless they belonged to print publishers.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the proposals were agreed in a rush, without public consultation, and with no attention to the detail.</p>
<p>Outrageously, they have given the Lords until Monday to fix their mistakes.</p>
<p><span id="more-11774"></span></p>
<p>The result is that they apply to any size of web publisher – if there’s more than one author, the content is edited and there’s a business involved, then you must join a self regulator.</p>
<p>Most blogs like this aren’t powerful publishing houses. Even ORGZine would need to be regulated, or face punitive measures if it ended up in court.</p>
<p>The threat of websites being regulated like this was never the purpose of Lord Leveson’s recommendations. Websites weren’t involved in phone hacking. There is no evidence that they need to be forced into self-regulation like this.</p>
<p>We need you to email Nick Clegg, Harriet Harman, and David Cameron to ask them to back off and leave the Internet out of Leveson.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>How do the planets affect the Sun ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">By Roy Martin Jan 5, 2013<br />
<em id="__mceDel">Revised March 17, 2013</em></p>
<p align="center"><i>“Knowledge is about as durable as green cheese.” </i>anon.<i></i></p>
<p> The barycentric motion of the Sun and the tidal forces acting on the Sun are both caused by the motion of the orbiting planets. This note was written to illustrate the differences between the combination of gravitational forces that cause the barycentric motion of the sun and the tidal forces believed to act principally on it&#8217;s surface layers. The first section was to be part of the introduction to a report about further work done on the tidal influence of the planets on solar activity, however it led to a few interesting, but quite unrelated observations about the synodic relationships between the planets and the José cycle, which would have been out of context there, so I have put them into this stand-alone note. As far as I know there is nothing fundamentally new here, just a somewhat different perspective on some older knowledge.</p>
<p>There is an intricate overlapping of features in the two phenomena, and yet they create distinctly different landscapes. This note aims to describe the differences and similarities relevant to my own studies, but they are possibly relevant to other on-going investigations and discussions surrounding the mechanisms by which the planets may effect both the solar cycle and the motion of the Sun about the barycentre.</p>
<p><span id="more-11770"></span>There is significant scope for confusion between the potential effects of the two causes. At least since the publication of José&#8217;s 1965 paper: &#8221;Sun&#8217;s Motion and Sunspots&#8221;, barycentric motion, or solar inertial motion (SIM), has been studied extensively. Many apparent correlations with events on earth and human activity have been identified, but most of those I have examined in any detail have failed to satisfy close scrutiny. The absence of any provable mechanism by which SIM caused by the planets can affect solar activity remains a major objection. SIM is fundamentally a whole-of-body effect, and as such none of the accelerations imposed on the Sun while orbiting the barycentre can differentially affect separate regions. Theories based on spin-orbit coupling appear to come up against the same objections.</p>
<p>During the same period, the possibility that tidal effects could affect solar activity was rejected and largely ignored, but in the last few years increased attention is being directed to this possibility. There is active reseach into suggested mechanisms, and in my own work I have identified close correlations between planetary induced tidal forces and the solar cycle. I now suspect that many of the correlations previously attributed to presumed SIM effects may be due to tidal effects occurring simultaneously.</p>
<p>We need to look at how each individual planet plays quite a different role in relation to SIM compared with tidal forces that may influence solar activity.</p>
<p>Figure 1. below is presented to show the relative effects of the major and minor planets, due to both the gravitational forces that cause barycentric motion, and the tidal effects which many are coming to believe are more likely to affect solar activity. The data plotted is from very simple physics, calculated using the basic formulae for gravitional and tidal forces. It is possible, even likely, that orbital eccentricity and inclination affect both to some extent, but are omitted from this analysis. I reason that if either gravitational or tidal effects are involved in modifying solar activity, it will first have to be shown and proved that the major primary forces due to one or the other are the principal cause. The individual bars represent the percentages of the total of the fully aligned planets.</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig1_all_planets_combined_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11528" alt="Fig1_All_planets_combined_01" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig1_all_planets_combined_01.jpg?w=614&#038;h=380" width="614" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>It can be seen from Fig.1 and Table 1. that the planets may be viewed as two overlapping groups:</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table1_planets_gravitational__tidal_groups.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11532" alt="Table1_Planets_gravitational_&amp;_tidal_groups" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table1_planets_gravitational__tidal_groups.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Table 1.</p>
<p>The gravitational group includes Saturn but not Mercury. The tidal group includes Mercury but not Saturn.</p>
<p>The relative magnitudes show the basic differences between the two groups. Jupiter and Saturn dominate the gravitational group, and Jupiter alone accounts for 74% of the total. How these two combine with Uranus and Neptune to create SIM will be looked at a more closely further on. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Jupiter cause 97.8% of the tidal forces, but the component from Jupiter is only 34.7%, which is nearly matched by Venus at 33%. The relative role of Mercury changes from 2.3% to 14.6%, almost equal to that of Earth, and thus has the potential to be a significant influence on tidal effects. The tidal group will be studied in much more detail in another note.</p>
<p>We should observe here that the planets do not exist in isolation. It is far too easy to become fixated on one of them as the sole or principal cause of an observed phenomena. Jupiter is a prime candidate for such attention because the orbital period is so close to that of the solar cycle, and it does play a big part in both sets, but in real life it is “&#8230;just a player in a rock and roll band.”</p>
<p>But we need to look at the basic forces in conjunction with the synodic periods between the various planets. Table 2. lists the relevant relationships, and we are immediately confronted by the problem that the network of interconnections between the gravitational and tidal planets is so complex that it can lead to the illusion that one is the cause of observed effects, when it is really the other.</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table2_synodic_periods_table_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11526" alt="Table2_Synodic_periods_table_01" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table2_synodic_periods_table_01.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Table 2.</p>
<p>In the gravitational group, the dominant synodic period is between Jupiter and Saturn, with a period of 19.8650 years. The 19.8650 x 9 = 178.7853 year multiple is of primary importance, because it appears to be the nominal period underlying the José cycle. I have therefore used it as a base period for comparisons. As shown in the table, the synodic periods of the major planets are all harmonically connected to the nominal 178.8 year period, the consequences of which can lead to endless discussion. Note the small differences between the 178.785 year nominal José cycle length and the nearest multiples for J-V, J-E and V-E.</p>
<p>The gravitational forces from Mercury, Mars, Uranus and Neptune are relatively small, but are included to show that their orbits also appear to be harmonically linked to the José cycle.</p>
<p>I tend to scepticism when claims are made that because a value is &#8216;close to&#8217; another it implies justification for causation, but here the José cycle correlations for all of the significant planets except Uranus are within +/- 0.2%, and it seems to me this is too close to ignore.</p>
<p>Similarly, we need to be cautious about numbers like the multiples of the synodic periods, because a given number can often be factored in different ways. Should these numbers be accepted as meaningful at all? In this case the factors are all about primes and Fibonacci numbers. We have six of the early primes: 2;3;5;7;11;13, the sum of which is 41, and 2;3;5;13 are also Fibonacci numbers. The sum of the alternate primes 3;7;13 is 23. Within the solar system, such relationships are often observed, and support other observations of the exquisite mathematical balance between planetary orbitital periods. I believe they can be taken seriously.</p>
<p>(Note: The multiple for Mercury could also be taken as 452, with factors 113 x 2<sup>2</sup>, giving the product 178.902 years. Take your pick, the difference matters little here.)</p>
<p>The harmonics of the Venus and Earth synodics are found to form a cycle 22.38 years long, which is very close indeed to one eighth of the José cycle. The derivation of the 22.38 year cycle is shown in Table 3. which further extends the relationships between the synodic periods. These relationships appear as important in studies of the possible effects of planetary tidal forces on the Sun:-</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table3_synodics__22-38_year_cycle_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11527" alt="Table3_Synodics_&amp;_22.38_year_cycle_01" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/table3_synodics__22-38_year_cycle_01.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Table 3.</p>
<p>With regard to Ref.1.), by reference back to the multiples in Table 2., we find that for Jupiter-Venus, 276/8 = 34.5; for Jupiter-Earth, 164/8 = 20.5, and the difference between them is 14, the multiple for Venus-Earth. And just for the fun of it, from the set of factors: (3&#215;23)/2 = 34.5,  41/2 = 20.5,  and 34.5x(2/3) = 21.  The half cycle difference plus and minus from a Fibonnaci number emerges as relevant in the plots of tidal forces on the Sun.</p>
<p>With regard to Ref.2.), the multiple differs very slightly from 11.0. The small adjustment was necessary to reconcile the 12.0037 year cycle period with the value derived from two separate studies on tidal effects. (The precise period is 0.648846 x (37/2) = 12.00365.)</p>
<p>In the context of the orbit of the Sun around the barycentre, the most important observation is one of the simplest, that nine J-S synodic periods are the dominant cause of the variation of the radius, as can be seen clearly in a plot of radius vs. time in Fig.2. This type of plot is a rather flat-earth way of presenting solar motion, but it shows the longer term temporal relationships much better than multiple polar plots. The J-U and J-N synodics combine to modulate both the amplitude of the radius and the peak-to-peak timing of the nine waves within each José cycle of 178.8 years. The pattern is very close to an exact repeat within the two cycles plotted here, and the near repetition is also seen in the previous three full cycles.</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig2_sun_radius_from_barycentre_1700_2100_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11529" alt="Fig2_Sun_radius_from_barycentre_1700_2100_01" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig2_sun_radius_from_barycentre_1700_2100_01.jpg?w=614&#038;h=356" width="614" height="356" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 2.</p>
<p>While Figure 1. illustrates the relative forces acting between each planet and the Sun, that does not reveal the actual effect each planet has on the movement of the Sun about the barycentre: The relationships in a simple two body system of rotating bodies in space is given by the expression: M<sub>p </sub>x R<sub>p</sub> = M <sub>s</sub>x R<sub>s</sub>, where M<sub>p</sub> &amp; M<sub>s</sub> are the masses of the planet and Sun, and R<sub>p</sub> &amp; R<sub>s</sub> are their respective radii from the common barycentre. As a means of illustrating the potential effect of each planet, the barycentric radius of the Sun has been calculated for each separate planet – Sun combination. These are shown in Figure 3.:</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig3_sun_barycentric_radius_-_separate_planets_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11771" alt="Fig3_Sun_barycentric_radius_-_Separate_planets_01" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig3_sun_barycentric_radius_-_separate_planets_01.jpg?w=614&#038;h=323" width="614" height="323" /></a><br />
Figure 3.</p>
<p>The dominant effect of Jupiter and Saturn is quite clear, but the effect of Uranus and Neptune is much greater than the gravitational forces acting would indicate. This is because of their very large orbital radii. The figures also show that the planets Venus, Earth, Mars, Pluto (and Mercury), can have only a very small effect on the barycentric motion of the Sun.</p>
<p>Figure 4. was drawn to illustrate the combining of three sine waves: the basic 19.865 year period J-S synodic cycle, plus the 13.813 year period J-U synodic cycle and the 12.783 year period J-N synodic cycle, phased as close as possible to the times of observed conjunctions, and scaled in approximately the same ratio as the separate planets barycentric radii shown above. This plot is disarmingly simple, yet it almost matches the plot of actual solar radii for the 1722 to 1901 period in Figure 2.above. Note that it is not possible to reproduce the plot exactly with simple sine waves because of the way the Sun actually orbits the barycentre.</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig4_sun_radius_from_barycentre_9_13_14_02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11772" alt="Fig4_Sun_radius_from_barycentre_9_13_14_02" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/fig4_sun_radius_from_barycentre_9_13_14_02.jpg?w=614&#038;h=479" width="614" height="479" /></a></p>
<p>Figure 4.</p>
<p>During the three cycles centred on the start and end dates at 1722 and 1901 the Sun traces successive orbits at a relatively large radius from the barycentre, then every second cycle during the middle six periods the Sun moves through tight loops passing close to the barycentre. The movement of the Sun during the middle six is thus somewhat different. The motion in tight loops causing the Sun to move almost radially to the barycentre, which is why the effect cannot be simulated with simple sine waves.</p>
<p>However, Figure 4. serves to emphasize the main point of this note; that there is a clear distinction between the effect on the Sun of the &#8216;gravitational&#8217; outer planets, and the &#8216;tidal&#8217; inner planets, Mercury, Venus, and Earth, noting however, that Jupiter plays a significant role in both.</p>
<p>To summarize: the synodic periods between the planets are shared between their gravitational and tidal influences on the Sun, but whereas the Jupiter-Saturn relationship dominates SIM, Venus-Earth-Jupiter relationships dominate the solar cycle scale tidal effects, with Mercury influencing some shorter term effects. Although some solar and terrestrial phenomena appear to correlate with SIM, the correlations are only partial and, to the best of my understanding, have no known physical connection.</p>
<p>I intend to cover the tidal influences more fully in later notes. They are proving to be a much more productive area of study. Suffice to say briefly in conclusion here; that tidal influences appear to correlate very closely with solar phenomena and with consequent effects on terrestrial phenomena.</p>
<p>As a footnote: In the work on the tidal theory there is a very significant cycle of 110.3 years. It is interesting to note that 110.3 x 1.61803(phi) = 178.48 years, within 0.31 years of the nominal José cycle period as derived above from the Jupiter – Saturn synodic.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the work done in preparing the notes on the barycentric motion of the Sun may help us to clarify what rotates about what in the solar system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/graphene.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11765" alt="graphene" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/graphene.jpeg?w=614"   /></a>Flashback to 2010:</em></p>
<p>The prestigious 2010 Nobel Prize for Physics was announced today (October 5), with the prize going to Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, both from the University of Manchester for their work on the development of graphene.</p>
<p>Graphene is a sheet of carbon that is a single atom thick. It is the most efficient conductor of heat known and it conducts electricity as effectively as copper. It is completely transparent, but dense enough to trap helium.</p>
<p>So how did they do it? Gigantic particle accelerator? Interstellar observatory? Witchcraft? None of the above. They used a piece of sticky tape and a pencil to remove a flake of the carbon in the pencil that was one atom thick. Seriously.<br />
________________________________</p>
<p><em>Fastforward to 2013:</em><br />
(Reuters) &#8211; A defense contractor better known for building jet fighters and lethal missiles says it has found a way to slash the amount of energy needed to remove salt from seawater, potentially making it vastly cheaper to produce clean water at a time when scarcity has become a global security issue.</p>
<p>The process, officials and engineers at Lockheed Martin Corp say, would enable filter manufacturers to produce thin carbon membranes with regular holes about a nanometer in size that are large enough to allow water to pass through but small enough to block the molecules of salt in seawater. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.</p>
<p>Because the sheets of pure carbon known as graphene are so thin &#8211; just one atom in thickness &#8211; it takes much less energy to push the seawater through the filter with the force required to separate the salt from the water, they said.</p>
<p><span id="more-11764"></span></p>
<p>The development could spare underdeveloped countries from having to build exotic, expensive pumping stations needed in plants that use a desalination process called reverse osmosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s 500 times thinner than the best filter on the market today and a thousand times stronger,&#8221; said John Stetson, the engineer who has been working on the idea. &#8220;The energy that&#8217;s required and the pressure that&#8217;s required to filter salt is approximately 100 times less.&#8221;</p>
<p>Access to clean drinking water is increasingly seen as a major global security issue. Competition for water is likely to lead to instability and potential state failure in countries important to the United States, according to a U.S. intelligence community report last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between now and 2040, fresh water availability will not keep up with demand absent more effective management of water resources,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Water problems will hinder the ability of key countries to produce food and generate electricity.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 780 million people around the world do not have access to clean drinking water, the United Nations reported last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the areas that we&#8217;re very concerned about in terms of global security is the access to clean and affordable drinking water,&#8221; said Tom Notaro, Lockheed business manager for advanced materials. &#8220;As more and more countries become more developed &#8230; access to that water for their daily lives is becoming more and more critical.&#8221;</p>
<p>PRODUCTION CHALLENGE</p>
<p>Lockheed still faces a number of challenges in moving to production of filters made of graphene, a substance similar to the lead in pencils. Working with the thin material without tearing it is difficult, as is ramping up production to the size and scale needed. Engineers are still refining the process for making the holes.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Lockheed faces commercial competition in this area. But it is not the only one working on the technology.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Grossman, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has done research on graphene membranes for filtration, said he was not familiar with details of Lockheed&#8217;s work. But he said finding a way to produce graphene sheets with nanometer-sized holes could produce a major advancement in desalination efficiency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can design a membrane that&#8217;s completely different than what we use today, then there&#8217;s a chance for more than two orders of magnitude (100 times) increase in the permeability of the membrane,&#8221; Grossman said.</p>
<p>Stetson, who began working on the issue in 2007, said if the new filter material, known as Perforene, was compared to the thickness of a piece of paper, the nearest comparable filter for extracting salt from seawater would be the thickness of three reams of paper &#8211; more than half a foot thick.</p>
