<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/iran-quake.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12396" alt="Iran-quake" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/iran-quake.png?w=614&#038;h=573" width="614" height="573" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-12395"></span></p>
<p>This from <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/04/16/uk-iran-quake-idUKBRE93F0E220130416">Reuters</a>:</p>
<p>A powerful earthquake struck southeast Iran near the border with Pakistan on Tuesday but with communications to the area badly disrupted, officials gave differing assessments of the casualty toll.</p>
<p>One Iranian official said hundreds of people were feared to have been killed. But an Iranian lawmaker from the region said the number of deaths was &#8220;not high&#8221;. A Pakistani official said at least five people been killed in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tremors from the 7.8 magnitude quake were also felt as far away as India and Gulf states.</p>
<p>The quake was centred in a remote desert and mountain region which is not densely populated. Assessing the damage was difficult due to the collapse in the communications network.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the biggest earthquake in Iran in 40 years and we are expecting hundreds of dead,&#8221; an Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Iranian politician Hamid Reza Pashang told the Mehr news agency: &#8220;From what we have heard from people in the stricken areas, we have learned that the number of deaths is not high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have talked to the people of Zabul, Saravan, Khash and other areas hit by the earthquake and they have said, the earthquake was not of a kind to cause many deaths,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Labour MEP Mary Honeyball thinks we&#8217;re trapped. I think I prefer UKIP&#8217;s message.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kingdom_of_england_vs_united_states_of_europe.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12393" alt="Kingdom_of_England_vs_United_States_of_Europe" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/kingdom_of_england_vs_united_states_of_europe.png?w=614&#038;h=236" width="614" height="236" /></a></p>
<p><strong>It is quite clear to that there will never be the agreement required from the 26 other EU member states for repatriation of powers to the UK – claims MEP </strong></p>
<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron and his family visited Angela Merkel last weekend at the German Chancellor&#8217;s guest residence Schloss Meseberg. We do not, in any detail at least, know what they discussed other than what was issued in a brief statement from Number 10 Downing Street. It revealed the two leaders discussed the need for reform of the single market and both reportedly called for &#8220;urgent action to make the European Union more competitive and flexible&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is well documented that the German chancellor has been anxious regarding Cameron&#8217;s plan for a referendum on the issue of Europe. Along with the French President François Hollande, Merkel has formed an alliance to illustrate the level of disapproval.</p>
<div>
<p><span id="more-12391"></span>Meanwhile, British Conservative Party MP Andrea Leadsom &#8211; leading member of the Fresh Start Campaign &#8211; timed remarks reported at the weekend to coincide with Cameron&#8217;s visit to Germany. Her Eurosceptic group within the Tory Party announced that it would be open to compromise on reforms. Why she has issued this statement is anyone&#8217;s guess but it is further indication of the dissent within the party and shows that Cameron&#8217;s so-called flagship policy is now in tatters.Of course, it was never going to be possible to repatriate powers in the way that British PM had wanted and this is something I have been saying since March 2010 &#8211; before Cameron was even elected into office. It was quite clear to those of us engaged in European politics that there would never be the agreement required from the 26 other European Union member states for repatriation to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Honeyball is a British Labour Party MEP representing London </strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: 15:00Hrs GMT</strong></p>
<p>Commissioner Hedegaard&#8217;s statement on today’s vote by the European Parliament on the backloading proposal</p>
<p>The European Parliament today voted against the Commission&#8217;s backloading proposal. In response to the Parliament&#8217;s vote, European Commission for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard said:</p>
<p>&#8221;The Commission of course regrets that the European Parliament has not approved the back-loading proposal. However, it is worth noting than when it was suggested in the second vote that the Parliament finalised its rejection right away, this was not supported. The proposal will now go back to the Parliament&#8217;s Environment Committee for further consideration. Europe needs a robust carbon market to meet our climate targets and spur innovation. The Commission remains convinced that back-loading would help restore confidence in the EU ETS in the short term until we decide on more structural measures. We will now reflect on the next steps to ensure that Europe has strong EU ETS. In doing so the Council&#8217;s position on the proposal will be an important factor and I take note of the Irish Presidency&#8217;s reaction today to urgently pursue and conclude discussions among Member States. The market, the investors and our international partners are all awaiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Background info</p>
<p>Today, the European Parliament voted against in its plenary session on a draft change to the EU&#8217;s emissions trading system (ETS):</p>
<p>The European Commission had proposed to postpone (back-load) the auctioning of 900 million EU ETS allowances from the years 2013-2015 until 2019-2020. This measure was designed to rebalance supply and demand and to reduce price volatility without any significant impacts on competitiveness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>On Twitter this morning, I was delighted to see the government&#8217;s new chief advisor, Sir Mark Walport, asking the public for questions to put to the Science and Technology Committee. This is a refreshing change from the imperious attitude adopted by the previous incumbent, Sir John Beddington.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/sir-mark2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12380" alt="sir-mark" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/sir-mark2.png?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Dear Sir Mark,</p>
<p>Thank you for making yourself accessible to the public and for inviting questions to be put to the Science and Technology Committee.</p>
<p>I am one of the UK&#8217;s more prominent ‘sceptical’ climate bloggers (No.2 for site traffic not far behind Andrew Montford’s ‘Bishop Hill’).<br />
My degree is in History and Philosophy of science, and I’m also a qualified mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>My question for the S&amp;T committee is this:</p>
<p><span id="more-12377"></span></p>
<p>Since it is now evident to anyone making an impartial assessment of the current level of uncertainty in the institutionally entrenched climate science paradigm that the question of the dominance of carbon dioxide as a climate forcing is very much an open one, how wide does the government intend to open the public purse to pay for the construction of ‘carbon capture and storage’ infrastructure, when it is clear from the most rudimentary cost benefit analysis that this is pure tokenism, even accepting the IPCC’s own figures on the thermal effectiveness of extra airborne CO2?</p>
<p>I have an additional question for your own consideration as a scientist:</p>
<p>If the negative phases of natural variations are sufficiently geo-effective in the 21<sup>st</sup> century to cancel the alleged effect of extra airborne co2 on surface temperature, how much did their positive phases contribute to the warming of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century?</p>
<p>To help you decide, I include a reconstruction I have made of the last 150 years of global ocean surface temperature. The upper panel shows the constituent forcings. The lower panel shows the match between the combination of forcings and the state of the art SST temperature record from Hadley. The correlation has a Pearson R^2 value of 0.9. I have added some notes of explanation below the figure.</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sst-model1.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-9172" alt="sst-model" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/sst-model1.png?w=614&#038;h=252" width="614" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>Notes.</p>
<p>ssnc – norm represents the geo-temperature effect of changing solar activity levels, including the (probably cloud cover) amplification discovered by Prof Nir Shaviv in his Journal of Geophysical Research paper ‘Using the oceans as a calorimeter’. It consists of a cumulative integration of the sunspot number departing from the 350 year average as a proxy for ocean heat content (The long term average coincides with a phenomenologically determined value at which the oceans neither gain nor lose heat content. It is necessary to integrate the SSN since the oceans have a large thermal inertia. For this reason, a simplistic perusal of the falling maximum amplitudes of solar cycles since 1960 is not an adequate justification for the assumption that the Sun cannot be responsible for around 0.15C of the late C20th increase in global surface temperature.</p>
<p>AMO – norm represents the detrended SST of the northern Atlantic ocean. The Northern Pacific follows a similar cyclic trend, and the magnitude of the contribution of this global oceanic oscillation is estimated at around 0.2C for the 1970-2005 period</p>
<p>Ln – co2 represents the logarithmically bound contribution of CO2. The airborne CO2 fraction is partly temperature driven so the internal feedback has to be accounted for in estimating its contribution of around 0.25C over the C20th.</p>
<p>SOI – norm is the sea level pressure difference between Darwin and Tahiti used by CSIRO to estimate the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Its contribution to decadal variation is estimated to be in the region of 0.1C.</p>
<p>I don’t expect to be able to single handedly convince the mainstream climate science establishment that they have made some fundamental errors in assessing the relative contributions of internal and external drivers of the climate system, but I hope your fresh pair of eyes and attuned sense of uncertainty assessment will make a valuable contribution to both the scientific and policy debates. I’ll leave you with a quote from Prof Phil Jones, head of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of east Anglia:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>We don’t fully understand how to input things like changes in the oceans, and because we don’t fully understand it you could say that natural variability is now working to suppress the warming. We don’t know what natural variability is doing.</i></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I hope you will recall this quote to mind whenever you hear statements of conviction concerning climate science, and when you look at the error bars provided on climate model output.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, please acknowledge personal receipt of this communication so I know I haven’t been ‘filtered out’. If you would like a copy of the spreadsheet of my model to test or modify, please feel free to request it.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Photographed 15th April 2013, Camellia &#8220;Mars&#8221;, colour rendition is reasonable, reds are always difficult to capture, is a little richer. To do this I had to click and creak down to lying on a mat, camera is looking slightly upwards. Windy day, camera on aperture priority, and this is hand held, hence not quite sharp. Lens is 28mm equivalent.</p>
<p>Post is an update on <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/i-hope-this-gcm-is-wrong-yet-more-cold-weather/">http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/i-hope-this-gcm-is-wrong-yet-more-cold-weather/</a></p>
<p>Where the same shrub is shown in flower 2nd March 2012.</p>
<p><span id="more-12374"></span></p>
<p>The reference cherry &#8220;Stella&#8221; is some time off blossom. The buds have started to swell, just showing as dull green. I&#8217;ll post when this matches last year&#8217;s photo, which is marked cherry Stella 12th April 2012. (as so often I spelt the name wrongly last time)</p>
<p>Lots of odds and ends in flower or moving.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-601.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-601-small.jpg?w=550&#038;h=412" width="550" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>These Hyacinth fully opened yesterday, can click for full size, they are real, not plastic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-602.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-602-small.jpg?w=550&#038;h=733" width="550" height="733" /></a></p>
<p>Wallflowers, yellow there as well, surprise me. I used to think they were a hot summer plants yet these are established, probably 10+ years and were in flower more than a month ago. Remarkably too yes they are strongly scented. They will go on for months.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">End of 2012 season</span></p>
<p>To add a little more interest the last summer flower for 2012</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-603.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-603-small.jpg?w=550&#038;h=412" width="550" height="412" /></a></p>
<p>Dated 18th November 2012, this had somehow avoided the frost. The following morning it was was lying limp, dead. Nasturtiums are cheerful, can climb and everything is edible. (seeds are essentially capers)</p>
<p>Passion flower vines I grew from seed this time last year have been outside all winter. They are looking a bit sad, beaten up by the wind and cold yet they mostly still have their leaves. With luck this year they will flower. Only they will I discover whether they have come true or hybridised.</p>
<p>A few unusual plants here. Maybe stop before I bore people.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The weather</span></p>
<p>The blocking has been replaced by in effect a continued minor blocking from the north east so the forcast is a north south fight with much warmer for England but the North of England and Scotland continue with cool conditions, some frost and snow over high ground. Night frosts for England are not over yet.</p>
<p>Western continental Europe are seeing sunshine, approaching 30C in places.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A Stihl saw and diamond wheel should sort this problem out:</em></p>
<div id="attachment_12364" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/turbine-house.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-12364" alt="turbine-house" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/turbine-house.jpg?w=300&#038;h=187" width="300" height="187" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo-Alamy</p></div>
<p>Energy firms will be allowed to build giant wind turbines just 350 metres from residential areas after a crucial ruling by a High Court judge.</p>
<p>The judge decided that a council&#8217;s attempt to impose a minimum distance of 1.2km (three quarters of a mile) between wind farms and people&#8217;s homes was unlawful, in a test case that could have far-reaching consequences for national planning laws.</p>
<p>Milton Keynes Borough Council in Buckinghamshire tried to prevent the wind energy firm RWE Npower Renewables Ltd from erecting 125 metre high turbines less than 1,217 metres from homes after it put in planning applications for two wind farms in the borough.</p>
<p><span id="more-12363"></span></p>
<p>The firm took the council to court, arguing that the &#8220;emerging policy&#8221; of imposing a sliding scale of minimum distances, based on the height of turbines, contradicted its existing local development plan, which recommends a minimum distance of 350m.</p>
<p>The company argued that the new policy would &#8220;sterilise&#8221; the borough for wind farms because so few sites would comply with it, and feared that the policy would set a national precedent.</p>
<p>Judge John Howells QC agreed with RWE today in a High Court judgement which is likely to be used as a trump card by energy firms whenever councils object to wind farms being built too close to homes.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that &#8220;wind turbines generate passionate argument as well as energy&#8221;, the judge said there was &#8220;no objective justification&#8221; for the proximity restrictions, regardless of actual noise or visual impact.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><em>My thanks to Roger Andrews, who sent me this guest post a little while ago and has been very patiently waiting for me to publish it. I had a good look around Bob Tisdale&#8217;s site before deciding to go ahead, to check he hadn&#8217;t already done the same thing. I can&#8217;t find anything directly comparable, so here it is. Hopefully Bob will join us in comments and let us know. Nicola Scafetta and others have shown a ~60-70yr pattern the motion of the solar system&#8217;s planets which we suspect is linked to this natural cyclic variation. It hasn&#8217;t been taken into account by climate models. The positive, warming phase of the oceanic cycles coincides with &#8216;global warming&#8217; attributed to the increase in co2 by the IPCC. Ignoring the natural oceanic cycles amounts to something which in commercial law is known as &#8216;omitted variable fraud&#8217;.</em></p>
<p align="center"><b>A NEW CLIMATE INDEX – THE NORTHERN MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION<br />
</b>Roger Andrews &#8211; March 28-2013</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely recognized that weather and climate are strongly influenced by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in and around the North Atlantic Ocean and by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in and around the North Pacific Ocean, if not globally. But as illustrated below the AMO and the PDO show quite different trends, giving the impression that North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean cycles march to the beat of a different drummer:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eoearth.org/files/111301_111400/111389/AMO_-_USGS.jpg">http://www.eoearth.org/files/111301_111400/111389/AMO_-_USGS.jpg<br />
</a><a href="http://www.eoearth.org/files/111301_111400/111389/AMO_-_USGS.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://www.eoearth.org/files/111301_111400/111389/AMO_-_USGS.jpg" width="499" height="351" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.eoearth.org/files/111301_111400/111389/AMO_-_USGS.jpg"><span id="more-12357"></span></a></p>
<p>But in fact they don&#8217;t. The above comparison is misleading because the AMO and PDO measure quite different things (the AMO is derived from detrended North Atlantic SST anomalies and the PDO from the difference in SST between the west and east North Pacific). When we compare detrended North Pacific SSTs with detrended North Atlantic SSTs – i.e. apples to apples – we find that the +/- 60 year AMO cyclicity is present in the North Pacific as well as in the North Atlantic, as shown below (the plots below cover the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans north of the Equator, use straight-line detrending and show both “corrected” and uncorrected SST data sets)</p>
<p><a href="http://oi47.tinypic.com/zlzwuq.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://oi47.tinypic.com/zlzwuq.jpg" width="680" height="1436" /></a></p>
<p>How much difference does this make? Well, right now it&#8217;s just another piece of information to plug into the equation, and the fact that I&#8217;ve been unable to find any mention in the literature of the AMO cycle existing in the Pacific Ocean suggests that it isn&#8217;t common knowledge. (It would be if anyone had  published a “PMO” index to complement the AMO index, but no one has.)</p>
<p>A separate PMO index could of course be constructed, but with substantially the same cyclicity present in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific the SST data from both can be combined into a single “Northern Multidecadal Oscillation Index” (NMO). There are various ways of calculating this index and a range of outcomes is therefore possible, but here&#8217;s a preliminary version calculated from linearly-detrended ERSST v3b data from the Atlantic and Pacific between 25N and 60N, the latitude band ERSST uses to calculate the AMO:</p>
<p><a href="http://oi45.tinypic.com/i5t9n4.jpg"><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://oi45.tinypic.com/i5t9n4.jpg" width="649" height="472" /></a><br />
As one would expect the NMO is very similar to the AMO, but it&#8217;s hemispheric in extent rather than confined to the North Atlantic (I say “hemispheric” because there seems to be no related Southern Multidecadal Oscillation. The oscillations occur almost entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and their amplitude decreases towards the Equator.)</p>
<p>Northern Hemisphere air temperatures show the same cylicity, with amplitudes again decreasing towards the Equator but with air temperatures tending to lead rather than lag SSTs. This has some  intriguing implications that I might get round to presenting later.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract. </strong></p>
<p>Solar activity, together with human activity, is considered a possible factor for<br />
the global warming observed in the last century. However, in the last decades solar activity<br />
has remained more or less constant while surface air temperature has continued to increase,<br />
which is interpreted as an evidence that in this period human activity is the main factor for<br />
global warming.We show that the index commonly used for quantifying long-term changes<br />
in solar activity, the sunspot number, accounts for only one part of solar activity and using<br />
this index leads to the underestimation of the role of solar activity in the global warming<br />
in the recent decades. A more suitable index is the geomagnetic activity which reflects all<br />
solar activity, and it is highly correlated to global temperature variations in the whole period<br />
for which we have data.</p>
<p><span id="more-12346"></span><!--more--></p>
<p>4. Discussion<br />
The geomagnetic activity reflects the impact of<br />
solar activity originating from both closed and<br />
open magnetic field regions, so it is a better indicator<br />
of solar activity than the sunspot number<br />
which is related to only closed magnetic<br />
field regions. It has been noted that in the last<br />
century the correlation between sunspot number<br />
and geomagnetic activity has been steadily<br />
decreasing from &#8211; 0.76 in the period 1868-</p>
<p>1890, to 0.35 in the period 1960-1982, while<br />
the lag has increased from 0 to 3 years (Vieira<br />
et al. 2001). According to Echer et al. (2004),<br />
the probable cause seems to be related to the<br />
double peak structure of geomagnetic activity.<br />
The second peak, related to high speed solar<br />
wind from coronal holes, seems to have<br />
increased relative to the first one, related to<br />
sunspots (CMEs) but, as already mentioned,<br />
this type of solar activity is not accounted<br />
for by the sunspot number. In Figure 6 the<br />
long-term variations in global temperature are<br />
compared to the long-term variations in geomagnetic<br />
activity as expressed by the ak-index<br />
(Nevanlinna and Kataja 2003). The correlation<br />
between the two quantities is 0.85 with p&lt;0.01<br />
for the whole period studied.It could therefore<br />
be concluded that both the decreasing correlation<br />
between sunspot number and geomagnetic<br />
activity, and the deviation of the global<br />
temperature long-term trend from solar activity<br />
as expressed by sunspot index are due to<br />
the increased number of high-speed streams of<br />
solar wind on the declining phase and in the<br />
minimum of sunspot cycle in the last decades.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By Roy Martin<br />
Revised April 16 2013</p>
<h3><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/orrery.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-12360" alt="orrery" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/orrery.jpg?w=300&#038;h=234" width="300" height="234" /></a>Summary</h3>
<p>Modern observations and research have given us a great deal of knowledge and understanding of the behaviour of the Sun and the underlying processes. [edit]  And yet there is still no generally accepted explanation of why, even after sometimes significant excursions, the length of the SC has averaged close to eleven years over extended periods of time.</p>
<p>This note continues to argue that the long term timing of the solar cycle, or Schwabe cycle (SC), is controlled by the tidal influences of the planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter.</p>
<p>(A PDF of this article can be <a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/the_solar_cycle_clock_01a.pdf">downloaded here</a>. Click on plots to open full size. )</p>
<p><span id="more-12298"></span></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In a previous study (1), it was found that the tidal effects of Venus, Earth and Jupiter produced a cycle with an average period of 11.03 years, which appeared to define the true long term SC. That conclusion was based on the analysis of calculations using the Index proposed by Hung (2009) (2), and while it seemed a valid result, was possibly questionable because it was based on a derived Index giving equal weight to the effect of each planet rather than direct calculations with correct weighting. Also, the conclusions were based primarily on detailed analysis of under two hundred years of data, with only spot checking of some earlier periods.</p>
<p>This study seeks to overcome those limitations using the simple first-principles methods described in the next section, including extending the period covered from 1500 to 2050. The primary objective is to establish if there is a strong enough correlation between the planetary tidal forces and observed solar activity to affirm the basic conclusions of the earlier study, and thus warrant acceptance as a hypothesis for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The resultant tidal force vector (TFV) from the planets Venus. Earth and Jupiter was calculated from the basic tidal formula, for the period from 1500 to 2050. The mechanism or mechanisms by which the primary TFV may affect the Sun is assumed to be by modulating the velocity of the Â horizontal flows on the surface of the Sun. However, while that concept is simple, analysis is expected to be very complex. This is referred to in more detail in the discussion below. In this study the resultant TFV is therefore considered to be a proxy for the final integrated effect. Although it is recognized that orbital eccentricities and inclination may also affect how tidal forces affect the Sun, it is assumed here that they are small enough to be initially disregarded. Mercury is not included at this stage. Although the tidal force caused by Mercury is about the same as that of the Earth, the short orbital period, and thus the shorter times for which it&#8217;s tidal force acts in one direction, is assumed to reduce the effect through the assumed mechanism.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the tidal force vector was plotted on a time scale from 1500 to 2050, in segments of fifty years. Smooth curves drawn through the high points spaced at 3.24422 year intervals appear as five sinusoidal curves, which are arbitrarily numbered 1-5 starting from the first peak after 1900.</p>
<p>Note that the orbital data used is given to at least eight significant digits, and the calculations were run to eight decimal places, but calculated values quoted here are generally rounded down to five or six digit accuracy. Consequently, small differences may occur between rounded values.</p>
<p>Observed SC data from 1700 to the present was obtained from SIDC. SC data for the period from 1500 to 1700 is not available from direct observation, but monthly data reconstructed from auroral observations and other sources was obtained from Letfus (1993) (3), for the 1500 to 1700 period. The monthly sunspot data with even numbered cycles reversed is plotted on the same time scales as the tidal plots.</p>
<p>The plots for the four fifty year periods from 1850 to 2050 are shown in Figures 1a to 1d. These are described and analysed in the following section.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>There are a number of fundamental characteristics of the TFV illustrated by Figures 1a to 1d, some of which appear to be highly significant:-</p>
<ol>
<li>The shortest cycles in the plot have a period of 0.64885 years, which is the synodic period of Venus and Jupiter</li>
<li>The intermediate peaks forming the five long waves have a constant period of 3.24422 years, exactly five times the V-J synodic period.</li>
<li>The five long waves all have a period of 110.304 years, which is exactly 34 x 3.24422</li>
<li>The average spacing of the five long waves is 110.304/5 = 22.0608 years.</li>
<li>There are ten periods marked out by the peaks of the 110 year waves and the points at which they cross, which are marked by red lines, hereafter referred to as nodes. These appear to vary very slightly in length (which may be an artefact of plotting), but over the full 1500 to 2050 time scale, covering 50 cycles, clearly have an average period of 11.0304 years.</li>
<li>Close to each of the 110 yr. period nodes, there are characteristically symmetrical patterns in the 0.6488 periods. Those close to the long wave peaks are designated W and X, and those close to the cross over points Y and Z. The patterns tend to alternate, but sometimes occur in succession. Different sequences in the alignment of the planets occur at around each of these points.</li>
<li>The periods between the nodes marked by the red lines are either 10.3815 or 12.0037 years long, designated q1 and q2 respectively.<br />
We find that q1 = 16 x 0.64885; q2 = ~11 x 1.09208 yrs., the J-E synodic, and also q2 = (37/2) x 0.64885. (Note: ~11 =&gt; 10.9916)</li>
<li>Between 1500 and 2050, q1 and q2 occur in the ratio of 3:2, and mostly in groups of five such that 3 x q1 + 2 x q2 = 55.152 years, exactly half the long wave period. I have dubbed this grouping of periods a Quintet cycle. The average of the q1 and q2 periods, both in each Quintet group and over the full period, is also 11.0304 years. It is noted that the 3 x q1 and 2 x q2 periods do not occur in any particular sequence within the 55.152 year periods.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that the planetary tidal forces from V-E-J provide the primary timing for the SC, these calculations directly imply that the long term average length of the SC is 11.0304 years. Similarly the long term average of the Hale cycle becomes 22.0608 years.</p>
<p>The actual average SC length over the full set of observed and reconstructed periods, from cycles -22 to 23, covering 46 cycles from 1501.5 to 2008.9, is indeed 11.03 years. Also, analysis of the distribution of SC lengths over time shows prominent peaks in occurrence at 10.4 and 12.0 years.</p>
<p>This set of characteristic cycles in the tidal forces exerted on the Sun provide an accurate framework against which to assess possible correlations with the observed and reconstructed features of the SC.</p>
<p>We see from Figures 1a to 1d that all solar R<sub>max</sub> dates are aligned at or close to the nodal points of the 110.3 year waves. More particularly, all odd numbered positive R<sub>max</sub> dates are closely associated with the nodes at the high points of the waves, and all even numbered negative R<sub>max</sub> dates are closely associated with the nodes at the intermediate crossover. These associations are consistent back to 1500. They are particularly relevant as the most likely basis for the Gnevyshef-Ohl Rule, which states that the sum of the sunspots occurring within positive numbered cycles is mostly less than the sum in the following odd numbered cycle. Altogether, these observations are highly significant because they imply a correlation over the &gt;500 year period covered of 100%, and so are analysed in more detail.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-193.png"><img class=" " alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-193-small.png?w=550&#038;h=484" width="550" height="484" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Figure 2. is a cross plot of the dates defined by the nodal points preceding each solar cycle, set at regular 11.0304 intervals, vs. the observed and reconstructed solar R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> dates. The R2 values of 0.9999 and 0.9998 respectively again demonstrate an almost perfect correlation of the observed dates with the regular 11.0304 year period in the resultant tidal forces from Venus, Earth and Jupiter. This is quite definitely not a matter of chance. With such close correlations, it is logical to assume we can now use the nodal dates from the full 1500 to 2050 plots as reference points for further analysis of the relationships between solar events within each cycle.</p>
<p>Figures 3.,&amp; 5. show a number of these relationships.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-194.png"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-194-small.png?w=550&#038;h=308" width="550" height="308" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. Times at which solar minima and maxima occur after<br />the previous node date of the 110 year cycle.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">The time of the tidal node before the SC under consideration has been used for the analysis in Figures 3. &amp; 5.. This is consistent with a number of studies that show that solar activity in cycle n appears to be associated with events around the maximum of cycle n-1.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In Figure 3., the times of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> are seen to fluctuate about a mean line by +3.12/-3.48 and +4.29/-4.74 respectively, with no visually detectable trend. (There may be small trends, but in such a short and irregular series, with higher start and lower end values, it is unlikely they would be reliable indicators.) They appear to vary at random in relation to the nodes, but the absence of any significant trend can be taken as further confirmation of the high correlation between observed or Â reconstructed dates in relation to the timing reference dates shown in Figure 2. Another test of the validity of the correlation would be to assume that instead of using the tidal node timing dates, which average 11.03 years over the long term, we were to use node dates based on a regular 11.10 year period, which is around the most commonly accepted SC length. That would create a difference over the study period of 47 cycles of:(11.10 &#8211; 11.03) x 47 = 3.29 years, enough to introduce a significant trend, which seems inconsistent with observations.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-195.png"><img class=" " alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-195-small.png?w=550&#038;h=310" width="550" height="310" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Individual solar cycle rise times.</p></div>
<p>From 1700 until the present, the plot in Figure 4 is essentially the same as the many published plots of rise times. Inclusion of the reconstructed values from 1500 to1700 provides us with the opportunity to observe that the behaviour of the Sun in the twentieth century was very much like that in the sixteenth. Also, we can see the longer and slower rise times associated with the low solar activity in the seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries, during the Maunder and Dalton minimum periods respectively. Overall, this pattern again appears to be rather random. There do not appear to be regular continuing cyclic variations on any time scale.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-196.png"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/image-196-small.png?w=550&#038;h=253" width="550" height="253" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5</p></div>
<p>Figure 5. Cross plots of solar cycle rise times vs. the times of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> after the previous 110 year cycle node.</p>
<p>The individual solar cycle rise times shown in Figure 4. appear to roughly track the times of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> in relation to the previous node, however Figure 5. reveals that there is no significant correlation between solar rise times and the time at which R<sub>min</sub> occurs after the tidal node. An R2 value of only 0.029 implies that the different rise times actually occur at random in relation to the 11.03 year periods. Hence the very irregular plot in Figure 4., which looks somewhat like a random walk. Thus solar rise times are not a direct function of the time by which the SC may occur earlier or later in relation to the timing reference dates, so we must conclude that rise times and the length of the solar cycle cannot be predicted simply by the timing of R<sub>min</sub>. On the other hand, with an R2 value of 0.283, the rise time does appear to correlate a little with the time of R<sub>max</sub> after the previous tidal node, implying some degree of influence from the tidal action of the planets on the rate of rise and hence the timing of R<sub>max</sub>. That would also be consistent with the conclusions from various studies that the magnitude of R<sub>max</sub> .in a cycle is a function of events shortly after R<sub>max</sub> in the preceding cycle.</p>
<h3>Discussion and conclusions</h3>
<p>We must observe two important caveats when discussing how planetary tides may affect solar activity. The first caveat is that planetary tidal tides are too weak in relation to the gravitational force at the surface to cause more than a few mm. vertical displacement of the surface. This acknowledged fact is the reason why suggestions that the planets could affect solar activity were flatly dismissed for so long. That thinking completely ignored the possible effects of horizontal components. The second caveat is that planetary tides do not directly affect the phenomena described by theories on the solar dynamo. The solar dynamo is clearly the primary driver of events in the Sun. However, evidence suggest that tidal effects can influence both the timing and magnitude of solar activity.</p>
<p>In the introduction, reference was made to the assumption that the mechanism by which the primary TFV can affect solar activity is a modulation of the velocity of the horizontal flows on the surface. There is an observed meridional flow on the surface from the equator towards the poles. Variations in the velocity of the meridional surface flow are observed to occur within SC&#8217;s and over the longer term. Velocities occurring in one SC are seen to correlate well with the number of sunspots in the following SC. Further, the horizontal components of the TFV are large enough to significantly affect the velocity of the meridional flow during the time of a SC. The solar dynamo and the sequence of events within a SC have been studied extensively and in great detail by many over the past few decades, and rather than try to make a brief summary here, I refer to work done by Katya Georgieva et.al.(4) (5), in particular: Solar dynamo and geomagnetic activity (2010) (4). These contain very clear explanations of the events in the SC giving rise to the meridional surface flow and the events leading to the variations in sunspot numbers, with extensive supporting references. The results derived here show that the occurrence of events in the Sun are closely synchronized with periodic variations in the tidal forces exerted on the Sun by the planets Venus, Earth and Jupiter. This synchronization will have taken millions of years to evolve and become firmly established in the present configuration, but appears to have been stable during the current era.</p>
<p>What can be regarded as the clock timing of the SC is seen to be maintained by the synodic periods of Jupiter-Venus and Jupiter-Earth, as detailed in Items 7. and 8. in the results section above. The 10.3815 an 12.0037 periods in the planetary tidal forces appear to be fundamental in controlling the length of the Schwabe and Hale cycles over periods of centuries. Figure 3. shows that the dates of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> are, on at least century time scales, constrained in relation to the nodal dates defined by the tidal forces of V-E-J. The apparently random cycle-to-cycle variations in relation to the nodes can largely be attributed to accountable variations in the meridional velocity at the surface, and the prevailing level of diffusivity. It has also been shown that the alternating high and low nodes are the most likely driver of the differential between positive and negative numbered SCs described by the Gnevyshef-Ohl Rule.</p>
<p>Similar conclusions have also been reached by Wilson (6), using a different type of analysis based on the alignments of Venus, Earth and Jupiter, as distinct from the calculated tidal forces approach of the current study. In particular, that study identified different planetary alignments at odd and even solar maxima associated with the Gnevyshef-Ohl Rule. The findings of the current study complement and support Wilson&#8217;s observation, and together they present a strong case for a planetary cause of the long term timing of the solar cycle.</p>
<p>In another study, Wilson (7) proposed a tidal torquing model as the mechanism through which the planets control the synchronization with the timing of the SC. At the present time it is my opinion that this proposition is open to question, based on my understanding of the most likely variations in the distribution and timing of the tidal forces acting on the Sun.</p>
<p>While this study establishes the underlying forces causing the SC to be synchronized with the the motion of the planets, it does not provide us with an immediately obvious means of determining the actual times of R<sub>min</sub> or R<sub>max</sub>. Investigations into this deficiency are continuing, noting that in the previous study, based on the Hung Index(1), close correlations were found between elements of the tidal Index plot and the actual times of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p>Mercury plays a definite role in the planetary tidal effects on the Sun, but after a brief look at plots with Mercury included, it was decided to focus first on the effects of Venus, Earth and Jupiter, for direct comparison with the earlier work (1). The results of this current work will make it easier to understand and appreciate the particular and significant role played by Mercury when it is included.</p>
