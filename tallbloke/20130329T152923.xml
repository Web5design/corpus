				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article by Frazer Nelson, editor of the &#8216;The Spectator’ eloquently expresses the issue which I find it hard to write about without lapsing into anglo-saxon. Please take the time to read it in full over at the Telegraph.

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>It’s the cold, not global warming, that we should be worried about</strong><br />
No one seems upset that in modern Britain, old people are freezing to death as hidden taxes make fuel more expensive<br />
Frazer Nelson 29 March 2013</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-cold.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11952" alt="old-cold" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/old-cold.jpeg?w=614"   /></a>A few months ago, a group of students in Oslo produced a brilliant spoof video that lampooned the charity pop song genre. It showed a group of young Africans coming together to raise money for those of us freezing in the north. “A lot of people aren’t aware of what’s going on there right now,” says the African equivalent of Bob Geldof. “People don’t ignore starving people, so why should we ignore cold people? Frostbite kills too. Africa: we need to make a difference.” The song – Africa for Norway – has been watched online two million times, making it one of Europe’s most popular political videos.</p>
<p>The aim was to send up the patronising, cliched way in which the West views Africa. Norway can afford to make the joke because there, people don’t tend to die of the cold. In Britain, we still do. Each year, an official estimate is made of the “excess winter mortality” – that is, the number of people dying of cold-related illnesses. Last winter was relatively mild, and still 24,000 perished. The indications are that this winter, which has dragged on so long and with such brutality, will claim 30,000 lives, making it one of the biggest killers in the country. And still, no one seems upset.<br />
<span id="more-11951"></span></p>
<p>Somewhere between the release of the 1984 Band Aid single and Al Gore’s 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth, political attention shifted away from such problems. The idea of people (especially old people) dying in their homes from conditions with which we are all familiar now seems relatively boring. Much political attention is still focused on global warming, and while schemes to help Britain prepare for the cold are being cut, the overseas aid budget is being vastly expanded. Saving elderly British lives has somehow become the least fashionable cause in politics.</p>
<p>The reaction to the 2003 heatwave was extraordinary. It was blamed for 2,000 deaths, and taken as a warning that Britain was horribly unprepared for the coming era of snowless winters and barbecue summers. The government’s chief scientific officer, Sir David King, later declared that climate change was “more serious even than the threat of terrorism” in terms of the number of lives that could be lost. Such language is never used about the cold, which kills at least 10 times as many people every winter. Before long, every political party had signed up to the green agenda.</p>
<p>Since Sir David’s exhortations, some 250,000 Brits have died from the cold, and 10,000 from the heat. It is horribly clear that we have been focusing on the wrong enemy. Instead of making sure energy was affordable, ministers have been trying to make it more expensive, with carbon price floors and emissions trading schemes. Fuel prices have doubled over seven years, forcing millions to choose between heat and food – and government has found itself a major part of the problem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Davey Kingston &amp; Surbiton, Liberal Demorat.</p>
<p>1: Climate change is the most important issues  facing us today ­ and has been for some time. The consequences if we do not tackle this urgently and fully are potentially catastrophic for the whole human race and life on the earth. The problem to date has been persuading enough people to recognise the threat, and despite Al Gore et al., I remain alarmed at how few people still really understand the scale of the problem and how fast we need to move.</p>
<p><span id="more-11939"></span></p>
<p>2: We must lead ­ lead the debate and lead the action. If Britain does commit itself unilaterally to largescale reductions in greenhouse gas emissiomns say to the oft discussed 60% target by 2050 ­ that will be an excellent start, if, at the same time, we set out a credible pathway, with policy changes starting now.The list of policies is well known ­ but worth repeating. Top comes the need to accelerate significantly the development of renewable energy and investment in energy conservation and efficiency, particularly for existing housing, where standards are still very low. We need to promote actively a decentralised energy system based more on microgeneration, using solar panels, small wind turbines and combined heat and power units to make buildings net generators of electricity ­ reducing reliance on the centralised and relatively inefficient system of major power stations. The EU should lead too, with a much tougher Emissions Trading Scheme. Reducing emissions from transport is also an urgent priority, where we must improve public transport, reducing the environmental impact of motor transport and aviation, and reducing the need to travel in the first place.We should also be prepared to look at even more radical measures, from personal carbon allowances to new international agencies with teeth, from a global emissions trading system to new WTO rules that link free trade and carbon reduction. The tough international challenge is to tackle climate change whilst making poverty history and that will require leadership that is consistent, principled and prepared to say tough things to friendly and less friendly countries alike.</p>
<p>3: Just as Government must lead the debate and lead by example, that&#8217;s what all MPs who believes this is serious should be doing. Personally I&#8217;ve done some of the easier things. I&#8217;ve written about it, delivered leaflets about it, spoken about it and had high street stalls to campaign on climate change. I&#8217;ve got energy efficient light bulbs, have good loft insulation, have a LPG car and use the train to work. I now have to take this forward and urge the local council in showing leadership in our community.</p>

<p><em><strong>Warmer temps linked with ice shelf break-ups</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>By Summit Voice</strong></p>
<p>SUMMIT COUNTY — The melt season on the Antarctic Peninsula is growing longer — in some cases it has doubled, and several major ice shelf breakup events in the region coincided with longer than usual melt seasons, according to a a new study that analyzed data from 30 weather stations.</p>

"The warming is driven by a strengthening of local westerly winds, causing warmer air from the sea to be pushed up and over the peninsula. In contrast to much of the rest of Antarctica, summer temperatures are high enough for snow to melt."

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Comedy’s hot new duo: Manne and Karoly</strong><br />
by Tony Thomas <a href="http://www.quadrant.org.au/blogs/doomed-planet/2013/03/comedy-s-hot-new-duo-manne-and-karoly">March 28, 2013</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/morecambeandwise2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11936" alt="morecambeandwise2" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/morecambeandwise2.jpg?w=614"   /></a>Bundoora, March 27: Latrobe University politics professor Robert Manne has called on students and uncommitted adults to join the Australian Youth Climate Coalition and/or Greenpeace.</p>
<p>He was addressing an audience of about 300 in a presentation at the university with Dr David Karoly, a denier that global warming has halted for the past 17 years.[i]</p>
<p>Why is Manne seeking to swell the membership of the AYCC and Greenpeace? Because, he said, those groups are leading the struggle against coal mining in Australia, and crusading against the “grotesque coal mining expansion” presently taking place.</p>
<p>It may have escaped Manne’s attention that our coal exports are worth $45b a year and maybe another $10b in home consumption.</p>
<p>“A decision to prevent further expansion of the coal industry and to wind back present coal mines would have enormous global significance, practically and symbolically,” he told his audience.</p>
<p>“Many of you understand the nature of the (warming) crisis facing humankind. I urge you to give support to these two organisations leading the fight for what can be described without hyperbole as the future of human civilization.”</p>
<p><span id="more-11933"></span></p>
<p>Manne, twice voted Australia’s leading public intellectual, said that if human beings don’t leave most of the world’s coal in the ground, civilization will be destroyed. Australia’s struggle to overcome dangerous climate change is diminished by our support of coal, which supplies 30% of Australian energy needs, he added.</p>
<p>He is perplexed by Australian governments’ apathy about warming, compared to its vigorous response to the global financial crisis, but he did hve an explanation. “This reflects the temporary weakness of the revolutionary anti-capitalist Left, which has been greatly wounded by the mistake it made associating the Soviet Union and communism with human liberation – a mistake from which it hasn’t yet emerged, as the Murdoch newspapers remind us every other day,” he said.</p>
<p>Today, according to Manne, the Left has a new challenge, which is the need to struggle against the injustice of one generation – ours – being perpetrated on generations of humans and other species not yet born.</p>
<p>“This is the most important struggle human beings have ever faced. What is now at stake is the future of human beings and all life forms, the future of civilization,” Manne said, not being a man for understatement.</p>
<p>He compares the anti-warming struggle to that of the struggle against slavery, racism and sexual oppression, which all seemed hopeless at times but won through.</p>
<p>Conceding that climate summits of late have been unproductive, Manne said he is pinning his hopes on dramatic, unanticipated and altruistic action being taken by an individual nation. This would be noticed by other nations and thus create what he called a “benign domino effect” on climate. “The situation of particular nations would determine in each case what the most pressing and symbolically significant action ought to be — let’s think about Australia’s potential role,” he said.</p>
<p>Professor Karoly was billed as presenting the science, while Manne presented the politics. Karoly did not grasp any such distinction, however, hammering away for his favored political solutions to his perceived climate problems, which include toasty temperature rises of up to 7C by 2100.</p>
<p>“No party, except perhaps the Greens, has emission targets that go anywhere near addressing the severity of anthropogenic climate change,” he said.</p>
<p>He scoffed at the “ageing English Viscount” Christopher Monckton, who spoke to an audience of Melbourne sceptics the previous night, and Karoly sneered at columnist Andrew Bolt at least six – possibly ten – times. While sarcastically calling Bolt a “well known climate expert” he forgot that his co-authority, Manne, similarly lacks climate qualifications. Karoly also quoted approvingly such climate experts as Barack Obama, Ban Ki-Moon and Kevin Rudd.</p>
<p>Karoly made many references to Australia’s hotness and wetness as somehow confirming global warming. He did not mention satellite readings showing that Australia’s current summer is perfectly normal, nor that Europe is in a gruesomely chilled state, which is presumably confirmation of global cooling. [ii] [iii]</p>
<p>He was awestruck by the loss of ice in the Arctic, but appeared unaware that a large continent below Tasmania, which people call the Antarctic, is gaining ice.[iv]</p>
<p>He ridiculed theories that solar changes could be partly driving earth’s climate, and was content to ignore concerns with in the IPCC itself that the sun’s role may be larger than originally believed.[v]</p>
<p>He warned that rising sea levels would swamp both Brisbane and Sydney airports by 2100, along with 10% of the world’s population, which well they may be if IPCC modeling is trustworthy.</p>
<p>Medieval warming? Current temperatures are more than 1C higher, Karoly declared, disregarding peer-reviewed studies from 700+ scientists at 400+ research institutions collectively asserting that medieval warming was both global and equal to, or greater than, today’s warming.[vi]</p>
<p>Karoly relied on the Climate Commission’s lacklustre authority on various scientific points, which is understandable since Karoly himself is a science adviser to that same Commission.</p>
<p>I managed to get the call at question time and asked Karoly:</p>
<p>“I would like to draw your attention to three facts, two of which are not in dispute at all.</p>
<p>“The first is that the CO2 levels are galloping faster than the most pessimistic predictions. The second is that there has been a 17 year pause in global warming, as acknowledged by Rajendra Pachauri of the IPCC, and that the British Bureau of Meteorolgy models are predicting that this pause will continue until the year 2017 — that’s a 20 year pause. And thirdly there is a leaked graph from the Fifth IPCC report due out in September showing actual temperatures tracking below the lowest predictions of the previous IPCC reports.</p>
<p>“If we put those three facts together, don’t they blow this idiotic global warming scare right out of the water?”</p>
<p>Karoly responded:</p>
<p>“Thank you for your opinion. The things you quoted are not facts but are in fact misrepresentations. Go to the UK Met Office website, they first of all show data sets for which there has been no pause in global warming. Temperatures continue to rise. The trends in global temperatures over the past 17 years are positive, they are not zero.</p>
<p>“The Met Office forecast is for average temperatures not for individual years. Newspaper reports and blogsite reports are inappropriately comparing one-year temperatures to forecasts of an average temperature.</p>
<p>“You look at the extremes, they show a 3/10 degree warming over that 20 year period, which the Met Office forecast, and is entirely consistent with the typical rate of warming over the 20 years of about 0.15deg per decade. So that forecast shows warming continuing unabated.</p>
<p>“The AR5 graph you are talking about is exactly consistent with the graph I showed where (IPCC forecast) warming is entirely consistent with the observed temperatures and not outside them as you suggest. I suggest you look at the actual data not websites…”</p>
<p>Me: “I have the actual graph here, would you like to consult it?”</p>
<p>Karoly: “I have seen that graph and it is a misrepresentation of the observed temperatures. You did not produce that graph, you pulled it off a website.”</p>
<p>Well, Karoly is dead right on that point, I got it from blogger Watts Up With That, and Anthony Watts got it from a thumb drive of draft Fifth Report material that some naughty person leaked.[vii]</p>
<p>Tony Thomas got lost in the dark on the way home from Latrobe, possibly because that place is in a parallel universe</p>
<p>[i] The Australian, February 22, quoted IPCC chair Dr Pachauri confirming a 17 year pause in global temperatures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><img class="aligncenter" alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-168.png?w=599&#038;h=539" width="599" height="539" /></p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Today I am tackling a very difficult subject which is widely misunderstood, the correct treatment of digital data.</p>
<p>Lets go back to childhood. Scribbling lines with a pencil on paper. Today as grown up we represent the squiggle by a series of X and Y numbers in a computer. There is no other way to do a digital representation of a continuous or analogue line. Confusingly in English, one is the analogue of the other.</p>
<p>Even here I am not being strictly correct, omitting the reconstruction filter.</p>
<p><span id="more-11929"></span></p>
<p>Figure 1. all three sets are for the same data.</p>
<p>Red traces are identical as a reference, meteorological maths, simply the common average of all days (or months) in a year and then truncated at a tenth of a degree.</p>
<p>This process handles averaging in amplitude but that is all. It makes a total mess of everything else. Error ranges to +1C</p>
<p>Top set, signal processed at the correct Nyquist limit for annual data output points, which means the data is limited to 2 year movement.</p>
<p>Middle set, a sensible minimum sample rate for displaying annual is thrice a year. Here I have kept Nyquist the same but output at this new sample rate. Now you start to see reality, <strong>proper processing keeps averaging in time too. When events happen appears.</strong></p>
<p>Bottom set, this is the closest to correct I can do. Nyquist is now set at annual and with three samples per year this is valid. (theoretic limit is 2)</p>
<p>Figure 1 has revealed two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>the highest temperature in CET at an annual level occurred as a spike at the turn of 2006/2007 but this is hidden by Met Office / Hadley / CRU practice of insisting on annual.</li>
<li>1996 had a cool spike which because it is within the hard limits of a calendar year is captured by standard math</li>
</ul>
<p>As you will see in a moment, winters of both 1947 and 1963 are grossly understated by standard annual CET.</p>
<p>The recent cold 2010 and hot 2011 were not, bad math. There is a trivial explanation: 2010 had two winter cold snaps, 2011 had none. Remember, much of the cold winter of 2010/11 came in December 2010, an early instance.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-169.png"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-169-small.png?w=550&#038;h=762" width="550" height="762" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2</p></div>
<p>Here is bottom trace for all of CET.</p>
<p>A fun time can be had by comparing this new representation with work with Martin&#8217;s CET commentary.</p>
<p>Root of site <a href="http://booty.org.uk/booty.weather/">here</a> (no new browser window)</p>
<p>Selectable timeline <a href="http://booty.org.uk/booty.weather/climate/histclimat.htm" target="_blank">here</a> (new browser window)</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 560px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-170.png"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-170-small.png?w=550&#038;h=150" width="550" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3</p></div>
<p>This is a difference of the top trace and standard met practice, can only do this one where the output sample points are at the middle of a year.</p>
<p>A word of caution. I&#8217;ve spent some time enhancing the software I am using to properly handle irrational input/output data sample points, I&#8217;ve implemented full data resampling, written in C. Fun. So far this works well but I am unhappy about the handling of dataset ends, always am. Beware, the ends might be significantly inaccurate. Please rest assured I do try my best and any error is not intended to mislead. I am prepared to risk some ridicule rather than play completely safe and show nothing.</p>
<p>In this instance the output sample rate is easily produced from monthly, time offset 1.5 and divide 4, giving sample points of 1/6th, 1/2, 5/6ths in a year with 1/3rd year between all points.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2006/7 spike?</span></strong></p>
<p>Now when was the exceptional Arctic ice melt? I think this was the winter before the melt. Perhaps this spike was over a much wider geographic area, weakening season freezing.</p>
<p>I have some surprising news to do with Arctic ice but that is for a later article. Fear not, things seem to be very different from the official idea.</p>
<p>At present no data supplied. Ask if you want it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>From the UK Labour party website:</em></p>
<div id="attachment_11916" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/caroline-flint-mp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-11916 " alt="caroline-flint-mp" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/caroline-flint-mp.jpg?w=614"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Right Honourable Caroline Flint MP</p></div>
<p>Ministers have been accused of cooking the books on household energy bills, after figures obtained by Labour revealed that the Government’s claim that energy bills will be £166 lower in 2020 is only true if people splash out thousands of pounds on a new appliances such as TVs, fridge-freezers, washing machines, dishwashers and gas-combi boilers.</p>
<p><strong>Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said:<br />
</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“The Government’s underhand attempt to mask the real impact of its policies on families’ energy bills is shameful. At a time when hard-pressed families and pensioners are seeing their incomes squeezed, only this out-of-touch Government could expect people to fork out thousands of pounds on new TVs, fridge freezers and washing machines. <strong>Instead of cooking the books to trick people into thinking their energy bills will be lower, Ministers should get behind Labour’s plans to overhaul the energy market and deliver fair prices for the public.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So what are labour&#8217;s plans that can deliver &#8220;fair prices to the public&#8221;?</p>
<p>I went to<a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/home"> their website</a> to find out, and looked for a link to their policies.</p>
<p><span id="more-11915"></span></p>
<p>And looked. And looked. But I didn&#8217;t find any link to any policy agenda at all. Can anyone help me find  &#8220;Labour’s plans to overhaul the energy market and deliver fair prices for the public.&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be most disappointed if it turns out that the the Right <del>tasty</del> Honourable Caroline Flint is just a pretty-talking-hot-air-head.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This article on Spiegel Online is surprising for a <strong>German</strong> publisher.</p>
<p>Seems to be claiming German is in fiscal trouble and is dumping some holy cows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin can&#8217;t afford many of its renewable energy programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then goes on &#8220;As prices for carbon emissions continue to languish, Berlin is planning to cancel some key subsidy programs aimed at increasing reliance on renewable energies. <strong>Germany and other European countries seem uninterested in fixing the problem</strong>.&#8221; (my bold)</p>
