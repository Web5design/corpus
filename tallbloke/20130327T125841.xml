<p>This article on Spiegel Online is surprising for a <strong>German</strong> publisher.</p>
<p>Seems to be claiming German is in fiscal trouble and is dumping some holy cows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Berlin can&#8217;t afford many of its renewable energy programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then goes on &#8220;As prices for carbon emissions continue to languish, Berlin is planning to cancel some key subsidy programs aimed at increasing reliance on renewable energies. <strong>Germany and other European countries seem uninterested in fixing the problem</strong>.&#8221; (my bold)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have calculated from scratch the global averaged temperature anomalies for the 73 proxies used by Marcott et al. in their recent Science paper. The method used is described in the <a href="http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=4761">previous post</a>. It avoids any interpolation between measurements and is based on the same processing software that is used to derive Hadcrut4 anomalies from weather station data. Shown below is the result covering the last 1000 years averaged in 50-year bins. I am using the published dates. Re-dating is a separate issue discussed below.</p>
<div id="attachment_4796" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/artifact.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4796" alt="Figure 1: Detail of the last 1000 years showing in black the global averaged Proxy data and in red the HADCRUT4 anomalies. The proxies have been normalised to 1961-1990. Shown in blue is the result for the Proxies after excluding TN05-17." src="http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/artifact.png" width="680" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: Detail of the last 1000 years showing in black the global averaged Proxy data and in red the HADCRUT4 anomalies. The proxies have been normalised to 1961-1990. Shown in blue is the result for the Proxies after excluding TN05-17.</p></div>
<p>There is no evidence of a recent uptick in this data. Previously I had noticed that much of the apparent upturn for the last 100 year bin was due to a single Proxy : TN05-17 situated in the Southern Ocean (Lat=-50, Lon=6). The blue dashed curve shows the 50 year resolution anomaly result after excluding this single proxy.</p>
<p><span id="more-11885"></span></p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the anomaly data using the modified carbon dating (re-dating). This has been identified by <a href="http://climateaudit.org/2013/03/16/the-marcott-shakun-dating-service/">Steve McIntyre</a> and others as the main cause of the up-tick. However I think this is only part of the story.</p>
<div id="attachment_4805" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 690px"><a href="http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/redated.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4805" alt="Figure 2: Global temperature anomalies using the modified dates (Marine09 etc). proxies are averaged in 50 year time intervals." src="http://clivebest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/redated.png" width="680" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2: Global temperature anomalies using the modified dates (Marine09 etc). Proxies are averaged in 50 year time intervals.</p></div>
<p>The new dating suppresses the anomalies from 1600-1800. There is a single high point for the period 1900-1950. The much larger spike evident in the paper around 1940 <a href="http://moyhu.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/next-stage-of-marcott-et-al-study.htmlhttp://moyhu.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/next-stage-of-marcott-et-al-study.html">(see also here) </a>is in my opinion mainly due to the interpolation to a fixed 20 year interval. This generates more points than measurement data and is very sensitive to time-scale boundaries. I believe you should only ever use measured values and not generated values.</p>
<p>There is no convincing evidence of a recent upswing in global temperatures in either graph based on the published or on the modified dates. I therefore suspect that Marcott&#8217;s result is most likely an artefact due to their interpolation of the measurement data to a fixed 20 year timebase, which is then accentuated by a re-dating of the measurements.</p>
<p><em>updated 24/3 : include re-dating graph</em></p>

<p><cite>mitigatedsceptic</cite> says:</p>
<div><a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/major-uk-newspaper-calls-for-repeal-of-climate-change-act/comment-page-1/#comment-48162"> March 25, 2013 at 10:34 am</a></div>
<p>TB and Roger A., thanks to you I was able to write to my MP, who is also a Cabinet Minister, in the following terms. I am sure that this could be much improved upon and I hope that others following this thread will do just that and write to their MPs right away while the snow is bringing the country to a standstill and many elderly and infirm are at serious risk. A response by Gov’t now might reduce the risks of power cuts and save many lives.</p>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Salutation</p>
<p>I understand that the Climate Change Act permits the Minister to alter the emissions target in the light of new scientific evidence. It is not necessary for Parliament to repeal the Act in order to relieve the energy crisis. The Introductory Text reads:</p>
<p>1 (1) It is the duty of the Secretary of State to ensure that the net UK carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline.<br />
2 (1) (a) The Secretary of State may by order amend the percentage specified in section 1(1);<br />
2 (2) (a) if it appears to the Secretary of State that there have been significant developments in scientific knowledge about climate change.</p>
<p>Surely fifteen years of zero warming and the coldest March, since goodness knows when, is evidence enough to justify relaxing the burden of this target, especially as we face an energy crisis caused almost entirely by efforts to meet it? Remember, if the evidence changes to show that warming is still on the cards, it will be possible increase the target again. This seems a much more flexible policy than rescinding the CCA altogether and it would placate the concerns of those who have invested so much in trying to reduce emissions.</p>
<p><span id="more-11876"></span></p>
<p>Please put it to Cabinet that here is an opportunity to recover the public’s lost confidence in the policy about climate change and to show that Government is capable of taking the right decisions in the light of changing circumstances.</p>
<p>This would allow the immediate salvation of major coal-fired power stations from closure and a cut in the rate of energy price rises. It would also emancipate us from the risks associated with importing so much energy from overseas and help the Balance of Payments substantially. Affordable and secure energy supplies are at the heart of economic recovery and can save millions from the fuel poverty presently threatening them.</p>
<p>This is the right moment, in the midst of a deep freeze in March, to make this statesman-like move. Please do not miss it!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s happened, we&#8217;re going head to head with the BIG GUNS. This really is an honour, thanks to all of you who nominated us.</p>
<p>JoNova is liked by very many, for its excellent political  and science dialog. It is so large discussion becomes difficult sometimes in the torrent of comment. Well done Jo!</p>
<p>The Talkshop is the David, the smallest site in the running, but active, category relevant, and pretty good with a slingshot. Yeah!</p>
<p>Penguin thinks the ice is melting, all that ice they go on about, soon to be gone. It&#8217;s not very bright. (Antarctic ice is at a satellite record high)</p>

<p>ClimateAudit has been a place of leading edge science statistics discussions, these days mostly about FOI and climate politics. Steve deserves recognition for his years of effort, yup, kick ass, he&#8217;s a damn good sport.</p>
<p><span id="more-11353"></span></p>
<p>As co-moderator here, old school, I have not voted last nor this year, abstain. It&#8217;s a spot of fun and why not?</p>
<p>Posted by Tim Channon. I expect Tallbloke will be along to edit and change, curse me. Yep we like fun.</p>
<p>Roger &#8216;tallbloke&#8217; Tattersall says: Thanks Tim for being quick on the draw. I&#8217;m in shock, best Science or Technology finalist!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“The most revolutionary thing one can do always is to proclaim loudly what is happening.”</em><br />
<em>Rosa Luxemburg</em><br />
<a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tod_kaiser.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-11843" alt="tod_kaiser" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tod_kaiser.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>There are times when I find it hard to speak politely. I left school at sixteen and worked on the shop-floor of a large engineering works for ten years, gaining a higher national qualification in mechanical and production engineering along the way before getting the chance to study for a degree in the History and Philosophy of Science. While I worked in heavy industry, I learned some choice ways of expressing myself which are basic, direct, and hurt the sensibilities of those who have spent their lives in polite company, although they got the job done effectively. So I sometimes struggle to find the right tone at those times when a message needs communicating forcefully to people in a position to influence policy, but without having them recoil and ignore things they don&#8217;t want to contemplate.</p>
<p>But the time for niceties has passed. Britain&#8217;s people face a looming disaster of epic proportion. Britain&#8217;s political class needs to act swiftly to minimise the damage which cannot be wholly averted at this late stage. Successive governments have set the stage for the impending denouement, so this is not a partisan rant, but a cross-party appeal to common sense. People are <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/15/government-protect-wintering-birds-but-not-pensioners/">dying by the thousand</a> as a direct result of <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/23/christopher-booker-its-payback-time-for-britains-insane-energy-policy/">botched energy policy</a> and we must act to save lives. Now.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s clear some of the undergrowth so we can see the shape of the problem. Firstly, we&#8217;ll deal with the climate scare.</p>
<p><span id="more-11842"></span><strong>The Climate Question</strong></p>
<p>There is no &#8216;enhanced greenhouse effect&#8217; from rising levels of co2 in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is an essential trace gas with little radiative effect compared with the enormous quantity of water vapour in the air. The hydrological cycle has massive redundant capacity to provide a negative feedback to any increase in radiative forcing from additional airborne co2. In any case it is <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/is-the-airborne-co2-fraction-temperature-dependent/">by no means certain</a> that the majority of the increase in airborne co2 is <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/uncertainty-the-origin-of-the-increase-in-atmospheric-co2/">of human origin</a>.</p>
<p>The real drivers of climatic change; the cyclically varying make-up of radiation from the Sun, the tidal effects on ocean circulation caused by the Moon&#8217;s declination cycle, and the Earth&#8217;s tectonic and seismic responses to the changing disposition of the rest of the solar system masses, induce near repeating <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/further-terrestrial-evidence-of-planetary-cycles-affecting-climate/">cyclic patterns</a> in Earth&#8217;s ever-changing climatic history. Through the decomposition of the complex signal into <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/tallbloke-and-tim-channon-a-cycles-analysis-approach-to-predicting-solar-activity/">simpler sinusoidal components</a>, we are able to better determine their origin, and predict future changes.</p>
<p>The indications are that the Sun is going into a phase of low activity levels. This is likely to increase cloudiness and reduce sunshine hours. That will induce surface cooling for several decades to come.</p>
<p><strong>The Energy Issue</strong></p>
<p>Supplying society&#8217;s need for high quality securely distributed energy is paramount to our well being. Clean water supply, food, health, education, and all of modern society&#8217;s benefits stem from our production of energy. Cleaner air is a desirable aspiration, but it cannot take priority over basic requirements on which peoples lives depend. The emissions from coal burning power stations are not particularly toxic at the levels they are ingested, and some of the by-products, such as sulphur are of direct benefit to agriculture. Acid rain destroying Scandinavian forest is a long debunked myth. Sulphur dioxide doesn&#8217;t make us ill. Hypothermia kills people, especially old people who have paid their dues to society and have the right to a warm home in retirement.</p>
<p><strong>The Engineer&#8217;s Solution</strong></p>
<p>Take a leaf out of Germany&#8217;s book and Commence building modern replacements for Britain&#8217;s aging coal fired generation capacity NOW, with whatever heavy industrial capacity we have left. Frack for gas NOW. Get the Americans in to do it if necessary, but don&#8217;t offer our tax money, we pay enough for gas as it is. Just cut the red tape and they will come to work willingly, without subsidy. Re-open any viable coal mines we still have, and start building some new ones.</p>
<p><strong>The Political Situation</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to encourage the British Government to grow some bollocks and tell the unelected incompetents in Brussels to FUCK OFF.  Then it won&#8217;t be able to use the excuse that the European Large Plant Directive prevents us from solving our URGENT energy crisis in the most time efficient and self reliant way. Repeal the <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/major-uk-newspaper-calls-for-repeal-of-climate-change-act/">Climate Change Act</a> immediately, if not sooner. Use the money the European Union has been embezzling from us without providing audited accounts for the last two decades. Stop giving our tax money to thieves, NOW. If the British establishment doesn&#8217;t heed the warning, it will be brought down by cold, angry people voting for a populist party with no administrative experience. While it would be fun, it&#8217;s unlikely to solve the energy crisis which is upon us. The<a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/03/22/gerard-wynn-uk-carbon-tax-to-be-levied-from-april-fools-day-get-ready-for-more-fuel-bill-hikes/"> new Carbon Tax</a> is an obvious ploy to steal more money from a cold population and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Summary for Policy Makers</strong></p>
<p>Stop dicking around, the eyes of the people are upon you. If you don&#8217;t move fast to fix the mess you&#8217;ve created, their collective boot will be up your collective arse, and since the Labour and Conservative parties are the two cheeks of the same arse, pointing the finger at each other in parliament won&#8217;t appease the taxpayer.  You are our paid servants, not our masters, so shape up, or ship out.</p>
<p>I knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep up the polite language once I started &#8216;the political bit&#8217;, oh well&#8230;</p>

The Sunday Telegraph, 24 March 2013</p>
<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/solar-cartoon.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8950" alt="solar-cartoon" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/solar-cartoon.jpg?w=614"   /></a>It is time for the Coalition to tear up its energy policy before the lights go out. The first priority must be to repeal the Climate Change Act of 2008.</p>
<p>With the worst snow conditions in the country since 1981, it’s worrying, to say the least, that gas supplies are running low. A month ago, The Sunday Telegraph warned in this column of the problems of an energy policy that puts expensive, inefficient green power before coal-fired and nuclear power. There have been a few signs that the Coalition is at last turning its attentions to the issue but, still, not nearly enough has been done.</p>
<p><span id="more-11840"></span>Now we are reaping the consequences. Because of a misguided faith in green energy, we have left ourselves far too dependent on foreign gas supplies, largely provided by Russian and Middle Eastern producers. Only 45 per cent of our gas consumption comes from domestic sources. All it takes is a spell of bad weather, and the closure of a gas pipeline from Belgium, to leave us dangerously exposed, and to send gas prices soaring. Talk of rationing may be exaggerated, but our energy policy is failing to deal with Britain’s fundamental incapacity to produce our own power.</p>
<p>Ed Davey, the Energy Secretary, may have granted planning permission this week to a new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point in Somerset. But one nuclear power station, with two new reactors, isn’t nearly enough. Moreover, it will take a decade to build and, even then, will only provide seven per cent of the country’s energy needs.</p>
<p>It is time for the Coalition to tear up its energy policy before the lights really do go out. The first priority must be to repeal the Climate Change Act of 2008, with its brutal, punishing targets: reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, and 26 per cent by 2020. These targets have already had a disastrous effect, forcing the closure of coal-fired power stations, and increasing tax-funded subsidies on wind power. Next month, electricity bills will soar even higher, thanks to a new tax on carbon dioxide produced by coal-fired and gas-fired power stations.</p>
<p>There are good intentions behind a green energy policy, and no one would wilfully want to damage the environment. But green technology – in its current incarnation, anyway – is just too inefficient and expensive to meet our energy needs. In some of the worst weather for more than 30 years, green power still only provides a tiny fraction of our energy needs. Solar power is of limited use in our cold, dark, northern climate. And wind power isn’t much better – cold weather doesn’t necessarily mean windy weather.</p>
<p>At last, the Coalition – or the Conservative part of it, anyway – is beginning to recognise these painfully obvious truths. In this week’s Budget, the Chancellor backed the policy of domestic fracking – the extraction of shale gas – with the promise of tax breaks for companies involved in the industry. He will know that American gas prices have plummeted, thanks to the US embracing the shale gas revolution. Britain must do the same. George Osborne also announced in the Budget that ceramics businesses would be exempt from the Climate Change Levy on energy costs. By making that exemption, he is acknowledging that green taxes are a significant drag on industry. He should make the exemption universal.</p>
<p>Our energy problems have been deepened by the greener-than-green Liberal Democrats, with their seeming stranglehold on the Cabinet post of Energy Secretary. When Chris Huhne took on the job in 2010, he swore Britain would become more independent of energy imports. Yet the country remains just as dependent, and Huhne’s Liberal Democrat colleague, Ed Davey, is still wedded to green power. Last year, he publicly slapped down his junior Tory energy minister, John Hayes, for calling for an end to more wind farms.</p>
<p>There is some good news, however. As we report today, government sources have said that wind power subsidies are to be cut again. This is a move in the right direction and we very much welcome it. It is to be hoped that there will be more such announcements, and concrete actions, from a government that has neglected a fundamental duty – to keep the lights on, energy affordable and our houses warm.</p>
