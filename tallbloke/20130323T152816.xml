<p><em>Now another big meteor has entered Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, with sightings rangng from New England to Florida.</em></p>
<p>This from <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1068697/nasa-confirms-meteor-after-fireball-reports">Sky News</a>:</p>
<p>The US space agency says reports of a flash in the sky along much of the US East Coast appeared to be a &#8220;single meteor event&#8221;.</p>
<p>Social media sites have been buzzing with reports of the flash that streaked across the sky.</p>
<p>It was spotted as far south as Florida and as far north as New England, reports said.</p>
<p>Bill Cooke of Nasa&#8217;s Meteoroid Environment Office said it &#8220;looks to be a fireball that moved roughly toward the southeast, going on visual reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging from the brightness, <strong>we&#8217;re dealing with something as bright as the full moon</strong>,&#8221; Mr Cooke said.<span id="more-11825"></span><br />
&#8220;We basically have [had&#8217;a boulder enter the atmosphere over the northeast.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says the meteor was widely seen, with more than 350 reports on the website of the American Meteor Society alone.</p>
<p>Robert Lunsford of the society told USA Today &#8220;it basically looked like a super bright shooting star&#8221;.</p>
<p>Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer at Philadelphia&#8217;s Franklin Institute, agrees that the sightings had all the hallmarks of a &#8220;fireball&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/usoskin2013a.pdf">new paper</a> just out at Astronomy and Astrophysics from Usoskin et al claims to show that the mysterious major cosmic event that took place in the 770&#8242;s AD was not of exotic origin, but solar:</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Aims. Miyake et al. (2012, Nature, 486, 240, henceforth M12) recently reported, based on 14C data, an extreme cosmic event in about AD775. Using a simple model, M12 claimed that the event was too strong to be caused by a solar flare within the standard theory. This implied a new paradigm of either an impossibly strong solar flare or a very strong cosmic ray event of unknown origin that occurred around AD775. However, as we show, the strength of the event was significantly overestimated by M12. Several subsequent works have attempted to find a possible exotic source for such an event, including a giant cometary impact upon the Sun or a gamma-ray burst, but they are all based on incorrect estimates by M12. We revisit this event with analysis of new datasets and consistent theoretical modelling.</p>
<p><span id="more-11820"></span><br />
Methods. We verified the experimental result for the AD775 cosmic ray event using independent datasets including 10Be series and newly measured 14C annual data. We surveyed available historical chronicles for astronomical observations for the period around the AD770s to identify potential sightings of aurorae borealis and supernovae. We interpreted the 14C measurements using an appropriate carbon cycle model.</p>
<p>Results. We show that: (1) The reality of the AD775 event is confirmed by new measurements of 14C in German oak; (2) by using an inappropriate carbon cycle model, M12 strongly overestimated the event’s strength; (3) the revised magnitude of the event (the global 14C production Q = (1.1 − 1.5) × 108 atoms/cm2) is consistent with different independent datasets (14C, 10Be, 36Cl) and can be associated with a strong, but not inexplicably strong, solar energetic particle event (or a sequence of events), and provides the first definite evidence for an event of this magnitude (the fluence &gt;30 MeV was about 4.5 × 1010 cm-2) in multiple datasets; (4) this interpretation is in agreement with increased auroral activity identified in historical chronicles.</p>
<p>Conclusions. The results point to the likely solar origin of the event, which is now identified as the greatest solar event on a multi-millennial time scale, placing a strong observational constraint on the theory of explosive energy releases on the Sun and cool stars.</p>

<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/roger-helmer.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11817" alt="Roger-Helmer" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/roger-helmer.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300" width="226" height="300" /></a>Mr. President, The report on last week’s Council calls for “differentiated growth-friendly fiscal consolidation” — a contradiction in terms.</p>
<p>It wants to “restore normal lending”, to “promote growth and competitiveness”, to tackle unemployment and modernise public administration.</p>
<p>If there were a prize for clichés and wishful thinking, gentlemen, you would win it. These objectives are motherhood and apple pie, but you have no idea how to deliver them.</p>
<p>You should take a leaf from Konrad Adenauer’s book, and have a bonfire of the regulations. You are drowning Europe in a sea of red tape.</p>
<p>You need to promote a low-tax, growth-friendly Europe.</p>
<p>And you need to dismantle the €uro. Again and again you declare the crisis over, but it comes back to bite you.</p>
<p>Now it’s Cyprus. You talk of a Europe of values, with the rule of law and property rights. Yet you planned to confiscate the funds of savers and pensioners, while protecting senior bondholders.<br />
<span id="more-11816"></span></p>
<p>You’re breaking the promise of your European Bank Deposit Guarantee scheme.</p>
<p>You try to evade your obligations by calling it a “tax”. But you have form in playing with words. You avoided further referendums on the European Constitution by calling it a Treaty. You broke your “no default” promise in Greece by calling it a haircut.</p>
<p>Now you break your deposit guarantee by pretending that confiscation is a tax. This is not a tax. This is EU theft with a fancy name. This is the very symbol and measure of your failure and breach of faith.</p>
<p>Former British Chancellor Lord Lawson described the €uro as “Possibly the most reckless political adventure of the post-war era”. And he was maybe under-stating the problem, at that.</p>
<p>You, Gentlemen, have presided over unemployment, and hardship, and poverty, and misery, in Southern Europe, on a scale we have not seen in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Yet you sit in your gilded offices, on your inflated salaries, and you fiddle while Rome burns. You have no answers to the problems of European citizens.</p>
<p>Let me quote a great Englishman, Oliver Cromwell:</p>
<p>“You have sat here too long for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!”</p>
<p>The speech was recorded and is available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_V0D6oKZ6M">here.</a></p>

<p>WHAT do Peter Lilley, Andrew Tyrie, Philip Davies, Christopher Chope and I have in common? We were the only MPs to vote against the 2008 Climate Change Bill, which is to say we had by then considered all the evidence and found it wanting.</p>
<p>For years we have endured insults. Behind the scenes Fiona Bruce, normally the most courteous of broadcasters, called me a “flat-earther” to my face. Others branded us “deniers” as if we were disputing the holocaust. The Al Gore film was accorded the status of Holy Writ. David Bellamy lost his job. Doubting scientists were scorned. Nigel Lawson found it difficult to get his book An Appeal To Reason published.</p>
<p><span id="more-11798"></span></p>
<p>In short there was an orthodoxy which was enforced with all the rigour of communism or fascism or, for that matter, the Spanish Inquisition. Dissenters must not be heard and global warming became a religion. Well the dissenters have now been proved right. Heaven knows how many billions of pounds later the world is now being told that actually the warming is so far off predictions that all bets are off and indeed the world’s temperature is static or falling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Despite the complete lack of evidence that human CO2 emissions cause any warming of the atmosphere, millions will be driven into fuel poverty as the snow continues to fall on chilly Britain. Even the MET Office has revised its five year forecast downwards to show almost no warming over the next five years, as revealed here at the Talkshop in early January. This unsound measure will cost jobs and drive industry abroad. We need some organisations with deep pockets to mount  a legal challenge to this madness. People will die as a direct result of this irresponsible and scientifically unsupported government climate policy.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Britain&#8217;s carbon tax: unfair and ineffective</strong><br />
Gerard Wynn - Reuters market analyst</p>
<p>The tax, called &#8220;carbon price support&#8221; by the British government, is [to be] levied on suppliers of fossil fuels to power plants and these will pass on the cost to electricity consumers.</p>
<p>It has uniquely united environmentalists and energy-intensive industries in opposition.</p>
<p>The tax will be applied when the price of European Union allowances (EUAs) is lower than a rising price floor per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) under the British scheme.</p>
<p>The idea is to send a clearer, long-term signal to investors in low carbon energy who may be deterred by the volatility of EUA prices.</p>
<p>The tax will be an important part of the British government&#8217;s support package to attract investment in new nuclear power.</p>
<p>By raising wholesale power prices by more than 10 percent by 2015, however, it will also provide an unmerited windfall for existing low carbon generation including nuclear power and wind farms.</p>
<p>Applying the tax inversely to the price of EUAs seemed to be a clever way to avoid charging polluters twice, as a flat-rate British carbon tax would have done.</p>
<p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is also the scheme&#8217;s biggest weakness.</p>
<p>First, European carbon price have collapsed, making them far cheaper than the UK floor price and increasing the size of the tax.</p>
<p>Second, insofar as the scheme succeeds in cutting emissions by factories and power plants, it will decrease demand for EUAs, which can then be snapped up by other European polluters, simply displacing emissions in an effect called carbon leakage.</p>
<p><span id="more-11794"></span>It may have been better for Britain to focus instead on sectors not embraced by the European Union emissions trading scheme (ETS), such as transport.</p>
<p>Finance minister George Osborne will give an update on the scheme in his budget on Wednesday. [Details below]</p>
<p>The best economic outcome may be to guarantee that all the tax receipts &#8211; estimated at about 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) a year &#8211; are redistributed to compensate households for higher power prices; to pay for efficiency investments by energy-intensive industry; and to invest in low carbon research and development.</p>
<p>Britain has had little time for such hypothecation in the past, however, and so far has only offered various limited compensation which it may further elaborate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pressure will therefore grow to remove or weaken the carbon price floor at the earliest opportunity, probably in 2020, threatening the aim of a long-term investment signal.</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/19/column-wynn-carbon-uk-idUKL6N0CB4M820130319">Read the rest here.</a></p>
<p>Here is what the wednesday budget clarified:</p>
<p>A tripling of support for low carbon<br />
generation, providing up to £7.6bn by 2020</p>
<p>From April 2013, a new carbon price floor</p>
<p>1.90 The Government is acting to give private investors the confidence to invest in the UK’s<br />
energy sector. From April 2013 the carbon price floor announced at Budget 2011 will come<br />
into effect, providing a clear and credible long-term signal to support investment in low carbon<br />
electricity generation.<br />
1.91 The Energy Bill, currently making its passage through Parliament, will introduce Electricity<br />
Market Reform. By providing stable revenues for investors at a fixed level known as a strike price,<br />
Contracts for Difference, as set out in the Bill, will provide long-term certainty for investors in<br />
low carbon generation. This will lower the cost of capital and help developers secure the large<br />
upfront amounts of capital investment required. Support available for low carbon electricity<br />
investment through the Levy Control Framework up to 2020 will rise to £7.6 billion a year<br />
(in 2012 prices), more than triple the £2.35 billion available in 2012-13. Together with the<br />
Government’s Energy Bill and Gas Generation Strategy, published in 2012, this will provide the<br />
framework needed for new energy investment.44</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find reference 44 in the text, but did come across this other piece of lunacy:</p>
<p>1.92 The Government intends to take forward two Carbon Capture and Storage<br />
projects to the detailed planning and design stage of the competition. This represents<br />
the next step in the £1 billion Carbon Capture and Storage commercialisation programme<br />
and follows a period of intensive commercial negotiations with a number of bidders. The<br />
Department for Energy and Climate Change will set out the details of the preferred bidders, next<br />
steps on these front end engineering and design studies, and the process to final investment<br />
decision.</p>
<p>Who is going to save the poor bloody public from these public school plus PPE idiots?</p>

<p>Image right is for 7am tomorrow morning, raining hard here, will be snow approaching Rog in Leeds, a weather front fighting cold air further north.</p>
<p>The notoriously difficult to forecast blocking conditions are now modelled as continuing probably into April.</p>
<p>Growing conditions continue to be bad, running about a month later than last year here in southern England.</p>
<p><span id="more-11788"></span></p>
<p>I do have first spring blossom out but that is a miniature Japanese cherry in a pot.</p>
<p>This photo is dated 2nd March 2012</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/Profile.aspx?pid=327"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-559.jpg?w=250&#038;h=188" width="250" height="188" align="left" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Red Camellia, click for RHS on this shrub</p></div>
<p>This shrub is fully exposed except for it&#8217;s back from an east wind, was out a month earlier last year but this year only showed first bud colour a few days ago, some way off opening.</p>
<p>The eating cherry, normally early flowering, shows no sign at all of bud movement.</p>
<p>Same date.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 260px"><img alt="Image" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image-560.jpg?w=250&#038;h=188" width="250" height="188" align="left" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Snowdrop clump</p></div>
<p>Here is my reference clump of snowdrops last year, at end of flowering where right now nearly a month later are not as far over.</p>
<p>North side of a hazel and fence.</p>
<p>Have some cheer. This was cherry Stella 12th April 2012, can click for full size.</p>

If you only plant one is a good choice.<br />Also rare blue sky</p></div>
<p>And 2012 was a <strong>late</strong> year. Yes we did get a small crop of fruit, as ever a headache netting to try and stop the birds. One poor apple last year, very little fruit on anything apart from raspberries, no jam. Few sticks of rhubarb but at least that is through this year.</p>
<p>Back to what is forecast.</p>
<p>Running left to right, top to bottom all at 7am. You can see the edge of the blocking in the Atlantic to the south-west.</p>

<p>The winter blocking, fortunately without intense cold or snow seems becoming more common. North polar weather rotation stalls. The presumption by me and I expect many more is related to the reduced solar activity. If true the magnetics bode ill, we have more to come.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that perhaps we are now seeing how nature pumps warm and cool at the horticultural limits, where plants and animal push but eventually find hostile conditions, spread is killed. Wet and cool is England.</p>
<p>I am waiting on complaints from the many who have planted tropical, and for dry conditions.</p>
<p>Whether this can control infestations is another matter. For example Harlequin ladybirds. Found and reported those a couple of years ago. In hindsight we found a host conifer too, a mixed colony, a fight going on.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Don&#8217;t clobber bloggers with Leveson</strong></p>
<p>Lord Leveson’s regulations are being applied to UK websites – in ways that could catch more or less anyone who publishes a blog. Ordinary bloggers could be threatened with exemplary damages and costs. If this happens, small website publishers will face terrible risks, or burdensome regulation – and many may simply stop publishing.</p>
<p>We have until Monday to stop this happening.</p>
<p>Lord Leveson said he wanted to regulate print media. He proposed that judges be allowed to award exemplary damages and full costs against unregulated publishers. These are stringent and controversial measures, but he only envisaged them applying to large and powerful publishers. Not websites, unless they belonged to print publishers.</p>
<p>Last weekend, the proposals were agreed in a rush, without public consultation, and with no attention to the detail.</p>
<p>Outrageously, they have given the Lords until Monday to fix their mistakes.</p>
<p><span id="more-11774"></span></p>
<p>The result is that they apply to any size of web publisher – if there’s more than one author, the content is edited and there’s a business involved, then you must join a self regulator.</p>
<p>Most blogs like this aren’t powerful publishing houses. Even ORGZine would need to be regulated, or face punitive measures if it ended up in court.</p>
<p>The threat of websites being regulated like this was never the purpose of Lord Leveson’s recommendations. Websites weren’t involved in phone hacking. There is no evidence that they need to be forced into self-regulation like this.</p>
<p>We need you to email Nick Clegg, Harriet Harman, and David Cameron to ask them to back off and leave the Internet out of Leveson.</p>
