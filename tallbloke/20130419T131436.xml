<div>A 90ft turbine in Aberdeenshire has fallen after being battered by 70mph gales.The turbine is one of two belonging to Jim Anderson at his Ardiffery Mains home in Hatton.Following a night of gales Mr Anderson woke to find his turbine felled and the three blades scattered across the field. He used a tractor with a digger to gather them on Wednesday.<span id="more-12469"></span><!--more--></p>
<p>Mr Anderson has just had a successful bid to have three more turbines erected despite concerns that the masts could interfere with flights at Aberdeen Airport and concerns from local residents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/10003826/Two-Earth-like-blue-planets-discovered-orbiting-distant-star.html">Telegraph</a>:</p>
<p>Two Earth-like planets thought to be covered in water have been discovered orbiting a distant star and may even have the right conditions to support life.<br />
<a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/blue-planet.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-12467" alt="blue-planet" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/blue-planet.jpg?w=614"   /></a></p>
<p>Astronomers believe the two ocean dominated worlds, which are around one and a half times the size of Earth, lie within the so-called Goldilocks zone around their star.</p>
<p>This is the distance from the star where it would be neither too hot nor too cold for there to be liquid water on the planet surface.</p>
<p>Scientists using Nasa’s Kepler space telescope, which has been searching for habitable planets outside our solar system, spotted the two planets orbiting a star called Kepler-62 1,200 light years away.</p>
<p><span id="more-12466"></span>One of the planets – called Kepler-62f – is 1.4 times larger than the Earth and may even be a rocky planet while another, called Kepler-62e, is 1.6 times the size of Earth and is closer to the star.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>They found three other planets orbiting the same star – which is slightly smaller and cooler than our sun.<br />
By calculating the amount of light the planets blocked out as they passed in front of their star, astronomers were able to calculate their size and orbit.</p>
<p>Computer modelling by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, suggests the two new planets may be covered in global oceans.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgra.50210/abstract">Prediction of solar activity for the next 500 years</a></b><br />
Friedhelm Steinhilber, Jürg Beer<br />
<b>Abstract:</b> Recently a new low-noise record of solar activity has been reconstructed for the past 9.400 years by combining two 10 Be records from Greenland and Antarctica with 14 C from tree rings [F. Steinhilber et al., 2012]. This record confirms earlier results, namely that the Sun has varied with distinct periodicities in the past. We present a prediction of mean solar magnetic activity averaged over 22 years for the next 500 years mainly based on the spectral information derived from the record of the past solar activity. Assuming that the Sun will continue varying with the same periodicities for the next centuries we extract the spectral information from the past and apply it in two different methods to predict the future of solar magnetic activity. First, the two methods are tested by predicting past changes. <b>Our methods are able to predict periods of high and low solar activity for a few centuries in the past.</b> However, they are less successful in predicting the correct amplitude. Then, the methods were used to predict the period 2000-2500. <b>Both methods predict a period of low activity around 2100 AD. </b>Between 2100 AD and 2350 AD the results are inconsistent regarding the duration of the low activity state in 2100 AD and the level of activity until 2250 AD. Around 2250 AD both methods predict a period of moderate activity. After 2350 AD both methods point to a period of high activity. The period of high activity will end around 2400 AD and will be followed by a period of moderate activity.</p>
<div dir="ltr">Here we follow the approaches by [Abreu et al., 2010; Bonev et al., 2004]</div>
<div dir="ltr">and make use of the spectral information contained in the past solar activity to predict the future 500 years. The</div>
<div dir="ltr">low-noise record [ F. Steinhilber et al., 2012]  based on several radionuclide datasets (10Be from Greenland and Antarctica, and 14 C from tree rings) is used as record of solar activity. This record has less noise than the individual records used in previous predictions and therefore can be considered as an improvement of these former studies.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">Finally we would like to note that the term “solar activity” is not well defined. While in the past</div>
<div dir="ltr">it was often considered as a synonym for sunspots we use it in this work as a measure of the</div>
<div dir="ltr"> general solar magnetic activity which includes both the closed magnetic field associated with</div>
<div dir="ltr">sunspots and the open magnetic field responsible for the modulation of the galactic cosmic rays</div>
<div dir="ltr">and therewith the production rate of cosmogenic radionuclides.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<div>However, as shown by the graph below, the current solar cycle [SC 24, red] is already closely tracking the first solar cycle [SC 5, pink] of the Dalton Minimum, and both are quite weak in comparison to the average of solar cycles 1 through 23 [blue].</div>
<div><img title="mar1" alt="" src="http://kaltesonne.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mar1.gif" width="400" height="209" /></div>
<div>The accumulated sunspot anomaly has significantly declined during the current solar cycle:</div>

<p>It&#8217;s partly my own fault, I should have put in more and stronger fixings than were supplied. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and informs us about what it was we<em> should</em> have done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve rescued the seedlings as best I can and now I have to find the cash to build a new greenhouse double quick as the growing season is upon us. I&#8217;m a part  time wage earner since the crash I was in a few years ago and this is a bit of a blow. If anyone feels like helping towards the £430 a replacement will cost, the donate button is top left. Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<div>Czech grid acts to guard against German wind power surges</div>
<div>Wed, Apr 17 17:49 PM BST</div>
<p>By Jan Lopatka</p>
<p>PRAGUE, April 17 (Reuters) &#8211; Czech grid operator CEPS has backed a plan to build transformers to guard against excess flows of German wind-produced electricity which threaten neighbouring transmission systems, a CEPS official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move could complicate efforts to find a regional solution to the problem of surges of renewable electricity from Germany.</p>
<p>CEPS Supervisory Board Chairman Tomas Huener told Reuters that the board approved a plan to install phase-shifters, or transformers, which will protect the Czech grid and could be built by 2016.</p>
<p><span id="more-12437"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The supervisory board approved the investment plan and a recommendation to the shareholder meeting,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Large electricity flows produced by wind farms in Germany&#8217;s sparsely populated north can overload transmission lines, or cause blackouts or losses when operators are forced by such surges to shut down power plants.</p>
<p>These so-called loop flows are most acute in the autumn and early winter when German wind power generation peaks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>My Thanks to Paul Vaughan, who has sent me a plot he has made of the variation in the rate of solar rotation determined by Russian scientists A. G. Tlatov and V.

The J-E-V cycle and it&#8217;s close synchrony with solar activity indicators such as sunspot number and solar rotation has been a subject of investigation on this blog since it started in 2009. Many contributors have offered new insight to this fascinating subject, and there is now a substantial body of peer reviewed literature in this area, as well as many articles on this site from Astrophysicist <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/?s=ian+wilson">Ian Wilson</a>, researchers <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/roy-martin-the-solar-cycle-clock/">Roy Martin</a>, <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/timo-niroma-on-solar-cycle-lengths/">Ray Tomes</a>, <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2010/06/14/venus-earth-jupiter-alignment-and-the-solar-cycle/comment-page-1/#comment-955">Jean-Pierre Desmoulins</a>, <a href="http://tallbloke.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/meet-the-new-kepler-p-a-semi/">P.A.

<p><em>I&#8217;ve asked Paul to tell us something about the derivation for the alignment cycle, and I&#8217;ll update this post with more info soon.

<p><strong>Abstract. </strong></p>
<p>We have studied the rotation of the solar atmosphere on the basis<br />
of  synoptic charts for 117 years (1887 &#8211; 2003) and derived the latitude-time<br />
diagrams for variation of the rotation periods in the interval of latitude +/-45 degrees.<br />
We determined the periods within 8 to 12 year &#8220;windows&#8221;, subsequently shifting<br />
the &#8220;window&#8221; along the data set, which makes it possible to reveal long-term<br />
variations in the solar rotation. It has been shown, that within the interval of<br />
latitude +/-20 degrees, the basic rotation period of the background magnetic field of the<br />
Sun is 22 years. During odd cycles of solar activity, the rotation rate<del> decelerates</del> <strong>accelerates</strong>,<br />
while during even cycles, <del>more</del> <strong>less</strong> rapid rotation is observed. When the sampling<br />
&#8220;window&#8221; increases to around 17 years, the 55 to 60 year quasi &#8211; period of<br />
rotation can be recognized. In this case, the maximum rotation velocity falls<br />
roughly on years 1930 and 1990. We consider possible generation of the solar<br />
cycle by 22-year period torsion waves interacting with relic magnetic field.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>a remarkable new oil and gas find that has gone almost unremarked:</em></p>
<div id="attachment_12429" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/reserves.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-12429 " alt="reserves" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/reserves.jpg?w=614&#038;h=405" width="614" height="405" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">U.S. Reserves up to 2010. The balance sheet now looks much healthier, but extraction costs are rising.</p></div>
<p>There it was, a remarkable stat buried among many that should have made everyone at the Dallas Convention Centre take a deep breath. According to the source, just one oil play in the Texas Midland Basin, the Spraberry/Wolfcap shale, may have a total recoverable resource of up to 50 billion barrels using new tight-oil extraction technologies. This revelation presents us all with an arresting number, if indeed that much oil is producible from a region already famous for its hydrocarbon potential. For one thing, supplementary data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency shows that only 1.3 billion barrels have been produced from the legacy region since its original discovery in 1949. So tapping into the multizone Spraberry/Wolfcap with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes is a like finding a virgin oil field – a very big one at that.</p>
<p><span id="more-12428"></span><!--more--></p>
<p>The best context for the size of the Spraberry/Wolfcap, and the tight oil revolution as a whole, may be the Canadian oil sands. At the peak of the peak oil worries in 2007, this mother lode of heavy oil was considered to be the <em>deus ex machina</em> of the free world’s oil supply woes. Investment into innovative, large-scale extraction processes led to the recognition that 170 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from the northern Alberta wilderness.</p>
<p>The jury is out for determining winners and losers. The ability to turn conjectured oil reserves under the ground into producing wells on the surface is dominantly a function of price. Recent weakness in commodities suggests that the oil price at which the world’s oil reserves stop turning into production may be soon tested. Then we’ll really know how much oil is available, and which producers have the most to be worried about.</p>

<p><a href="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/greenhouse-effects.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5280" alt="Greenhouse effects" src="http://tallbloke.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/greenhouse-effects.gif?w=300&#038;h=199" width="300" height="199" /></a>Scientists are struggling to explain a slowdown in climate change that has exposed gaps in their understanding and defies a rise in global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Often focused on century-long trends, most climate models failed to predict that the temperature rise would slow, starting around 2000. Scientists are now intent on figuring out the causes and determining whether the respite will be brief or a more lasting phenomenon.</p>
<p>Getting this right is essential for the short and long-term planning of governments and businesses ranging from energy to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/sectors/industries/overview?industryCode=46&amp;lc=int_mb_1001">construction</a>, from agriculture to insurance. Many scientists say they expect a revival of warming in coming years.</p>
<p>Theories for the pause include that deep oceans have taken up more heat with the result that the surface is cooler than expected, that industrial pollution in Asia or clouds are blocking the sun, <strong>or that greenhouse gases trap less heat than previously believed.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-12420"></span></p>
<p>The change may be a result of an observed decline in heat-trapping water vapor in the high atmosphere, for unknown reasons. It could be a combination of factors or some as yet unknown natural variations, scientists say.</p>
<p>Weak economic growth and the pause in warming is undermining governments&#8217; willingness to make a rapid billion-dollar shift from fossil fuels. Almost 200 governments have agreed to work out a plan by the end of 2015 to combat global warming.</p>
<p>&#8220;The climate system is not quite so simple as people thought,&#8221; said Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish statistician and author of &#8220;The Skeptical Environmentalist&#8221; who estimates that moderate warming will be beneficial for crop growth and human health.</p>
<p>Some experts say their trust in climate science has declined because of the many uncertainties.</p>

<p>One Iranian official said hundreds of people were feared to have been killed. But an Iranian lawmaker from the region said the number of deaths was &#8220;not high&#8221;. A Pakistani official said at least five people been killed in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Tremors from the 7.8 magnitude quake were also felt as far away as India and Gulf states.</p>
<p>The quake was centred in a remote desert and mountain region which is not densely populated. Assessing the damage was difficult due to the collapse in the communications network.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the biggest earthquake in Iran in 40 years and we are expecting hundreds of dead,&#8221; an Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Iranian politician Hamid Reza Pashang told the Mehr news agency: &#8220;From what we have heard from people in the stricken areas, we have learned that the number of deaths is not high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have talked to the people of Zabul, Saravan, Khash and other areas hit by the earthquake and they have said, the earthquake was not of a kind to cause many deaths,&#8221; he said.</p>
