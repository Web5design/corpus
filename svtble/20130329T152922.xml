    <title>The 7 Questions A Startup Should Answer in their Fund Raising Pitch</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24562216432584_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24562216432584_raw.jpg" alt="question.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of our companies started financing processes in earlier this quarter. At a strategy session with one of our companies, the team and I crafted the outline of the pitch deck. They asked me what questions a venture investor might ask in the initial meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distilling the investment analysis into a small number of general questions is challenging because of the diversity of businesses we see but, I gave it a try and came up with the following questions I might ask a startup to answer in an initial meeting.
&lt;ol style="line-height: 19px; padding-top: 25px;"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Value prop] What is the problem and is it worth solving? Why is now the right time to solve it?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Team] Does the team have the vision and the wherewithal to build this company?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Go to market] What is the competitive angle (competitive barrier to entry and/or go-to-market) that will enable this company to succeed where others have tried and failed?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Sales effectiveness &amp;amp; product validation] Who does the startup sell to? Which customers have used the product and how have they received it? How much is each customer worth?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Product distribution] How does the company acquire customers cost effectively?  What are the unit economics (customer acquisition cost, contribution revenue, and churn rates)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Revenue model] Does the company have the revenue model to build a big (&amp;gt;$100M annual revenue) business with good margins (gross ~ 50 to 60% / net ~15 to 25%) under reasonable assumptions?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;[Market size] Can the market enable or bear a $100M revenue Alternatively, is this product in a quickly growing market or riding a disruptive wave?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/the-11-risks-vcs-evaluate"&gt;Other risks including legal risks, technology development risks, value chain implications and so on may also be important&lt;/a&gt;. But when building a generic fund-raising deck, answering these questions in your pitch deck will serve as a solid starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s important to unite these points with a single theme or story to sell the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>15 Things You Cannot Do With a Chromebook Pixel</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I will do anything for love, but I won&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;rdquo; - Meatloaf &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have resorted to leading off with a Meatloaf quote. This not only cheapens the quality of this fine blog but also makes me hungry. But, before you complain too much or mumble to yourself about how lame that is, please note: there is a method to this madness. Mostly, it is to keep me from getting bored. Also, I&amp;#39;m secretly hinting to my wife that meatloaf might make a good dinner entr√©e. (Home by 7 honey!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, instead of writing a review, I&amp;#39;ve decided to list just &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the things the new Chromebook Pixel won&amp;#39;t do. But first, a little backstory. The Chromebook Pixel ($1299) is a marvel of engineering. It has a responsive high-res touchscreen (check), an elegant machined-aluminum chassis (check), a speedy processor (check), and Google (check). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#39;re a glutton for punishment (e.g., Windows 8), the Pixel is everything anyone would ever want in a touchscreen laptop and thensome. (It&amp;#39;s so awesome, I&amp;#39;ve invented the word thensome just for this post.) But it won&amp;#39;t do everything. And to prove it won&amp;#39;t do everything, I have decided to make up a few things it won&amp;#39;t do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pretend to be a hot plate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve tried this one, believe me. The steps are fairly straightforward. You login with your Google password, then set the laptop on a hot driveway for about seven hours. My test results: Initially, I was getting some bubbling with eggs and my toast felt warm, then &amp;ndash; nothing. I don&amp;#39;t mind some of the cracks, and I don&amp;#39;t think Google PR will either. (E-mail me if you can get yours to work like a hot plate, but I think the aluminum chassis might be designed only for warming up Pop Tarts and egg rolls.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Run the original version of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have also tried this. It&amp;#39;s the first thing I did after the hot plate test. Now, for the naysayers out there (comments are disabled just for you!): I realize there are gaming portals that let you run Doom illegally in a browser. That&amp;#39;s like reading the new Al Gore book as a stolen PDF: boring and wrong. I&amp;#39;m talking about installing Doom from my original floppy disks. I&amp;#39;m not sure when I felt the most remorse: when I realized there wasn&amp;#39;t a floppy disk drive or when I realized no one knows what that is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Perform surgery on a human&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Chromebook Pixel cannot perform surgery. While this is probably a good thing, you should know some of the limitations before you purchase one. You might be thinking: I have decided to buy a laptop that performs surgery. The Chromebook is not for you, seek medial help. Or maybe it&amp;#39;s a relief knowing this limbless Linux derivative (you did know Chrome is a derivative of Linux, right? I mean, right?) is not perfect. That should not be a barrier to entry. Not having a functioning appendix, that definitely is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Telling you jokes and puns in a quirky robotic voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I used to think this is important, back when I had a closer relationship with Apple Siri. We&amp;#39;ve grown distant latley. I now have a new artificial friend named Google Now. But does Google Now work on the Chromebook Pixel? Not really. (Post in comments if it actually does let you use Google Now. Wait, I forgot &amp;ndash; comments are disabled!) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Stargazing on a clear night with someone you love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the delineating features of the original Android smartphones was that you could hold the little sucker up to the night sky and see star constellations. I mean, wonder of wonders! This feature alone made me question my iPhone purchasing habits. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any way to do this with the Chromebook Pixel. You can use one to block the sun on your morning commute, though. I have already let Google know the whole Chromebook stargazing thing would be cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Solving world peace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Chromebook will not solve world peace. I feel that&amp;#39;s a little less critical than the Photoshop problem I mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Connecting pretty much anything by USB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Okay, harsh! But there&amp;#39;s this pesky problem that is worth mentioning to anyone who is confused: the Chromebook Pixel does not run Windows. I need to let that sink in a little. Wait for it. Okay &amp;ndash; also, since the Chromebook does not run Windows, it does not run Windows drivers. So let&amp;#39;s say you own some amazing USB recording equipment and want to make an album. Or let&amp;#39;s say you have a fancy USB telephone system for your office. Or, anything USB-related. Good news: you can warm up your toast! (Disclaimer: Many printers, webcams, and toasters do work.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Performing data-intensive experiments related to nuclear fission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actually, it can do that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Developing a complex Web site using Windows software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You remember that point I made about USB drivers? I know you&amp;#39;re still coming to grips with that. More bad news for you: a Chromebook Pixel cannot run complex Windows desktop programming software. Like, none. It does work perfectly fine for Joomla, WordPress development, most Java programming, some mild cooking, and recording cat videos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Doorstop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That&amp;#39;s why God created Windows 8 laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Chatting over Apple&amp;#39;s Facetime app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I know! I was surprised by this one, too. No Apple Facetime app &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. I repeat: Nada on Facetime. There&amp;#39;s a perfectly good webcam, too. If you try to do anything related to Facetime you just get a blank stare/screen. The webcam is only good for taking photos of kittens. Oh, and for stargazing in real-time once Google gets my message about that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Microsoft Office, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Okay, like anyone really takes OneNote seriously. And, technically speaking, there are Google equivalents. Also, if you really need to use Word, you can use the Chrome Remote Desktop app and tap into a Windows computer. Or move on in life. Or dictate documents using Google Keep in 20-second intervals. Or write them by hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Time travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I had high expectations for this one. I thought, hey &amp;ndash; maybe the Chromebook Pixel does time travel? Or maybe it can tap into the multiverse? That would make up for the whole USB driver problem or the Photoshop issues I mentioned (twice). But the Chromebook Pixel does not do time travel or the multiverse quite yet. You can do experiments in nuclear fission, program complex Web sites, chat over pretty much everything except Facetime, warm your toast, and record a document by voice in 20-second intervals. Oh, and type up sardonic blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The alarm clock as an MMO game?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most of us use alarm clocks, but something about them feels broken. Sure, the alarm will ring at exactly the right time, but after being disturbed from a long nights rest, we just want to go back to sleep, so we hit snooze ‚Äì and we all know how that plays out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with the alarm clock is that there&amp;#39;s no obvious incentive to get up. At least no incentive that we can readily perceive in our morning mutant states. Breakfast in bed or the smell of freshly brewed coffee will usually do the trick. However, in the absence of such bounty, perhaps there are a few things we can try as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we turned the alarm clock into a massive multiplayer online game? My reckoning is that at any given moment there are at least a few million people on this earth waking up to an alarm clock. The habit ‚Äìusually the hardest part when building a product‚Äì is already there, it&amp;#39;s just waiting to be experimented with. Here&amp;#39;s how it might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the app. Set your alarm time. The app will now pair you with another player who wishes to wake at the same time ‚Äì and that&amp;#39;s it, the game is set. To prevent people from cheating, you can&amp;#39;t exit the app. If you exit the app the game will end and you&amp;#39;ll be forced to forfeit the points of the round to your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the alarm rolls around you&amp;#39;ll both be alerted with a task/game to complete. The games will vary every morning and will generally take about 30 ‚Äì 60 seconds to complete. You gain points for every battle you win and bonus points if you achieve a streak of wins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Games could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find an international city on a map. (Maps integration, with no search.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer a trivia question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spot the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move your phone as far from its current location as possible within the next 60 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most taps on the screen within a 30 second period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify a song. (iTunes integration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whack-a-mole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve a simple math equation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcribe an audio sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paper‚ÄìScissors‚ÄìRock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and so on..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game could be a lot more interesting with leader-boards, crazier game types, and various other social mechanisms. Perhaps you could play the same person everyday, if you both wished? This is just a silly idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d use it, would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ys"&gt;Let&amp;#39;s make it happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to do anything</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many people, when faced with doing something new that they know nothing about, won‚Äôt ever get started. The project seems too daunting and they don‚Äôt have any context for even where to begin. In fact, in the very beginning, Justin.tv was exactly this type of problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we first conceived of Justin.tv, it was simple to explain: we‚Äôd have a live streaming video feed of our exploits in San Francisco broadcast from a camera in real time to many viewers simultaneously watching on the web. It wasn‚Äôt as simple to figure out how to make this a reality, in fact, Emmett and I (it was just us at first) didn‚Äôt know the first thing about online video protocols, servers or infrastructure, cameras, or mobile network connections. At that point, we were simply two web developers with a year of experience building an AJAX calendar app. To us, the whole project appeared to be one big black box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Justin.tv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we could break this down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to build a mobile camera that streamed video to one server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to ingest a video and stream to multiple viewers from our server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to an expert in hardware devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research available mobile data transmission technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to a startup we‚Äôd recently met who was doing live streaming (to figure out what tech they were using)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate using a Content Delivery Network for streaming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found that when faced with a set of seemingly insurmountable challenges, the first step towards making it easier is to break things down into as large a set of small individual tasks as possible. In this case, our list of to-dos was broken down further many times. #1 lead us to Kyle, who became a cofounder and built the first streaming device (a computer that encoded video data from an analog camera). We learned that EVDO Rev A was coming to San Francisco, enabling us to send data at reasonable speeds over the cell networks (#2). Following up with #3 lead us to learn about streaming server options, and eventually choose #4 (paying someone else to stream our video for us). Six months after we first began working on the Justin.tv project full time, starting from a place with zero knowledge, we had a mobile streaming hardware device that sent video to multiple viewers, and launched our show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is simple to apply to any set of challenges, from the fantastic to the mundane. Make yourself a list of what must be done and go through that list. For example, if you need to graduate from university and get a job so you can take care of your family, that probably entails a large set of smaller, more manageable things: getting decent grades in each of a set of credits, creating a resume, applying to jobs, practicing interviewing, etc. In turn, each of these things can be reduced to a set of smaller tasks that will seem more accomplishable: getting a decent grade in a class turns into a set of tasks including studying, writing term papers, and preparing for an exam. Often times, the first step in accomplishing your goals might be as simple as buying the assigned books for a class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall a disagreement I had with a friend many years ago. My claim was that anything I set my mind to was achievable; he thought this idea was ridiculous. The point came up because he thought the idea of private spaceflight orchestrated by individuals would never work. &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/10/07/spacex-capsule/1618411/"&gt;Looks like I was right.&lt;/a&gt; You can achieve anything you set your mind to; doing so is just process of reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are of a like-minded attitude, &lt;a href="http://iamexec.com/hiring"&gt;come build things at Exec&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forked: Founder vs. Early Employee</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny how much hero worship there is out there about being the &amp;ldquo;founder&amp;rdquo; of a startup company.  That&amp;#39;s not to say I don&amp;#39;t appreciate it &amp;ndash; to some degree.  But the reality is that how different is it to be the &amp;ldquo;founder&amp;rdquo; or the first group of folks to really put your shovel in the ground versus on of the early team to pour the cement, build the frame and get a roof on that building?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it better to take your shot as a founder or join up as an early employee?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I&amp;#39;ve wondered about that question after announcing I was leaving Zaarly.  Lots of great folks have asked if I&amp;#39;d join their company, go to the dark side (as an investor), cofound something with them or simply help lead something that was moving up the hockey stick. All of these were great opportunities and things that made me pause. In some ways its that proverbial &amp;ldquo;fork&amp;rdquo; in the road for me and my career.  And so I&amp;#39;ve been forced to ask, &amp;ldquo;What makes sense for me at this point in my life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of this is where I found the most insight: &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;at this point in my life.&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve realized: founding something is a great learning experience.  It truly truly is.  BUT, I learned more about how to found something from my experience at Appature (learning from the founders Kabir aand Chris who&amp;#39;d closed their Series A a few months before I joined) and working with dozens of founders as a lawyer.  And now as I start the process of founding my next company, I realize how much collectively I learned going through the process at Zaarly and all those experiences before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you should found something, but more like &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; and if you think about your journey as a founder in those terms, turns out its much easier (non) choice you&amp;#39;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, Which Fork?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I don&amp;#39;t pretend to sit here and give prescriptive advice to anyone&amp;hellip; turns out startups are a challenge whether you found it or you join it early on.  What I&amp;#39;ve learned about myself is that as a founder you must be able to be a teacher and inspire confidence.  From my first hacky side project startup to Zaarly to my new project, each time I&amp;#39;ve gotten more confident, more experienced and more knowledgable.  That isn&amp;#39;t to say I can control the outcomes any better, but perhaps I&amp;#39;ll just make fewer of the same mistakes&amp;hellip; again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I thought through my opportunities, I asked myself these questions:
- Are you able to teach others that work with you something?
- Can you lead people towards an ambiguous aim?
- Will you be better able to convince others to follow your lead in one to three years?
- Are you convinced you are ready to take &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; shot?
- Do you have the resources (time, money, support) to go for a while without a paycheck?
- Describe how this fails?  Does that scare you from doing it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these come down to the question of timing (and confidence in that timing answer), in some form of another.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s now or maybe it&amp;#39;s later, but most of these are experiences, skills or resources &amp;ndash; and all of which require you personally believing now is the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I decided to forgo other opportunities because it feels a little like I&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this for my whole life&amp;hellip; and that&amp;#39;s the answer I needed to know I was ready to go back out for another swing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turns out, it&amp;#39;s hard.  So don&amp;#39;t make it harder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you found or not?  I think the answer is yes (if you are asking the question), of course you found&amp;hellip; but the question really is about &lt;strong&gt;when&lt;/strong&gt; do you found it.  That&amp;#39;s not easy to know, but it&amp;#39;s something that will become obvious as you begin your journey.  If you are confident you want to found something, make your journey about answering those questions &amp;ndash; with the right experience, knowledge, connections and resources.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I love startup people and the guys and gals I meet who are taking the risk to do a startup.  But I often wonder why there is the infatuation with being &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; founder and not part of that early early team?  It&amp;#39;s lessons learned doing the startup grind that ready you to found &amp;ndash; but rather than &amp;ldquo;pay their dues&amp;rdquo;, people move forward with founding.  I wonder if you&amp;#39;d get more out of learning from a successfully founded company than struggling through your first one without any prior experience.  Not every situation is the same, but there are some very common lessons along any startup journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I&amp;#39;m totally enjoying the process of founding another startup.  I truly am. It&amp;#39;s way harder than I remembered, and takes extreme patience, but that&amp;#39;s okay. At the same time, each day I realize how MUCH I didn&amp;#39;t know just a few years ago before my first startup.  Little things like tricks, timelines, structures, hacks, shortcuts, mistakes to avoid, quirks, etc.  You can get some on the fly, but others are just so much easier learning from/with others.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life&amp;#39;s all about preparing you for that moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s awesome to see all the enthusiasm for starting companies &amp;ndash; we probably have a few guys like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates to thank for that.  But if you look at their journeys, they each had figured out the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; time for them to found something&amp;hellip; whether than meant putting in the time in school, in another company, via a hobby or just in life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But founding a company isn&amp;#39;t about if, its about when.  And if you know you want to do it&amp;hellip; create that plan and that path to actually do it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuz it&amp;#39;s terrifying and awesome on this journey.  Wouldn&amp;#39;t be anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Formspring - A Postmortem</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, after nearly three and a half years, &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/formspring-the-pioneering-anonymous-qa-platform-is-shutting-down/"&gt;Formspring is shutting down&lt;/a&gt;. While it‚Äôs a sad moment for me to see a startup I worked on and loved close its doors, I can‚Äôt help but also look back and examine ways we could have steered the product toward a more successful outcome. What follows are a few points that I‚Äôve been reflecting on ever since Ade announced Formspring‚Äôs closure that I hope will be helpful for current and future entrepreneurs. To be clear, my critique is of product decisions we all made together, as a company (while I was there). As we would have shared in its success, so too shall we share and learn from its end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We protected anonymous content to a fault&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formspring‚Äôs initial success was, in large part, due to giving our users the ability to ask each other questions anonymously (even without a Formspring account). In under a year, we skyrocketed to our first billion questions answered and showed few signs of slowing down. Yet even as we celebrated these milestones, we were all discussing how anonymity would or wouldn‚Äôt play a part in the future of our product. On the one hand, anonymity was a really popular feature (duh). On the other hand, we saw a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of bad and abusive content come through that channel (&lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19"&gt;double duh&lt;/a&gt;). A fact that we wound up being &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/12/29/formspring-the-site-for-prying-questions-gears-up-but-will-it-grow-up/"&gt;pretty infamous&lt;/a&gt; for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But man was it hard to let go of anonymity as a core feature. We tried workaround after workaround. We prompted for sign-up after asking an anonymous question. We started pushing privacy settings for users into our on-boarding (which they never changed, of course). We started setting up elaborate filters to catch bad or abusive questions and put them behind a ‚ÄúFlagged Questions‚Äù link in users‚Äô inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a lot of time on anonymity. It was our sacred cow. Looking back, we should have spent that time finding ways to gracefully degrade that feature instead of finding ways to keep it alive. When you find yourself constantly giving a feature CPR, you should stop and consider whether or not it‚Äôs worth saving (or even possible to save).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our opaque follow-model shot us in the foot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, this lines up with our stance on anonymity. Following on Formspring was, for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; completely anonymous. You couldn‚Äôt see who followed you and others couldn‚Äôt see that you were following them. This meant that we gave people a microphone and they kind of had to &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt; people heard what they were saying. And until we eventually launched our Smiles feature (akin to Facebook Likes), there was no way to know that your content was being consumed. We debated this a lot internally and came to the conclusion that the Twitter public-follow model was broken in that it put unnecessary social pressure on users to follow back. We felt we could build social features on top of the content (like Smiles) that let our users receive feedback and let their followers out themselves purposefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formspring eventually allowed public following (not as a default, and after I left), but it was too little too late. My takeaway from this has been to always double check to make sure you‚Äôre not designing toward your own biases instead of what‚Äôs best for your product and users. Formspring had clearly struck a chord with people aching to share more about themselves with their friends. And instead of making it apparent that they were achieving their goal, we put an artificial barrier in place and prevented them from knowing if Formspring was working for them or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We skated toward the hockeystick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest sin of them all from a product perspective, but also the hardest to avoid (and one that I see companies make over and over again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our initial graphs at Formspring, as you probably know, all hockeysticked up and to the right. Nearly straight up. That part was totally awesome! We were super popular! We could be the next [insert gigantic company name here]!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, the graph has peaked and is starting to slowly (very slowly) trend downward. What do we do? Make big bets, right? Try to recapture that crazy growth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so we tried. The first big project we worked on was a Formspring button that sites could embed at the end of blog posts or other content. We had millions of users, so we figured it wasn‚Äôt a stretch to imagine they browsed other web sites and would gladly click a Formspring button at the end of a post (which asked ‚ÄúWhat did you think?‚Äù and allowed them to post a response to their Formspring page). This was just as the Facebook Share and Twitter ‚ÄúTweet This‚Äù buttons were appearing, so we figured it made perfect sense to follow who we viewed as our closest competitors at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We literally spent months on that system. We had to make sure our servers could handle a potentially huge influx of traffic (we based our estimations on our main site‚Äôs traffic, which was honestly insane), had to design and implement the feature, make sure the implementation was easy for publishers, make deals with publishers, etc. We bet huge. On someone else‚Äôs (Facebook and Twitter‚Äôs) plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about photos? Instagram had just come out and was killing it! Our users would surely be more engaged if they could represent their questions and answers visually, right? I worked on those designs for at least a month and a couple more were spent iterating on and actually implementing that work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually don‚Äôt know exactly how that launch went (because I had moved on to Amazon right before it went out the door), but now it seems obvious that photos weren‚Äôt the killer feature we‚Äôd all hoped they would be. Oof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs: build &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; product, not someone else‚Äôs. The most successful products execute on a vision that aligns with their product‚Äôs and users‚Äô goals. It‚Äôs hard to put blinders on when your stats are slowly coming down and you see other startups skyrocketing around you with various tactics and strategies. &lt;em&gt;For the love of god, put them on.&lt;/em&gt; It‚Äôs the only way to build what you should instead of chasing others‚Äô ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, print out &lt;a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/03/the-startup-curve.html"&gt;Paul Graham‚Äôs Startup Curve&lt;/a&gt; and put it on every wall in your office. It will be you. Buckle up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the face of Formspring‚Äôs shutdown, I‚Äôm grateful for having been a part of it. I learned so much from both the team we built and the product that I‚Äôll carry with me the rest of my career. I learned that small changes can frequently (and surprisingly) have the biggest impacts. I learned that gigantic, sweeping changes make it hard to track what‚Äôs going right and what‚Äôs going wrong. I learned just how hard it is to keep a huge site up and operational (also what happens when all of EC2-East goes down). I learned that I love designing for people I can communicate with every day within the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I learned to focus. To put the product vision first. To not try keeping up with what‚Äôs trending. To build &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; product for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Formspring. It was a wild ride.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listening</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You need to prepare, listen and engage.
-&lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3004361/a-conversation-charlie-rose-biz-stone-ev-williams"&gt;Charlie Rose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve met a lot of incredibly successful, accomplished and well-known people. In some cases, I&amp;#39;ve even worked with them. This is one of the huge perks of working with Ron Conway, who I put in this bucket.  (Incidentally, this sounds like a nested &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23humblebrag&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;humblebrag&lt;/a&gt; but just because I met these folks obviously doesn&amp;#39;t put me in that bucket.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, one skill that really stands out among some of these folks is their ability and willingness to listen. I&amp;#39;m not just talking about the level of listening where you remember what the other person said. And not the pollyannish notion of &amp;ldquo;I feel your pain.&amp;rdquo;  I&amp;#39;m talking about the deeper level of listening that requires a mastery of body language, a genuine level of empathy and most important, a genuine interest and curiousity in the speaker or subject matter, or both. They are curious in either the person or the material, regardless of the person or material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried to become a better listener. About fifteen years ago, I bought &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Listening-Forgotten-Skill-Self-Teaching-Guides/dp/0471015873/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1364482828&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=listening"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; and even highlighted portions of it. I got through about a quarter of it and threw it into my &amp;ldquo;Books Aborted&amp;rdquo; pile, which is a very large pile by the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to sound too &lt;a href="http://www.decipheringthesimpsons.com/index.php?p1=vocab&amp;amp;p2=obsequious"&gt;obsequious&lt;/a&gt;, but Ron is one of the best listeners I have ever seen. People like him lock into the other person a la Bill Clinton, who is probably the Mozart when it comes to this. For every meeting that Ron does, he brings a huge pile of notes related to the other person (i.e., he prepares) and completely locks into that person. His signature move is to furiously jot notes to record and remember what the other person is saying. I&amp;#39;ve asked him why he does this and he said, &amp;ldquo;Because I forget shit.&amp;rdquo; But the signal it sends to the speaker is immeasurable. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Charisma-Myth-Personal-Magnetism/dp/1591844568"&gt;charisma&lt;/a&gt; in a nutshell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I first met Ron in 2005, we would talk about online video, his then-current interest. He would scribble notes furiously, sometimes on cocktail napkins. I thought I was the  smartest person in the world on video. When I realized a few years later that he did that with virtually everyone on every topic, I was a bit crestfallen to say the least.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I were a better listener. I&amp;#39;m subpar. Ask my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gracelee"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;. And to her chagrin, I want to improve not necessarily because I want to be a better and more empathic person. it&amp;#39;s because I think it&amp;#39;s an incredibly valuable skill to have as an investor, particularly in the startup world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your approach or &lt;a href="http://daslee.me/your-investors-business-model"&gt;business model&lt;/a&gt;, a huge part of startup investing (and in some cases, the only part) is human talent evaluation. &amp;ldquo;We invest in people&amp;rdquo; is probably the most common refrain for startup investors. And if you&amp;#39;re investing in people, you need to understand not only their skill, aptitude and potential but also their insight, drive, motivation and toughness - the immeasurables. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s where listening comes in. One difference between a good investor and a great investor is that the great investor asks the right questions. And just as importantly, they&amp;#39;re able to process and synthesize the answers. They ask the incisive ones that cut through the noise. And identifying the right question is a function of great listening. Listening increases the throughput of data and also filters out the noise. If you watch Charlie Rose or watch great interviewers, they ask the great follow-up, unscripted questions that reveal the most important and telling details. This can unearth the people who have the missionary and authentic drive to do something great - and just as importantly, weed out the people who say the right things but don&amp;#39;t actually mean it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other person who comes to mind for me ont his topic is Michael Moritz, the legendary investor at Sequoia Capital. We&amp;#39;ve co-invested a lot with Sequoia, but I&amp;#39;ve never really worked with him personally. But his path to investing is not necessarilyt the conventional one. Before his investing career, he was a journalist and writer. And without speaking to him about this or knowing if this is bullshit, it kind of makes sense.  Without knowing anything about the profession, a great journalist has to ask the right questions and synthesize the answers (among other things). And that&amp;#39;s a dynamic exercise that&amp;#39;s a direct function of getting the right information and inputs - i.e., being a great listener. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clayton Christensen said that &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3225-what-are-questions"&gt;questions are places in your mind where answers fit.&lt;/a&gt; The relevant facts are there for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; but you need to be able to ask the right questions to unearth them. The great investors can get to the most insightful answers and meaningful insights faster than the rest of us. In the startup world, where data is scarce but potential is abundant, that is an elite skill.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 11 Risks VCs Evaluate</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24560610974892_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24560610974892_raw.jpg" alt="risk.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the industry is called venture capital, the goal of a VC isn&amp;#39;t to maximize every risk. Instead, we try to understand all the risks a business might face and weigh those risks with the reward - the exit. Here are the major risks that I typically review when a startup pitches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market timing risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Is now the right time for the business? It&amp;#39;s often hard to evaluate this risk, but nevertheless, it&amp;#39;s an important consideration. There are many stories of people saying I invented Facebook before Facebook, which may very well be true. But the market just wasn&amp;#39;t yet ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business model risk&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- Is there a clear business model? Do the unit economics seem to work? If not, what are the assumptions required to achieve profitability?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market adoption risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Are there strong competitive players in the market? What are the major barriers to entry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market size risk -&lt;/strong&gt; If the company is successful, is the exit scenario large enough to¬†&lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-align-founder-and-vc-incentives-why-fund-size-matters"&gt;provide the types of returns our fund needs&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution risk&lt;/strong&gt;¬†- Does the team have the right skills and passion to reach their goals? If not, are they amenable to finding others to complement their skills?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Does the company have to develop a new technology that may not reach fruition, or may take much longer than expected? This is typically more prevalent in cleantech and hardware companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capitalization structure risk&lt;/strong&gt; - does the company have enough room in the cap table to take more investment necessary to grow while still ensuring employees and executives are well compensated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Is the startup building atop YouTube, Twitter or Facebook? How strong is their relationship? Are their product plans in the direct path of the platform or complementary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venture management risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Is the company receptive to feedback? Is the team candid about the state of the business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial risk&lt;/strong&gt; - How much money does the company require to achieve its goals? Is the financing risk manageable given the current environment and company trajectory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal risk&lt;/strong&gt; - Does the company have a high likelihood of lawsuit for patent or copyright infringement? Does the company have any outstanding complaints with early employees or founders? Are there regulatory challenges involved in this sector?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of these risks applies differently to each startup, but it&amp;#39;s a good general outline for entrepreneurs to think through when they pitch their companies to VCs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Don't Mislead Your Users</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tapped an icon or used a gesture only to end up in the wrong place? You were mislead. It&amp;#39;s a sucky feeling. It&amp;#39;s also why we designers should be specific in our intent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is rapidly evolving and &lt;a href="http://theindustry.cc/2013/01/07/13-design-trends-for-2013/"&gt;trends are appearing&lt;/a&gt; all the time. Right now, our interfaces are leaning more towards iconography and &lt;a href="http://www.gesturemanifesto.com"&gt;gestures&lt;/a&gt; rather than text. Which is awesome, and more &lt;a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/brevity-in-design"&gt;concise&lt;/a&gt;. But with them is a greater chance to mislead. You see, it&amp;#39;s hard to mislead your user with words because they&amp;#39;re words‚Äìthe explicit and original way to communicate (unless, of course, you skipped English class). But there&amp;#39;s no popover hovering above our icons and gestures. We&amp;#39;re assuming that our users will deduce their meaning and in some cases, discover them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shape our products based on what we envision, but sometimes, those visions can be blurry in some areas. Then four hours after our product has gone into the wild, we begin receiving redundant messages exclaiming how this or that was misleading. We weren&amp;#39;t specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; specific.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specificity is clarity. I&amp;#39;m not saying you should write a paragraph beneath each trigger in your product, but pass it by a few people. Ask them what they think a particular icon or gesture does. If your accurate response rate is less than 90%, your intent is still blurry. In that case, reanalyze your intention and figure out a better and more &lt;a href="http://blog.jarederondu.com/brevity-in-design"&gt;concise way&lt;/a&gt; to convey it. Ask yourself if any other message could be inferred from that icon other than your intended one. Understand the placement, the context, and the message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be specific. Be simple. Be direct.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YC Demo Day, the Morning After</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apparently, this year it‚Äôs particularly in vogue to express a certain ennui about the batch of Y Combinator startups that presented at Demo Day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I checked in with investors and friends who attended the event, the overwhelming response was that there were tons of solid companies but nothing ‚Äúamazing‚Äù or ‚Äú10x‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the tech press can‚Äôt seem to get behind one single company, instead making their obligatory &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/top-y-combinator-startups/"&gt;‚Äútop 7‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/26/here-are-our-six-favorite-startups-from-the-first-batch-of-y-combinators-winter-2013-demo-day/?fromcat=all"&gt;‚Äú6 favorite‚Äù&lt;/a&gt; lists. This morning‚Äôs &lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/26/at-smaller-y-combinator-social-is-out-revenue-is-in/"&gt;story in the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; confirms the overall sentiment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;founders are tackling ‚Äúboring‚Äù problems that generate cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders risk everything, move across the country or further, endure endless stress, damage relationships, sacrifice their health and pour their every waking moment into creating something people want ‚Äî and they‚Äôre rewarded with a yawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If companies are too serious they‚Äôre boring, and if they‚Äôre too social then they‚Äôre fluffy and we‚Äôre headed for the next bubble. Fuck that noise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Draft Everywhere</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Two big Draft announcements today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft (http://draftin.com)&lt;/a&gt; documents can now easily be published to Wordpress and Tumblr from inside Draft. Go to Settings -&amp;gt; Places to Publish. You&amp;#39;ll then get a Publish button next to your documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I couldn&amp;#39;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bookmarklets and browser extensions like Instapaper, Evernote&amp;#39;s Clearly, and Readability make reading anything on the web simple, focused, and gorgeous. Why can&amp;#39;t writing be that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft/amlbbbgcijmiooecobhkjblcdkjldmdk"&gt;here&amp;#39;s a Chrome extension that lets you&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any webpage that you can write on, you can now use Draft with. Your blog, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, even comment boxes on websites like Reddit and Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just place your cursor in the box you want to write in, click the Chrome Draft extension, and Draft will open up in a new Chrome Tab. Choose an already written document or something new to write in Draft (any text from the original text box will carry over). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/draftapp/images/Screen+Shot+2013-03-27+at+10.52.28+AM.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#39;re done, there&amp;#39;s a menu button to paste your work back into the text box you came from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/draftapp/images/Screen+Shot+2013-03-27+at+11.00.08+AM.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, everything you write everywhere is focused, versioned, and able to be shared with friends for help before you publish. I hope you like it. This might be the handiest and neatest thing I&amp;#39;ve ever made. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/draft/amlbbbgcijmiooecobhkjblcdkjldmdk"&gt;Click here to access the Draft Chrome extension.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also &lt;a href="https://github.com/n8/draft_extension"&gt;open sourced the Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; in case anyone wants to make it better or start similar projects for Firefox and Safari. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the past couple weeks I&amp;#39;ve improved a lot of other things. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your font style and size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive syncing is a lot better. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft is much more usable now on narrow devices like iPads in landscape mode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a CTRL+r/CMD+r shortcut to switch between edit and view modes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a really exciting couple weeks since I launched Draft. The feedback and support have been incredible. Thank you so much for the help, the criticism, and the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned. &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt; has so much more in store to help us become better writers. I&amp;#39;m just getting started. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to Align Founder and VC Incentives: Why Fund Size Matters</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24559109319240_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24559109319240_raw.jpg" alt="richard cook.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When deciding if to raise a venture round, it&amp;#39;s &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;critical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to ensure your venture investor shares the vision for the company: both the product roadmap and the financial goals of the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most founders never consider the impact on fund size on VC motivations. As long as there are enough reserves to invest as the company grows, a founder might think, that&amp;#39;s fine with me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is naive. Fund sizes dictate a VC&amp;#39;s strategy. To achieve their target returns, a $50M fund and a $500M fund must pursue very different investment and management styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take a look at the economics of two hypothetical funds, a $50M and a $500M fund. Assuming each fund seeks to return three times the capital invested in 10 years to provide a good return for investors, the total value of the portfolios must be $150M and $1,500M respectively. The funds have different target ownerships and therefore different average investment sizes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this boils down to a target value of a company at exit.¬†The larger the fund, the larger the exits must be for the venture investors to be successful.
&lt;table width="100%"&gt;

&lt;tr style="border-bottom: 1px solid gray;"&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$50M fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$500M fund&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Target return multiple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Implied Portfolio Holding Value&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$150M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$1,500M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Average Ownership&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total Market Cap of Portfolio&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$1,500M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$6,000M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avg Investment Size including reserves&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;2.5M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$10M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Number of Investments per Fund&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Company Failure Rate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;50%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;70%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Successful Investments&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Avg Market Cap of Exit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$150M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;$400M&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smaller fund a $150M exit fits the model. It&amp;#39;s a great outcome. But the same can&amp;#39;t be said for the larger fund, which seeks exits three times larger. VCs understand this math - it&amp;#39;s the same calculations they use to pitch potential investors. But it&amp;#39;s equally important founders understand the motivations and the goals of their investors, to ensure both are aligned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larger funds will push companies to pursue larger exits. When raising capital, ensure that your investors share the same vision and commitment to the product, but also verify that your target outcomes for the business are in the same ballpark and that you both define success in the same terms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strategy For Releasing Music Online</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Releasing an album of music can be as simple as listing it on iTunes and calling it a day, but I think there&amp;#39;s a better way. A way to take advantage of different online stores and services to promote discovery while not losing out on any potential revenue from people willing to spend some money on melodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what I would do if I was releasing a newly recorded album.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to deter piracy and please the biggest fans, as soon as the album was mixed, mastered, and finished, I would put it up on Bandcamp for sale for $10. People following a band closely enough to know when new music is coming out also probably already use Bandcamp (or can figure it out). I&amp;#39;m convinced that piracy of &amp;ldquo;leaked&amp;rdquo; music before it&amp;#39;s released happens by super fans too impatient for the chance to buy it. You can fix that by making it available to buy before people can get it for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I would plan an official release date shortly thereafter, ramp up a little marketing and getting the word out for the release on iTunes and Amazon. This mainstream release on the major music stores is to get the more casual music fans, people browsing around, and others that may somehow find the album. I would knock the price down to $7.99 at this point to further encourage the purchase of music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 30 days of the album being on iTunes I would put it on Spotify and Rdio. Not just from stuff I read, but when I hear personal stories from managers, bands, and those in the industry that say they still haven&amp;#39;t made more than $100 for the entire length of time they&amp;#39;ve been on Spotify, something&amp;#39;s wrong. Streaming services are important for discovery reasons, but they aren&amp;#39;t providing any (or much) revenue. Until they can bring &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to the table &amp;ndash; even if it&amp;#39;s less &amp;ndash; there&amp;#39;s no reason for musicians not to think of them as second class services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on adoption of the album and how sales are going, after 6+ months I would look into sites and services like NoiseTrade.com that focus on promotional gain over financial gain. Capturing emails, growing the fan base, and getting the most people to hear the music would the goal for the remainder of the album&amp;#39;s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most musicians aren&amp;#39;t creating music just for the chance to be broke and in debt and need to &amp;ndash; at minimum &amp;ndash; recoup the costs that went into making the album. By playing off the immediacy of digital distribution to please your biggest fans and people willing to pay a premium, you capitalize on sales. Using a trickle down approach to services that have less return, you don&amp;#39;t cannibalize potential sales in the name of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coping as an Entrepreneur</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I wrote about &lt;a href="http://adii.me/youre-born-an-entrepreneur"&gt;being born an entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;, I did so to communicate what I felt / thought in an effort to be validated. Because if I can be validated, if I can find others like me, then surely it means that &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m not crazy&lt;/em&gt;. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various tweets &amp;amp; affirmations that I got subsequently made me feel like I wasn&amp;#39;t alone. But then I read &lt;a href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/02/20/why-many-entrepreneurs-are-privately-suffering-and-what-to-do-about-it/"&gt;this article about entrepreneurs being &lt;em&gt;soft-bipolar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;In general, though, many believe that running startups can drive people to experience intense ups and downs. While this is true, it‚Äôs often the other way around: People in the bipolar spectrum are attracted to entrepreneurship. Building businesses can be a great way for hypomanic entrepreneurs to apply their energy and creativity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are more vulnerable to mood fluctuations and can also experience episodes of dark depression that may include feelings of hopelessness, irritability, fatigue, concentration problems, and feelings of worthlessness.&amp;rdquo;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In October last year, my wife &amp;amp; I had an argument (can&amp;#39;t even remember what it was about) and at one point she turned to me to say: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You need to spend time with your son, not because you need to manage him, but because you really want to spend time with him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those very serious words hit me very hard and I left me speechless. What my wife had said was true; not because it was my intention, but it was the consequence of so many other decisions that I was making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the room and upon reflection, I had to admit that deep-down I was incredibly unhappy. So I decided to see my therapist (who had I had been seeing on &amp;amp; off), who suggested that I definitely have a mild case of depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear those words from a therapist was tough. I had never considered myself depressed or an unhappy person; instead I&amp;#39;m an extrovert that always wants to be happy, optimistic &amp;amp; proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hearing these words from my wife (who is the one person in this world that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; knows me) and my therapist though, pushed me to explore other aspects of my life &amp;amp; thoughts that might not have been as obvious. I found that I used the ups to disguise and forget about the downs. As such I was able to &lt;em&gt;cope&lt;/em&gt;, but every now &amp;amp; again that coping mechanism completely failed as the ups would just not come quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to admit &amp;amp; accept that regardless of how successful or happy I was, part of me was imperfect &amp;amp; broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#39;ve done a couple of things to help me cope on what is a pretty rollercoaster ride when being an entrepreneur:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://adii.me/weve-broken-this-startup-thing"&gt;I tweaked a couple of small things&lt;/a&gt; in my daily routine: I work less, I exercise more, I take vitamins to sleep better &amp;amp; I generally attempt to shut down my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write about the things that are in my head. Instead of writing about &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;5 Steps to Grow Your Business&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; or commenting on what&amp;#39;s happening with other companies, I prefer to just share what is going on in my head &amp;amp; heart. This has helped me to cleanse my mind of some things that I grapple with daily and also helps me to distill those thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I joined &lt;a href="http://www.eonetwork.org/"&gt;EO&lt;/a&gt;, where I meet with a group of like-minded entrepreneurs every month to get help. I see this as some kind of &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneurs Anonymous&lt;/em&gt;, where I can just be me, be vulnerable and ask fo help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reminded of Dan Martell&amp;#39;s recent &lt;a href="http://blog.clarity.fm/living-life-in-permanent-beta/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Living Life in Permanent Beta&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; blog post, where he speaks of building &lt;em&gt;soft assets&lt;/em&gt; as an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the tweaks that I&amp;#39;ve made in my life in the last couple of months aren&amp;#39;t necessarily something that I need every, single day. But I&amp;#39;m putting money in the bank and when those downs hit, I have an asset-base on which I can rely to help me cope (as an entrepreneur).&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I began my last post, ‚Äú&lt;a href="http://francispedraza.com/to-think-like-midas"&gt;To think like Midas&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù, by saying that great entrepreneurs think like investors. I spent the rest of it explaining how a great investor might think. Using the past to see the future, we discussed trends and megatrends, and how the winners - the ‚ÄúGreat Men‚Äù - see them coming, make them happen and shape them. Those are the people you want to bet on if you‚Äôre an investor, and if you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, those are the people you want to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, this way of thinking shouldn&amp;#39;t just apply to founders. Leadership should be fractal. If you work for a startup, this is how you want to think. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; is an investor. &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; is an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If great entrepreneurs think like investors, then what follows is the corollary: your business is your investment thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A business is an argument, of sorts. It‚Äôs a statement about value: about what you find valuable, what other people will find valuable, and how best to create that value in the world while making a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every business asserts that it has found the best solution to a problem ‚Äì and that the problem is not only worthy, but that it is the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; worthy of all the problems it could possibly solve ‚Äì given limited time and capital, risk, and the passions and talents of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Framing the decision&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting a business is an investment decision. Dating is an investment decision. Hiring someone is an investment decision. Paying for a service, using a product, working on a project ‚Äì every application of time, money or energy ‚Äì is an investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a framework for thinking about investment: cost plus opportunity cost must be less than expected value. Or, to put it the other way: expected value must be greater than cost plus opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expressed in symbols: &lt;strong&gt;V &amp;gt; C + O.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs run through one of those decisions‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Should we hire someone?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Well, how much do they cost in dollars (salary + equity + incentives + overhead)? Okay, X dollars a year. How much do they cost in time (including recruiting, setup and ongoing communications)? Approximately how much does all of that time cost, if you put a dollar number, Y, to it? Okay, add X to Y get the cost, C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the hard part: estimate the opportunity cost. Who else could we hire? What else could we buy? Or what else could we build? What else is competing for C dollars? Of those alternatives, estimate their expected values then subtract their costs to calculate their expected profits. Take the highest positive number and call that option B: the next best alternative.  Opportunity cost is the profit forgone from the next best alternative, or O = V(next best) ‚Äì C(next best).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q: Should we continue to employ someone? Should I use your product? Should I pay for your service? Should I spend time with you? Should I invest in your startup? Should I start this company? Should I keep working on this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: Repeat the thought process above. The same framework applies to many different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why decisions are complicated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it‚Äôs such a simple formula, then why are some decisions so complicated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquidity - the ability to trade something for cash - is an acute constraint on the cost variable in the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have capital?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it takes years before the expected value pays off. Can you shoulder the costs long enough to receive the benefits? Can you afford to pay them right now and keep paying them as long as it will take for them to pay for themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs what capital is for. To solve the company&amp;#39;s liquidity problem, you have to sell debt or equity. The amount and terms you‚Äôre able to raise depend on how capital markets, specifically the investors which make the market, perceive the risks associated with your company and ‚Äòthe deal‚Äô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can you back out?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many decisions can‚Äôt be reversed, or only with a penalty. That‚Äôs unfortunate, because when circumstances change, so do the variables. Costs, opportunity costs, and expected values go up or down. But you can‚Äôt always double down when times are good and pull out when times are bad, or when a more attractive opportunity shows up.  Cash investors in a startup cannot generally back out early or easily. And sweat equity investors - the startup&amp;#39;s team - can&amp;#39;t either.  The natural and inherent inability of all the investors to back out quickly and regain liquidity has critical consequences on the framework for decision making in startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have time?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe first rule in business is to never run out of money.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the second rule?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;, I asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúNever run out of money!‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone once told me that. I promptly forgot it, but it‚Äôs a lesson that life doesn‚Äôt let you forget for very long. For me, the day of reckoning has come and gone three times now, once per financing. When it‚Äôs over, and the money is in the bank, it‚Äôs such a relief. Running out of money is running out of time, which is a stressful experience. Ahead of you, there‚Äôs a looming ‚Äòcliff‚Äô - that date, that ‚Äòdead‚Äô line - after which you can‚Äôt make payroll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process is not fun, but it&amp;#39;s inherent in the game. Until a startup has established its unit economics - its cost per user/customer acquisition and lifetime value per user/customer - and shown that it can continue to raise venture financing as a &amp;ldquo;scale-up&amp;rdquo;, it will always be racing towards a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs not true that if things are going well, you can always raise more money. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; true that if things are going well and there‚Äôs plenty of money in the bank so that they will &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; going well, that you can always raise more money. Liquidity is no joke. When you run out of money, you run out of moves. The runway ends before you can take off. Game over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another wise piece of advice I once heard: ‚ÄúCreate options, then make decisions.‚Äù To that, I would like to add: ‚ÄúImprove your options, then improve your decisions.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken together, this advice adds up. Let‚Äôs pull it together‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is about scarcity and runway.  The lack of liquidity for investments in a startup means cash from investors is justifiably scarce.  And it can only provide liquidity for a limited time, giving you a certain amount of runway. Without that liquidity, you can‚Äôt make decisions, even good ones. Liquidity buys you time. Without options, you can‚Äôt make decisions. So spend the time creating options. Then, improve your options and your decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä®That‚Äôs a recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Asymmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asymmetry is about expanding the opportunity cost variable in the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In economic literature, information asymmetry refers to principals and agents, but its a subset of a larger class of problems caused by imperfect information. In this essay, I&amp;#39;d like to explore the asymmetry between a decision maker and reality, which is immense and complex, such that the cost of acquiring more information is very high, upward curving, and ultimately infinite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs an infinite amount of information. You have access to a tiny fraction of it. When you make decisions, you‚Äôre dealing with imperfect knowledge. The decision you‚Äôre weighing is infinitely more complex than you will ever know, or need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say, for example, your startup has just received enough funding to make some additional hires, and you set out to hire your first marketing person. Suppose you reach out to ten marketing people, three become serious discussions, and you hire one. By pulling the trigger, though, you were also, by definition, ruling out every other eligible marketing candidate on the planet for that role. You were comfortable doing that, because, of course, you were not willing to interview them all, and you judged that your sample size of ten was sufficient. You knew that you might be missing out on some incredibly superior candidate who‚Äôs out there ‚Äì somewhere - but your sense for how hard it would be to find that candidate and how very few exist is such that you‚Äôre comfortable pulling the trigger on the candidate in front of you. But what if you‚Äôre wrong? What if you didn‚Äôt look far enough, or in the right places? What if an incremental increase in time invested upfront in looking beyond your immediate network would have uncovered a trove of talent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We acquire information in order to create and improve our options. Your sense for the opportunity cost of a decision is based on the very limited information you have about all the possible alternatives. Making decisions with limited information is an art. The mature response to ‚Äúthe information problem‚Äù is not to get squeamish when you don‚Äôt have enough information to make a perfectly informed decision. Rather, it‚Äôs probably to identify which data points, of those available, are most operative to making a decision, and then, if those are not sufficient, to identify which data points, of those necessary but not available, will be cheapest to acquire. Then, the game becomes getting the right information, and getting it rapidly and at lowest cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which begs the question - how? I use three processes to support my overall strategy: networking, canvassing and landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Networking&lt;/em&gt; is an art. I don‚Äôt profess to be a master. However, I do dislike the stereotype of the charismatic-hustler-schmoozer-wheeler-dealer-connector-talker that some people associate with sales people. Many people who profess to be salespeople are decent at one or two aspects, but may not get the rest. They may be acting as pawns instead of queens. It‚Äôs not enough to make a move; one has to comprehend the entire board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By meeting lots of new people, you are acquiring information. Every individual is a data point on the grid. The more data points, the more complete your understanding of reality and the fewer your blind spots. You are also creating an option, because friendly relationships don‚Äôt have an expiration date. Once you‚Äôve established rapport, respect and trust with someone, and you become their friend, you can lean on them, at any point in the future, for information, advice, perspectives, ideas, introductions, help, opportunities and even capital - as long as the relationship is maintained. Not every relationship is lucrative, but every relationship has potential upside. It‚Äôs an option. Preserving and expanding your optionality is wise. And it‚Äôs a two way street‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs suppose that you know 50 venture capitalists, but you don‚Äôt know any current high school students. Then, you happen to take a short plane flight with a venture capitalist and a high school student, but you can only sit with one. To maximize your benefit, which do you choose? Now, obviously, there are unknown variables here, so there‚Äôs no right answer, but I‚Äôd like to make a case for the high school student. There is marginal benefit in meeting an additional VC, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information built-in to the high school student that you don‚Äôt currently have access to. High school students are a blind spot for you. If, for whatever reason, you someday need to design a product for them, or recruit them as interns, or be aware of trends in popular culture or public education or any number of intersections that this individual represents, albeit, with a sample size of one, then you could get back in touch. Repeat this exercise with Norwegians, salsa dancers, gun control lobbyists, material scientists and Franciscan priests‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canvassing&lt;/em&gt; is asking questions of others systematically to gain information, perspectives, advice and insights to achieve what I called &amp;ldquo;parallax&amp;rdquo; in a &lt;a href="http://francispedraza.com/create-parallax"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. So while you network, you‚Äôre extracting information. Earlier this week I found myself standing next to a Franciscan priest from Italy while standing in line waiting for a bus at JFK. Through the conversation I learned a lot of interesting information about the Catholic Church. So, if networking is about going broad - knowing more people - canvassing is going deep - knowing people more. To be good at it, you have to be curious and fascinated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand your network, ask them questions, gain more information - then what? Then, you put all of this information together into a coherent understanding of reality. I call that process &lt;em&gt;Landscaping&lt;/em&gt;. It‚Äôs like an exercise in cartography: this is my map and here are the mountains, here are the rivers, the Black Forest and beyond here, there be dragons‚Ä¶ Or, it can be likened to finding new puzzle pieces, then fitting them together. Landscaping lends itself to spending lots of time alone to think, read and write. New information and perspectives can be gained from conversations with others, but ultimately landscaping is about putting it all together into a story that makes sense about the world and the way it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time on these three activities should expand your opportunity costs. You‚Äôll increasingly realize that for every thing you do, you are choosing not to do many other worthy things. And the more options you create, the higher the likely value of the best option, and the greater the foregone profit of the next best option.  An ironic take away might be: ‚ÄúAt all costs, expand opportunity costs!‚Äù Even though deliberately increasing the ‚Äúcost‚Äù side of the equation by increasing opportunity costs seems counter-intuitive, it‚Äôs what great business leaders do. It forces the bar ever higher for the value side of the equation, so that when they do decide to invest time and resources, it‚Äôs very high leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Subjectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjectivity is inherent in calculating the expected value variable in the formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, so far we‚Äôve assumed that human beings are rational actors, which isn‚Äôt exactly right. Are they irrational, then? No, they‚Äôre not. When economists talk about ‚Äúrational‚Äù actors, they are referencing the classic textbook definition: calculated profit-seeking. But money is a store of value, so profit-seeking is only a subset of value-seeking, and value is fundamentally subjective. Let‚Äôs think about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is valuable to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not value what you value. If we did, we would be the same. But we are not the same, we are different. We want and care about different things because we see the world in different ways. We may have some things in common, but not everything. And that‚Äôs why we trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what you truly value is a process of self-discovery. Why are you starting this business? If you succeed, what will it do for you? What do I want more of in my life? Given all that I could be doing, why is this the best use of my time? Given trade-offs between freedom and security, or work-life balance and financial success, what would I choose? Ask yourself enough questions like this and you‚Äôll quickly uncover your own philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is valuable to others?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No two people value things precisely the same way, but there is usually a fair amount of overlap. Even if there weren‚Äôt, there would still be gains from trade. You want this? I want your money. I give you this, you give me your money. Prices coordinate supply and demand. Demand is subjective, so prices coordinate subjective inputs and make them visible, coordinating action across time for vast numbers of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what is valuable to large groups of other people is a lucrative skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there social, cultural and emotional complications?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you give the job to your friend, or the more qualified outsider? Do you invest in the startup you love, or the startup that‚Äôs going to make your limited partners more money? Do you do what your told, or stand up for what you believe? Are you passionate about what you do every day, or do you just show up for the check?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjectivity brings color to a colorless ledger of profit and loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Justifying your decision to yourself and others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the formula? Expected value must be greater than cost plus opportunity cost: V &amp;gt; C + O. It is a framework as disarming in its simplicity as it is enchanting in its complexity.  The nuances, caveats, subjective inputs and infinite information that form the context for every investment decision must ultimately be weighed in the balance by you - the decision maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wrote this, the image that kept coming to mind was that of a pole vaulter. Sprinting down the track, every muscle pumping, then planting the pole, leaping off the ground and catapulting into mid-air. In that moment, there‚Äôs one question: will you get high enough to clear the hurdle? Get ready - you are that pole vaulter. That hurdle is your opportunity cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That formula is the test. Your business (and your life, for that matter) has to pass the test. Again and again and again. If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur, you know what it‚Äôs like. You pitch. Not just once, or dozens, or hundreds - but thousands upon thousands of times. Yesterday I had seven meetings and three phone calls. In every single one of those, I had to help other people see that the expected value of what I wanted them to do (invest, partner, etc.) was greater than their cost and opportunity cost. They‚Äôre not me, so they don‚Äôt necessarily value what I value. Every person asks different questions and has different reservations. Patterns emerge in these conversations ‚Äì which you revisit, prompting you to reconsider your logic again and again. You have to justify your investment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your business is your thesis. It is your ultimate answer to how you will create value, both for yourself and for others, both now and in the future. It is your grand statement, your philosophy in motion, your logic incarnate. Given all the costs. Given all the opportunity costs. Given all the context and considerations. Given the world in which you find yourself. Given you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer the question: WHAT IS VALUABLE?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This. This is what is valuable. This, this, this!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you work on, speaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak your passion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What it's like to have gay parents</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/13/pope-francis-gay-marriage-anti_n_2869221.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;At stake is the identity and survival of the family: father, mother and children. At stake are the lives of many children who will be discriminated against in advance, and deprived of their human development given by a father and a mother and willed by God.‚Äù 
- Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born into a family with two mothers, Laurie and Kerrie. I wasn&amp;#39;t adopted; I was conceived through artificial insemination using donor sperm. My parents fell in love and went through the process in the late 80&amp;#39;s, which was pretty controversial at the time. I&amp;#39;ve met many other children who were conceived the same way, but they were always younger, conceived after it had become more socially acceptable. The only thing I was told about my father is the color of his hair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mum and Kerrie are both female feminist family therapists so I have never exactly had a father figure in my life. Despite this, our family was incredibly close&amp;ndash;I grew up in an environment where I became used to telling my parents everything and receiving unconditional love in return. When I was young, I used to pretend to be sick during school so I could spend the day with Mum or Kerrie at work. I&amp;#39;ve never met another family as close as ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often asked me, &amp;quot;Do you think not having a father changed you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I had graduated from high school, my parents asked me to come into the kitchen to listen to a talk show on the radio with them. There was a South Australian politician who was avidly preaching that &amp;ldquo;Gay parents are discriminating against their children by taking away their right to a father&amp;rdquo;, which would &amp;ldquo;handicap them in later life&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The radio opened up to viewer discussion and I called in, furious. While I waited on hold, I began to shakily scribble what I would say on a discarded piece of paper. I&amp;#39;ve kept it to this day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ve heard you talk very passionately and at great length about discrimination against children, but you haven&amp;#39;t talked about how you&amp;#39;ve come to this conclusion. Are you close to families where you have experienced, first hand, the negative effects of gay parenting? Are you referencing research? And, what do you even mean by discrimination: mental wellbeing, family relationships, success in life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where I stand it seems as though you are simply stating an opinion, one which is not based in research or anecdote. And from that single, subjective, uninformed opinion, you are trying to enforce policy that will affect the entire country&amp;#39;s perspective on my family.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never taken off hold. When the show ended, Laurie, Kerrie and I sat in silence. It was only then that I realized my voice would never be heard&amp;ndash;people were so busy listening to politicians and priests that they forgot to ask the children what having gay parents was actually like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt society that will one day accept gay marriage, but before it does we have to collectively change how we think. Right now, opinions are used interchangeably with facts. We often fail to look at things holistically, to look at the evidence and reason, to differentiate between fact and opinion.  We lose sight of the fact that we are individuals and that other people with other experiences may feel differently. We get so caught up in our own rationalization that we forget to ask how others feel. Subjectivity is the root of all discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was four years old, I remember complaining to my Mum. I whined &amp;ldquo;Mum, I wish I had a Dad&amp;rdquo;. She was shocked, and in retrospect, I can understand why. She must have felt worried that despite all her love, there was some fundmental truth to the discrimination in society. Maybe she had made a mistake. Maybe children did need fathers. She looked down and cautiously asked me &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grinned at her &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;That way he could go to work and I could spend all day with you and Kerrie!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fantasy VC</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;People who can&amp;#39;t own their own sports teams play fantasy sports. People who can&amp;#39;t invest in the stock market do virtual trading. Why should I be left out? I decided that I&amp;#39;m going to publish my list of investing picks (that I&amp;#39;ve kept private up til now), so that in the future I can (and you can) look back and see how I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it more realistic, I&amp;#39;m giving myself ~$3M/year to invest &amp;ndash; that&amp;#39;ll keep me honest and help make me decide &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; I like each company, not just that I like them (which is important from an investor&amp;#39;s perspective). I&amp;#39;m including the date picked as that&amp;#39;s relevant to finding startups &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals are to identify both super successful and undervalued companies, before they becomes &amp;ldquo;obviously successful.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;#39;ll be attending YC Alumni Demo Day and meeting with a bunch of people in the tech community, because I do that anyway. Disclosures and notes at bottom. I can&amp;#39;t currently afford to act on these, but if you do &amp;amp; make any profit, feel free to share. Some day in the future, I hope to put my money where my mouth is &lt;em&gt;(want to make that happen? let&amp;#39;s talk)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Startup's 10 Most Important Metrics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24557450864274_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24557450864274_raw.jpg" alt="ruler.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the analytics tools today, it&amp;#39;s easy to measure hundreds if not thousands of different metrics for your business. Cutting through all the chaff to determine the most important or insightful metrics can be quite a challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the ten metrics I&amp;#39;ve found to be most useful in board meetings. They answer the questions of how should a startup founder might measuring the business at the highest level. You should have many more metrics than these, but I&amp;#39;ve highlighted the ones that I recommend presenting to your board and reviewing each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Metrics Format&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clear data leads to productive conversations.  To best understand a data point and its implications, we have to put it in context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found dividing top level data in three slides, one for company priority (Distribution, Engagement, Revenue) helps to set the right context. Within the slide, a table that shows the metric and compares it to last month, then explicitly calculates the monthly change, the trailing six month average and finally compares the metric to the goal best communicates the state of that metric. See below for an example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table width="100%"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Metric
&lt;td&gt;This month
&lt;td&gt;Last Month
&lt;td&gt;% change
&lt;td&gt;TSM Average
&lt;td&gt;Goal
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Active Users&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;50,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;125%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Total User Base&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;500,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;400,000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;25%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TSM Average column is the Trailing Six Month Compound Growth Rate. It is calculated in this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(ending_value/starting_value)^(1/num_periods-1)-1.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most businesses, a monthly growth percent is too volatile to be meaningful. However the TSM Average smooths out the monthly change. Comparing the monthly to the TSM, we can get a sense of whether the monthly growth is accelerating or decelerating and how it compares to the goal you set each quarter. In this example, the total user growth was slower this month than in the past six month, but activity is way up. The next question, the one board members and founders should ask, is why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Metrics/Question Pairs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the base format of the metrics, let&amp;#39;s talk about which metrics matter. Each metric is followed by the question it&amp;#39;s designed to answer. Pick the ones that are relevant to your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Distribution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New users added last month by channel/TSM growth rate:&lt;/strong&gt; How are well are we growing the user base? Which user sources are the best?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total user base/TSM growth rate:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;How important is our monthly growth compared to our total user base?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost of customer¬†acquisition,¬†lifetime¬†value, pay back period:&lt;/strong&gt;¬†Can we grow faster through paid acquisition? Are we acquiring customers profitably? How much can we afford to spend on new customers? How is this changing over time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active users (can defined in several different ways depending on your product) by channel/TSM growth rate:&lt;/strong&gt; Are we getting better at giving our customers what they want/need?¬†Which channels of users are most effective in finding us the right kind of user?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;% of users using top 3 key features in a given month:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;Are our product initiatives the right ones?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Revenue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue / TSM Revenue growth:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;Are we growing our revenue?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion to paid rate in that month/by cohort:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;How many users converted to paid?¬†Are we improving our ability to convert customers to paid?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avg spend per paying customer of a managed account vs solo account:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;What is the impact of the account management team?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Churn rate/ TSM Churn rate:&lt;/strong&gt; How well do we retain our customers?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn rate:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;When are we profitable? When do we run out of cash? When do we need to raise?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the metrics that have been most valuable/insightful for me working with our companies. &lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/your-startup-s-10-most-important-metrics"&gt;Let me know if there are other metrics you use to measure your business that might be useful to add to this list on this Branch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Can You Deliver On Your Brand's Promises?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I got an e-mail from a WooThemes customer, which read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you for your answer! This confirms your superior support reputation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate reaction was to smile, because the customer was happy, and this is &lt;a href="http://adii.me/your-competitors-are-making-it-easy-for-you"&gt;something that we proactively strive to achieve at Woo&lt;/a&gt;. But then, I realized how easily that could&amp;#39;ve worked out differently too if the customer didn&amp;#39;t have a great experience with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone heard that you were a great company to work with (and decides to use your product / service / app because of that) and they then experience the exact opposite, it&amp;#39;s not only a neutral outcome. Instead that customer has an exponentially bad experience, because their &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; was that much more / better than they got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company, you weren&amp;#39;t thus competing on neutral footing; you had to deliver (at least) on par with your reputation and thus the expectation of that customer. Anything less than those lofty goals and you&amp;#39;ve failed that customer in their expectation &amp;amp; perception of how things would be when they take the plunge to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the thing then&amp;hellip; What does your brand &amp;amp; reputation promise? Can you live up those promises? Can you actually execute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are you just great at marketing and have essentially set up all your future customers to be disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Summly deal makes no sense</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The story about Summly&amp;#39;s 17-year old founder cashing out his company for $30,000,000 is fascinating because it makes no sense. I hate to be a curmudgeon, but I think Yahoo shareholders deserve an explanation. It&amp;#39;s not clear at all to me that they are getting their money&amp;#39;s worth. Let&amp;#39;s walk through the story together &lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: I have no idea if it actually happened like this. Just an educated guess.)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly raises &lt;a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/summly"&gt;$1.5 million in total funding&lt;/a&gt;, launches to significant fanfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo comes knocking, asks for their download numbers, revenue, technology overview, and the resum√©s of their 5 employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly comes back and says just short of a million, $0, &lt;a href="http://summly.com/technology.html"&gt;licensed-technology from SRI&lt;/a&gt;, and here are the resum√©s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says great, we are looking to beef up our mobile team here. We are also interested in the future of news. You have 5 employees. But you don&amp;#39;t have enough downloads, technology, or revenue for this to be an attractive deal to us on the real M&amp;amp;A front. Tell you what, you guys have raised $1.5m. It won&amp;#39;t take a huge sum for us to pick you up. I think if all of your engineers pass the &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/yahoos-mayer-gets-internal-flak-more-rigorous-hiring-1C8814659"&gt;rigorous technical/CS interviews that Marissa has mandated&lt;/a&gt;, or at least a majority, we&amp;#39;ll hire your team and we&amp;#39;ll pay your investors back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says OK, let&amp;#39;s pursue that option. I think my team can pass your interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo screens the employees, and tells the founder that &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/"&gt;2 of them passed&lt;/a&gt;. And we&amp;#39;ll let the the founder skip the interview because he&amp;#39;s 17 and won&amp;#39;t pass it - but he probably understands mobile better than half the people at Yahoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says dang, only 2 out of 5 passed? Umm&amp;hellip;alright, well will you still buy us? What&amp;#39;s the number?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo takes the information back to PR and corp dev&amp;#39;s numbers people. PR calculates that they&amp;#39;ll get major press for the acquisition of a teenager&amp;#39;s company, values that press at $1m. Corp dev says they&amp;#39;ll pay &lt;a href="http://daslee.me/quick-thoughts-on-acquihiressoft-landings"&gt;$1m per engineer&lt;/a&gt; as is typical. And we&amp;#39;ll throw in $5m for the founder. That brings the total to $8m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says no, $50m is our minimum. We need to pay back our generous investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says $15m is fair. After all, we&amp;#39;re getting 3 employees, shutting down the app, and will have to rewrite the technology on our stack with a team of senior engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says $30m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?????? The craziest thing is that there are a lot of really qualified, CS-beefy teams doing really amazing things in the mobile news/discovery space these days - and that would definitely take a $30m acquisition offer or less. I don&amp;#39;t really understand why they picked this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update on March 27:&lt;/em&gt; I just want to clarify some things, since this article really took off and the story is pretty much out of my hands now. First, I mean no disrespect to Nick or anybody else at Summly. They obviously made something people want, and Yahoo wanted. The app was beautifully created, wonderfully marketed, and cool. It just seemed to me that this was not a typical acquisition, and therefore Yahoo needed to explain it better. I also want to say that in my last paragraph, I mention that there are &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flipboard.com"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://getprismatic.com/"&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cir.ca/"&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://getpocket.com/"&gt;in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pulse.me/"&gt;mobile&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://wavii.com/?"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.feedly.com/"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that Yahoo could have bought. I was not referring even a little bit to my own company that makes &lt;a href="https://everyme.com"&gt;Everyme.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://origami.com"&gt;Origami.com&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of those properties have anything to do with news or content discovery. They are private social networks. I don&amp;#39;t expect any redactions from any news publications, I just wish they would ask me for clarifications or do maybe 3 minutes of research on my company and me before calling me a &lt;a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2013/03/17-year-old-british-high-schooler-sells-iphone-app-for-30m/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;jelly belly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or declaring my post as &lt;a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/app_kid_ridiculed_1KtdYlBL7WGlePijXZlpmK"&gt;&amp;ldquo;adolescent-style envy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or surmising that I wonder &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/guy-who-hates-to-be-a-curmudgeon-explains-why-yahoo-buying-a-17-year-olds-startup-for-30-million-makes-no-sense-2013-3"&gt;&amp;ldquo;why him and not me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m neither envious, jealous, nor do I wonder why it wasn&amp;#39;t me. I am just curious like a lot of other people are, as is evidenced by how popular this post became.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows Blue is how Windows 8 should have been from the start</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556374409446_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556374409446_raw.jpg" alt="owen_24236632149354_raw (1).jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a bad habit of releasing an OS to the world &amp;ndash; like Windows Vista &amp;ndash; that&amp;#39;s rushed and not polished, just to meet deadlines. Vista would be the prime example of a &amp;ldquo;half-done&amp;rdquo; operating system that was directly improved on by a later iteration, Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Windows 8 was released, it was met with harsh criticism from those in the news business as well as the technology industry. Early reviews of Windows 8 slated the OS for having many missing features, inconsistencies and general &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo; usability issues. Here&amp;#39;s a handful of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/review/511116/windows-8-design-over-usability/"&gt;Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs easy to find things that are wrong with Modern (which was called Metro in developer and early versions). For example, there are no overlapping windows, and there‚Äôs simply no way to put three or four applications on a single screen at the same time‚Äîeven if your work space has a screen that‚Äôs 27 inches across. Windows 8 largely eliminates menus‚Äîthe product of more than 40 years of usability research‚Äîand introduces a new system of touch-based text labels and controls that are frequently hidden and obscure. The interface is sparse‚Äîapplications like e-mail and the address book now present far too little information on the screen, resulting in the need to frequently pan and scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3537710/windows-8-review"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8‚Äôs Snap lets you position two apps ‚Äî desktop or Windows 8-style ‚Äî alongside each other. Unfortunately, the Snap view is rather limited, with one app occupying a small amount of screen real estate (320 px) and the other taking the majority of the pixels available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/windows_8_Review?page=0,1"&gt;Maximum PC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Metro comes with a number of options to prettify your PC, know that its settings are a wee bit more buried than your average Control Panel‚Äîand they aren&amp;#39;t even accessible via the Control Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5934932/windows-8-review-incredibly-innovative-incredibly-important-not-quite-incredible"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad, somewhat predictable truth is that the fundamental act of moving a file from one folder to another‚Äîthe drag-and-drop action that was probably one of the first three things you learned to do on a computer‚Äîis kind of terrible in Metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of examples that talk to some of the issues Windows 8 faced at launch. There&amp;#39;s a bunch of other ones I haven&amp;#39;t quoted here either: the lack of a Modern-style control panel, no Modern-style Office suite (I still can&amp;#39;t believe this one), the total disconnect between desktop and Modern UI, generic share commands and the over-simplification of basic system tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bewilders me as to why Microsoft would dumb down fundamental features like Bluetooth or even completely ignore adding functionality for dealing with system settings in the gold release of Windows 8, but it seems that it simply comes down to a lack of time. Windows 8 &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to be out by the holiday season of 2012. They cut functionality and dumbed down features to deliver it on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve got our first glimpse of Windows Blue, it&amp;#39;s telling that Microsoft knew what was missing from day one and that they&amp;#39;ve taken on the criticism from the world. Keeping in mind that Blue is a very early preview (and is very unofficial) of whatever we&amp;#39;re going to see later this year, the leak that we&amp;#39;ve got gives us a glimpse at how Microsoft is going to proceed with what they started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556359264822_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556359264822_raw.png" alt="windows8smalls.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that&amp;#39;s been addressed is the odd disconnect between Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 that happened at launch, despite the fact that the Windows Phone team&amp;#39;s designs were public for some time before Windows 8 came out. Windows Phone had the ability to have large, medium and small tiles. Windows 8 had large and medium. Despite the plans being public, the Windows 8 team didn&amp;#39;t seem to pick up on this before release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now align tile sizes with those on a Windows Phone. Maybe not a big deal, but a consistent experience across platforms is key here and it&amp;#39;s important that Microsoft gives a consistent interface across their offerings. Microsoft was never good with consistency previously, perhaps they&amp;#39;ve turned over a new leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556360743954_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556360743954_raw.png" alt="immersivesettings.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Microsoft has dealt with the watered down Modern control panel. You can finally delve into the settings of your Bluetooth devices and configure them (amongst other things). Those who live in tablet world no longer have to deal with dropping out of their dream into the desktop to change settings in the old control panel. Almost every system setting imaginable is now configurable from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556362525162_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556362525162_raw.jpg" alt="filemanagermetro2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, a file manager has been added for the Modern interface (something that users moaned about &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;) so that it&amp;#39;s possible to actually deal with files from the Modern UI rather than having to switch back to the desktop mode and poke at tiny controls to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556365287910_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556365287910_raw.png" alt="split.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even dealt with complaints from users about being unable to run applications at any ratio other than 20%/80% of the screen per app. It&amp;#39;s possible to resize an application to any ratio a user likes in Windows Blue. It&amp;#39;s actually taken one step further, though, allowing users to add a third and even fourth application to the Modern interface split view without issue (on a big screen, you can add as many as you like). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556370606370_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556370606370_raw.png" alt="splitsplit.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the developers I talked to about this, the consensus was that this could create mayhem for those that chose to wrote XAML applications instead of HTML5 applications, as the HTML5 applications tend to be able to handle display scaling better. It could be interesting to see how this is handled by the community once it&amp;#39;s official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office isn&amp;#39;t included in the leaked build, but I desperately hope that Microsoft has a Modern UI version of it ready by the time Blue hits the street. It needs it, and this rounding out of the OS actually just shows how desperately the company needs to complete that part of the picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Modern UI is the path forward; it&amp;#39;s clear from Windows Blue&amp;#39;s leak (so far) that there&amp;#39;s little focus on the desktop experience. There&amp;#39;s a few small changes that are barely observable by the user, such as the &amp;ldquo;libraries&amp;rdquo; now showing up in My Computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the desktop has been ignored (as far as we&amp;#39;ve seen), and the void between the Modern-UI touch future and the desktop that Microsoft is forging ahead with is growing larger. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily bad, it&amp;#39;s just obvious where the company is betting we&amp;#39;ll be wanting to spend all of our time. The disconnect between the touch interface and the desktop is growing and I fear that PC users are going to be left behind as the company moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Blue shows that Microsoft is sticking with their guns and that Windows 8 needed improvement. It was the basic form of what&amp;#39;s to come and this functionality should have been there from the start but wasn&amp;#39;t. Perhaps if the company had waited to release the product and baked these features in from the beginning it might have won consumers over even faster. Apple is renowned for taking as long as it takes for their features to become fully baked, even if it means delivering late. Microsoft still hasn&amp;#39;t learnt that trick, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue is coming and it &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/03/25/windows-blue-in-context-think-of-it-as-the-windows-phone-8-upgrade-for-windows-8-itself/"&gt;completes the picture&lt;/a&gt; of where we&amp;#39;re going with Windows. I hope this upgrade doesn&amp;#39;t have a price tag attached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audacity of a Ninth Grader</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people who are stuck. Stuck in a job or a position. Or they want to start a business, but never seem to get past the vague idea. They want a promotion, but are too scared to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched a new product a couple weeks ago called &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt; to help people &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;write better&lt;/a&gt;. A ninth grader was the first person to email me after news about Draft was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a simple proposition: Can he interview me over Skype or email for his blog. It would just be 5 questions. And he seemed to already have used my product: &amp;ldquo;Just used Draft. It is the coolest thing in the whole world. No more Google Docs for school projects. :)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flattery works. But I am insanely impressed that a ninth grade kid has the audacity to email people he doesn&amp;#39;t know to get their help improving the asset he&amp;#39;s created. That&amp;#39;s just not something most people do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a crowded concert this last weekend (Frightened Rabbit). Walking out of the concert hall after the show, we were in your typical cattle formation. Tons and tons of people trying to get outside. Being civil. Barely. And everyone is trying to squeeze past these 4 open doors to get outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me as odd is the exit of the concert hall actually has something like 10 doors. Why is everyone crowding through these 4? So I avoided the crowded line, walked with my 2 friends to one of the other doors, and pushed. It wasn&amp;#39;t locked. We were out. The security guards, looking over all of us, didn&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my first job after college, I felt stuck. I used to be a Chemical Engineer who had fallen in love with making things on computers. And I was lucky enough to get a chance to work for a technology consulting company, Accenture. But I didn&amp;#39;t get put into a position to make things on computers. I got put into a role where I was constantly taking meeting minutes and documenting requirements and test cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started sending emails to random people in the company. Not random people exactly. Random important people. I emailed partners. I&amp;#39;d email them new ideas I had that I thought Accenture could make money from. As I look back, they were crazy, half-baked ideas, poorly thought out, and articulated even worse. But I got emails and phones calls back from these partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever told me to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got a promotion to a team at Accenture that would let me make software. I didn&amp;#39;t have to document requirements anymore. The door was unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt, a friend from an acting class I took last year, shared this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His major in college was acting. When he showed up to school, he met classmates just like him. Everyone had been in high school plays or performing in some community theater. The teacher on the first day of class asked everyone why they were there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most students had variations of the same answer: &amp;ldquo;I want to be an actor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One student though had a different answer, and it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s always motivated Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other student replied: &amp;ldquo;I am an actor, and I want to get better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve continued to send emails to people who are complete strangers to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sent emails to Mark Cuban and Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce. Had conversations with both of them. Benioff even setup a meeting with me and his staff. An email sent to the CEO of Starbucks led to a meeting too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These emails rarely turn into much. But sometimes they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started Inkling, one of the first things I did was email another entrepreneur also doing things with The Wisdom of Crowds. That email quickly turned into the first revenue making deal Inkling did for $30,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I emailed Dustin Curtis to see if I could be a member of SVBTLE, the blog network you are reading this post on, before SVBTLE even had an invite form. I really didn&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d invite me. I didn&amp;#39;t know him. I had dropped the ball on blogging awhile ago. And I had 200 Twitter followers to his 40,000. But what the hell, I emailed anyways. I got an invite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I emailed someone I&amp;#39;ve admired for a long time for some mentorship. He&amp;#39;s going to say no, right? He&amp;#39;s too frickin busy. Now he&amp;#39;s personally advising me on Draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that we want to and can accomplish but a lot of us are sitting around waiting for permission. Permission that seems to never come. The kid in the ninth grade isn&amp;#39;t waiting for it. The acting student has already decided he&amp;#39;s an actor without anyone telling him he could be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure they get told no. I&amp;#39;m sure the acting student wasn&amp;#39;t very good yet. But what&amp;#39;s the worst thing that could happen in most of these cases. People ignore you? People tell you no? You look a little silly trying to push a door that is actually locked? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how often does the worst thing even happen, and how much better is the best thing that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting on permission for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the other door already. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;It would be awesome to meet you on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://instantbight.com/instantbight/interview-with-nathan-kontnynatekontny"&gt;here&amp;#39;s the interview I did with ninth grader David Silverman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Freemium Negates The Leaky Bucket Myth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg" alt="bucket.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any time in the past ten years, you might have asked someone at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AINTU&amp;amp;ei=Ol5QUcDVIoGmiQLqmwE"&gt;Intuit&lt;/a&gt; about the size of the QuickBooks user base, they would have told you the same number: about 4M. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure hasn&amp;#39;t grown because Intuit&amp;#39;s customer base, the small-and-medium business market, is a leaky bucket. &lt;a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqIndexAll.cfm?areaid=24"&gt;On the small end of the spectrum, about 750,000 businesses are created each year and about the same number fail.&lt;/a&gt; On the upper end of the spectrum, successful medium sized businesses (and the larger, more valuable Quickbooks customers) outgrow Intuit&amp;#39;s products and upgrade to enterprise accounting packages provided by Oracle and others of their ilk. It&amp;#39;s no surprise then that QuickBooks suffers from high churn rates, characteristic of the SMB market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaky bucket market dynamic can be quite unattractive if customers must be acquired through paid customer acquisition. SMBs are notoriously expensive to acquire. Combined with high churn rates, we have a recipe for burning through mounds of cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those concerns, it&amp;#39;s difficult to argue with Intuit&amp;#39;s success. It&amp;#39;s nearly a $20B market cap company generating $4.2B annually in revenue of which 17% or $700M+ is derived from this leaky bucket SMB segment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did Intuit build a business of such scale atop a customer segment that looks like quicksand? They don&amp;#39;t pay to acquire customers. Intuit used word of mouth, brand strength and an existing product (Quicken) to bootstrap QuickBooks to success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it&amp;#39;s easier than ever for startups to target the SMB market successfully. Freemium businesses of scale are feasible because mobile application distribution, web distribution (SEO, social media) and app stores like Intuit or Salesforce or Google amass millions of SMB owners who can be reached at zero marginal cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But very few startups and investors pursue the market even today despite these fundamental changes in the market. Part of the challenge is maintaining the discipline to minimize customer acquisition spend, instead focusing on &lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/branding"&gt;brand building&lt;/a&gt;, word of mouth marketing, product excellence and so on. In other words, patience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, I think we will see a segment of SMB SaaS companies achieving very large exits. And though their customers bases will suffer the same leaky bucket economics as Intuit, the customer acquisition strategies afforded to and created by these startups will trump those challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introducing Next Big Thing (nbt.fm); A Reddit/Hacker News For Music</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The general rule of thumb is that if a product or service doesn&amp;#39;t exist, create it. I was looking for a good hub of music news, articles, and rising artists and never really found it. Sure, Reddit has a music section, and you could follow individual sources on Twitter to get a similar experience, but a dedicated hub of diverse music related content was missing. Now &lt;a href="http://nbt.fm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Big Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the technical help of Jared Moody, the foundation for user submitted links to be voted into popularity is now in place. This isn&amp;#39;t revolutionary, if you&amp;#39;ve used any service since ~2005 when Digg was king, this won&amp;#39;t blow your mind, but the aim is for functionality right now. Elegance is important, but only after you have something worth making pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tracking down new music and sharing interesting industry stories with people, but sometimes I don&amp;#39;t have the time to keep on top of everything and suspect you might feel the same. Next Big Thing tackles the issue and quickly provides the top items people think are worth talking about, while also providing more content to those with plenty of time to sift. The site also highlights links directly to songs on services like Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, Youtube, and more. The songs can be voted on and sorted newest to most popular as well. The aim of this is to promote discovery among those seeking new and soon to be popular music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of something exciting. Please join, submit, vote, or just browse, but this type of resource needs people contributing to make it the most useful for everyone. Keep in mind that it is just the start, rough edges will be smoothed in time and features will be added. If you&amp;#39;re so inclined please send feedback or suggestions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My new favorite foreign place on Earth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next to San Francisco, because everything is next to San Francisco, Tokyo is now officially my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;#39;ve only been here for five days so far, but I&amp;#39;ve never been so sold on a place so quickly. Decided fairly unequivocally that I was in love with this place on the train ride to our apartment from the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is coming in without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much prior bias. All of my friends who have been to Japan without exception are direly in love with the country, but I&amp;#39;ve never had any particular desire to come here. The only reason I&amp;#39;m here is literally because a friend of a friend tweeted about a RT ticket being $314 from LAX to NRT. Managed to snag RT tickets from SFO to NRT for $345 everything included, so just jumped on it on a whim last July. Literally no prior planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s to like about Tokyo/Japan? Some of it&amp;#39;s personal, some of it&amp;#39;s just objectively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s high tech and cutting edge. As a whole, there seems to be very little resistance to embracing the new as it emerges and in numerous cases even envisioning that new and causing it to come to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an incredibly pervasive sense of respect. I&amp;#39;m normally an incredibly irreverent person and have been in every other country/locale I&amp;#39;ve ever been to, but here, everyone is &lt;em&gt;just so good&lt;/em&gt; that I can&amp;#39;t help but feel compelled to be good as well. The streets are so spotless that when I see a stray can strewn on the sidewalk I&amp;#39;m obliged to pick it up and walk several hundred meters to a trash can. I have to walk several hundred meters to a trash can because trash cans are pretty much nonexistent - everyone is required to recycle by law and everything is partitioned by category and the waste profile is shockingly small in contrast with America. This pleases me greatly particularly because I just watched &lt;a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozBE-ZPw18c"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone goes out of their way to help everyone else. For the first time ever I feel like there&amp;#39;s a great duty upon me to uphold the common moral code - not out of respect necessarily for the moral code, but out of the sheer desire to uphold and not lay ruin to the ineffable sense of communal aim towards the common good omnipresent in every square centimeter of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, there&amp;#39;s a great sense of mutual respect among all here as well as a remarkably strong culture of innovation and embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, this place is the definition of heaven for a pescetarian. Seafood is cheap and plentiful and literally, &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; anything you could ever want from the sea is available here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only discovered one downside to Japan my entire stay here, and that&amp;#39;s that fruit is inordinately expensive since Japan is, unfortunately (or fortunately, since it may have contributed to their rapid speciation in a glorious new direction from the rest of the world), an island. But even this has a redeeming quality - fruit juice is remarkably affordable and cheap. I&amp;#39;m assuming this is because concentrate is extremely inexpensive to transport even to an island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, no real downside to Tokyo discovered yet. Upside: everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;
