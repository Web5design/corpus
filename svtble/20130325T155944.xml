    <title>The Leaky Bucket Myth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg" alt="bucket.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any time in the past ten years, you might have asked someone at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AINTU&amp;amp;ei=Ol5QUcDVIoGmiQLqmwE"&gt;Intuit&lt;/a&gt; about the size of the QuickBooks user base, they would have told you the same number: about 4M. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure hasn&amp;#39;t grown because Intuit&amp;#39;s customer base, the small-and-medium business market, is a leaky bucket. &lt;a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqIndexAll.cfm?areaid=24"&gt;On the small end of the spectrum, about 750,000 businesses are created each year and about the same number fail.&lt;/a&gt; On the upper end of the spectrum, successful medium sized businesses (and the larger, more valuable Quickbooks customers) outgrow Intuit&amp;#39;s products and upgrade to enterprise accounting packages provided by Oracle and others of their ilk. It&amp;#39;s no surprise then that QuickBooks suffers from high churn rates, characteristic of the SMB market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaky bucket market dynamic can be quite unattractive if customers must be acquired through paid customer acquisition. SMBs are notoriously expensive to acquire. Combined with high churn rates, we have a recipe for burning through mounds of cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those concerns, it&amp;#39;s difficult to argue with Intuit&amp;#39;s success. It&amp;#39;s nearly a $20B market cap company generating $4.2B annually in revenue of which 17% or $700M+ is derived from this leaky bucket SMB segment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did Intuit build a business of such scale atop a customer segment that looks like quicksand? They don&amp;#39;t pay to acquire customers. Intuit used word of mouth, brand strength and an existing product (Quicken) to bootstrap QuickBooks to success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it&amp;#39;s easier than ever for startups to target the SMB market successfully. Freemium businesses of scale are feasible because mobile application distribution, web distribution (SEO, social media) and app stores like Intuit or Salesforce or Google amass millions of SMB owners who can be reached at zero marginal cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But very few startups and investors pursue the market even today despite these fundamental changes in the market. Part of the challenge is maintaining the discipline to minimize customer acquisition spend, instead focusing on &lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/branding"&gt;brand building&lt;/a&gt;, word of mouth marketing, product excellence and so on. In other words, patience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, I think we will see a segment of SMB SaaS companies achieving very large exits. And though their customers bases will suffer the same leaky bucket economics as Intuit, the customer acquisition strategies afforded to and created by these startups will trump those challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introducing Next Big Thing (nbt.fm); A Reddit/Hacker News For Music</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The general rule of thumb is that if a product or service doesn&amp;#39;t exist, create it. I was looking for a good hub of music news, articles, and rising artists and never really found it. Sure, Reddit has a music section, and you could follow individual sources on Twitter to get a similar experience, but a dedicated hub of diverse music related content was missing. Now &lt;a href="http://nbt.fm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Big Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the technical help of Jared Moody, the foundation for user submitted links to be voted into popularity is now in place. This isn&amp;#39;t revolutionary, if you&amp;#39;ve used any service since ~2005 when Digg was king, this won&amp;#39;t blow your mind, but the aim is for functionality right now. Elegance is important, but only after you have something worth making pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tracking down new music and sharing interesting industry stories with people, but sometimes I don&amp;#39;t have the time to keep on top of everything and suspect you might feel the same. Next Big Thing tackles the issue and quickly provides the top items people think are worth talking about, while also providing more content to those with plenty of time to sift. The site also highlights links directly to songs on services like Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, Youtube, and more. The songs can be voted on and sorted newest to most popular as well. The aim of this is to promote discovery among those seeking new and soon to be popular music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of something exciting. Please join, submit, vote, or just browse, but this type of resource needs people contributing to make it the most useful for everyone. Keep in mind that it is just the start, rough edges will be smoothed in time and features will be added. If you&amp;#39;re so inclined please send feedback or suggestions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:%20info@nbt.fm"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My new favorite foreign place on Earth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next to San Francisco, because everything is next to San Francisco, Tokyo is now officially my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;#39;ve only been here for five days so far, but I&amp;#39;ve never been so sold on a place so quickly. Decided fairly unequivocally that I was in love with this place on the train ride to our apartment from the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is coming in without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much prior bias. All of my friends who have been to Japan without exception are direly in love with the country, but I&amp;#39;ve never had any particular desire to come here. The only reason I&amp;#39;m here is literally because a friend of a friend tweeted about a RT ticket being $314 from LAX to NRT. Managed to snag RT tickets from SFO to NRT for $345 everything included, so just jumped on it on a whim last July. Literally no prior planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s to like about Tokyo/Japan? Some of it&amp;#39;s personal, some of it&amp;#39;s just objectively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s high tech and cutting edge. As a whole, there seems to be very little resistance to embracing the new as it emerges and in numerous cases even envisioning that new and causing it to come to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an incredibly pervasive sense of respect. I&amp;#39;m normally an incredibly irreverent person and have been in every other country/locale I&amp;#39;ve ever been to, but here, everyone is &lt;em&gt;just so good&lt;/em&gt; that I can&amp;#39;t help but feel compelled to be good as well. The streets are so spotless that when I see a stray can strewn on the sidewalk I&amp;#39;m obliged to pick it up and walk several hundred meters to a trash can. I have to walk several hundred meters to a trash can because trash cans are pretty much nonexistent - everyone is required to recycle by law and everything is partitioned by category and the waste profile is shockingly small in contrast with America. This pleases me greatly particularly because I just watched &lt;a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozBE-ZPw18c"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone goes out of their way to help everyone else. For the first time ever I feel like there&amp;#39;s a great duty upon me to uphold the common moral code - not out of respect necessarily for the moral code, but out of the sheer desire to uphold and not lay ruin to the ineffable sense of communal aim towards the common good omnipresent in every square centimeter of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, there&amp;#39;s a great sense of mutual respect among all here as well as a remarkably strong culture of innovation and embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, this place is the definition of heaven for a pescetarian. Seafood is cheap and plentiful and literally, &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; anything you could ever want from the sea is available here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only discovered one downside to Japan my entire stay here, and that&amp;#39;s that fruit is inordinately expensive since Japan is, unfortunately (or fortunately, since it may have contributed to their rapid speciation in a glorious new direction from the rest of the world), an island. But even this has a redeeming quality - fruit juice is remarkably affordable and cheap. I&amp;#39;m assuming this is because concentrate is extremely inexpensive to transport even to an island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, no real downside to Tokyo discovered yet. Upside: everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Competitors Are Making It Easy For You</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen many &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; e-mails from (*odd?*) customers over the years, but to this day, I&amp;#39;m always most surprised when I see e-mails that includes snippets like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow! You got back to me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you for responding to my e-mail. I thought that I was just sending my e-mail into a blackhole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thanks for helping me out &amp;amp; answering all my questions. My previous experiences trying to get help from software companies have been really bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age, where every Tom, Dick &amp;amp; Harry are saying that their companies are offering their customers good service, I&amp;#39;m surprised to see customers with so many scars relating to previous experiences. I mean, I think we treat our customers well at Woo, but we&amp;#39;re in no way perfect; yet they really appreciate the experiences they have with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need to speculate on what other companies are or aren&amp;#39;t doing with regards to customer service; all I know is that there&amp;#39;s still large amounts of customers that have had exclusively bad experiences with other companies in the past and by giving them a good experience, you are being their breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the chance, stop focusing on other aspects of growing your business and just &lt;a href="http://adii.me/dont-compete-on-features"&gt;use customer service as a competitive advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Singapore's JFDI Asia puts Southeast Asia accelerators on the map</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just quickly as I&amp;#39;m packing for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonrussell/status/316008239798042626"&gt;a trip&lt;/a&gt;, but I had to share the newest stats from the new (one-year-old) &lt;a&gt;JFDI Asia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#39;Bootcamp&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/?s=jfdi+asia"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written a lot about them&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; which is now past $3 million in funding for its first batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another of its originals &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://tribehired.com"&gt;Tribhired&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/03/25/malaysian-social-recruitment-site-tribehired-raises-560000-plans-international-launch/"&gt;closed a seed round this week&lt;/a&gt;, and the impressive update below comes via JFDI Asia CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hughmason"&gt;Hugh Mason&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;#39;m working on a more comprehensive piece for TNW:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr: Seven of the 11 graduates have raised seed-stage funding, four are dead. Total investment stands at SG$3.9 million (US$3.1 million).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TribeHired&lt;/strong&gt; - Social recruitment platform for fast-growing start-ups that puts friends to work. $15k investment by JFDI.2012 Pte Ltd closed. &lt;strong&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; - $696k round led by TNF Ventures and supported by angels Ben Chew and Ben Ball closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing the situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, JFDI.Asia has taken 11 teams of entrepreneurs from idea to investment in 100 days, with greater than 60% success raising follow-on funding. This compares favourably with the 14% success rate reported for other Singapore programs. A further 9 are now in the pipeline, with 10-15 more expected to follow later in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful JFDI.Asia teams raise a median S$650,000 per team, exceeding that achieved by more established international peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent valuations prove that JFDI.Asia increases the value of startups passing through its program by 4-5X in 100 days [3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEOs of JFDI.Asia funded teams project that they will create at least 33 new jobs in Singapore by end 2013, ie an average 8 per funded team [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more proof of why Southeast Asia is &lt;a href="http://insidethenoodlebowl.com/us-investors-showing-greater-interest-in-southeast-asia"&gt;attracting interest&lt;/a&gt; from the US, Japan and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Now the regular disclaimer: Yes, there are a different set of challenges here and the startup ecosystem is still being built out, and at different levels in various markets across the region.]&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurdles</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What hurdles does a new app face? &lt;a href="http://www.moves-app.com/"&gt;Moves&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone app for tracking your steps, has been part of my life for a few weeks and I love it. Watching my usage evolve and interest in the app spread has prompted some thoughts about the hurdles a mobile app must overcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, an app has to find its way on to your phone.&lt;/strong&gt; Moves launched at the end of January and from an outsider&amp;#39;s perspective, has grown organically and consistently since. I came across the app from a tweet and every week, I see someone else talking about it.  When someone mentions Moves, you can sense a smile on their face. They are delighted by the combination of the design and experience, the encouragement of healthy behavior, and the price (free). &lt;em&gt;Side note: I&amp;#39;m skeptical of free apps with revenue-to-be-named-later and that applies in this case, too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of slow word-of-mouth is ideal, in my opinion. Many apps launch with a large coordinated push. For a day or two, it seems like everyone is talking about it. A week later, no one is. Seeing new people discover and actually use an app, and then talk about it because they love it, is much more powerful than a mad rush to be first to a new fad.  Nothing beats &amp;ldquo;I use this app and like it. You might, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone sees it that way, and of course, many apps harness that initial momentum (even if largely manufactured) and go on to great success. One way or another, an app has to stand out. It might be through App Store promotion, a marketing campaign, the pedigree of those behind it, the love of influencers, or people raving about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when a app breaks through the noise, a person has to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search for it or revisit a link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download the correct app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in many cases, sign in or create an account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a new app does make it to your phone, how likely is it to stay?&lt;/strong&gt; I installed Moves and a few days later it was on my iPhone&amp;#39;s home screen. I checked my total daily, kept my phone with me on the treadmill, told friends about it, and wondered if I&amp;#39;d hit a new daily record during SXSW (I did). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I had to replace my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A screen issue required a trip to the Apple Store. With the possibility of a replacement in mind, I backed up my phone before I left. Sure enough, the screen wasn&amp;#39;t repairable and I left with a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I restored from the backup later that day, I noticed that some apps were missing. I actually didn&amp;#39;t know which ones, but just sensed gaps on a few screens. Apparently backing up your iPhone does not save apps that aren&amp;#39;t in iTunes (that&amp;#39;s my theory, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I realized that Moves was missing and installed it again. When I opened it, the data I had collected was gone, no epic days downtown and no lazy Sundays. After a few days, I checked to see the fresh data I had collected, but each day showed zero steps. Something wasn&amp;#39;t working correctly. I reset everything and now, things are working smoothly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, none of those hurdles were the fault of Moves. In fact, I gladly take the blame for them. These scenarios are not uncommon, though. Even a great app like Moves, an app that is basically doing everything right, faces these hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notice an app was missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the time to search for it and download it again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue using it if previous data, scores, achievements were missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue using it if it didn&amp;#39;t work initially?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the app is considered essential (part of the mail, messages, lists, and calendar flow, tied to friends or family, an addictive game or service) we&amp;#39;ll jump through many hoops, but that is the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t a formula for success here, unless you include temporary shortcuts like paying for installs or viral loop tricks (the &amp;ldquo;Invite All&amp;rdquo; button is awfully close to the &amp;ldquo;Invite&amp;rdquo; button, isn&amp;#39;t it?). At the most basic level, the quality of the app and the size of your existing audience are the two biggest factors in determining success, but thousands of companies and developers are tying to solve these problems every day and great apps don&amp;#39;t always succeed. My experience using Moves and working on other mobile apps has reminded me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciate the challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t always appreciate how difficult it is to create a successful app. Be reasonable in your expectations, supportive of your fellow developers, and humble if your talent and good fortune deliver a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus a lot of removing hurdles that keep someone from installing and starting to use an app, but much less on those that cause a current user to drift away. We&amp;#39;re often casual about things like requiring users to sign in again after an app update. Yes, it&amp;#39;s unavoidable sometimes, but know that a single new hurdle can leave some of your users behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create something inspired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an app solves a problem in a unique way, reflects passion and care, or is simply inspired, it&amp;#39;s obviously easier to gain and keep someone&amp;#39;s attention. A new app should matter. It should have a core reason for existing, beyond &amp;ldquo;to make money&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gain a lot of users&amp;rdquo;. People can tell if the creators believe in what they&amp;#39;ve built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form a relationship beyond the app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let the app be the only relationship you have with a user. That tenuous connection can be broken through something as small as lost credentials that require logging in again, a bug in the latest update, a new phone, or a fresh install. If someone is connected to the company behind an app, they are more likely to reach out for support, forgive a misstep, provide helpful feedback, or try the next, new thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they reach a hurdle, they&amp;#39;ll ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bands Don't Die</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bands don&amp;#39;t die anymore, they just break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even just a few years ago, news of your favorite band&amp;#39;s demise could have sent you into a whirlwind of endless repeat of track 2, but now, not so much. Whether through wall posts, blog updates or just 140 characters at a time, bands keep marching on long after the music stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of examples of bands living on long after they&amp;#39;ve set their instruments down, but why? Because it&amp;#39;s hard to let go of 20,000+ followers, or even just 1000 followers. What if the band decides to pull a Brett Favre and come back from retirement time and time again? What if individual members want to explore new options? This &amp;ldquo;social media&amp;rdquo; time we currently find ourselves in demands that no matter how many followers, or how you got them, you don&amp;#39;t let them go. Keeping a band&amp;#39;s social media going could once have been seen as an altruistic thing, letting fans know of any lingering news or merch updates. But with the rise of a Kickstarter generation, successes are built on the backs not of a few people, but thousands. Reissued vinyls don&amp;#39;t press themselves and reunion tours still need someone to plan them so keeping as many fans and followers within a few keystrokes as you can is more of a necessity than an egotistical move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether musicians use the words &amp;ldquo;indefinite hiatus&amp;rdquo; or just call it quits, you can be pretty sure that those updates will still be coming in. Slower of course, but still there to remind you of when the music played on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It's a power struggle.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many of you have heard about the Python dev conference tweeting fiasco. In case you haven&amp;#39;t, what happened was that a few developers were inappropriately joking about dongles and made a woman sitting in the row in front of them uncomfortable. She decided to snap a photo of them and tweet about their indiscretion to her 10k+ followers on Twitter. This led to all parties being fired, including the female involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most women working in Silicon Valley, this is nothing new. Men can sometimes be inappropriate, and some may even call it a bit of a &amp;#39;nerd fraternity&amp;#39; or boys club. I&amp;#39;ll admit, it&amp;#39;s hard to get use to even if you&amp;#39;ve been working in the valley your whole life like me. But in order to be a successful woman in the tech community you have to learn how to handle these uncomfortable scenarios professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that this woman felt powerless in the situation given that she was predominately surrounded by men (let&amp;#39;s face it, it&amp;#39;s a PYTHON conference). Overhearing a group of men behind her make inappropriate sexual jokes pushed her over the edge. There aren&amp;#39;t many women (myself included) that would feel comfortable in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the woman in question,  she ended up going overboard by  ultimately robbing these men of their power. Instead of tweeting their photo to twitter,  it might have been better to be direct and tell them to shut up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 lesson for women to take away from this unfortunate scenario is to be direct. When we feel uncomfortable because someone is saying something insulting, we simply say so in a polite, professional manner. By doing so, we create clear boundaries for what is appropriate and what isn&amp;#39;t. These situations are opportunities for educating others on becoming more self aware in social situations. It&amp;#39;s in the best interest of everyone involved and it&amp;#39;s our job as women to drive this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 outcome that I hope will come from this is an improvement in hiring strategy and employee training. Companies need to understand that their brand as a whole is defined by the reputation of their employees. There is a strong need to teach proper social skills and social awareness so we can create a more cohesive culture where men and women feel comfortable working together. While many men in Silicon Valley are extremely talented and have a high IQ, we&amp;#39;re seeing the increasing importance and value of a high emotional intelligence or EQ. If companies start to focus on EQ, I think we&amp;#39;ll see more inviting culture and ultimately be successful at building more successful products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use to do a lot of social advising for YCombinator founders and other engineers and I&amp;#39;m more than happy to do my part and help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The World of Hands-On Journalism, or How You Can Save Fido from Certain Death</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;#39;ve already been featured in top media outlets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the famous last words I received in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it&amp;#39;s like telling a police officer you&amp;#39;ve already received enough speeding tickets. Or, explaining to your doctor you&amp;#39;ve already performed surgery on yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it&amp;#39;s not the most effective way to deal with the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a short phrase we like to use which is sort of a secret handshake in the field of journalism: the hands-on test. I might say hands-on when I need to see the thing in person. You make a widget, and I need to see if the widget does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do. There&amp;#39;s a check and balance at play here. (Eventually, there&amp;#39;s also a check.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As journalists, we&amp;#39;re often paid to find out, on behalf of a customer, if something really works. We&amp;#39;re sort of a silent oracle, the space between two realities. (Some of us take up a bigger space than others.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;#39;ve invented a dog collar that connects to a transmitter in your kitchen. You say little Fido won&amp;#39;t run beyond a certain distance. I want to believe you, I really do. Something deep inside of me yearns to trust complete strangers by e-mail. And, I&amp;#39;m not so attached to my FedEx driver that I need to see her everyday, unless the delivery involves chocolate or coffee. In a few cases, a box cutter has turned on me, which is one of the few work injuries in my field that makes me nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, in almost every instance, we have to see the thing. We have to flip open the cover and look inside. We have to see the innards. Once we strap on the collar to little Fido and send him on his merry way and see that he will not be run over by a train or a food cart because of your app, we will be more than happy to write some glowing and solicitous prose about it. We&amp;#39;ll be earnest. But looking at a picture and some text on the Web does not help. Fido deserves a lot better than that, doesn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 12 years as a writer, I&amp;#39;ve seen quite a few interesting reactions to my product requests. Of course, it all starts with the Apple response: no. Then there&amp;#39;s the Microsoft response, which adds some flair: unfortunately, no. Or, there&amp;#39;s the response I half expect these days: the product is not available for testing yet. And, I get that. These things take time. Greatness is not easy. Still, I get a little confused (and constipated!) when I find out 400 other journalists have posted reviews about the product already. But maybe they are in a different epoch of time? Maybe there&amp;#39;s an alternate universe where the product is in wonderful abundance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of these requests, we&amp;#39;re just doing our job. We&amp;#39;re being oracles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell you one of my favorite stories, which is almost completely true. There was a mystery tablet from a major tech company once. (I won&amp;#39;t give you any specifics about it other than to say the letters of this company start with H and P.) Things were pretty hush-hush, what with those folks at Gizmodo on the hunt for unreleased stuff. There were coded messages, whispers in dark alleys. Finally, someone admitted there was going to be a tablet, and it was going to be kind of similar to the Palm OS phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used every tactic in the book: I will sign an NDA, I promise not to tell Gizmodo, I will sign in blood and offer my life in servitude if I break my silence. None of that worked, although I think the representative from this super-secret company was intrigued by the servitude bit. Eventually, the answer was no and it was always going to be no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my editor got involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes, another e-mail arrived. &amp;ldquo;Why, we found one right under the desk here!&amp;rdquo; Apparently, everyone in the office of this mysterious company (codenamed H and P, shhh) was pleasantly surprised when they found it hiding under that desk. They all smiled and laughed. &amp;ldquo;We will get this packaged up for ya right away and ship that off pronto!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I felt a little conned, specifically by the &amp;ldquo;hey we found one right here under the desk&amp;rdquo; trick. Part of me knows they were probably in short supply. But, part of me also thinks there are those who work in shipping departments who are standing right in front of 14 product boxes typing a message on an iPad that says they don&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this all leads me to the most flummoxing response of all: we already have enough coverage. Isn&amp;#39;t that like saying we already have enough money? Or we already have enough precious jewels? Or we already have enough gold bars? Or maybe &amp;ndash; we already have enough endorsements by famous supermodels? Oh, we would be interested in that coverage but we already have like a billion dollars because of the Gizmodo write-up. We can&amp;#39;t take any more money because our bank is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m probably missing something here. I know that selling too many products can be a problem. Which, thankfully, is one of the few things that BlackBerry doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about. But isn&amp;#39;t all press coverage good press coverage? Putting this stuff into the hands of a journalist is a good thing, depending on the cleanliness of the journalist? I&amp;#39;m not saying just mail stuff out willy-nilly to anyone who has a WordPress account. That would not be wise, and would also involve the phrase willy-nilly (lame!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is never really enough major media coverage. There&amp;#39;s Apple and there is everyone else. (Lately, even Apple has been happy for the coverage.) At the end of the day, this is just a happy exchange of goods and services. Some guy in Minnesota tests your stuff. It&amp;#39;s not that complicated. The customer is the ultimate winner. And, poor little Fido.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobile Productivity for Normal People</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24551355774384_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24551355774384_raw.jpg" alt="google-now-landing_616.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, there has been a new refrain among consumer mobile startups that I&amp;#39;ve met with: we&amp;#39;re designing for normal people or &lt;a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/"&gt;normals as Chris Dixon would put it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this trend. First, there is a movement towards great design. Second, there is a wave to reinvent and reimagine core applications of the mobile phones. The apps shipped with the standard OS were ports of their desktop counterparts. Only now, after using these cloned applications for a while, do we understand how email, phone, calendar, etc should evolve. Third, &lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/machine-learning-in-consumer-products"&gt;machine learning technologies make magical experiences possible like priority inbox or Google Now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, developing a product for a different segment demands a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, alternate customer acquisition techniques are required. Unlike productivity nuts whose unrelenting persistence of even minor time savings drives product experimentation and usage, normals discover products by chance or through word of mouth. Large scale distribution deals like carrier bundling, embedding in the operating system and mass media channels seem to me to be much more effective for reaching this audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the value proposition must be clear, simple and immediate. Normals have far less patience. In other words, this user segment demands better designed applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, the user feedback from productivity nuts and normals will vary dramatically. The first will demand ever more sophisticated features and integrations while the second will oppose functionality in pursuit of simplicity. Picking anything in between will develop a product that fails to meet either need well. Product must clearly prioritize one&amp;#39;s segments needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for startups targeting normals is massive. But approaching the market requires a new mindset, different product prioritization and alternate marketing tactics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what other ways must startups serving normals evolve? &lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/mobile-productivity-for-normal-people/invite_link/DUK9SOfmKbMhSA"&gt;Join us on this Branch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10th Anniversary of Copeland's 'Beneath Medicine Tree'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tylerhayes_24529652319834_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tylerhayes_24529652319834_raw.jpg" alt="copelandbmtuq9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people&amp;#39;s first taste of Copeland came with &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39;s single, &amp;ldquo;Downtown.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;#39;s a song about young love with a punchy chorus that can be hard to forget. A perfect choice of song to introduce the band in 2003 when it was still a time of loud and fast guitars, pounding drums, generally ruled by pop/punk. &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; was different, opening with the soft and delicate song, &amp;ldquo;Brightest.&amp;rdquo; For a lot of kids, this was something they hadn&amp;#39;t really been exposed to before, unsure if they loved or hated it. It&amp;#39;s possible the album came out just as musical tides were shifting, or maybe it was &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; that &amp;ndash; even slightly &amp;ndash; caused a shift in musical influence for a generation of then high school and college kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a raw and innocent aspect to the songs on &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; that only a debut album can produce. Jimmy Eat World&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Clarity&amp;#39; is another album with a similar spark and likeness that just drips magic. The impact of &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; is hard to explain, but it sweeps you up and even though it&amp;#39;s not perfect, there aren&amp;#39;t any faults to be found. Lead singer, Aaron Marsh mentioned that Beneath Medicine Tree was an album he wanted to move people, 10 years later it still can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious from the album&amp;#39;s title, there&amp;#39;s an inherent sadness present throughout the songs, though nothing quite like &amp;#39;Eat, Sleep, Repeat&amp;#39; which is the band&amp;#39;s 3rd release. &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; was not a depressing sadness, but one of mourning wrapped in hope, surrounded by songs of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Goldman, the record&amp;#39;s engineer, mentioned that &amp;ldquo;Love Is A Fast Song&amp;rdquo;, which appears on Copeland&amp;#39;s second album, &amp;#39;In Motion&amp;#39;, was originally the title track song for &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39;. Scraped at the time because the song just wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough and ready, it became one of the stand out songs on their sophomore release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Copeland, as the band was taking their final lap around the country, you could tell from the farewell tour that they were burnt out. Even though the band&amp;#39;s final album, &amp;#39;You Are My Sunshine&amp;#39;, was a refreshing release, it still didn&amp;#39;t have the enthusiasm and emotional spark that &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; did. The type of spark that usually only comes around once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the jazzy beat of &amp;ldquo;Coffee,&amp;rdquo; to the hypnotic ending of &amp;ldquo;When Finally Set Free&amp;rdquo; or the slow burn of &amp;ldquo;California,&amp;rdquo; the album truly is a classic.  And 10 years later it&amp;#39;s as strong as it was the day it came out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hiring Goes Both Ways</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;#39;ve been involved in hiring 30+ team members to WooThemes, of which 24 remains on the team today. If I had to distill all of that experience into one piece advice it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring someone that you really want to join your team, it&amp;#39;s critical that the individual wants to join the team as badly as you want them to join.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife always tells me that her dad used to &lt;em&gt;warn&lt;/em&gt; her about potential boyfriends when she was younger. He would always say: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never chase after a boy or a bus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This resonates with my experiences of growing our team; when I&amp;#39;ve aggressively chased a hire and compromised on what exactly I wanted (i.e. salary, exact job description, benefits, etc.), it generally meant that our relationship started on the wrong foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we&amp;#39;ve had most success hiring the individuals that would do everything in their power to be part of our team. On paper, these individuals probably won&amp;#39;t be considered the best candidate, but in practice - due to their passion for our company, our team and our customers - they&amp;#39;ve exceeded all of our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This also reminds me of how important hiring according to company culture is. I love &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love"&gt;Dharmesh Shah&amp;#39;s words&lt;/a&gt; in this regards: &amp;ldquo;Culture is to recruiting what marketing is to product.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CNN says it doesn't support rapists, evidence says otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apparently CNN is &lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/column-post/cnn-soft-rapists-steubenville-coverage-sparks-debate-81861?page=0,0"&gt;denying any slant toward the rapists&lt;/a&gt; in its coverage of the Steubenville, Ohio rape trial, and the reporter involved is offended anyone would think she supports rapists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough&amp;mdash;I seriously doubt she does support rapists, and I doubt that she thinks rape is a good thing. But it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that within a minute of appearing on camera, she talks about how emotional it was to watch two boys believe they were watching their lives crumble before their eyes. Let&amp;#39;s go to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=MvUdyNko8LQ#t=76s"&gt;video tape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MvUdyNko8LQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;(Start at 1:15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure it was a very emotional moment, and there is some journalistic value in describing the defendants&amp;#39; reactions. But, as I &lt;a href="http://blog.jamietie.com/media-rape-culture-victim-blaming-and-stuebenville"&gt;pointed out before&lt;/a&gt;, this crosses that line. It makes her appear to be much more concerned with the impact of a rape on the men who committed it than on the young woman who was raped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed, she highlights the pat, almost rote apology from Trent Mays (who apologized for taking and sending nude pictures of the young woman, not for raping her). CNN also showed Ma&amp;#39;Lik Richardson breaking down in the courtroom. Perhaps he is truly sorry. But being sorry doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that he raped someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, by emphasizing that the parties where Mays and Richardson raped the young woman were fueled by alcohol, she brings in one of the oldest  ways to blame the victim&amp;mdash;if she hadn&amp;#39;t been drinking none of this would have happened. In fact, alcohol is used both to blame the victim &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; excuse the behavior of the rapists&amp;mdash;they were drunk, as well. It&amp;#39;s a pretty tidy example of the double standard: She&amp;#39;s less sympathetic because she was drunk, but the rapists are more sympathetic because they were out of control and did something they might not have done while sober. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t wash. What happened was rape. Full stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN would be wise to actually read the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/cnn-apologize-on-air-for-sympathizing-with-the-steubenville-rapists"&gt;Change.Org petition&lt;/a&gt;, understand what they did wrong, and work toward being more supportive of victims and less supportive of rapists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Jonah Peretti Taught Me About Journalism:
Make it Emotional, Social, Shareable</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of my trip to SXSW, the music, film and interactive festival in Austin that ended last week, was hearing Jonah Peretti, founder of Buzzfeed, speak  Buzzfeed,although still a startup, gets 40 million unique visitors a month, 40% per cent of whom read it on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Peretti, who also co-founded Huffington Post, a great journalist? Nope. He&amp;#39;s a guy who. while a grad student at MIT Media Lab, experimented with how to make things go viral. Read his Wikipedia page; it’s hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His key target audience? The &amp;ldquo;bored at work&amp;rdquo; network. The bored at work network is made up of people who have to spend all day at a desk on a computer, but who aren&amp;#39;t necessarily working all the time. These people use their mental breaks to shop online, and also to share content. If Buzzfeed puts out some content that interests them &amp;ndash; say, a cat photo or a diet that gets you into a bikini in 24 hours &amp;ndash; this network will share it because they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of the smart phone, a second, even larger network emerged:  the bored in line network. 
Mobile used to be where viral died, but now its where viral lives. Even reporters are part of the bored at work network, often scanning online for story ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From his youthful experiments, Peretti concluded that if you want something to be seen by a large audience, half the time should be spent on the idea, and the other half on how to spread it. If content is attractive to people on social networks, it can get as much as 34x the traffic as it gets on the original site. So Buzzfeed went to the market with social and shareable content, becoming quickly known for its quirky cat videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howeve, that wasn’t Peretti’s total intent. He wanted to have a place for long form serious journalism that was equally sharable, so he hired Ben Smith, the highly respected reporter from Politico, to be his political editor. Smith broke the story of Romney’s running mate, and now Buzzfeed has lots of serious journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of news is good for social sharing? Scoops are good (everyone wants to be the first to know). So is any story that’s a matrix of fact and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good sites should be like a Paris cafe: philosophy and politics are vociferously discussed, but dogs are allowed, and discussions stop to pet the dog. That’s why you like your Facebook news feed; it’s a combination of inspirational quotations, family news, and fascinating photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only certain topics, however, lend themselves to sharing. To make you share something, you have to identify with it in some emotional way. Nostalgia is social. Breaking news about things like the Jody Arias trial or a tsunami are social. Humor is inherently social, as are cute animals. Buzzfeed did a promotional campaign with Toyotus Prius called “25 Hybrid Animals You will Love.” It got millions of shares and views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, people, is the future of journalism: emotional, sharable, and social. Get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Writing Online</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It now seems foreign to consider writing in a full fledged word processor, only to copy it over to a CMS, then publish it online. There was a time when writing your blog post in Wordpress or another online editor just wasn&amp;#39;t acceptable, but that&amp;#39;s no longer the case. If you&amp;#39;re writing for the web, there&amp;#39;s a good chance that you&amp;#39;re also writing on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing online is currently a blossoming space. The seed was planted, it grew, and finally it&amp;#39;s beginning to show some beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a subtle, but important, uprising happening both in the way people write online and why people write online. Services are coming of age, questioning their roots and beginning to shed the past in favor of a new level of experience. Money and success are also no longer results, but prerequisites to typing this connected content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; was only the spark, the catalyst, that put a vision is the minds of those with creative tendencies, blogging was accessibility, not the revolution. The revolution hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals are finally coming together to out publish traditional publishers. As evident by &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://svbtle.com/magazine"&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt;, and the iOS app &lt;a href="http://the-magazine.org"&gt;The Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Simplicity, beauty, and beyond all, compelling content is starting to transition power from a few groomed individuals, to those with passion and endurance. Wordpress has users that are keeping their software in business, but they haven&amp;#39;t converted those users into paid contributors for a single source, aiming to produce high quality content coming at you from every angle that you can think. They should, or they&amp;#39;re going to get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music discovery &amp;ndash; I believe &amp;ndash; needs to be curated by both machines and humans and writing is the same way. The machines sort, organize, and manipulate the data, while humans provide the answer to &amp;ldquo;Is this good?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year from now the world of online publishing is going to look a lot different , and very few see it coming.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I Can't Sing</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t code. I can&amp;#39;t design. I can&amp;#39;t dance. I can&amp;#39;t get in shape. I can&amp;#39;t draw. I can&amp;#39;t give speeches. I can&amp;#39;t write. I can&amp;#39;t invent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 15 I had a friend named Patrick. We met in driver&amp;#39;s ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you looked at him, you&amp;#39;d probably expect to find him in a moshpit, or playing insanely loud punk music. You&amp;#39;d be right. But the guy had the voice of an angel and sang in his high school choir. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, Collin and I pick him up from choir practice. 
Collin was our 16 year old friend who we often made drive us around. Poor Collin :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were driving to who knows where (some cafe to play chess and drink coffee or to Taco Bell) a song came on the radio that I liked. And I sang it a little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That weird looking, punk rock, 15 year old kid gave me some advice that has helped shape every single thing I&amp;#39;ve accomplished since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He warned me that, as I sang, I was trying to imitate the musician on the radio, and I wasn&amp;#39;t doing a very good job of it. My voice just couldn&amp;#39;t do what we were listening to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I should try to cover the same song but do it in a way that suited my voice. My voice isn&amp;#39;t very strong at those high notes. If I was going to imitate anyone, try to imitate someone&amp;#39;s voice that works at this low pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried Patrick&amp;#39;s advice, and I sang the song at a considerably lower pitch that was comfortable to me. I remember it sounded now more like Johnny Cash. The result was surprising. It wasn&amp;#39;t half bad, and it was much better than me trying to sing like that guy on the radio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt like a &amp;ldquo;web designer&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;#39;ve been building websites for 15 years, and I&amp;#39;ve done what I&amp;#39;ve needed to do, but I could never get my stuff to look even close to those beautiful creations I admire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get past that, I&amp;#39;d end up buying some template somone else made. Or finding really good business partners who could design all the things I couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 12 months, however, running my third software company, I found myself alone trying to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have a partner, or a designer or anyone else to help me. And I didn&amp;#39;t have any money to buy the help. A template wasn&amp;#39;t going to cut it this time. I was in a bind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a Dribbble account full of my work. I don&amp;#39;t have a portfolio. I don&amp;#39;t know what awards designers win. I hear there are awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had to figure out what I can design. I had to figure out a way to design that suits me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I can&amp;#39;t do a lot with color, or illustrations, or shadows, or logos, I&amp;#39;d have to go with very little of those things. It would have to be the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still looked at people doing amazing work online for inspiration. But instead of trying to step into the shoes of my preconceived notion of a designer, I started noticing elements of projects that I could actually do myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t create an identity or logo like Aaron Draplin, but I sure could use Futura Bold and add a little space between the letters like he seems to be doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up with what you see at &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt;, software I&amp;#39;ve made to help me &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;write better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has no logo. It has zero images. There&amp;#39;s one color on the homepage. Blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank god or luck or hard work or whatever, I have stumbled on a large number of people that appreciate and love the user experience and user interface I&amp;#39;ve created. I&amp;#39;ve worked my ass off to accomplish this project. But I didn&amp;#39;t expect this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are blemishes that you might see (and even more that I do). Mountains and mountains of things I need to improve and polish. And I&amp;#39;ll never think it&amp;#39;s as good as anything from my heros who I immediately think of when someone says: designer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, along the way of getting here, I have figured out a way to design. I found some way to sing this song but with a voice that suits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not be able to sing like your preconceived model of how a singer sings, but I&amp;#39;ll never understand when someone tells me, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;#39;t sing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you probably didn&amp;#39;t have a friend like Patrick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;It would be awesome to meet you on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Abandoning RubyGems</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vagrant 1.1+ no longer supports &lt;a href="http://rubygems.org/"&gt;RubyGems&lt;/a&gt; as an installation method. Instead, you must install Vagrant 1.1+ using &lt;a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com"&gt;pre-made packages or installers&lt;/a&gt;. For folks used to the gem-based installation, this has caused a mixture of confusion and disdain. In this post, I enumerate my reasons for abandoning RubyGems, and why it is better for the Vagrant community long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially released Vagrant as a RubyGem over 3 years ago. Vagrant is written in Ruby, and at the time I was already comfortable with making RubyGems, so I decided it was a natural distribution mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t regret this decision for a moment. The Ruby community is very open to cutting edge technologies, and I think that distributing as a RubyGem improved my initial adoption of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, I&amp;#39;ve grown and learned that RubyGems is no longer the best choice, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#39;m going to explain why installers make life better for Vagrant users. In a future post, I&amp;#39;ll explain how installers affect plugin developers and that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Non-Rubyists&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the initial release of Vagrant in 2010, Vagrant has grown to be used by hundreds of companies and thousands of people. While I don&amp;#39;t have hard numbers to back this up, a majority of the Vagrant users I meet are not Ruby developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to making installers, the top complaint I would receive about Vagrant was about RubyGems. As a Ruby person myself, I always considered RubyGems to be simple. But for anyone outside the Ruby community, I learned that the burden of having to learn RubyGems, install Ruby, and so on was a high enough barrier to entry that many people didn&amp;#39;t even try to install Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, packages that bundle all of Vagrant&amp;#39;s dependencies (including Ruby), make installing Vagrant extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bugs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant has a lot of external dependencies: Ruby, RubyGems, OpenSSL, zlib, JSON, and more. With the RubyGems approach, users were left to manually install these dependencies, either from source or their package manager of choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this flexibility, I was unable to test Vagrant in every conceivable environment. I knew Vagrant worked on my system with my installed versions of dependencies, but didn&amp;#39;t know if it would work in every system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it was common to receive bugs where Vagrant was used with dependencies that were too old, had bugs, or were simply broken due to permission errors and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care whether this is perceived as my fault or the user&amp;#39;s fault. I don&amp;#39;t blame users for not installing proper versions, especially if they just installed what their package repository had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is a &lt;strong&gt;huge problem&lt;/strong&gt; when Vagrant crashes due to a broken environment, and then people perceive this as an instability in Vagrant itself, when 9 times out of 10, it was due to a misconfigured environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With installers, I am able to ship Vagrant with all the dependencies it needs, and promise the user that Vagrant will work with those dependencies. This is especially helpful in Windows environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I strictly control the environment, I&amp;#39;m able to improve and fine tune the dependencies Vagrant relies on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vagrant 1.1, I replaced the old, slow pure-Ruby &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29"&gt;tar&lt;/a&gt; library i was using with &lt;a href="http://www.libarchive.org/"&gt;libarchive&lt;/a&gt;, a high performance, stable, and flexible application and library written in C. libarchive is now shipped with every Vagrant installer, so users don&amp;#39;t have to install another dependency, and don&amp;#39;t really need to care Vagrant is using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vagrant 1.2, I replaced the downloader from using pure-Ruby HTTP to using &lt;a href="http://curl.haxx.se/"&gt;cURL&lt;/a&gt;. This is much faster and supports many more network protocols, such as FTP. Every installer will ship with cURL pre-installed within it. Again, users don&amp;#39;t need to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I&amp;#39;ll be replacing the pure-Ruby SSH library with a more stable, well maintained SSH library written in C. Once again, users don&amp;#39;t need to care, but they&amp;#39;ll notice that SSH becomes more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these changes, I&amp;#39;m able to make significant dependency changes without the user noticing. In fact, all the user notices is that the Vagrant experience just got a lot better. Things got faster, things don&amp;#39;t crash, and Vagrant supports more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Vagrant got a lot better because I was able to make changes I couldn&amp;#39;t safely make by distributing via RubyGems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheap Data</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to a tech talk last night called &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5760309240"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Genomics at Web Scale.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.counsyl.com/"&gt;Counsyl&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;[SV Angel is an investor in Counsyl.]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is above my pay grade to critique but here goes. There&amp;#39;s a strain of thought in computer science that &amp;ldquo;data beats algorithms.&amp;rdquo; That is, having more data is better than having a superior algorithm. For example, &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120907/more-data-beats-better-algorithms-or-does-it/?goback=%2Egde_35222_member_161040415"&gt;some contend&lt;/a&gt; that the winners of the &lt;a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/"&gt;Netflix Prize&lt;/a&gt; had a relatively simple algorithm but won because they had more data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/"&gt;Imran Haque&lt;/a&gt;, Counsyl&amp;#39;s Director of Research, tweaked this claim. He said that cheap, abundant data &lt;em&gt;leads&lt;/em&gt; algorithms. And by doing that, they can lead to technological (mainly software) breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1990&amp;#39;s, cheap text created by the Web led to better machine learning, machine translation technologies, AI technologies, PageRank and other breakthroughs. In the mid 2000&amp;#39;s, cheap image data created by cell phones, digital cameras and the like helped actualize arithmetic coding, effective computer vision and quite possibly to break throughs like self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imran said that the next breakthrough is cheap molecular data. The cost of sequencing one human genome (i.e., 6 billion bits!) cost $9MM in 2007 and $7K in 2013. These costs are &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/graphiti/427720/bases-to-bytes/"&gt;falling almost 5x faster than Moore&amp;#39;s Law since 2007.&lt;/a&gt; Because of this and advances in other fields like robotics, Imran&amp;#39;s claim is that this will be the most interesting area of computer science for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5416116"&gt;Would love any thoughts/comments here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Pycon Incident</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent some time digging into the whole Pycon Incident and found it really disturbing. I normally don&amp;#39;t talk about this kind of thing, but the way it went down really struck me. As well, I&amp;#39;m not sure I wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen as much of this, if not for some new friends and co-workers, and wanted to make sure people knew this stuff was happening in our industry. I know I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot, and much of it very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to recap the specifics. If you want those, you&amp;#39;ll need to search and keep digging. I&amp;#39;ll warn you, there is a lot of opinion and reaction you&amp;#39;ll need to sort through to understand what happened. I wish there was a good, unbiased wrap up to send you to, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find one. (Update: I found &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/society/pycon-dongle-joke-misogyny-sexism-adria-richards/"&gt;a pretty good one here&lt;/a&gt;.) I will, however, give my take having figured out a lot of the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version: Adria Richards, a developer evangelist, was sitting in a Pycon session when she overheard two guys telling a dirty joke. She snapped a photo of it and posted it on Twitter, calling them out. There was a &lt;a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2013/03/pycon-response-to-inappropriate.html"&gt;fairly calm, smart and measured reaction from the conference&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the guys was fired and a pretty massive Internet blow up over the whole thing. Most of which was direct squarely, and harshly, at Adria. (Update: turns out Adria was fired as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, I just want to make it clear that this is my take, based on what I know which might be slightly incomplete. I mean, I wasn&amp;#39;t there, etc. I&amp;#39;m also not as educated as I now know I should be on women&amp;#39;s issues in tech, not that I think you need to be to get to the bottom of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s how I see it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was it ok for these guys to have this conversation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Very debatable, but yes. It wasn&amp;#39;t a smart move to have it in a public place, and doubly so in a professional setting, but what two people talk about should be their own business most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was the joke offensive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Going to go with no, based on the definition of offense. The point being, I&amp;#39;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they didn&amp;#39;t intend any offense, with the caveat that anyone overhearing is certainly within their rights to feel uncomfortable over hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was Adria&amp;#39;s response to post their photo on Twitter appropriate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No. This was clearly not the best way to approach the situation, as I&amp;#39;m sure, in hindsight, she&amp;#39;d admit. Handling it in person, either face to face or via Pycon people, without escalating to the Internet, would have been the proper approach in my opinion. But, I don&amp;#39;t see anything horribly wrong with it either, it&amp;#39;s no worse an act than these guys telling dirty jokes in a public, professional setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should this guy have been fired?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No. Seems like a knee-jerk over-reaction to me. Having said that, I don&amp;#39;t feel too bad for him. He should have known better, and people are fired for less all the time. And his reputation? That&amp;#39;s an easy one. If this had happened to me, I&amp;#39;d have personally and publicly apologized to Adria, made it clear that while no offense was intended, I fully understand why she might have been upset, taken my lumps and moved on. People make mistakes, and this was clearly a small one followed by a bunch of over-reactions. I think smart folks recognize that.  (Update: &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681"&gt;looks like he&amp;#39;d posted an apology&lt;/a&gt; and I just hadn&amp;#39;t seen it, probably because it was buried with over-reactions and bullshit. And, in case it wasn&amp;#39;t clear, I don&amp;#39;t think he did anything actually deserving to be fired.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Should Adria have been fired?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly no. Nobody should have been fired over this. I thought maybe the guy involved might have a case, but this clearly seems like something with legal implications. I&amp;#39;m no lawyer, so I don&amp;#39;t know. Regardless, my guess is had there been no firing of anyone, this whole thing might have settled down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet&amp;#39;s response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we come to the heart of the matter, the reaction of the Internet to all of this. And, in my mind, there is no question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In no way, shape or form does Adria Richards deserve any of the poor treatment she&amp;#39;s getting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; And if you dig around, some pretty frightening stuff is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the real problem here. It&amp;#39;s not about the joke or her reaction to it. It&amp;#39;s about how many people in this industry reacted to all this, and that, in my opinion, really needs to change.  Sure, she didn&amp;#39;t react appropriately, but that doesn&amp;#39;t excuse anything, it wasn&amp;#39;t THAT much of an over-reaction and those guys should have known better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder if the gender roles were reversed here. Would this even be an issue? I mean, there are many cases of women being disparaged through photos, without any valid cause whatsoever, and while there is a bit of outrage, there is nothing remotely like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These men are being defended for making a mistake, and she&amp;#39;s being threatened and abused for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that seem backwards to you? Doesn&amp;#39;t it seem strange that the focus here is on Adria and what she did? Where are the people calling these dudes out for being stupid? Forget offensive for the moment, what they did was dumb, clearly against professional codes of conduct (and Pycon&amp;#39;s) and as such, what&amp;#39;s so wrong with her calling them out? Seriously, had this been me calling them out, would it have caused the same reaction? I highly doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got a problem here. I&amp;#39;m not sure how to solve it, but clearly this kind of thing cannot be allowed to continue. I guess the first step for me is to pay more attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update and final addendum:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s been a little less than a day since I initially wrote this and quite a few things have come to light.  I can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;d change my stance based on what I knew at the time, and honestly, had I known now what I new then, I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;d change much either. I might be a bit harder on Adria going public, as I think about that more, it was a really bad move. I guess I just started thinking about all the horrible photos out there and thought, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;#39;s the big deal, it&amp;#39;s a stupid joke and now they&amp;#39;ve been outed.&amp;rdquo; Which &lt;strong&gt;would have been the case&lt;/strong&gt; if one of them hadn&amp;#39;t have been fired. Which was, just&amp;hellip;stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that I was very nervous to post something like this on a sensitive issue. The reason I did was because I saw so much hate floating around, and here it was coming from an industry I love and I&amp;#39;m fiercely passionate about. It made me sad, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what to think. So I read and I wrote and it started to become clear.  In the end this isn&amp;#39;t about a dick joke, or an attention seeker, it&amp;#39;s about an immature industry&amp;#39;s inability to handle something like this. It&amp;#39;s about a fundamental lack of respect. And it&amp;#39;s about a world where, at any moment, we can publish whatever the hell we want to whomever we want and more often than not, don&amp;#39;t have to worry about being held accountable for it.  Many of us don&amp;#39;t choose to do so, for a variety of reasons. Many more do so responsibly, again for a variety of reasons.  Some, like Adria, publish without thinking through the consequences. Some publish hidden behind masks without fear of simple questioning, let alone consequence. They can always just fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in an always connected world. Our industry enables that, so we know how to take advantage of it. Most days this is awesome. But some days, some days it&amp;#39;s downright scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted this because I felt like I hadn&amp;#39;t seen any even-handed reaction aside from the short post from Pycon itself.  Both parties were at fault for causing it, but the over-reaction that happened, frankly, could have and should have been avoided and it&amp;#39;s a fucking shame that it wasn&amp;#39;t.  With all this power and intellect we&amp;#39;ve got, we can&amp;#39;t seem to handle something like this? Sad. I still feel this way and that was the primary point I was trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to me being nervous. I&amp;#39;m pretty far removed from this. I don&amp;#39;t hold very much emotional stake in this particular game. I could have easily ignored it, and almost did. (Or so I thought, wow, it really blew up today.)  Regardless of their opinion I have to give it up for those people who did speak out and for whom an issue like this hits close to home. For those who didn&amp;#39;t, well, I&amp;#39;ve learned why you might not want to.  Part of me feels like I should have just written this out and kept it to myself and let those who really feel this speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I&amp;#39;m reminded of how this was handled. Of the companies and the firings and the flame wars, finger pointing and threats and hate and all the other bullshit. Clearly this industry needs help. We can do better. And, fuck it, I&amp;#39;m a part of this industry too, and I&amp;#39;m here to help how I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&amp;#39;m done. Here&amp;#39;s a picture of some cuddle buddies:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the File System Wars Will Trigger a Wave of Consumer M&amp;A</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24549775061166_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24549775061166_raw.jpg" alt="Finished_Risk_Board_lrg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is &amp;ldquo;never get involved in a land war in Asia&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a land war being fought on the web and it&amp;#39;s for files and filesystems. Incumbents and startups alike are duking it out. And things are really starting to get interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startups, Dropbox and Evernote, reinvented the file system as a synchronized, cross platform file system abstracting the hardware and the data. Now they are moving up the stack. &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dropbox-acquires-mailbox-to-help-grow-the-gmail-app-for-ios-quickly/"&gt;Dropbox&amp;#39;s acquisition of Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/dropbox-for-ios-updated-with-new-photo-gallery-and-design/"&gt;renewed focus on photographs&lt;/a&gt; and attachments and Evernote&amp;#39;s every growing battery of point applications like Skitch, Food, Hello and Peek aim to drive further file creation and user engagement within their notebooks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24549784378398_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24549784378398_raw.png" alt="ScreenCapture at Thu Mar 21 07:41:23 PDT 2013.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incumbents, Microsoft and Apple, leverage their own advantages heavily.  Over the last few years, Microsoft and Apple, which own the most popular operating systems and the content creation applications, Microsoft Office and Apple iWork, have persistently revised their operating systems to unify the local and cloud filesystems (SkyDrive and iCloud). Google entered the fray seeking to displace Office with a web based document creation suite whose by-product was an online file system that evolved into Drive. &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html"&gt;Google&amp;#39;s recent Keep launch, a note taking application, is a shot across Evernote&amp;#39;s bow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the core value proposition to users has changed. The old war cry, liberation from disaster recovery and data backup duties, has been replaced by the promise of device independent, scalable, searchable filesystems that use the power of the cloud to afford new capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Google Drive, &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=2691634"&gt;searching for Eiffel Tower will return photographs from a user&amp;#39;s of the famed Parisian monument using image recognition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because end user applications and experiences differentiate these filesystems, I expect to see a flurry of acquisitions of next generation content creation tools that users love by these companies all in effort to create loyalty and build lock-in to a particular file system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These might include photo creation tools, next generation presentation tools, developer API platforms enabling programmatic access to these file systems and potentially even content stores to compete with Google Play and iTunes. After all, movies and music and books also have to be stored in a file system. It may as well be the same one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For users the promise of the cloud filesystems battle is better applications and experience. For startups, it means the beginning of the M&amp;amp;A wave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which startups do you think are most likely to be acquisition targets in the file system wars? &lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/why-the-file-system-wars-will-trigger-a-wave-of-consumer-m-a/invite_link/dldr9tZxKrMJDQ"&gt;Let me know what you think on this Branch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firing Your Customers</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll know from my writing in the past, that I&amp;#39;m a big advocate of &lt;a href="http://adii.me/make-customers-pay"&gt;making one&amp;#39;s customers pay&lt;/a&gt; (which is something I&amp;#39;ve become a little battle-hardened on over the years). I&amp;#39;m however also a firm believer in &lt;a href="http://adii.me/dont-compete-on-features"&gt;giving customers a superior experience&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; I&amp;#39;m more than happy to fight for my customers and &lt;a href="http://adii.me/dont-be-defensive-defend-your-livelihood"&gt;defend their livelihoods&lt;/a&gt; when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere within that landscape of differing views on what constitutes good customer experiences and how I / we should interact with customers, I&amp;#39;ve developed a tendency to fire customers &lt;em&gt;when the situation requires it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, I think it&amp;#39;s important to say that not all customers are created equally; in a very similar way to not all companies or products being equal either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, I don&amp;#39;t believe that the customer is always right (instead I now believe that it was a rookie error to even think like this from the beginning). I now believe that every customer interaction should be handled on the merits of that individual situation, with the underlying intention being to give every customer a fair opportunity to receive their desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also reminded of all the signs that reads &lt;strong&gt;Rights of Admission Reserved&lt;/strong&gt;, which obviously had the intention of giving the holder of those rights some mechanism to exert influence on any given situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately - as a business owner - I have the choice of doing business with whom I wantl just as a prospective customer has the option of doing business with me or not doing business with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been very active in our support helpdesk at Woo and I consistently interact with hundreds of WooThemes customers (existing &amp;amp; prospective) every week. Firing any of these customers was never something I even considered for a second (heck, &lt;a href="http://adii.me/make-customers-pay"&gt;I was even offering people free support in the past&lt;/a&gt;), but then I had a couple of really bad experiences with a handful of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s based on those experiences that I&amp;#39;ve decided that there&amp;#39;s two reasons for actually firing a customer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a customer is rude, swears at me (or anyone on my team), insults me (or anyone on my team) or irrationally calls my / our integrity into question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a customer simply isn&amp;#39;t a good fit for us. This can be due to a multitude of reasons, but it just sometimes becomes obvious sometimes that it&amp;#39;s better (for both parties) to sever the relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad customers are toxic; regardless of how many thousands of customers you have. It&amp;#39;s like having that one bad apple in the batch, which infects everything else. I&amp;#39;ve experienced first hand how a rude / irrational customer interaction can bring a whole team down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, those experiences are just as bad for customers and the outcome is similarly as bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I believe that the business-to-client relationship should be one of trust / respect and one that is mutually beneficial. As such, if this isn&amp;#39;t possible anymore, it&amp;#39;s better that there is no relationship, because a pure financial bond isn&amp;#39;t enough to keep a relationship going (*i.e. I&amp;#39;m no prostitute*).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are You Ready For De-Extinction?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/R6w0jjL.png" alt="De-Extinction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans have been &lt;a href="http://www.theadvancedapes.com/theratchet/2012/12/1/the-sixth-mass-extinction"&gt;fundamentally reshaping ecosystems and causing massive megafaunal extinction events since we emerged from East Africa ~75,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.  Over this time period iconic animals like the wooly mammoth, wooly rhinoceros, giant wombats, American horses, western camels, giant beavers, saber-toothed cats, and many other species suffered extinction.  It is estimated that the world lost at least 178 large mammals during our migratory emergence.  Ecosystems continued to collapse as we established ourselves globally and continued to extend our use (and misuse) of resources throughout the Holocene.  Today many of the animals that suffered extinction during this period (e.g, Tasmanian tiger, dodo, passenger pigeon) have become permanently associated with our species capacity to destroy ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we could undo this damage?  What if we could bring all of these species back and revive the healthy megafaunal ecosystems that existed throughout the world before our emergence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkable advances in synthetic and molecular biology within the past decade will allow us to bring back Paleolithic ecosystems.  Researchers can now take ancient DNA fragments (e.g., like preserved wooly mammoth DNA) and compare them with DNA from the extinct animals closest living relative (e.g., for the mammoth that would be the Asian elephant).  After the genetic comparisons have been made, McMaster University geneticist and biological anthropologist &lt;a href="http://www.anthropology.mcmaster.ca/faculty-1/poinarh"&gt;Hendrik Poinar&lt;/a&gt; claims the possibility of de-extinction is theoretically plausible: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can in theory use that information to modify existing chromosomes with what we imagine to be mammoth substitutions, the result would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid, and such a creature could theoretically be implanted into the womb of a mother elephant.  Get the formula right, and the offspring might be a mammoth in the eye of the beholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of these scientific possibilities, &lt;a href="http://longnow.org/revive/"&gt;The Long Now Foundation’s Revive and Restore&lt;/a&gt; program held a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7650"&gt;de-extinction conference on March 15th 2013&lt;/a&gt; supported by TED and the National Geographic Society to begin discussing these scientific and ethical issues.  The fact that science has progressed so far as to enable the possibility of de-extinction may at first seem like a compelling enough reason to do it.  After all, who wouldn’t want to see iconic ice age mammals like the saber-toothed cat and wooly mammoth?  However, we immediately run into ethical questions that prove challenging to answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biologist and de-extinction enthusiast &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_the_dawn_of_de_extinction_are_you_ready.html"&gt;Stewart Brand stated that Revive and Restore held this recent TED conference&lt;/a&gt; in order to “open the discussion to the public.”  So in this article I want to list the pros and cons of de-extinction so that everyone can make an informed decision for themselves.  Whether you are scientifically literate or not, whether you have a love of science and nature or not, de-extinction would effect everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the De-Extinction Revolution Begin!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.We have a responsibility to the biosphere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated at the start of this article, our species is largely responsible for the high extinction rates of the Middle Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic, and Holocene.  Of course, extinction is a natural process and it is a driver of biological evolution.  However, in contemporary times the extinction rate is more than 1,000 times above the “normal” estimated background extinction rate before our emergence.  This means that there is overall declining biodiversity and ecosystems are suffering as a result.  Therefore, we have a responsibility to not only reverse these trends, but also to “re-wild” what we have destroyed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Increase ecological and biological diversity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ecosystems today are unstable.  Some rainforests suffer from “empty-forest syndrome” and food chains in the oceans, seas, prairies, and mountains are collapsing as a result of extinction and climate change.  We could potentially revive and re-create vibrant ecosystems by bringing back species that used to play pivotal roles within various niches.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Iconic, Beloved, Missed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Revive and Restore home page they claim that key revival criteria is how “iconic,” “beloved,” and “missed” currently extinct species are.  This may seem like a trivial reason, but many humans love and care for nature, and would love to see Paleolithic biosphere revived and restored.  Certain animals hold cultural capital and unique places within the population imagination.  For this reason many people would argue de-extinction is intrinsically good and morally justified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Science!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding nature and the biological world is important for our own understanding of the universe and our planet.  If we started to recreate ecosystems specifically designed for currently extinct flora and fauna we would learn a great deal about how ecosystems function.  We would also learn about currently extinct animal behaviour that we cannot learn from fossils.  Selfishly, I think the evolutionary anthropologist in me would be interested in studying Paleolithic fauna because it would potentially help us better understand our own evolution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep The Past In The Past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Many Paleolithic biospheres no longer exist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a massive ecological problem with bringing back species from the Paleolithic: many of these species habitats no longer exist.  The last Ice Age ended 10,000 years ago.  This means that most of the species that suffered extinction as a result of our emergence lived in habitats and ecosystems that cannot be redesigned today.  This problem would be most pressing for Eurasian megamammals like the wooly rhinoceros and the wooly mammoth.  These species would be revived into a quickly warming world that may not be able to support them.  The consequences would likely be a quick “re-extinction.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.No country for wild carnivores&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second equally important question is whether there would be a country that would want to protect and maintain populations of vicious Ice Age carnivores like the saber-toothed cat.  Stanford University ethicist Hank Greely and de-extinction enthusiast claimed that it would be “neat to see [a saber-toothed cat].”  However, would they be destined to live their lives in zoos and labs?  Would we ever be able to establish a population in the wild?  As paleontologist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Laelaps"&gt;Brian Switek&lt;/a&gt; pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildlife experts in and around Yellowstone National Park have enough trouble trying to get the public to accept the presence of wolves – carnivores that were extirpated from the area within recent history before being reintroduced two decades ago – and conservationists continue to struggle with the persistent conflict between jaguars and ranchers in South America.  Can you imagine the uproar over sabertoothed cats being returned to the western United States or South American grasslands? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Lack of conservation funding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conservationists struggle to make progress with limited funding.  Although many international organizations have managed to stabilize many animal populations that would otherwise be de-extinction candidates today, they still have not managed to significantly reduce the background extinction rate.  If we bring back currently extinct animals that may put even more stress on underfunded conservation organizations and prevent them from allocating resources effectively.  The result could be increased extinction of currently endangered species.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Genomic engineering can serve more practical purposes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several population of megafauna today (e.g., cross-river gorilla, white rhinoceros) that are on the edge of extinction.  With genetic engineering we could help these populations stay afloat by adding genetic variation to populations in risk of a genetic bottleneck.  This would give conservationists a useful tool to help these populations rebound in the wild, as opposed to suffering from genetic inbreeding and eventually collapse.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let The Debate Begin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently on a revolutionary scientific frontier.  De-extinction is a real possibility right now.  What will we do?  Will we bring the Paleolithic into the Anthropocene?  As I have tried to illustrate, de-extinction raises very complex questions.  Undoubtedly there will be very passionate de-extinction enthusiasts and equally passionate de-extinction opposition.  I hope that this article helped inform you about some of the important questions that we will all be encountering this decade.  The fate of the biosphere is now in our hands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reader, Keep and a Dissection of Google's Madness</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on a bit of a vacation this week from the world of tech, spending my time instead being Mr. Husband and Mr. Homeowner. I can&amp;#39;t help but chirp up, however, on the subject of Google&amp;#39;s newly-launched Evernote competitor, &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/20/google-launches-evernote-rival-keep-for-the-web-android-4-0-and-above/"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#39;re not keeping up with the Angry Nerds crowd, people are pretty mad that Google decided to rather abruptly &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/14/google-to-axe-google-reader-on-july-1-as-part-of-larger-round-of-app-closures/"&gt;shut down its RSS service&lt;/a&gt; named Reader. The backlash of that is still ringing strong, with smart people like &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/"&gt;Om Malik telling Google&lt;/a&gt; that he won&amp;#39;t be using Keep because he can&amp;#39;t trust that it won&amp;#39;t meet the same fate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t speak to Google&amp;#39;s long-term plans, but I do think that Keep will stick around. In the grand scheme of things, where Google makes more money by understanding user behavior, a service such as Keep makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#39;ve missed the news, Google&amp;#39;s amazing-service-du-jour is &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/12/05/google-now-adds-travel-destination-weather-local-events-song-id-by-voice-and-more/"&gt;Google Now&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s the &amp;ldquo;living in the future&amp;rdquo; app that many of us have been wanting. Though its results start off somewhat lackluster, the more that you use it, and the more that it knows about you, the more amazing it becomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Now is impressive because of semantics. It knows what you&amp;#39;ve searched, where you are and what you&amp;#39;re doing (roughly). With this information, it can offer information, rather than just providing data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Semantics are the holy grail to Google. As Matt Cutts has often &lt;a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/google-synonyms/"&gt;talked about&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most interesting challenges for search is understanding what someone means when a searched term is a synonym for another. Google, via Android (and also some iOS apps), your personal account and your history on both already knows a lot about you. But there are personal semantics that are missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; care about? What sorts of things do you find important enough to keep for later? If you save loads of articles that reference freshwater fish, and many more that talk about cooking or healthy lifestyles, Google is likely to be able to draw the connection that you enjoy eating fish and it can provide better contextual search results for you. While there&amp;#39;s a chance that you&amp;#39;re a fan of aquariums, the semantics make the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Keep, Google is opening the door to a layer of information about its users that it hadn&amp;#39;t previously been able to reach. Is Keep safe from the swinging axe of product death? Nobody can answer that just yet. But what&amp;#39;s definitely true is that, to Google, Keep is a much more important product than Reader. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, kids, when it comes to Google, you are the product being sold. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Papa for Pope</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.papaemeritus.com"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_leemartin_24548993319996_raw.jpg" alt="Papa Emeritus II"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or How to Run a Papal Election Campaign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One proven way to generate extra traffic in Internet marketing is to associate your campaign with major world events somehow. Maybe it&amp;#39;s the Superbowl, Oscars, or in the case of my last campaign, the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave"&gt;Papal Conclave&lt;/a&gt;. The trick is to react quickly and cleverly in an effort to become part of the massive conversation already happening organically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(Swedish_band)"&gt;Ghost B.C.&lt;/a&gt; to have a presence in Austin at &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com"&gt;SXSW&lt;/a&gt; even though they weren&amp;#39;t performing. Trying to make an impression among all that noise and BBQ is not easy, but we were handed a, dare I say &lt;em&gt;blessing&lt;/em&gt;, when Pope Benedict XVI stepped down and forced an election for a new Pope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided to craft a &amp;ldquo;Papa Emeritus II for Pope&amp;rdquo; campaign that existed in both the real and digital world via old school printed flyers and the website &lt;a href="http://www.papaemeritus.com"&gt;papaemeritus.com&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed fans to cast their vote for Papa and unlock the band&amp;#39;s newest track, &lt;a href="http://www.papaemeritus.com"&gt;Year Zero&lt;/a&gt;. The first thing we needed was an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Poster&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thinking is that real world campaign &amp;ldquo;conversion&amp;rdquo; of a &lt;strong&gt;text-heavy&lt;/strong&gt; flyer design was going to be low within all that noise at SXSW, so I opted to design something much more iconic and dropped in a subtle web URL for good measure. The aesthetic and layout of the poster is an obvious bite of &lt;a href="http://www.obeygiant.com/"&gt;Shepard Fairey&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; massively successful &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster"&gt;Hope&lt;/a&gt; poster for President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s 2008 election campaign with a Ghost B.C. twist, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began by &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/p/WR5ph4hZfF/"&gt;sketching&lt;/a&gt; Papa Emeritus II from a source image with my 24 pack of Sharpies in an effort to abstract his most prominent features like his &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitre"&gt;Mitre&lt;/a&gt;, white eye, and ghoulish scowl. This sketch served as a guide I could use in Illustrator to digitally draw all the shapes I needed to create Papa. I found an excellent &lt;a href="http://colorburned.com/55_seamless_lines_crosshatch_s/"&gt;pattern pack&lt;/a&gt; by Grant Friedman that assisted me in creating the cross-hatching which adds a nice lighting variation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I dropped the word &amp;ldquo;POPE&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;PAPA&amp;rdquo; in as 250pt &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica"&gt;Helvetica Bold&lt;/a&gt; and sent a print ready version of the flyer over to Austin for pasting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Flyering&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_leemartin_24548994446220_raw.jpg" alt="Pope Flyers"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the night of Sunday, March 10th, our flyer crew hit the streets of Austin and what commenced was the best pasting campaign in the history of SXSW. They absolutely fucking killed it. &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/p/W3tt4art7K/"&gt;Papa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sunsetblood/status/311991028892712960"&gt;was&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/p/WxJDvujIIl/"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I couldn&amp;#39;t make it to Austin, I immediatley started receiving countless &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leemartin/status/311266348598693888"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;, texts, and photos from my friends who saw the poster. Hell, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfeinberg"&gt;Jason Feinberg&lt;/a&gt; even ripped one down as a souvenir since he&amp;#39;s such a fanboy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were so many great reactions on Twitter to the posters I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly post them all, but here are a few gems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unclegrambo/status/312620022386270209" target="_blank"&gt;@unclegrambo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brianslagel/status/312261488658223106" target="_blank"&gt;@brianslagel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/laura_hudson/status/311225037875183616" target="_blank"&gt;@laura_hudson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subliminal Marketing: &lt;strong&gt;Achieved.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Voting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to blanketing Austin in paper, we ran a complimentary Internet campaign at the same time from &lt;a href="http://www.papaemeritus.com"&gt;papaemeritus.com&lt;/a&gt;. The idea was to use the Papal Conclave tradition of casting paper ballots with the Latin heading &amp;ldquo;Eligo in Summum Pontificem&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;I elect as Supreme Pontiff&amp;rdquo;) to give all visitors the chance to channel their inner Cardinal and vote for Papa Emeritus II. This scheme also came with the added benefit of pulling an email address and some location data from the user for future mailings via the Facebook &lt;a href="http://developers.facebook.com"&gt;Graph API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the fan&amp;#39;s ballot was cast, it activated the Year Zero &lt;em&gt;ritual&lt;/em&gt; which allowed them to stream the band&amp;#39;s newest track. If you haven&amp;#39;t heard it yet, go &lt;a href="http://www.papaemeritus.com"&gt;right now&lt;/a&gt; to unlock it &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be prepared to witness one of the most fucked up videos I&amp;#39;ve seen in a long time &lt;strong&gt;very soon&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip; I seriously couldn&amp;#39;t watch it alone in my new apartment at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the site, we had an opportunity to react to the actual election progress on our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thebandGHOST/status/311984815702425600"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/thebandghost/posts/574616922557108"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; by demanding a recount when Pope Francis was elected. Side note: my buddy &lt;a href="http://philipscottandrews.com/"&gt;Pip&lt;/a&gt; suggested we come out and say Pope Francis was actually Papa without his mask on, but I didn&amp;#39;t think I could get that one approved&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Post Mortem&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like the campaign could have been even bigger with more varied competing reactionary content, such as video, live stream from a fake papal election, or photoshopped photos of Papa in social situations. More parody, basically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However,  it goes to show that some old school tactics with new school execution can be quite successful even in over saturated situations if you can develop the right imagery with the perfect timing and context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. You can expect more from our Ghost B.C. campaign in the next few weeks leading up to the &lt;a href="http://www.myplaydirect.com/ghostbc"&gt;Infestissimam&lt;/a&gt; release. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/leemartin"&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for the latest and please let me know if you have any questions or comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A beautiful new exhibit at MoMa, &lt;a href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1319"&gt;Henri Labrouste: Structure brought to
Light&lt;/a&gt;, is very much worth a visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/kwindla_24548333153994_raw.jpg" title="Photo of the reading room at the Bibliothèque Nationale by Georges Fessy."&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_kwindla_24548333153994_raw.jpg" alt="LABROUSTE.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labrouste was one of the great architects of the 19th century. He was
trained in the then-traditional mode, a combination grand tour and
apprenticeship in Italy. During the prolific final twenty years of his
career, he created a new and contemporary language for public
buildings. He pioneered the use of cast iron and combined structural
innovation with detailed attention to decoration and form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MoMa exhibit concentrates on his two great libraries, the
&lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:France,_Paris_II_Biblioth%C3%A8que_nationale_de_France,_BnF,_Site_Richelieu,_Salle_Labrouste_1854-1875.jpg"&gt;Bibliotèque Nationale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Genevi%C3%A8ve_Library"&gt;Bibliotèque Sainte-Geneviève&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron and Masonry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the stone outer perimeter wall, pierced by
large windows in its upper story, and the internal iron truss
structure was one of the great novelties of Labrouste&amp;#39;s library
design. They are at once independent and codependent. The fineness
of the iron arcades would be impossible without the stone box, which
stabilizes them, while the minimal thickness of the stone box is
possible because there is so little lateral thrust fromt he metal
frame. This enhances the luminosity of the interior. Other
architects were experimenting with mixtures of traditional and
innovative materials in rail stations and market halls, but
Labrouste was the first to endow iron with a new civic decorum and a
system of ornament that expresses the nature of the material and
follows its constructive logic. The iron arches are pierced only
where it is structurally possible to lighten the material, thus
producing a beautiful &amp;ndash; and perfectly rational &amp;ndash; lacy effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above text from the exhibit perfectly captures one idea &amp;ndash; one
ideal &amp;ndash; of architecture. And more than architecture, of engineering
and design in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer programming is a relatively new vocation. Like all new
practitioners, programmers have liberally borrowed and repurposed
vocabulary as we&amp;#39;ve invented our profession. We sometimes call what we
do &amp;ldquo;software engineering.&amp;rdquo; And we refer to the functional
definitions of our software systems as &amp;ldquo;architecture.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are metaphors. There&amp;#39;s very little quantitative work in most
day-to-day professional programming. And our &amp;ldquo;architectures&amp;rdquo; are not
buildings and bridges; they are built from very different raw
materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, engineering and architecture are very good
metaphors. &amp;ldquo;Engineering&amp;rdquo; is about specifying and producing functional
artifacts. &amp;ldquo;Architecture&amp;rdquo; endeavors to create large-scale physical
artifacts that serve complex, multi-layered human needs. Both are,
fundamentally, the quest for deft definition and elegant management of
constraints. Form that follows, but is not dictated by, function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of engineering and architecture as two flavors of a larger
pursuit: design. Design, in this sense, is about transcending the
zero-sum problem of working with multiple, overlapping, conflicting
contraints, about turning those constraints into opportunities, and
about creating beauty from these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labrouste examined cast iron as a structural material and figured out
how to mate iron with stone so that the strengths of the two materials
complement each other. He created a new structural aesthetic from this
pairing. And he designed non-structural ornamentation that extended
this aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack"&gt;John Carmack&lt;/a&gt;, a Labroustian figure to digital architects, has a nice
description of what he thinks makes a good programmer. Carmack &lt;a href="http://slashdot.org/story/99/10/15/1012230/john-carmack-answers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;
that programming requires managing design trade-offs at multiple
layers of abstraction. A good programmer does this multi-layered
design work well, iteratively, intuitively, and keeps a &amp;ldquo;map&amp;rdquo; of these
abstractions in her head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These multiple layers of abstraction are the site grading, plumbing,
stonework, wooden beams, lighting, furniture, finishes and
ornamentation of the computer programmer&amp;#39;s working world: the
microprocessors, disks, memory, input devices, graphics hardware, the
low-level software drivers, the operating system, the various software
libraries, the various parts of the new application being developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Labrouste, technical aspects of building and construction were
inseperable from ornamentation. He carefully planned for the reading
room&amp;#39;s heating and ventilation. He designed a hot-water heating
system for beneath the tables, at the readers&amp;#39; feet, and he
installed twenty-four radiators around the perimeter of the
room. These iron heating devices were given a sculptural treatment
that recalls Labrouste&amp;#39;s earlier designes for streetlights on the
Pont del la Concorde. Nor were the transverse beams in the book
stacks left unadorned; the ornamentation underscored the assembly of
bolted ironwork. Drawings such as these, at full scale, were made to
guide the manufacture of the building&amp;#39;s component parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MoMa explanatory text for an exhibited elevation and plan of a
radiator for the reading room of the Bibliotèque Nationale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Labrouste&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://archive.org/details/Ms3910"&gt;construction diary&lt;/a&gt; for the Bibliotèque Sainte-Geneviève
has been made available online by that library and archive.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual,  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/arts/design/henri-labrouste-at-the-museum-of-modern-art.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;Michael Kimmelman&amp;#39;s review&lt;/a&gt; in
the New York Times is excellent and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
