    <title>Can You Deliver On Your Brand's Promises?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I got an e-mail from a WooThemes customer, which read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you for your answer! This confirms your superior support reputation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate reaction was to smile, because the customer was happy, and this is &lt;a href="http://adii.me/your-competitors-are-making-it-easy-for-you"&gt;something that we proactively strive to achieve at Woo&lt;/a&gt;. But then, I realized how easily that could&amp;#39;ve worked out differently too if the customer didn&amp;#39;t have a great experience with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone heard that you were a great company to work with (and decides to use your product / service / app because of that) and they then experience the exact opposite, it&amp;#39;s not only a neutral outcome. Instead that customer has an exponentially bad experience, because their &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt; was that much more / better than they got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a company, you weren&amp;#39;t thus competing on neutral footing; you had to deliver (at least) on par with your reputation and thus the expectation of that customer. Anything less than those lofty goals and you&amp;#39;ve failed that customer in their expectation &amp;amp; perception of how things would be when they take the plunge to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the thing then&amp;hellip; What does your brand &amp;amp; reputation promise? Can you live up those promises? Can you actually execute?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or are you just great at marketing and have essentially set up all your future customers to be disappointed?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Summly deal makes no sense</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The story about Summly&amp;#39;s 17-year old founder cashing out his company for $30,000,000 is fascinating because it makes no sense. I hate to be a curmudgeon, but I think Yahoo shareholders deserve an explanation. It&amp;#39;s not clear at all to me that they are getting their money&amp;#39;s worth. Let&amp;#39;s walk through the story together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly raises &lt;a href="www.crunchbase.com/company/summly"&gt;$1.5 million in total funding&lt;/a&gt;, launches to significant fanfare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo comes knocking, asks for their download numbers, revenue, technology overview, and the resumés of their 5 employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly comes back and says just short of a million, $0, &lt;a href="http://summly.com/technology.html"&gt;licensed-technology from SRI&lt;/a&gt;, and here are the resumés.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says great, we are looking to beef up our mobile team here. We are also interested in the future of news. You have 5 employees. But you don&amp;#39;t have enough downloads, technology, or revenue for this to be an attractive deal to us on the real M&amp;amp;A front. Tell you what, you guys have raised $1.5m. It won&amp;#39;t take a huge sum for us to pick you up. I think if all of your engineers pass the &lt;a&gt;rigorous technical/CS interviews that Marissa has mandated&lt;/a&gt;, or at least a majority, we&amp;#39;ll hire your team and we&amp;#39;ll pay your investors back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says OK, let&amp;#39;s pursue that option. I think my team can pass your interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo screens the employees, and tells the founder that &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130325/yahoo-paid-30-million-in-cash-for-18-months-of-young-summly-entrepreneurs-time/"&gt;2 of them passed&lt;/a&gt;. And we&amp;#39;ll let the the founder skip the interview because he&amp;#39;s 17 and won&amp;#39;t pass it - but he probably understands mobile better than half the people at Yahoo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says dang, only 2 out of 5 passed? Umm&amp;hellip;alright, well will you still buy us? What&amp;#39;s the number?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo takes the information back to PR and corp dev&amp;#39;s numbers people. PR calculates that they&amp;#39;ll get major press for the acquisition of a teenager&amp;#39;s company, values that press at $1m. Corp dev says they&amp;#39;ll pay &lt;a href="http://daslee.me/quick-thoughts-on-acquihiressoft-landings"&gt;$1m per engineer&lt;/a&gt; as is typical. And we&amp;#39;ll throw in $5m for the founder. That brings the total to $8m. Let&amp;#39;s ignore the hurt feelings that our employees will have about making a 17 year-old a millionaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says no, $50m is our minimum. We need to pay back our generous investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says $15m is fair. After all, we&amp;#39;re getting 3 employees, shutting down the app, and will have to rewrite the technology on our stack with a team of senior engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summly says $30m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yahoo says yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What?????? The craziest thing is that there are a lot of really qualified, CS-beefy teams doing really amazing things in the mobile news/discovery space these days - and that would definitely take a $30m acquisition offer or less. I don&amp;#39;t really understand why they picked this one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows Blue is how Windows 8 should have been from the start</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556374409446_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556374409446_raw.jpg" alt="owen_24236632149354_raw (1).jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has a bad habit of releasing an OS to the world &amp;ndash; like Windows Vista &amp;ndash; that&amp;#39;s rushed and not polished, just to meet deadlines. Vista would be the prime example of a &amp;ldquo;half-done&amp;rdquo; operating system that was directly improved on by a later iteration, Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Windows 8 was released, it was met with harsh criticism from those in the news business as well as the technology industry. Early reviews of Windows 8 slated the OS for having many missing features, inconsistencies and general &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo; usability issues. Here&amp;#39;s a handful of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/review/511116/windows-8-design-over-usability/"&gt;Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to find things that are wrong with Modern (which was called Metro in developer and early versions). For example, there are no overlapping windows, and there’s simply no way to put three or four applications on a single screen at the same time—even if your work space has a screen that’s 27 inches across. Windows 8 largely eliminates menus—the product of more than 40 years of usability research—and introduces a new system of touch-based text labels and controls that are frequently hidden and obscure. The interface is sparse—applications like e-mail and the address book now present far too little information on the screen, resulting in the need to frequently pan and scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3537710/windows-8-review"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8’s Snap lets you position two apps — desktop or Windows 8-style — alongside each other. Unfortunately, the Snap view is rather limited, with one app occupying a small amount of screen real estate (320 px) and the other taking the majority of the pixels available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/windows_8_Review?page=0,1"&gt;Maximum PC&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Metro comes with a number of options to prettify your PC, know that its settings are a wee bit more buried than your average Control Panel—and they aren&amp;#39;t even accessible via the Control Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5934932/windows-8-review-incredibly-innovative-incredibly-important-not-quite-incredible"&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad, somewhat predictable truth is that the fundamental act of moving a file from one folder to another—the drag-and-drop action that was probably one of the first three things you learned to do on a computer—is kind of terrible in Metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of examples that talk to some of the issues Windows 8 faced at launch. There&amp;#39;s a bunch of other ones I haven&amp;#39;t quoted here either: the lack of a Modern-style control panel, no Modern-style Office suite (I still can&amp;#39;t believe this one), the total disconnect between desktop and Modern UI, generic share commands and the over-simplification of basic system tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It bewilders me as to why Microsoft would dumb down fundamental features like Bluetooth or even completely ignore adding functionality for dealing with system settings in the gold release of Windows 8, but it seems that it simply comes down to a lack of time. Windows 8 &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to be out by the holiday season of 2012. They cut functionality and dumbed down features to deliver it on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#39;ve got our first glimpse of Windows Blue, it&amp;#39;s telling that Microsoft knew what was missing from day one and that they&amp;#39;ve taken on the criticism from the world. Keeping in mind that Blue is a very early preview (and is very unofficial) of whatever we&amp;#39;re going to see later this year, the leak that we&amp;#39;ve got gives us a glimpse at how Microsoft is going to proceed with what they started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556359264822_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556359264822_raw.png" alt="windows8smalls.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that&amp;#39;s been addressed is the odd disconnect between Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 that happened at launch, despite the fact that the Windows Phone team&amp;#39;s designs were public for some time before Windows 8 came out. Windows Phone had the ability to have large, medium and small tiles. Windows 8 had large and medium. Despite the plans being public, the Windows 8 team didn&amp;#39;t seem to pick up on this before release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now align tile sizes with those on a Windows Phone. Maybe not a big deal, but a consistent experience across platforms is key here and it&amp;#39;s important that Microsoft gives a consistent interface across their offerings. Microsoft was never good with consistency previously, perhaps they&amp;#39;ve turned over a new leaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556360743954_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556360743954_raw.png" alt="immersivesettings.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Microsoft has dealt with the watered down Modern control panel. You can finally delve into the settings of your Bluetooth devices and configure them (amongst other things). Those who live in tablet world no longer have to deal with dropping out of their dream into the desktop to change settings in the old control panel. Almost every system setting imaginable is now configurable from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556362525162_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556362525162_raw.jpg" alt="filemanagermetro2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, a file manager has been added for the Modern interface (something that users moaned about &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;) so that it&amp;#39;s possible to actually deal with files from the Modern UI rather than having to switch back to the desktop mode and poke at tiny controls to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556365287910_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556365287910_raw.png" alt="split.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft even dealt with complaints from users about being unable to run applications at any ratio other than 20%/80% of the screen per app. It&amp;#39;s possible to resize an application to any ratio a user likes in Windows Blue. It&amp;#39;s actually taken one step further, though, allowing users to add a third and even fourth application to the Modern interface split view without issue (on a big screen, you can add as many as you like). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24556370606370_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_owen_24556370606370_raw.png" alt="splitsplit.PNG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the developers I talked to about this, the consensus was that this could create mayhem for those that chose to wrote XAML applications instead of HTML5 applications, as the HTML5 applications tend to be able to handle display scaling better. It could be interesting to see how this is handled by the community once it&amp;#39;s official.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office isn&amp;#39;t included in the leaked build, but I desperately hope that Microsoft has a Modern UI version of it ready by the time Blue hits the street. It needs it, and this rounding out of the OS actually just shows how desperately the company needs to complete that part of the picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Modern UI is the path forward; it&amp;#39;s clear from Windows Blue&amp;#39;s leak (so far) that there&amp;#39;s little focus on the desktop experience. There&amp;#39;s a few small changes that are barely observable by the user, such as the &amp;ldquo;libraries&amp;rdquo; now showing up in My Computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the desktop has been ignored (as far as we&amp;#39;ve seen), and the void between the Modern-UI touch future and the desktop that Microsoft is forging ahead with is growing larger. It&amp;#39;s not necessarily bad, it&amp;#39;s just obvious where the company is betting we&amp;#39;ll be wanting to spend all of our time. The disconnect between the touch interface and the desktop is growing and I fear that PC users are going to be left behind as the company moves on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Blue shows that Microsoft is sticking with their guns and that Windows 8 needed improvement. It was the basic form of what&amp;#39;s to come and this functionality should have been there from the start but wasn&amp;#39;t. Perhaps if the company had waited to release the product and baked these features in from the beginning it might have won consumers over even faster. Apple is renowned for taking as long as it takes for their features to become fully baked, even if it means delivering late. Microsoft still hasn&amp;#39;t learnt that trick, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue is coming and it &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/03/25/windows-blue-in-context-think-of-it-as-the-windows-phone-8-upgrade-for-windows-8-itself/"&gt;completes the picture&lt;/a&gt; of where we&amp;#39;re going with Windows. I hope this upgrade doesn&amp;#39;t have a price tag attached.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audacity of a Ninth Grader</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people who are stuck. Stuck in a job or a position. Or they want to start a business, but never seem to get past the vague idea. They want a promotion, but are too scared to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I launched a new product a couple weeks ago called &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt; to help people &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;write better&lt;/a&gt;. A ninth grader was the first person to email me after news about Draft was published.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a simple proposition: Can he interview me over Skype or email for his blog. It would just be 5 questions. And he seemed to already have used my product: &amp;ldquo;Just used Draft. It is the coolest thing in the whole world. No more Google Docs for school projects. :)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flattery works. But I am insanely impressed that a ninth grade kid has the audacity to email people he doesn&amp;#39;t know to get their help improving the asset he&amp;#39;s created. That&amp;#39;s just not something most people do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at a crowded concert this last weekend (Frightened Rabbit). Walking out of the concert hall after the show, we were in your typical cattle formation. Tons and tons of people trying to get outside. Being civil. Barely. And everyone is trying to squeeze past these 4 open doors to get outside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What struck me as odd is the exit of the concert hall actually has something like 10 doors. Why is everyone crowding through these 4? So I avoided the crowded line, walked with my 2 friends to one of the other doors, and pushed. It wasn&amp;#39;t locked. We were out. The security guards, looking over all of us, didn&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got my first job after college, I felt stuck. I used to be a Chemical Engineer who had fallen in love with making things on computers. And I was lucky enough to get a chance to work for a technology consulting company, Accenture. But I didn&amp;#39;t get put into a position to make things on computers. I got put into a role where I was constantly taking meeting minutes and documenting requirements and test cases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucked.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started sending emails to random people in the company. Not random people exactly. Random important people. I emailed partners. I&amp;#39;d email them new ideas I had that I thought Accenture could make money from. As I look back, they were crazy, half-baked ideas, poorly thought out, and articulated even worse. But I got emails and phones calls back from these partners. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one ever told me to stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got a promotion to a team at Accenture that would let me make software. I didn&amp;#39;t have to document requirements anymore. The door was unlocked. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt, a friend from an acting class I took last year, shared this story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His major in college was acting. When he showed up to school, he met classmates just like him. Everyone had been in high school plays or performing in some community theater. The teacher on the first day of class asked everyone why they were there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most students had variations of the same answer: &amp;ldquo;I want to be an actor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One student though had a different answer, and it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s always motivated Matt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other student replied: &amp;ldquo;I am an actor, and I want to get better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve continued to send emails to people who are complete strangers to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve sent emails to Mark Cuban and Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce. Had conversations with both of them. Benioff even setup a meeting with me and his staff. An email sent to the CEO of Starbucks led to a meeting too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These emails rarely turn into much. But sometimes they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started Inkling, one of the first things I did was email another entrepreneur also doing things with The Wisdom of Crowds. That email quickly turned into the first revenue making deal Inkling did for $30,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I emailed Dustin Curtis to see if I could be a member of SVBTLE, the blog network you are reading this post on, before SVBTLE even had an invite form. I really didn&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d invite me. I didn&amp;#39;t know him. I had dropped the ball on blogging awhile ago. And I had 200 Twitter followers to his 40,000. But what the hell, I emailed anyways. I got an invite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, I emailed someone I&amp;#39;ve admired for a long time for some mentorship. He&amp;#39;s going to say no, right? He&amp;#39;s too frickin busy. Now he&amp;#39;s personally advising me on Draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things that we want to and can accomplish but a lot of us are sitting around waiting for permission. Permission that seems to never come. The kid in the ninth grade isn&amp;#39;t waiting for it. The acting student has already decided he&amp;#39;s an actor without anyone telling him he could be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure they get told no. I&amp;#39;m sure the acting student wasn&amp;#39;t very good yet. But what&amp;#39;s the worst thing that could happen in most of these cases. People ignore you? People tell you no? You look a little silly trying to push a door that is actually locked? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how often does the worst thing even happen, and how much better is the best thing that could happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting on permission for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the other door already. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;It would be awesome to meet you on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="http://instantbight.com/instantbight/interview-with-nathan-kontnynatekontny"&gt;here&amp;#39;s the interview I did with ninth grader David Silverman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Freemium Negates The Leaky Bucket Myth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24556023824670_raw.jpg" alt="bucket.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at any time in the past ten years, you might have asked someone at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AINTU&amp;amp;ei=Ol5QUcDVIoGmiQLqmwE"&gt;Intuit&lt;/a&gt; about the size of the QuickBooks user base, they would have told you the same number: about 4M. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure hasn&amp;#39;t grown because Intuit&amp;#39;s customer base, the small-and-medium business market, is a leaky bucket. &lt;a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqIndexAll.cfm?areaid=24"&gt;On the small end of the spectrum, about 750,000 businesses are created each year and about the same number fail.&lt;/a&gt; On the upper end of the spectrum, successful medium sized businesses (and the larger, more valuable Quickbooks customers) outgrow Intuit&amp;#39;s products and upgrade to enterprise accounting packages provided by Oracle and others of their ilk. It&amp;#39;s no surprise then that QuickBooks suffers from high churn rates, characteristic of the SMB market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaky bucket market dynamic can be quite unattractive if customers must be acquired through paid customer acquisition. SMBs are notoriously expensive to acquire. Combined with high churn rates, we have a recipe for burning through mounds of cash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite those concerns, it&amp;#39;s difficult to argue with Intuit&amp;#39;s success. It&amp;#39;s nearly a $20B market cap company generating $4.2B annually in revenue of which 17% or $700M+ is derived from this leaky bucket SMB segment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did Intuit build a business of such scale atop a customer segment that looks like quicksand? They don&amp;#39;t pay to acquire customers. Intuit used word of mouth, brand strength and an existing product (Quicken) to bootstrap QuickBooks to success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, it&amp;#39;s easier than ever for startups to target the SMB market successfully. Freemium businesses of scale are feasible because mobile application distribution, web distribution (SEO, social media) and app stores like Intuit or Salesforce or Google amass millions of SMB owners who can be reached at zero marginal cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But very few startups and investors pursue the market even today despite these fundamental changes in the market. Part of the challenge is maintaining the discipline to minimize customer acquisition spend, instead focusing on &lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/branding"&gt;brand building&lt;/a&gt;, word of mouth marketing, product excellence and so on. In other words, patience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next five years, I think we will see a segment of SMB SaaS companies achieving very large exits. And though their customers bases will suffer the same leaky bucket economics as Intuit, the customer acquisition strategies afforded to and created by these startups will trump those challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introducing Next Big Thing (nbt.fm); A Reddit/Hacker News For Music</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The general rule of thumb is that if a product or service doesn&amp;#39;t exist, create it. I was looking for a good hub of music news, articles, and rising artists and never really found it. Sure, Reddit has a music section, and you could follow individual sources on Twitter to get a similar experience, but a dedicated hub of diverse music related content was missing. Now &lt;a href="http://nbt.fm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Big Thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the technical help of Jared Moody, the foundation for user submitted links to be voted into popularity is now in place. This isn&amp;#39;t revolutionary, if you&amp;#39;ve used any service since ~2005 when Digg was king, this won&amp;#39;t blow your mind, but the aim is for functionality right now. Elegance is important, but only after you have something worth making pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love tracking down new music and sharing interesting industry stories with people, but sometimes I don&amp;#39;t have the time to keep on top of everything and suspect you might feel the same. Next Big Thing tackles the issue and quickly provides the top items people think are worth talking about, while also providing more content to those with plenty of time to sift. The site also highlights links directly to songs on services like Spotify, Soundcloud, iTunes, Youtube, and more. The songs can be voted on and sorted newest to most popular as well. The aim of this is to promote discovery among those seeking new and soon to be popular music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the beginning of something exciting. Please join, submit, vote, or just browse, but this type of resource needs people contributing to make it the most useful for everyone. Keep in mind that it is just the start, rough edges will be smoothed in time and features will be added. If you&amp;#39;re so inclined please send feedback or suggestions as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My new favorite foreign place on Earth</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next to San Francisco, because everything is next to San Francisco, Tokyo is now officially my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I&amp;#39;ve only been here for five days so far, but I&amp;#39;ve never been so sold on a place so quickly. Decided fairly unequivocally that I was in love with this place on the train ride to our apartment from the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is coming in without &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much prior bias. All of my friends who have been to Japan without exception are direly in love with the country, but I&amp;#39;ve never had any particular desire to come here. The only reason I&amp;#39;m here is literally because a friend of a friend tweeted about a RT ticket being $314 from LAX to NRT. Managed to snag RT tickets from SFO to NRT for $345 everything included, so just jumped on it on a whim last July. Literally no prior planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s to like about Tokyo/Japan? Some of it&amp;#39;s personal, some of it&amp;#39;s just objectively awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s high tech and cutting edge. As a whole, there seems to be very little resistance to embracing the new as it emerges and in numerous cases even envisioning that new and causing it to come to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an incredibly pervasive sense of respect. I&amp;#39;m normally an incredibly irreverent person and have been in every other country/locale I&amp;#39;ve ever been to, but here, everyone is &lt;em&gt;just so good&lt;/em&gt; that I can&amp;#39;t help but feel compelled to be good as well. The streets are so spotless that when I see a stray can strewn on the sidewalk I&amp;#39;m obliged to pick it up and walk several hundred meters to a trash can. I have to walk several hundred meters to a trash can because trash cans are pretty much nonexistent - everyone is required to recycle by law and everything is partitioned by category and the waste profile is shockingly small in contrast with America. This pleases me greatly particularly because I just watched &lt;a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozBE-ZPw18c"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone goes out of their way to help everyone else. For the first time ever I feel like there&amp;#39;s a great duty upon me to uphold the common moral code - not out of respect necessarily for the moral code, but out of the sheer desire to uphold and not lay ruin to the ineffable sense of communal aim towards the common good omnipresent in every square centimeter of Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, there&amp;#39;s a great sense of mutual respect among all here as well as a remarkably strong culture of innovation and embracing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal level, this place is the definition of heaven for a pescetarian. Seafood is cheap and plentiful and literally, &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; anything you could ever want from the sea is available here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve only discovered one downside to Japan my entire stay here, and that&amp;#39;s that fruit is inordinately expensive since Japan is, unfortunately (or fortunately, since it may have contributed to their rapid speciation in a glorious new direction from the rest of the world), an island. But even this has a redeeming quality - fruit juice is remarkably affordable and cheap. I&amp;#39;m assuming this is because concentrate is extremely inexpensive to transport even to an island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in short, no real downside to Tokyo discovered yet. Upside: everything that matters.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your Competitors Are Making It Easy For You</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen many &lt;em&gt;odd&lt;/em&gt; e-mails from (*odd?*) customers over the years, but to this day, I&amp;#39;m always most surprised when I see e-mails that includes snippets like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wow! You got back to me!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thank you for responding to my e-mail. I thought that I was just sending my e-mail into a blackhole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Thanks for helping me out &amp;amp; answering all my questions. My previous experiences trying to get help from software companies have been really bad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age, where every Tom, Dick &amp;amp; Harry are saying that their companies are offering their customers good service, I&amp;#39;m surprised to see customers with so many scars relating to previous experiences. I mean, I think we treat our customers well at Woo, but we&amp;#39;re in no way perfect; yet they really appreciate the experiences they have with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t need to speculate on what other companies are or aren&amp;#39;t doing with regards to customer service; all I know is that there&amp;#39;s still large amounts of customers that have had exclusively bad experiences with other companies in the past and by giving them a good experience, you are being their breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the chance, stop focusing on other aspects of growing your business and just &lt;a href="http://adii.me/dont-compete-on-features"&gt;use customer service as a competitive advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Singapore's JFDI Asia puts Southeast Asia accelerators on the map</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just quickly as I&amp;#39;m packing for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonrussell/status/316008239798042626"&gt;a trip&lt;/a&gt;, but I had to share the newest stats from the new (one-year-old) &lt;a&gt;JFDI Asia&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#39;Bootcamp&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/?s=jfdi+asia"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve written a lot about them&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; which is now past $3 million in funding for its first batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another of its originals &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://tribehired.com"&gt;Tribhired&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/03/25/malaysian-social-recruitment-site-tribehired-raises-560000-plans-international-launch/"&gt;closed a seed round this week&lt;/a&gt;, and the impressive update below comes via JFDI Asia CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hughmason"&gt;Hugh Mason&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;#39;m working on a more comprehensive piece for TNW:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tl;dr: Seven of the 11 graduates have raised seed-stage funding, four are dead. Total investment stands at SG$3.9 million (US$3.1 million).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TribeHired&lt;/strong&gt; - Social recruitment platform for fast-growing start-ups that puts friends to work. $15k investment by JFDI.2012 Pte Ltd closed. &lt;strong&gt;ACTIVE&lt;/strong&gt; - $696k round led by TNF Ventures and supported by angels Ben Chew and Ben Ball closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summarizing the situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, JFDI.Asia has taken 11 teams of entrepreneurs from idea to investment in 100 days, with greater than 60% success raising follow-on funding. This compares favourably with the 14% success rate reported for other Singapore programs. A further 9 are now in the pipeline, with 10-15 more expected to follow later in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful JFDI.Asia teams raise a median S$650,000 per team, exceeding that achieved by more established international peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent valuations prove that JFDI.Asia increases the value of startups passing through its program by 4-5X in 100 days [3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEOs of JFDI.Asia funded teams project that they will create at least 33 new jobs in Singapore by end 2013, ie an average 8 per funded team [4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more proof of why Southeast Asia is &lt;a href="http://insidethenoodlebowl.com/us-investors-showing-greater-interest-in-southeast-asia"&gt;attracting interest&lt;/a&gt; from the US, Japan and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Now the regular disclaimer: Yes, there are a different set of challenges here and the startup ecosystem is still being built out, and at different levels in various markets across the region.]&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hurdles</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What hurdles does a new app face? &lt;a href="http://www.moves-app.com/"&gt;Moves&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone app for tracking your steps, has been part of my life for a few weeks and I love it. Watching my usage evolve and interest in the app spread has prompted some thoughts about the hurdles a mobile app must overcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, an app has to find its way on to your phone.&lt;/strong&gt; Moves launched at the end of January and from an outsider&amp;#39;s perspective, has grown organically and consistently since. I came across the app from a tweet and every week, I see someone else talking about it.  When someone mentions Moves, you can sense a smile on their face. They are delighted by the combination of the design and experience, the encouragement of healthy behavior, and the price (free). &lt;em&gt;Side note: I&amp;#39;m skeptical of free apps with revenue-to-be-named-later and that applies in this case, too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of slow word-of-mouth is ideal, in my opinion. Many apps launch with a large coordinated push. For a day or two, it seems like everyone is talking about it. A week later, no one is. Seeing new people discover and actually use an app, and then talk about it because they love it, is much more powerful than a mad rush to be first to a new fad.  Nothing beats &amp;ldquo;I use this app and like it. You might, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone sees it that way, and of course, many apps harness that initial momentum (even if largely manufactured) and go on to great success. One way or another, an app has to stand out. It might be through App Store promotion, a marketing campaign, the pedigree of those behind it, the love of influencers, or people raving about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when a app breaks through the noise, a person has to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remember the name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search for it or revisit a link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;download the correct app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;open the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in many cases, sign in or create an account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a new app does make it to your phone, how likely is it to stay?&lt;/strong&gt; I installed Moves and a few days later it was on my iPhone&amp;#39;s home screen. I checked my total daily, kept my phone with me on the treadmill, told friends about it, and wondered if I&amp;#39;d hit a new daily record during SXSW (I did). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I had to replace my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A screen issue required a trip to the Apple Store. With the possibility of a replacement in mind, I backed up my phone before I left. Sure enough, the screen wasn&amp;#39;t repairable and I left with a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I restored from the backup later that day, I noticed that some apps were missing. I actually didn&amp;#39;t know which ones, but just sensed gaps on a few screens. Apparently backing up your iPhone does not save apps that aren&amp;#39;t in iTunes (that&amp;#39;s my theory, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, I realized that Moves was missing and installed it again. When I opened it, the data I had collected was gone, no epic days downtown and no lazy Sundays. After a few days, I checked to see the fresh data I had collected, but each day showed zero steps. Something wasn&amp;#39;t working correctly. I reset everything and now, things are working smoothly again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, none of those hurdles were the fault of Moves. In fact, I gladly take the blame for them. These scenarios are not uncommon, though. Even a great app like Moves, an app that is basically doing everything right, faces these hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many people would:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;notice an app was missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;take the time to search for it and download it again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue using it if previous data, scores, achievements were missing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continue using it if it didn&amp;#39;t work initially?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the app is considered essential (part of the mail, messages, lists, and calendar flow, tied to friends or family, an addictive game or service) we&amp;#39;ll jump through many hoops, but that is the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t a formula for success here, unless you include temporary shortcuts like paying for installs or viral loop tricks (the &amp;ldquo;Invite All&amp;rdquo; button is awfully close to the &amp;ldquo;Invite&amp;rdquo; button, isn&amp;#39;t it?). At the most basic level, the quality of the app and the size of your existing audience are the two biggest factors in determining success, but thousands of companies and developers are tying to solve these problems every day and great apps don&amp;#39;t always succeed. My experience using Moves and working on other mobile apps has reminded me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciate the challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t always appreciate how difficult it is to create a successful app. Be reasonable in your expectations, supportive of your fellow developers, and humble if your talent and good fortune deliver a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize hurdles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We focus a lot of removing hurdles that keep someone from installing and starting to use an app, but much less on those that cause a current user to drift away. We&amp;#39;re often casual about things like requiring users to sign in again after an app update. Yes, it&amp;#39;s unavoidable sometimes, but know that a single new hurdle can leave some of your users behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create something inspired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an app solves a problem in a unique way, reflects passion and care, or is simply inspired, it&amp;#39;s obviously easier to gain and keep someone&amp;#39;s attention. A new app should matter. It should have a core reason for existing, beyond &amp;ldquo;to make money&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;gain a lot of users&amp;rdquo;. People can tell if the creators believe in what they&amp;#39;ve built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form a relationship beyond the app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let the app be the only relationship you have with a user. That tenuous connection can be broken through something as small as lost credentials that require logging in again, a bug in the latest update, a new phone, or a fresh install. If someone is connected to the company behind an app, they are more likely to reach out for support, forgive a misstep, provide helpful feedback, or try the next, new thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they reach a hurdle, they&amp;#39;ll ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bands Don't Die</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bands don&amp;#39;t die anymore, they just break up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even just a few years ago, news of your favorite band&amp;#39;s demise could have sent you into a whirlwind of endless repeat of track 2, but now, not so much. Whether through wall posts, blog updates or just 140 characters at a time, bands keep marching on long after the music stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of examples of bands living on long after they&amp;#39;ve set their instruments down, but why? Because it&amp;#39;s hard to let go of 20,000+ followers, or even just 1000 followers. What if the band decides to pull a Brett Favre and come back from retirement time and time again? What if individual members want to explore new options? This &amp;ldquo;social media&amp;rdquo; time we currently find ourselves in demands that no matter how many followers, or how you got them, you don&amp;#39;t let them go. Keeping a band&amp;#39;s social media going could once have been seen as an altruistic thing, letting fans know of any lingering news or merch updates. But with the rise of a Kickstarter generation, successes are built on the backs not of a few people, but thousands. Reissued vinyls don&amp;#39;t press themselves and reunion tours still need someone to plan them so keeping as many fans and followers within a few keystrokes as you can is more of a necessity than an egotistical move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether musicians use the words &amp;ldquo;indefinite hiatus&amp;rdquo; or just call it quits, you can be pretty sure that those updates will still be coming in. Slower of course, but still there to remind you of when the music played on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The web as a platform</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After teaching myself iOS development in 2008, and Android development a few years later, I quickly learned the value in a well-supported development platform. One that&amp;#39;s curated and carefully maintained by a single entity; Apple and Google, in my case. These platforms allow me to be very productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue I see when delving into the world of the web is that a central web platform doesn&amp;#39;t really exist. I can&amp;#39;t ask the question, &amp;ldquo;I want to build a mind-blowing web application today, what framework should I use?&amp;rdquo;, and expect to get a straight answer. In some respects, the plethora of choice this problem represents is the power of the web, but overall I think it does the web a disservice because there isn&amp;#39;t enough weight put behind a single platform. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might choose today to get involved with backbone.js, only to find out that tomorrow, it&amp;#39;s the Play framework, or Angular.js, which is getting the most developer attention. I love that computing is ever-evolving, but I also want to use tools that mature and improve over time rather than work in an environment that has me spending more time &amp;#39;keeping up&amp;#39; than I do actually building a deep and meaningful solution for my customers. I think the web needs a secure, robust and well-supported (well funded?) framework for all to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, I&amp;#39;d like to see great web companies like Google and Twitter throw their weight behind a single web framework, much like Apple did with its open source Webkit project. This would lend credibility and engineering effort to a single framework and push it along faster than new frameworks pop up and distract us. Although early, I do think that Google is trying to make strides in this area as they have put a lot of weight behind &lt;a href="http://www.dartlang.org/"&gt;Dart&lt;/a&gt; - and they are spending a lot of time talking about the web as a platform.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s spend our time making great products, and less time learning the cool new framework du jour. Learning is fun, but &lt;strong&gt;building&lt;/strong&gt; is both fun &amp;amp;&amp;amp; productive.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It's a power struggle.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure many of you have heard about the Python dev conference tweeting fiasco. In case you haven&amp;#39;t, what happened was that a few developers were inappropriately joking about dongles and made a woman sitting in the row in front of them uncomfortable. She decided to snap a photo of them and tweet about their indiscretion to her 10k+ followers on Twitter. This led to all parties being fired, including the female involved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most women working in Silicon Valley, this is nothing new. Men can sometimes be inappropriate, and some may even call it a bit of a &amp;#39;nerd fraternity&amp;#39; or boys club. I&amp;#39;ll admit, it&amp;#39;s hard to get use to even if you&amp;#39;ve been working in the valley your whole life like me. But in order to be a successful woman in the tech community you have to learn how to handle these uncomfortable scenarios professionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hypothesis is that this woman felt powerless in the situation given that she was predominately surrounded by men (let&amp;#39;s face it, it&amp;#39;s a PYTHON conference). Overhearing a group of men behind her make inappropriate sexual jokes pushed her over the edge. There aren&amp;#39;t many women (myself included) that would feel comfortable in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the woman in question,  she ended up going overboard by  ultimately robbing these men of their power. Instead of tweeting their photo to twitter,  it might have been better to be direct and tell them to shut up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 lesson for women to take away from this unfortunate scenario is to be direct. When we feel uncomfortable because someone is saying something insulting, we simply say so in a polite, professional manner. By doing so, we create clear boundaries for what is appropriate and what isn&amp;#39;t. These situations are opportunities for educating others on becoming more self aware in social situations. It&amp;#39;s in the best interest of everyone involved and it&amp;#39;s our job as women to drive this change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 outcome that I hope will come from this is an improvement in hiring strategy and employee training. Companies need to understand that their brand as a whole is defined by the reputation of their employees. There is a strong need to teach proper social skills and social awareness so we can create a more cohesive culture where men and women feel comfortable working together. While many men in Silicon Valley are extremely talented and have a high IQ, we&amp;#39;re seeing the increasing importance and value of a high emotional intelligence or EQ. If companies start to focus on EQ, I think we&amp;#39;ll see more inviting culture and ultimately be successful at building more successful products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use to do a lot of social advising for YCombinator founders and other engineers and I&amp;#39;m more than happy to do my part and help.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The World of Hands-On Journalism, or How You Can Save Fido from Certain Death</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;#39;ve already been featured in top media outlets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the famous last words I received in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, it&amp;#39;s like telling a police officer you&amp;#39;ve already received enough speeding tickets. Or, explaining to your doctor you&amp;#39;ve already performed surgery on yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it&amp;#39;s not the most effective way to deal with the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a short phrase we like to use which is sort of a secret handshake in the field of journalism: the hands-on test. I might say hands-on when I need to see the thing in person. You make a widget, and I need to see if the widget does what it&amp;#39;s supposed to do. There&amp;#39;s a check and balance at play here. (Eventually, there&amp;#39;s also a check.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As journalists, we&amp;#39;re often paid to find out, on behalf of a customer, if something really works. We&amp;#39;re sort of a silent oracle, the space between two realities. (Some of us take up a bigger space than others.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;#39;ve invented a dog collar that connects to a transmitter in your kitchen. You say little Fido won&amp;#39;t run beyond a certain distance. I want to believe you, I really do. Something deep inside of me yearns to trust complete strangers by e-mail. And, I&amp;#39;m not so attached to my FedEx driver that I need to see her everyday, unless the delivery involves chocolate or coffee. In a few cases, a box cutter has turned on me, which is one of the few work injuries in my field that makes me nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, in almost every instance, we have to see the thing. We have to flip open the cover and look inside. We have to see the innards. Once we strap on the collar to little Fido and send him on his merry way and see that he will not be run over by a train or a food cart because of your app, we will be more than happy to write some glowing and solicitous prose about it. We&amp;#39;ll be earnest. But looking at a picture and some text on the Web does not help. Fido deserves a lot better than that, doesn&amp;#39;t he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 12 years as a writer, I&amp;#39;ve seen quite a few interesting reactions to my product requests. Of course, it all starts with the Apple response: no. Then there&amp;#39;s the Microsoft response, which adds some flair: unfortunately, no. Or, there&amp;#39;s the response I half expect these days: the product is not available for testing yet. And, I get that. These things take time. Greatness is not easy. Still, I get a little confused (and constipated!) when I find out 400 other journalists have posted reviews about the product already. But maybe they are in a different epoch of time? Maybe there&amp;#39;s an alternate universe where the product is in wonderful abundance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of these requests, we&amp;#39;re just doing our job. We&amp;#39;re being oracles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll tell you one of my favorite stories, which is almost completely true. There was a mystery tablet from a major tech company once. (I won&amp;#39;t give you any specifics about it other than to say the letters of this company start with H and P.) Things were pretty hush-hush, what with those folks at Gizmodo on the hunt for unreleased stuff. There were coded messages, whispers in dark alleys. Finally, someone admitted there was going to be a tablet, and it was going to be kind of similar to the Palm OS phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used every tactic in the book: I will sign an NDA, I promise not to tell Gizmodo, I will sign in blood and offer my life in servitude if I break my silence. None of that worked, although I think the representative from this super-secret company was intrigued by the servitude bit. Eventually, the answer was no and it was always going to be no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my editor got involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes, another e-mail arrived. &amp;ldquo;Why, we found one right under the desk here!&amp;rdquo; Apparently, everyone in the office of this mysterious company (codenamed H and P, shhh) was pleasantly surprised when they found it hiding under that desk. They all smiled and laughed. &amp;ldquo;We will get this packaged up for ya right away and ship that off pronto!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I felt a little conned, specifically by the &amp;ldquo;hey we found one right here under the desk&amp;rdquo; trick. Part of me knows they were probably in short supply. But, part of me also thinks there are those who work in shipping departments who are standing right in front of 14 product boxes typing a message on an iPad that says they don&amp;#39;t have any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this all leads me to the most flummoxing response of all: we already have enough coverage. Isn&amp;#39;t that like saying we already have enough money? Or we already have enough precious jewels? Or we already have enough gold bars? Or maybe &amp;ndash; we already have enough endorsements by famous supermodels? Oh, we would be interested in that coverage but we already have like a billion dollars because of the Gizmodo write-up. We can&amp;#39;t take any more money because our bank is not big enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m probably missing something here. I know that selling too many products can be a problem. Which, thankfully, is one of the few things that BlackBerry doesn&amp;#39;t have to worry about. But isn&amp;#39;t all press coverage good press coverage? Putting this stuff into the hands of a journalist is a good thing, depending on the cleanliness of the journalist? I&amp;#39;m not saying just mail stuff out willy-nilly to anyone who has a WordPress account. That would not be wise, and would also involve the phrase willy-nilly (lame!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is never really enough major media coverage. There&amp;#39;s Apple and there is everyone else. (Lately, even Apple has been happy for the coverage.) At the end of the day, this is just a happy exchange of goods and services. Some guy in Minnesota tests your stuff. It&amp;#39;s not that complicated. The customer is the ultimate winner. And, poor little Fido.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mobile Productivity for Normal People</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24551355774384_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24551355774384_raw.jpg" alt="google-now-landing_616.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, there has been a new refrain among consumer mobile startups that I&amp;#39;ve met with: we&amp;#39;re designing for normal people or &lt;a href="http://cdixon.org/2010/01/22/techies-and-normals/"&gt;normals as Chris Dixon would put it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this trend. First, there is a movement towards great design. Second, there is a wave to reinvent and reimagine core applications of the mobile phones. The apps shipped with the standard OS were ports of their desktop counterparts. Only now, after using these cloned applications for a while, do we understand how email, phone, calendar, etc should evolve. Third, &lt;a href="http://tomtunguz.com/machine-learning-in-consumer-products"&gt;machine learning technologies make magical experiences possible like priority inbox or Google Now.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, developing a product for a different segment demands a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, alternate customer acquisition techniques are required. Unlike productivity nuts whose unrelenting persistence of even minor time savings drives product experimentation and usage, normals discover products by chance or through word of mouth. Large scale distribution deals like carrier bundling, embedding in the operating system and mass media channels seem to me to be much more effective for reaching this audience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the value proposition must be clear, simple and immediate. Normals have far less patience. In other words, this user segment demands better designed applications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, the user feedback from productivity nuts and normals will vary dramatically. The first will demand ever more sophisticated features and integrations while the second will oppose functionality in pursuit of simplicity. Picking anything in between will develop a product that fails to meet either need well. Product must clearly prioritize one&amp;#39;s segments needs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity for startups targeting normals is massive. But approaching the market requires a new mindset, different product prioritization and alternate marketing tactics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what other ways must startups serving normals evolve? &lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/mobile-productivity-for-normal-people/invite_link/DUK9SOfmKbMhSA"&gt;Join us on this Branch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>10th Anniversary of Copeland's 'Beneath Medicine Tree'</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tylerhayes_24529652319834_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tylerhayes_24529652319834_raw.jpg" alt="copelandbmtuq9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people&amp;#39;s first taste of Copeland came with &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39;s single, &amp;ldquo;Downtown.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;#39;s a song about young love with a punchy chorus that can be hard to forget. A perfect choice of song to introduce the band in 2003 when it was still a time of loud and fast guitars, pounding drums, generally ruled by pop/punk. &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; was different, opening with the soft and delicate song, &amp;ldquo;Brightest.&amp;rdquo; For a lot of kids, this was something they hadn&amp;#39;t really been exposed to before, unsure if they loved or hated it. It&amp;#39;s possible the album came out just as musical tides were shifting, or maybe it was &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; that &amp;ndash; even slightly &amp;ndash; caused a shift in musical influence for a generation of then high school and college kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a raw and innocent aspect to the songs on &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; that only a debut album can produce. Jimmy Eat World&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Clarity&amp;#39; is another album with a similar spark and likeness that just drips magic. The impact of &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; is hard to explain, but it sweeps you up and even though it&amp;#39;s not perfect, there aren&amp;#39;t any faults to be found. Lead singer, Aaron Marsh mentioned that Beneath Medicine Tree was an album he wanted to move people, 10 years later it still can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obvious from the album&amp;#39;s title, there&amp;#39;s an inherent sadness present throughout the songs, though nothing quite like &amp;#39;Eat, Sleep, Repeat&amp;#39; which is the band&amp;#39;s 3rd release. &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; was not a depressing sadness, but one of mourning wrapped in hope, surrounded by songs of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Goldman, the record&amp;#39;s engineer, mentioned that &amp;ldquo;Love Is A Fast Song&amp;rdquo;, which appears on Copeland&amp;#39;s second album, &amp;#39;In Motion&amp;#39;, was originally the title track song for &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39;. Scraped at the time because the song just wasn&amp;#39;t strong enough and ready, it became one of the stand out songs on their sophomore release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of Copeland, as the band was taking their final lap around the country, you could tell from the farewell tour that they were burnt out. Even though the band&amp;#39;s final album, &amp;#39;You Are My Sunshine&amp;#39;, was a refreshing release, it still didn&amp;#39;t have the enthusiasm and emotional spark that &amp;#39;Beneath Medicine Tree&amp;#39; did. The type of spark that usually only comes around once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the jazzy beat of &amp;ldquo;Coffee,&amp;rdquo; to the hypnotic ending of &amp;ldquo;When Finally Set Free&amp;rdquo; or the slow burn of &amp;ldquo;California,&amp;rdquo; the album truly is a classic.  And 10 years later it&amp;#39;s as strong as it was the day it came out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hiring Goes Both Ways</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;#39;ve been involved in hiring 30+ team members to WooThemes, of which 24 remains on the team today. If I had to distill all of that experience into one piece advice it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When hiring someone that you really want to join your team, it&amp;#39;s critical that the individual wants to join the team as badly as you want them to join.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife always tells me that her dad used to &lt;em&gt;warn&lt;/em&gt; her about potential boyfriends when she was younger. He would always say: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Never chase after a boy or a bus.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This resonates with my experiences of growing our team; when I&amp;#39;ve aggressively chased a hire and compromised on what exactly I wanted (i.e. salary, exact job description, benefits, etc.), it generally meant that our relationship started on the wrong foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead we&amp;#39;ve had most success hiring the individuals that would do everything in their power to be part of our team. On paper, these individuals probably won&amp;#39;t be considered the best candidate, but in practice - due to their passion for our company, our team and our customers - they&amp;#39;ve exceeded all of our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This also reminds me of how important hiring according to company culture is. I love &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-hubspot-culture-code-creating-a-company-we-love"&gt;Dharmesh Shah&amp;#39;s words&lt;/a&gt; in this regards: &amp;ldquo;Culture is to recruiting what marketing is to product.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CNN says it doesn't support rapists, evidence says otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Apparently CNN is &lt;a href="http://www.thewrap.com/media/column-post/cnn-soft-rapists-steubenville-coverage-sparks-debate-81861?page=0,0"&gt;denying any slant toward the rapists&lt;/a&gt; in its coverage of the Steubenville, Ohio rape trial, and the reporter involved is offended anyone would think she supports rapists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough&amp;mdash;I seriously doubt she does support rapists, and I doubt that she thinks rape is a good thing. But it doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that within a minute of appearing on camera, she talks about how emotional it was to watch two boys believe they were watching their lives crumble before their eyes. Let&amp;#39;s go to the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=MvUdyNko8LQ#t=76s"&gt;video tape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MvUdyNko8LQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;(Start at 1:15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure it was a very emotional moment, and there is some journalistic value in describing the defendants&amp;#39; reactions. But, as I &lt;a href="http://blog.jamietie.com/media-rape-culture-victim-blaming-and-stuebenville"&gt;pointed out before&lt;/a&gt;, this crosses that line. It makes her appear to be much more concerned with the impact of a rape on the men who committed it than on the young woman who was raped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed, she highlights the pat, almost rote apology from Trent Mays (who apologized for taking and sending nude pictures of the young woman, not for raping her). CNN also showed Ma&amp;#39;Lik Richardson breaking down in the courtroom. Perhaps he is truly sorry. But being sorry doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that he raped someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, by emphasizing that the parties where Mays and Richardson raped the young woman were fueled by alcohol, she brings in one of the oldest  ways to blame the victim&amp;mdash;if she hadn&amp;#39;t been drinking none of this would have happened. In fact, alcohol is used both to blame the victim &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; excuse the behavior of the rapists&amp;mdash;they were drunk, as well. It&amp;#39;s a pretty tidy example of the double standard: She&amp;#39;s less sympathetic because she was drunk, but the rapists are more sympathetic because they were out of control and did something they might not have done while sober. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it doesn&amp;#39;t wash. What happened was rape. Full stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN would be wise to actually read the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/petitions/cnn-apologize-on-air-for-sympathizing-with-the-steubenville-rapists"&gt;Change.Org petition&lt;/a&gt;, understand what they did wrong, and work toward being more supportive of victims and less supportive of rapists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Jonah Peretti Taught Me About Journalism:
Make it Emotional, Social, Shareable</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of my trip to SXSW, the music, film and interactive festival in Austin that ended last week, was hearing Jonah Peretti, founder of Buzzfeed, speak  Buzzfeed,although still a startup, gets 40 million unique visitors a month, 40% per cent of whom read it on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Peretti, who also co-founded Huffington Post, a great journalist? Nope. He&amp;#39;s a guy who. while a grad student at MIT Media Lab, experimented with how to make things go viral. Read his Wikipedia page; it’s hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His key target audience? The &amp;ldquo;bored at work&amp;rdquo; network. The bored at work network is made up of people who have to spend all day at a desk on a computer, but who aren&amp;#39;t necessarily working all the time. These people use their mental breaks to shop online, and also to share content. If Buzzfeed puts out some content that interests them &amp;ndash; say, a cat photo or a diet that gets you into a bikini in 24 hours &amp;ndash; this network will share it because they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of the smart phone, a second, even larger network emerged:  the bored in line network. 
Mobile used to be where viral died, but now its where viral lives. Even reporters are part of the bored at work network, often scanning online for story ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From his youthful experiments, Peretti concluded that if you want something to be seen by a large audience, half the time should be spent on the idea, and the other half on how to spread it. If content is attractive to people on social networks, it can get as much as 34x the traffic as it gets on the original site. So Buzzfeed went to the market with social and shareable content, becoming quickly known for its quirky cat videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howeve, that wasn’t Peretti’s total intent. He wanted to have a place for long form serious journalism that was equally sharable, so he hired Ben Smith, the highly respected reporter from Politico, to be his political editor. Smith broke the story of Romney’s running mate, and now Buzzfeed has lots of serious journalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of news is good for social sharing? Scoops are good (everyone wants to be the first to know). So is any story that’s a matrix of fact and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good sites should be like a Paris cafe: philosophy and politics are vociferously discussed, but dogs are allowed, and discussions stop to pet the dog. That’s why you like your Facebook news feed; it’s a combination of inspirational quotations, family news, and fascinating photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only certain topics, however, lend themselves to sharing. To make you share something, you have to identify with it in some emotional way. Nostalgia is social. Breaking news about things like the Jody Arias trial or a tsunami are social. Humor is inherently social, as are cute animals. Buzzfeed did a promotional campaign with Toyotus Prius called “25 Hybrid Animals You will Love.” It got millions of shares and views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, people, is the future of journalism: emotional, sharable, and social. Get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Writing Online</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It now seems foreign to consider writing in a full fledged word processor, only to copy it over to a CMS, then publish it online. There was a time when writing your blog post in Wordpress or another online editor just wasn&amp;#39;t acceptable, but that&amp;#39;s no longer the case. If you&amp;#39;re writing for the web, there&amp;#39;s a good chance that you&amp;#39;re also writing on the web. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing online is currently a blossoming space. The seed was planted, it grew, and finally it&amp;#39;s beginning to show some beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a subtle, but important, uprising happening both in the way people write online and why people write online. Services are coming of age, questioning their roots and beginning to shed the past in favor of a new level of experience. Money and success are also no longer results, but prerequisites to typing this connected content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;blog&amp;#39; was only the spark, the catalyst, that put a vision is the minds of those with creative tendencies, blogging was accessibility, not the revolution. The revolution hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals are finally coming together to out publish traditional publishers. As evident by &lt;a href="https://medium.com"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://svbtle.com/magazine"&gt;Svbtle&lt;/a&gt;, and the iOS app &lt;a href="http://the-magazine.org"&gt;The Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. Simplicity, beauty, and beyond all, compelling content is starting to transition power from a few groomed individuals, to those with passion and endurance. Wordpress has users that are keeping their software in business, but they haven&amp;#39;t converted those users into paid contributors for a single source, aiming to produce high quality content coming at you from every angle that you can think. They should, or they&amp;#39;re going to get left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Music discovery &amp;ndash; I believe &amp;ndash; needs to be curated by both machines and humans and writing is the same way. The machines sort, organize, and manipulate the data, while humans provide the answer to &amp;ldquo;Is this good?&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year from now the world of online publishing is going to look a lot different , and very few see it coming.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I Can't Sing</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t code. I can&amp;#39;t design. I can&amp;#39;t dance. I can&amp;#39;t get in shape. I can&amp;#39;t draw. I can&amp;#39;t give speeches. I can&amp;#39;t write. I can&amp;#39;t invent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 15 I had a friend named Patrick. We met in driver&amp;#39;s ed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you looked at him, you&amp;#39;d probably expect to find him in a moshpit, or playing insanely loud punk music. You&amp;#39;d be right. But the guy had the voice of an angel and sang in his high school choir. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, Collin and I pick him up from choir practice. 
Collin was our 16 year old friend who we often made drive us around. Poor Collin :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were driving to who knows where (some cafe to play chess and drink coffee or to Taco Bell) a song came on the radio that I liked. And I sang it a little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That weird looking, punk rock, 15 year old kid gave me some advice that has helped shape every single thing I&amp;#39;ve accomplished since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He warned me that, as I sang, I was trying to imitate the musician on the radio, and I wasn&amp;#39;t doing a very good job of it. My voice just couldn&amp;#39;t do what we were listening to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I should try to cover the same song but do it in a way that suited my voice. My voice isn&amp;#39;t very strong at those high notes. If I was going to imitate anyone, try to imitate someone&amp;#39;s voice that works at this low pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried Patrick&amp;#39;s advice, and I sang the song at a considerably lower pitch that was comfortable to me. I remember it sounded now more like Johnny Cash. The result was surprising. It wasn&amp;#39;t half bad, and it was much better than me trying to sing like that guy on the radio. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt like a &amp;ldquo;web designer&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;#39;ve been building websites for 15 years, and I&amp;#39;ve done what I&amp;#39;ve needed to do, but I could never get my stuff to look even close to those beautiful creations I admire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get past that, I&amp;#39;d end up buying some template somone else made. Or finding really good business partners who could design all the things I couldn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last 12 months, however, running my third software company, I found myself alone trying to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t have a partner, or a designer or anyone else to help me. And I didn&amp;#39;t have any money to buy the help. A template wasn&amp;#39;t going to cut it this time. I was in a bind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have a Dribbble account full of my work. I don&amp;#39;t have a portfolio. I don&amp;#39;t know what awards designers win. I hear there are awards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I had to figure out what I can design. I had to figure out a way to design that suits me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I can&amp;#39;t do a lot with color, or illustrations, or shadows, or logos, I&amp;#39;d have to go with very little of those things. It would have to be the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still looked at people doing amazing work online for inspiration. But instead of trying to step into the shoes of my preconceived notion of a designer, I started noticing elements of projects that I could actually do myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t create an identity or logo like Aaron Draplin, but I sure could use Futura Bold and add a little space between the letters like he seems to be doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up with what you see at &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt;, software I&amp;#39;ve made to help me &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;write better&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has no logo. It has zero images. There&amp;#39;s one color on the homepage. Blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank god or luck or hard work or whatever, I have stumbled on a large number of people that appreciate and love the user experience and user interface I&amp;#39;ve created. I&amp;#39;ve worked my ass off to accomplish this project. But I didn&amp;#39;t expect this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are blemishes that you might see (and even more that I do). Mountains and mountains of things I need to improve and polish. And I&amp;#39;ll never think it&amp;#39;s as good as anything from my heros who I immediately think of when someone says: designer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, along the way of getting here, I have figured out a way to design. I found some way to sing this song but with a voice that suits me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might not be able to sing like your preconceived model of how a singer sings, but I&amp;#39;ll never understand when someone tells me, &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;#39;t sing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you probably didn&amp;#39;t have a friend like Patrick. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

    <title>Abandoning RubyGems</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Vagrant 1.1+ no longer supports &lt;a href="http://rubygems.org/"&gt;RubyGems&lt;/a&gt; as an installation method. Instead, you must install Vagrant 1.1+ using &lt;a href="http://downloads.vagrantup.com"&gt;pre-made packages or installers&lt;/a&gt;. For folks used to the gem-based installation, this has caused a mixture of confusion and disdain. In this post, I enumerate my reasons for abandoning RubyGems, and why it is better for the Vagrant community long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially released Vagrant as a RubyGem over 3 years ago. Vagrant is written in Ruby, and at the time I was already comfortable with making RubyGems, so I decided it was a natural distribution mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t regret this decision for a moment. The Ruby community is very open to cutting edge technologies, and I think that distributing as a RubyGem improved my initial adoption of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, I&amp;#39;ve grown and learned that RubyGems is no longer the best choice, for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;#39;m going to explain why installers make life better for Vagrant users. In a future post, I&amp;#39;ll explain how installers affect plugin developers and that ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Non-Rubyists&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the initial release of Vagrant in 2010, Vagrant has grown to be used by hundreds of companies and thousands of people. While I don&amp;#39;t have hard numbers to back this up, a majority of the Vagrant users I meet are not Ruby developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to making installers, the top complaint I would receive about Vagrant was about RubyGems. As a Ruby person myself, I always considered RubyGems to be simple. But for anyone outside the Ruby community, I learned that the burden of having to learn RubyGems, install Ruby, and so on was a high enough barrier to entry that many people didn&amp;#39;t even try to install Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, packages that bundle all of Vagrant&amp;#39;s dependencies (including Ruby), make installing Vagrant extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bugs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vagrant has a lot of external dependencies: Ruby, RubyGems, OpenSSL, zlib, JSON, and more. With the RubyGems approach, users were left to manually install these dependencies, either from source or their package manager of choice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this flexibility, I was unable to test Vagrant in every conceivable environment. I knew Vagrant worked on my system with my installed versions of dependencies, but didn&amp;#39;t know if it would work in every system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, it was common to receive bugs where Vagrant was used with dependencies that were too old, had bugs, or were simply broken due to permission errors and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care whether this is perceived as my fault or the user&amp;#39;s fault. I don&amp;#39;t blame users for not installing proper versions, especially if they just installed what their package repository had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is a &lt;strong&gt;huge problem&lt;/strong&gt; when Vagrant crashes due to a broken environment, and then people perceive this as an instability in Vagrant itself, when 9 times out of 10, it was due to a misconfigured environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With installers, I am able to ship Vagrant with all the dependencies it needs, and promise the user that Vagrant will work with those dependencies. This is especially helpful in Windows environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Flexibility&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I strictly control the environment, I&amp;#39;m able to improve and fine tune the dependencies Vagrant relies on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vagrant 1.1, I replaced the old, slow pure-Ruby &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28computing%29"&gt;tar&lt;/a&gt; library i was using with &lt;a href="http://www.libarchive.org/"&gt;libarchive&lt;/a&gt;, a high performance, stable, and flexible application and library written in C. libarchive is now shipped with every Vagrant installer, so users don&amp;#39;t have to install another dependency, and don&amp;#39;t really need to care Vagrant is using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vagrant 1.2, I replaced the downloader from using pure-Ruby HTTP to using &lt;a href="http://curl.haxx.se/"&gt;cURL&lt;/a&gt;. This is much faster and supports many more network protocols, such as FTP. Every installer will ship with cURL pre-installed within it. Again, users don&amp;#39;t need to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I&amp;#39;ll be replacing the pure-Ruby SSH library with a more stable, well maintained SSH library written in C. Once again, users don&amp;#39;t need to care, but they&amp;#39;ll notice that SSH becomes more stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these changes, I&amp;#39;m able to make significant dependency changes without the user noticing. In fact, all the user notices is that the Vagrant experience just got a lot better. Things got faster, things don&amp;#39;t crash, and Vagrant supports more features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Vagrant got a lot better because I was able to make changes I couldn&amp;#39;t safely make by distributing via RubyGems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheap Data</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I went to a tech talk last night called &lt;a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5760309240"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Genomics at Web Scale.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://www.counsyl.com/"&gt;Counsyl&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;[SV Angel is an investor in Counsyl.]&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is above my pay grade to critique but here goes. There&amp;#39;s a strain of thought in computer science that &amp;ldquo;data beats algorithms.&amp;rdquo; That is, having more data is better than having a superior algorithm. For example, &lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120907/more-data-beats-better-algorithms-or-does-it/?goback=%2Egde_35222_member_161040415"&gt;some contend&lt;/a&gt; that the winners of the &lt;a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/"&gt;Netflix Prize&lt;/a&gt; had a relatively simple algorithm but won because they had more data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/"&gt;Imran Haque&lt;/a&gt;, Counsyl&amp;#39;s Director of Research, tweaked this claim. He said that cheap, abundant data &lt;em&gt;leads&lt;/em&gt; algorithms. And by doing that, they can lead to technological (mainly software) breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1990&amp;#39;s, cheap text created by the Web led to better machine learning, machine translation technologies, AI technologies, PageRank and other breakthroughs. In the mid 2000&amp;#39;s, cheap image data created by cell phones, digital cameras and the like helped actualize arithmetic coding, effective computer vision and quite possibly to break throughs like self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imran said that the next breakthrough is cheap molecular data. The cost of sequencing one human genome (i.e., 6 billion bits!) cost $9MM in 2007 and $7K in 2013. These costs are &lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/graphiti/427720/bases-to-bytes/"&gt;falling almost 5x faster than Moore&amp;#39;s Law since 2007.&lt;/a&gt; Because of this and advances in other fields like robotics, Imran&amp;#39;s claim is that this will be the most interesting area of computer science for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5416116"&gt;Would love any thoughts/comments here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On The Pycon Incident</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spent some time digging into the whole Pycon Incident and found it really disturbing. I normally don&amp;#39;t talk about this kind of thing, but the way it went down really struck me. As well, I&amp;#39;m not sure I wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen as much of this, if not for some new friends and co-workers, and wanted to make sure people knew this stuff was happening in our industry. I know I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot, and much of it very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not going to recap the specifics. If you want those, you&amp;#39;ll need to search and keep digging. I&amp;#39;ll warn you, there is a lot of opinion and reaction you&amp;#39;ll need to sort through to understand what happened. I wish there was a good, unbiased wrap up to send you to, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find one. (Update: I found &lt;a href="http://www.dailydot.com/society/pycon-dongle-joke-misogyny-sexism-adria-richards/"&gt;a pretty good one here&lt;/a&gt;.) I will, however, give my take having figured out a lot of the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version: Adria Richards, a developer evangelist, was sitting in a Pycon session when she overheard two guys telling a dirty joke. She snapped a photo of it and posted it on Twitter, calling them out. There was a &lt;a href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2013/03/pycon-response-to-inappropriate.html"&gt;fairly calm, smart and measured reaction from the conference&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the guys was fired and a pretty massive Internet blow up over the whole thing. Most of which was direct squarely, and harshly, at Adria. (Update: turns out Adria was fired as well.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go on, I just want to make it clear that this is my take, based on what I know which might be slightly incomplete. I mean, I wasn&amp;#39;t there, etc. I&amp;#39;m also not as educated as I now know I should be on women&amp;#39;s issues in tech, not that I think you need to be to get to the bottom of this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s how I see it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was it ok for these guys to have this conversation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Very debatable, but yes. It wasn&amp;#39;t a smart move to have it in a public place, and doubly so in a professional setting, but what two people talk about should be their own business most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was the joke offensive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Going to go with no, based on the definition of offense. The point being, I&amp;#39;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they didn&amp;#39;t intend any offense, with the caveat that anyone overhearing is certainly within their rights to feel uncomfortable over hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was Adria&amp;#39;s response to post their photo on Twitter appropriate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No. This was clearly not the best way to approach the situation, as I&amp;#39;m sure, in hindsight, she&amp;#39;d admit. Handling it in person, either face to face or via Pycon people, without escalating to the Internet, would have been the proper approach in my opinion. But, I don&amp;#39;t see anything horribly wrong with it either, it&amp;#39;s no worse an act than these guys telling dirty jokes in a public, professional setting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Should this guy have been fired?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; No. Seems like a knee-jerk over-reaction to me. Having said that, I don&amp;#39;t feel too bad for him. He should have known better, and people are fired for less all the time. And his reputation? That&amp;#39;s an easy one. If this had happened to me, I&amp;#39;d have personally and publicly apologized to Adria, made it clear that while no offense was intended, I fully understand why she might have been upset, taken my lumps and moved on. People make mistakes, and this was clearly a small one followed by a bunch of over-reactions. I think smart folks recognize that.  (Update: &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681"&gt;looks like he&amp;#39;d posted an apology&lt;/a&gt; and I just hadn&amp;#39;t seen it, probably because it was buried with over-reactions and bullshit. And, in case it wasn&amp;#39;t clear, I don&amp;#39;t think he did anything actually deserving to be fired.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: Should Adria have been fired?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly no. Nobody should have been fired over this. I thought maybe the guy involved might have a case, but this clearly seems like something with legal implications. I&amp;#39;m no lawyer, so I don&amp;#39;t know. Regardless, my guess is had there been no firing of anyone, this whole thing might have settled down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet&amp;#39;s response.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we come to the heart of the matter, the reaction of the Internet to all of this. And, in my mind, there is no question to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In no way, shape or form does Adria Richards deserve any of the poor treatment she&amp;#39;s getting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; And if you dig around, some pretty frightening stuff is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the real problem here. It&amp;#39;s not about the joke or her reaction to it. It&amp;#39;s about how many people in this industry reacted to all this, and that, in my opinion, really needs to change.  Sure, she didn&amp;#39;t react appropriately, but that doesn&amp;#39;t excuse anything, it wasn&amp;#39;t THAT much of an over-reaction and those guys should have known better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but wonder if the gender roles were reversed here. Would this even be an issue? I mean, there are many cases of women being disparaged through photos, without any valid cause whatsoever, and while there is a bit of outrage, there is nothing remotely like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These men are being defended for making a mistake, and she&amp;#39;s being threatened and abused for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t that seem backwards to you? Doesn&amp;#39;t it seem strange that the focus here is on Adria and what she did? Where are the people calling these dudes out for being stupid? Forget offensive for the moment, what they did was dumb, clearly against professional codes of conduct (and Pycon&amp;#39;s) and as such, what&amp;#39;s so wrong with her calling them out? Seriously, had this been me calling them out, would it have caused the same reaction? I highly doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve got a problem here. I&amp;#39;m not sure how to solve it, but clearly this kind of thing cannot be allowed to continue. I guess the first step for me is to pay more attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update and final addendum:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s been a little less than a day since I initially wrote this and quite a few things have come to light.  I can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;d change my stance based on what I knew at the time, and honestly, had I known now what I new then, I&amp;#39;m not sure it&amp;#39;d change much either. I might be a bit harder on Adria going public, as I think about that more, it was a really bad move. I guess I just started thinking about all the horrible photos out there and thought, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;#39;s the big deal, it&amp;#39;s a stupid joke and now they&amp;#39;ve been outed.&amp;rdquo; Which &lt;strong&gt;would have been the case&lt;/strong&gt; if one of them hadn&amp;#39;t have been fired. Which was, just&amp;hellip;stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I can say is that I was very nervous to post something like this on a sensitive issue. The reason I did was because I saw so much hate floating around, and here it was coming from an industry I love and I&amp;#39;m fiercely passionate about. It made me sad, but I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what to think. So I read and I wrote and it started to become clear.  In the end this isn&amp;#39;t about a dick joke, or an attention seeker, it&amp;#39;s about an immature industry&amp;#39;s inability to handle something like this. It&amp;#39;s about a fundamental lack of respect. And it&amp;#39;s about a world where, at any moment, we can publish whatever the hell we want to whomever we want and more often than not, don&amp;#39;t have to worry about being held accountable for it.  Many of us don&amp;#39;t choose to do so, for a variety of reasons. Many more do so responsibly, again for a variety of reasons.  Some, like Adria, publish without thinking through the consequences. Some publish hidden behind masks without fear of simple questioning, let alone consequence. They can always just fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in an always connected world. Our industry enables that, so we know how to take advantage of it. Most days this is awesome. But some days, some days it&amp;#39;s downright scary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted this because I felt like I hadn&amp;#39;t seen any even-handed reaction aside from the short post from Pycon itself.  Both parties were at fault for causing it, but the over-reaction that happened, frankly, could have and should have been avoided and it&amp;#39;s a fucking shame that it wasn&amp;#39;t.  With all this power and intellect we&amp;#39;ve got, we can&amp;#39;t seem to handle something like this? Sad. I still feel this way and that was the primary point I was trying to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to me being nervous. I&amp;#39;m pretty far removed from this. I don&amp;#39;t hold very much emotional stake in this particular game. I could have easily ignored it, and almost did. (Or so I thought, wow, it really blew up today.)  Regardless of their opinion I have to give it up for those people who did speak out and for whom an issue like this hits close to home. For those who didn&amp;#39;t, well, I&amp;#39;ve learned why you might not want to.  Part of me feels like I should have just written this out and kept it to myself and let those who really feel this speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I&amp;#39;m reminded of how this was handled. Of the companies and the firings and the flame wars, finger pointing and threats and hate and all the other bullshit. Clearly this industry needs help. We can do better. And, fuck it, I&amp;#39;m a part of this industry too, and I&amp;#39;m here to help how I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, I&amp;#39;m done. Here&amp;#39;s a picture of some cuddle buddies:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the File System Wars Will Trigger a Wave of Consumer M&amp;A</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24549775061166_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24549775061166_raw.jpg" alt="Finished_Risk_Board_lrg.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - The most famous of which is &amp;ldquo;never get involved in a land war in Asia&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a land war being fought on the web and it&amp;#39;s for files and filesystems. Incumbents and startups alike are duking it out. And things are really starting to get interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The startups, Dropbox and Evernote, reinvented the file system as a synchronized, cross platform file system abstracting the hardware and the data. Now they are moving up the stack. &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/dropbox-acquires-mailbox-to-help-grow-the-gmail-app-for-ios-quickly/"&gt;Dropbox&amp;#39;s acquisition of Mailbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/14/dropbox-for-ios-updated-with-new-photo-gallery-and-design/"&gt;renewed focus on photographs&lt;/a&gt; and attachments and Evernote&amp;#39;s every growing battery of point applications like Skitch, Food, Hello and Peek aim to drive further file creation and user engagement within their notebooks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24549784378398_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24549784378398_raw.png" alt="ScreenCapture at Thu Mar 21 07:41:23 PDT 2013.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incumbents, Microsoft and Apple, leverage their own advantages heavily.  Over the last few years, Microsoft and Apple, which own the most popular operating systems and the content creation applications, Microsoft Office and Apple iWork, have persistently revised their operating systems to unify the local and cloud filesystems (SkyDrive and iCloud). Google entered the fray seeking to displace Office with a web based document creation suite whose by-product was an online file system that evolved into Drive. &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html"&gt;Google&amp;#39;s recent Keep launch, a note taking application, is a shot across Evernote&amp;#39;s bow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the core value proposition to users has changed. The old war cry, liberation from disaster recovery and data backup duties, has been replaced by the promise of device independent, scalable, searchable filesystems that use the power of the cloud to afford new capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Google Drive, &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=2691634"&gt;searching for Eiffel Tower will return photographs from a user&amp;#39;s of the famed Parisian monument using image recognition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because end user applications and experiences differentiate these filesystems, I expect to see a flurry of acquisitions of next generation content creation tools that users love by these companies all in effort to create loyalty and build lock-in to a particular file system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These might include photo creation tools, next generation presentation tools, developer API platforms enabling programmatic access to these file systems and potentially even content stores to compete with Google Play and iTunes. After all, movies and music and books also have to be stored in a file system. It may as well be the same one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For users the promise of the cloud filesystems battle is better applications and experience. For startups, it means the beginning of the M&amp;amp;A wave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which startups do you think are most likely to be acquisition targets in the file system wars? &lt;a href="http://branch.com/b/why-the-file-system-wars-will-trigger-a-wave-of-consumer-m-a/invite_link/dldr9tZxKrMJDQ"&gt;Let me know what you think on this Branch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
