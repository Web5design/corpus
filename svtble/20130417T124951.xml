    <title>Swinging For The Fences</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I read Ben Huh&amp;#39;s post about how he got really depressed and contemplated suicide. One thing really stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Failure is an option, and a real risk. Failure and risk something entrepreneurs understand well, and learn to manage. However, death isn’t an option, it’s an inevitability. *&lt;/em&gt;And before I die, I want to take as many swings at the fence as I can.**&amp;rdquo;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swinging for the fences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m only 28 years old. I haven&amp;#39;t had a near-death experience. I&amp;#39;m relatively healthy and my life expectancy is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also had a good - maybe even great - life thus far. I&amp;#39;m married to my beautiful wife, who doubles as my soulmate, best friend &amp;amp; muse. I have a 16-month old son that is starting to look &amp;amp; act more like I do every day. I had the opportunity to take a chance (on myself) when I was quite young and that chance has lead to immense success at WooThemes (which has in turned spawned more opportunities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you ask me how many times I&amp;#39;ve taken a swing for the fences, I could count those attempts on two hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since reading Ben&amp;#39;s post, I&amp;#39;ve felt this desire &amp;amp; passion to take a few more swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I settled into bed last night, I opened up Twitter to do some pre-sleep reading when I stumbled onto various tweets about the Boston Marathon bombings. I subsequently struggled to go to sleep and when I eventually dozed off, it was an uneasy sleep at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke this morning, I enjoyed my coffee along with CNN&amp;#39;s special coverage of the bombings. The same uneasiness that I took into dreamland was still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to think about much else than the bombings. When I heard the news that the first (confirmed) victim was a 8-year-old boy, I immediately felt the need to hug my own son and hold him close. I also hugged my wife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt vulnerable. Life felt fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was about 8000 miles away from Boston and the bombings, I felt the emotional impact as if I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not one to crawl into a corner. I needed a nudge in the opposite direction today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That nudge turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pattonoswalt/posts/10151440800582655"&gt;these awesome and inspirational words from Patton Oswalt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His words spoke to me and made me feel less vulnerable. His words encouraged me to try make a dent in the universe and swing to the fences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve since decided that yesterday&amp;#39;s bombings and all of my emotions will serve as a constant reminder of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is way too short. &lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt; I have absolutely no idea how much time I&amp;#39;ll have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regret manifests way too easily. And it&amp;#39;s not like my decision-making is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can however control how many times and how often I swing for the fences. It doesn&amp;#39;t even need to be perfect; I just need to keep on taking those swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will you swing for the fences today?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Difference Between Sales and Business Development</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Almost daily, I run into the misconception that the function of sales and business development are interchangeable, from co-workers to industry peers. This stems primarily, I believe, from the shift in titles of salespeople to business development &amp;ndash; which has been done in an effort to avoid the negative connotation that surrounds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, the two are very different. Hence, this tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use the terms Business Development and Sales interchangeably, you&amp;rsquo;re doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andrew Dumont (@AndrewDumont) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewDumont/status/314914841364148224"&gt;March 22, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But 140 characters just isn&amp;#39;t enough to explain of the subtleties, so here we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think about the function of business development, it should be thought of as a marketing function. Yes, there are some soft sales skills (qualification, negotiation, etc.) that are necessary to become a good business development professional, but at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s a marketing function. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to think about it on a sliding scale between a pure function of sales or marketing, it would wind up somewhere around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/adumont_24587316673038.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/adumont_24587316673038_small.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-09 at 8.24.31 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason behind this, is that typical goals of business development include brand placement, market expansion, new user acquisition, and awareness &amp;ndash; all of which are shared goals of marketing. The slight slide towards sales is simply because of the tactics business development employs to achieve those goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is where we get into the meat of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the company, business development tends to hold the same structure, which I sketched up quickly below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/adumont_24587329233240.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/adumont_24587329233240_small.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-09 at 8.42.03 PM.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply stated, the function of sales is to sell directly to the end customer. The function of business development is to work through partners to sell to the end customer, in a scalable way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last part is key. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the differentiator. It allows a company to use pre-existing sales teams or communities that a partner has developed to reach new audiences. Sales is very much an equation of capacity, which is why sales teams tend to grow so large. Business development teams, on the other hand, are typically very small, maintaining their small size by working through existing partner infrastructures. The art of business development comes in identifying partners that fit that description, while finding a way to provide value to the partner&amp;#39;s end customer and business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this relationship in a few of the examples I laid out in a previous post on &lt;a href="http://andrewdumont.me/role-of-business-development-startups"&gt;the role of business development at a startup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all of this isn&amp;#39;t meant to de-value the function of sales. Truth be told, I really respect good salespeople. It&amp;#39;s an extremely difficult career, one with constant denial and pressure to succeed. Sales is hard, and should be respected when it&amp;#39;s done at a high level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the two are very different, despite their apparent overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rails AB Testing - Simple Abs</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently turned on paid subscriptions to &lt;a href="https://draftin.com"&gt;Draft, the writing software&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;ve created. And I wanted a really simple way to test a few alternatives of the payment page in Rails without needing to use a separate service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the solutions out there get too complicated. Even the &amp;ldquo;simplest&amp;rdquo; ones require things like Redis. They do that because somewhere the AB testing library needs to remember what variation of a test a user has already seen, so it knows what to show them on subsequent visits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t want to install Redis just to have my AB tests be performant. That&amp;#39;s still an extra network call to Redis for this simple operation, not to mention the added complexity of adding Redis to my software stack when I don&amp;#39;t need it right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#39;t the AB testing library just store what variation a user has already seen in the user&amp;#39;s cookies? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s what SimpleAbs does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add this line to your application&amp;#39;s Gemfile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;gem &amp;#39;simple_abs&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then execute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ bundle
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or install it yourself as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem install simple_abs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create the migration to install the Alternatives table: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails g simple_abs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the migrations: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rake db:migrate
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use simple_abs to figure out an &amp;ldquo;alternative&amp;rdquo; to show your users. You can get ahold of an alternative from either a Rails View or a Controller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="ruby"&gt;ab_test(experiment name, [variation name 1, variation name 2, etc.])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example where I might have three different versions of a buy page. simple_abs will randomly pick which version this user should see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="ruby"&gt;def buy
  @buy_page = ab_test(&amp;quot;buy_page&amp;quot;, [&amp;quot;short&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;medium&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;])

  render action: &amp;#39;buy&amp;#39;
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, in your template, you can use an if statement to show them that version of the @buy_page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="erb"&gt;&amp;lt;% if @buy_page == &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;
  Lots of extra information
&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;#39;ve already seen one of the alternatives, simple_abs figures that out from the permanent cookies of the user. In other words, if on the first visit, this method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="ruby"&gt;ab_test(&amp;quot;buy_page&amp;quot;, [&amp;quot;short&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returns &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo;. On subsequent visits to the page from this same user, you will also get the value &amp;ldquo;short&amp;rdquo; from the ab_test method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your user converts you can call &amp;ldquo;converted!(experiment name)&amp;rdquo; from a View or Controller: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="ruby"&gt;converted!(&amp;quot;buy_page&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also force someone to a specific alternative of your page by using the query paramater &amp;ldquo;test_value&amp;rdquo; in your url: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://draftin.com/buy_things?test_value=long
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get some data you can look at it from a Rails console. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="ruby"&gt;irb(main):011:0&amp;gt; pp SimpleAbs::Alternative.where(&amp;quot;experiment = &amp;#39;buy_page&amp;#39;&amp;quot;).all
  SimpleAbs::Alternative Load (55.1ms)  SELECT &amp;quot;alternatives&amp;quot;.* FROM &amp;quot;alternatives&amp;quot; WHERE (experiment = &amp;#39;buy_page&amp;#39;)
[#&amp;lt;SimpleAbs::Alternative id: 2, which: &amp;quot;short&amp;quot;, participants: 16, conversions: 1, experiment: &amp;quot;buy_page&amp;quot;, created_at: &amp;quot;2013-04-16 05:14:13&amp;quot;, updated_at: &amp;quot;2013-04-16 13:39:14&amp;quot;&amp;gt;,
 #&amp;lt;SimpleAbs::Alternative id: 1, which: &amp;quot;long&amp;quot;, participants: 20, conversions: 1, experiment: &amp;quot;buy_page&amp;quot;, created_at: &amp;quot;2013-04-16 05:11:12&amp;quot;, updated_at: &amp;quot;2013-04-16 14:30:01&amp;quot;&amp;gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you can plug the participants and conversions into a calculator like that found here: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tools.seobook.com/ppc-tools/calculators/split-test.html"&gt;http://tools.seobook.com/ppc-tools/calculators/split-test.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Trials        = simple_abs&amp;#39; participants
Successes     = simple_abs&amp;#39; conversions    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/n8/simple_abs"&gt;Source code available on Github&lt;/a&gt;. Feedback and pull requests are greatly appreciated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This library is very much inspired by the other AB testing libraries out there. Not the least of which is A/Bingo from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patio11"&gt;Patrick McKenzie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;It would be awesome to meet you on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

    <title>The Two Key Ingredients in Great Connected Consumer Products</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24590311425792.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/tom_24590311425792_small.jpg" alt="ElectricIMP-WiFi.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve all had a great idea for a product that would solve a pain we feel directly. It used to be impossible to convey that insight to anyone who might be in a position to act upon it. But that&amp;#39;s all changing because of the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of late, it&amp;#39;s becoming increasingly easier for consumers to share their ideas for great products and bring them to market. One great example of this is a company called &lt;a href="http://www.quirky.com"&gt;Quirky&lt;/a&gt; which solicits ideas from a community of people all over the world. It refines the ideas, prototypes them, leveraging the insights of the community and then manufactures these products and sends them to retailers. Quirky solves many of the challenges in bringing products to market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe great product design and simple connectivity will be the defining principle of success for connected consumer products. For many products, connectivity to the Internet breathes magic into once static objects. That&amp;#39;s the vision behind one of Redpoint&amp;#39;s investments, Electric Imp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the product design expertise of Quirky with the magic connectivity of Electric Imp enables regular people to dream of new ideas and work with Quirky and Electric Imp to create and bring these new inventions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/electric-imp-partnership/"&gt;Electric Imp, Quirky and GE, all partners in innovation&lt;/a&gt;, will solicit ideas for connected devices and then work to build these products and bring them to market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a great idea for a new connected product, &lt;a href="http://www.quirky.com/session/new"&gt;submit your idea&lt;/a&gt;. You may see it on store shelves before the holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>100 Breath Meditation, 30 day challenge</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;My heart goes out Boston, one of my favorite cities. Be well.  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday it seems we&amp;#39;re bombarded with stress. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s current world events, other times it&amp;#39;s our jobs or family &amp;ndash; everyone&amp;#39;s list of stressors is different, but I&amp;#39;m sure you can relate.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;#39;ve become an fan of meditation to help reduce stress. The only problem is that (for me) it&amp;#39;s really hard to sit still for 30+ minutes a day. So when I say I&amp;#39;m a fan of meditation, I really am just that, an outsider fanboy that likes the idea, but never really does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was having a conversation w/ my friend Philip Rosedale. Philip is a tech genius (&lt;a href="http://foundation.bz/3/"&gt;don&amp;#39;t believe me?&lt;/a&gt;), and he&amp;#39;s also a big fan of counting as a form of meditation (check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philiprosedale"&gt;his twitter&lt;/a&gt;, he counts to 10,000 every single day). Philip was sharing with me the positive and relaxed mental state you can achieve with counting meditation, so I thought I&amp;#39;d give it a try.  &amp;hellip;and&amp;hellip; I can&amp;#39;t do it. For me, counting to 10,000 or even 1,000 is next to impossible. But it got me thinking, what if I took traditional &amp;#39;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati"&gt;following the breath&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; meditation and combined it with counting. I gave it a shot and noticed some immediate (calming) results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;100 Breath Meditation&lt;br&gt;
Eliminate distractions, shut off the TV, turn off your music, and minimize your real-time bitcoin currency tracker (I&amp;#39;m a buyer at 50). Close your eyes and follow your breath. Don&amp;#39;t try to change or influence your breath (faster or slower), simply observe the inhale and exhalations. Now, after you&amp;#39;ve settled (3-5 breaths), start to count each breath in your head:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; inhale/exhale, 1 &amp;ndash;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ndash; inhale/exhale, 2 &amp;ndash;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your goal for the day is to hit 100. If you make it to 10 and the phone rings, start with 11 later that day. Ideally you&amp;#39;d go to 100 in one session, but somedays (like today for me, I&amp;#39;m at 50) it will require going back a few times. If you find your mind wondering, don&amp;#39;t get upset or agitated &amp;ndash; gently bring your mind back to your breath and resume counting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join me&lt;br&gt;
Starting today, I&amp;#39;d like to challenge you to 30 days of 100 Breath Meditation. To join the fun, download &lt;a href="http://lift.do/"&gt;the Lift iPhone app&lt;/a&gt;, then search for and join &amp;ldquo;100 Breath Meditation&amp;rdquo;. This app allows you to track positive habits in your life (sorry no android version yet). It&amp;#39;s been a couple weeks for me and I&amp;#39;m really seeing very positive results, I hope this helps you on your path to enlightenment. Cheers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where is the line between informing and exploiting?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How much coverage is too much, and when does the saturation of coverage of an event like the Boston Marathon bombing inadvertently serve the goals of the attackers? It&amp;#39;s an excellent question asked by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateGardiner"&gt;Kate Gardiner&lt;/a&gt; about the coverage of the explosion on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wonder how much we&amp;rsquo;ve rewarded the bomber(s) by inundating them with coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kate Gardiner (@KateGardiner) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateGardiner/status/323943016970743808"&gt;April 15, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My reply was simple&amp;mdash;perhaps simplistic, actually&amp;mdash;we need to draw a line between informing the public and exploiting the victims of this attack. But neither she nor I really know where that line is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of news has fundamentally changed in the nearly 12 years since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. It isn&amp;#39;t worthwhile to list all of the changes, but the rise of mobile phones with video cameras and social media&amp;mdash;especially Twitter&amp;mdash;have made an already ravenous appetite for instant updates nearly insatiable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, is that appetite healthy? &lt;del&gt;Hell if I know.&lt;/del&gt; I&amp;#39;m really not sure. People much smarter than I am have made &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload"&gt;persuasive arguments about too much information being bad for you&lt;/a&gt;. But the appetite exists, and is rooted in simple human curiosity. From a purely practical perspective, it barely matters. You would be hard pressed to find a news organization willing to sit a story as big as the Boston explosion out, even if it&amp;#39;s nowhere near the Northeast. And even if one organization did, there are innumerable other sources where people can turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everyone agrees with that proposition, of course. Some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/323961119293177856"&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; that the coverage is too much, and that it actually &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/giromide/status/323963360498548738"&gt;impedes our understanding&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m not sure. The 24-hour news cycle&amp;mdash;which is much older than the Internet, let&amp;#39;s not forget&amp;mdash;wouldn&amp;#39;t exist if people weren&amp;#39;t consuming that information. News networks need to be more responsible, yes, but I don&amp;#39;t think too much information is the problem. The problem is not enough &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; information. Too many anchors and commentators simply talk to fill up time, and the speculation that engenders is not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Media consumers need to be careful as they decide what to consume. Cable news has a lot of advantages, but too often offers baseless speculation to fill time. And while the Internet has made it so much easier to share news, it also allows misinformation to spread at the same speed. Consumers need to be as cautious and skeptical about unverified reports as journalists should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leads us to the next question: How can a news organization share information in a responsible way? There is a difference between covering a car crash and enabling people to gawk at one. So too is there a difference between keeping people informed and exploiting a tragedy to drive pageviews. I think Gardiner, along with a lot of other people I follow on Twitter, actually did a good job. They see massive amounts of information in their feeds, and they pass along information that has been verified or seems important. That includes locations of coverage for people following the news and information that could be important to people actually in Boston. I think that serves as a very good model for how to cover something like this on Twitter. And the &lt;a href="http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/15/explosions-rock-boston-marathon-finish-line-dozens-injured/yLhfDT1XC3HXSa8wPiVijL/story.html?camp=id"&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; did a really terrific job pulling together a story quickly that answers the questions it can and explains why it can&amp;#39;t answer others yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to the final question, which is also the first that was asked: Are we serving the bombers&amp;#39; ends with constant coverage? The answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;maybe&amp;rdquo; with a side of I&amp;#39;m not sure it matters. Journalists have a duty to cover tragedies like this responsibly. That means something different than it would have a decade or more ago. But the key word is responsibly. Journalists and commentators need to be clear about what they know and what they don&amp;#39;t know, and put what they do know into perspective. If they do that, even if it is what the attackers want, they&amp;#39;ve done their job.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thiel Fellowship Closing Ceremony Speech</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have come to the conclusion that I suck at blogging on demand and that if I make myself write a post on Monday I will generally tend to wait until the last minute to write it. To counter this, I&amp;#39;m going to try writing every other day and only posting the best two pieces on Monday and Friday. If that still fails, I&amp;#39;ll try every day and Tynan can tell me &lt;a href="http://tynan.com/erryday"&gt;I told you so.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the meantime, as it&amp;#39;s midnight CST here on Monday, here&amp;#39;s the short semi-prepared speech I gave this weekend at the Thiel Fellowship Closing Ceremonies (we all gave a two minute quip about our two years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of surprising things I learned as a Thiel Fellow, but one of the most striking is how quickly two years go by.  Most of my life’s seemed interminably slow, and when I accepted the fellowship two years seemed like forever. But here I am, two years later, and it feels like it’s gone by in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few theories as for why that is.  One of them is that strangely enough, the fact that the Fellowship seems to have passed so quickly is an indication of just how much experience it managed to cram into two short years. Looking back, the entirety of the fellowship feels like one long day of building things, learning, and meeting incredible people. There was no time to realize that time was passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two years, I managed to fail at one startup, learn a ton of lessons, meet an amazing cofounder on an equally amazing trip to Antarctica organized by an also equally amazing mentor, discover, develop, and invent transdermal caffeine, patent transdermal caffeine, and am now in the process of building our new venture with the launch of our flagship product Sprayable Energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve learned a few things along the way. One is a simple one – perseverance and determination, along with experience, goes a long way.  Especially in startups, progress in the short term is incredibly difficult to measure, as it’s more often than not not linear or even sequential. One minute we might be on top of the world, and the next in a massive ditch. And a few minutes after that, we might be on top of the world again. So I’ve learned to not put so much weight on the short term and optimize for the long term, and we’ll see what happens in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lesson was less apparent to me, and that’s that oak trees come from acorns. Richard Hamming gave a great talk called You and Your Research – in it, he noted that great work never came about as the result of trying for the great thing straight off – it always resulted from starting small, and planting the little seeds that ultimately grew into mighty oaks. So I guess what I’ve learned here again is to aim for the long term – I’m very impatient, but there’s no point in trying to build a skyscraper without first setting the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’d like to thank all my fellow fellows and everyone else in the network for being awesome friends and mentors and helping make this experience something I’ll never forget.  And I want to thank my family for always being right behind me, supporting me the entire way. And I’d like to say a word of encouragement to all the incoming fellows – I’m super excited to see what you all do, and we’ll all get there in the end :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>What is the Purpose of Life Anyway, or Why I Feel like the Brother of the Guy in The National</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I feel like I’m the brother of the lead singer in the alt-rock band The National. He has a beard, I have a beard. (Well, sometimes. And by “sometimes” I mean often.) He has made a movie about how he went on tour as an assistant tour manager. I feel like I’m also a bystander, covering things with a casual bipartisan interest. We’re both members of the crowd, linked in an inextricable way to something famous and unattainable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today I talked to an engineer from a company called Detroit Electric. It’s not a utility. They’re making a sports car that can go 190 miles on a charge, which is like having an expensive (and drive-able) smartphone. Brilliance reveals itself in short phrases. The engineer had The Bill Gates Pause where you can almost see neurons connecting inside his head, processing a millions things but only giving you a snippet. They pause because, like God, if they gave us everything at once we would die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand how the brother of the guy in The National feels. You’re sidelined while the superstar gets the attention. The band, quite curiously, has two sets of brothers and then the lead singer. When I read on Pitchfork that the lead singer fully understands he’s the only one with a brother not in the band, I felt a strong pang of recognition. (I will tell you the story of my own brother someday, but it won’t be sarcastic in any way.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalism is about revealing greatness. As writers, we’re not creating as much as divulging. We stand in front of the open window of innovation and say, see &amp;ndash; here is a ticket to bountiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to an event in Las Vegas not long ago where this became strikingly clear. We all struggle with a desire to be famous &amp;ndash; that’s why Facebook exists. We have something to say, and we feel other people would be interested in hearing it. I suppose this is what it means to be human, e.g.,  expressing a desire to be heard. As the film critic Roger Ebert, recently passed, once said: we all have a desire for someone  to document us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The invitation to the event made me think my attendance was a matter of solemn duty. My presence was requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I showed up with a friend of mine, perennially positioned as my photographer. We greeted the host and found our place. Within a few minutes, the host said there was someone she wanted me to meet. I told my friend, grab your camera. We chit-chatted for awhile, and &amp;ndash; being incapable of being anything but inquisitive, I started asking questions. &amp;ldquo;Ah, yes. I bet that was a memorable experience.&amp;rdquo; I jotted down a few notes, then felt a soft tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone else needed by attention. I felt a glint of import. I rattled through a few more questions; we snapped a few more pictures. Then it hit me. I had not been invited to partake of the event. I had been invited to cover the partakers. I was there to make sure the invited guests felt invited. I was the person doing the covering; I was not the covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be a difficult role. There is power in the selection process, but it is a limited power. Once, at a car event in LA, I started asking questions about a new model coming out from Nissan. The engineer could tell when I was asking questions that could help him. It was a seven passenger model, something like a minivan but not as ridiculous. So I asked about safety, and legroom, and surround-sound. Then I switched gears. I asked about the molding on the side, the carbon fiber accents &amp;ndash; the inner-workings. I had strayed off message. Owing to my penchant to explore something until it is no longer explorable, I had (excuse the pun) driven too far away from the landing site. He cut me off and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is that? Because there is a role to play. In tech journalism in particular, we are not uncovering a secret slavery operation in Congo. We’re not wiretapping for a drug ring. It’s one shiny object after another, strung up on URLs like Christmas lights for a season, only to be removed and replaced by other shiny objects. Make it too ornate and people get confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that’s why I do this blog. Granted, part of it is that I can be wholly unedited. There’s freedom in knowing I am not covering anything. At the same time, it is a way to combat the impertinence of reviewing yet another inkjet printer. You can only say so many things about toner cartridges, although I hear Brother International has some big news on that front.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lead with Pain</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want more people to read my blog. I spend all this time writing; I don&amp;#39;t want it to bore people. I want it to be more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So part of the way I&amp;#39;m trying to accomplish that is to become a better storyteller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I learn more about storytelling and I look at what good storytellers do, I notice many of them don&amp;#39;t just lead with &amp;ldquo;once upon a time&amp;rdquo;. They lead with pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they&amp;#39;ll even start a story in the middle. They&amp;#39;ll open with the main character on their knees, grovelling with a gun to their head. And as the hammer of the gun pulls back. Bam. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re back to the beginning before this painful event has even occurred yet. But they&amp;#39;ve got us hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method of storytelling maybe even seems cliché. So many movies and TV shows use it. It works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then it surprises me how few of us incorporate this method into our own stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people start a blog post with something like, &amp;ldquo;I went to the store the other day,&amp;rdquo; and they quickly lose my interest. I realize I&amp;#39;m going to have to dig to find out how this relates to anything I&amp;#39;m trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if they begin with a description of pain that they&amp;#39;ve gone through, maybe even fixed, now they&amp;#39;ve got my attention. I sit up. I take notice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I craft new things now, I spend a lot of time figuring out that statement of pain I&amp;#39;ll lead with in the first sentence or paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t just do this for blog posts. I&amp;#39;m doing this for my product landing pages. READMEs for open source projects. Emails. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Hoy has written some great stuff on launching products. If you read over this post, &lt;a href="http://unicornfree.com/2012/shut-up-and-take-my-money-or-how-to-pitch-so-people-will-listen"&gt;Shut Up and Take my Money&lt;/a&gt;, you might notice Amy has similarly discovered the power in leading with pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She used to talk about a new product she was working on like this: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential customer at cocktail party&lt;/strong&gt;: So, what’s Charm?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Charm is a new, end-to-end customer support tool. It solves the problem of passing around email as a specification of work&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when she started leading with a pain that she and her potential customer might share: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential customer&lt;/strong&gt;: So, what’s Charm?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you get a lot of support email? Yeah, me too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People started paying a lot more attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;It would be awesome to meet you on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

    <title>Founders, Equip Your Champions</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24588656872344.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/tom_24588656872344_small.jpg" alt="carabiners.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a founder, you&amp;#39;re always selling. You&amp;#39;re selling yourself, your team, your product, your company. But your pitch is likely missing one of two key components. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pitch needs to accomplish two goals to be effective. Most pitches solve the first, but omit the second. First, the pitch must convince the audience who might be investors, employees, recruits, or customers of some premise. Second, the pitch has to equip your champions, now convinced of your argument, to sell on your behalf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No enterprise software is ever bought unilaterally. No candidate is ever hired in isolation. No investment decision is ever made by one person in a VC firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whomever you&amp;#39;re pitching will need to convince another person or group of people. So your pitch should be structured to enable those champions to be effective by providing a be simple, relatable and intriguing argument to build momentum within whatever organization is making the decision whether a VC fund, a family or a business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you structure such an argument? One approach I&amp;#39;ve found that works well is a three pronged argument delivered in less than a minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A change is inevitable, that change implies a big opportunity, and this is the right team or product to help us take advantage of that change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your sales pitch, ideally at the end of the pitch, equip your champion with an argument like this. It will empower your champion to be more effective and help you close that sale. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Managing My Network</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, a co-worker asked me how to manage all the people in their network. I guess since my last company was a Social CRM, people seem to think I actually have a clue about managing my network.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s just start by saying there is no magic solution or bullet &amp;ndash; it really just takes time and effort. To help him out, I started compiling a list of the tools and techniques I use with the folks in my network and how I incorporate them into my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, I don&amp;#39;t think any company has solved the main problem of a centralized address book that adds great context. We are all becoming too connected and that&amp;#39;s not going to slow down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, knowing who matters most, who matters now and having the right information about those people is still too hard but there are some great products that, if pieced together, can start to make it easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I broke out my favorite products into the following three categories below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 1: Smart Address Books:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I look for mobility here. I also want it to be close to my inbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brewster.com/"&gt;Brewster&lt;/a&gt; Only iOS. This has become my main address book. I go here before I send emails, need to search for someone or when I&amp;#39;m just bored and wondering who I haven&amp;#39;t talked to in a while. Steven Greenwood, the founder, has a great vision for making this the smart address book we are all looking for and he&amp;#39;s tackling the hard problems first (merging common contacts, de-duplicating, trending, etc so I&amp;#39;m really bullish on this getting better. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite features:&lt;/strong&gt; Search by location and expertise across every network. Merging email, all social channels and address book. Great UI. Smart Lists for falling out of touch, trending, etc. The ability to email multiple people from a search or group at the same time, to, Cc and Bcc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xobni.com/"&gt;Smartr&lt;/a&gt; - iOS, Androind, BlackBerry, Outlook and Gmail (originally was Xobni plugins). I don&amp;#39;t use this anymore but it has some great features that add context to your contacts which other platforms don&amp;#39;t have. It&amp;#39;s much like Brewster, not as sexy and I don&amp;#39;t like the UI as much. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite features:&lt;/strong&gt; When you view a contact, it reminds you of the first day you met and what you talked about on that day. &lt;em&gt;Ex. You emailed Mike 6 months ago about &amp;ldquo;Subject of the email&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cobookapp.com"&gt;Cobook&lt;/a&gt; - Native Mac app, iPhone soon - This is really a merged address book with not a lot of magic built in, yet. Simple and native is the selling point here but products just for contacts and communication I&amp;#39;d much prefer to have mobile first. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite features:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrates directly into the mac menu bar for quick access. Easy tagging and merging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/"&gt;Full Contact&lt;/a&gt; - Web only. This has a lot of power in the backend to go out and find all of the social profiles based on your current email addresses you have for your contacts. Very good for developers who want to access the API and build contextual apps based on social data and context. The UI is all web and feels much like a spreadsheet with more bells and whistles. I haven&amp;#39;t spent much time here as the design doesn&amp;#39;t make me excited and seems like a lot of work. I think they should focus on solving the merging and relationship problem between all of the contact data and just power all of the other consumer apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 2: Social Context and Address Books:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;These are contact solutions in context of where you are already working. This is more about serendipity and finding common connection at the right time with the right common connection or information that helps build better relationships. This is my favorite thing and really over time I can look back and see so many relationships that have started just because I acted on a piece of info that provided a bridge or common ground to start a conversation with someone I would not of otherwise known. Always trying to add value.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rapportive.com"&gt;Rapportive&lt;/a&gt; - Web browser (Gmail). Social profiles, notes and ability to connect and chat on social inside of gmail compose and read screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mon.ki"&gt;Monki&lt;/a&gt; - Web and iOS soon. Better search in gmail, google search and in context with any article you are reading on the web. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite features:&lt;/strong&gt; If I&amp;#39;m reading an article on TechCrunch and people I know have also talked about it or shared it, it will let me know. If I&amp;#39;m writing an email address in gmail, it expands the search results to all my contacts and &lt;a href="http://cl.ly/image/0y433d2n3v3W"&gt;gives me a social profile directly in Gmail.&lt;/a&gt; While viewing any webpage, click the Mon.ki browser plugin and discover all of the people you know who work at that company. &lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m an advisor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://zokuapp.com/"&gt;Zoku&lt;/a&gt; - Email. This is a service that tries to pull updates from your social networks and find information that is important and reminds you of things they think you&amp;#39;d want to connect with them about beyond birthday&amp;#39;s and babies. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite feature:&lt;/strong&gt; Sends me an email which I can easily browse. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://writethat.name"&gt;Writethatname&lt;/a&gt; - Gmail. I use this service but actually never know I&amp;#39;m using it. It scans your email and pulls out signature blocks, Twitter handles, Facebook links, Linkedin, etc and automatically updates your Google contacts address book in Gmail. This comes in valuable later. (Also, all the other services that work with Google contacts will automatically pull this updated info that is scraped)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Category 3: Social CRM:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;These tools are more if you spend your time tracking relationships over time and have a business need to do something. Fundraising, sales, biz dev.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nimble.com"&gt;Nimble&lt;/a&gt; - Web and mobile (paid after 1 user). Great profiles for all of your contacts and this tool is really about tracking all of your relationships and tracking your interactions to where they are at in the deal or sales pipeline. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite feature:&lt;/strong&gt;  If I talk to someone on Twitter, it logs that conversation in a master profile so I know where and what we&amp;#39;ve chatted about before if I&amp;#39;m chatting through another platform like email, Facebook, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://contactually.com"&gt;Contactually&lt;/a&gt; - Web. This is really focused around the follow up and the reminders. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite features:&lt;/strong&gt;  They give you goals per week to achieve based on your past performance. &lt;a href="http://cl.ly/image/3X201X2W2A40"&gt;Simple email reminders&lt;/a&gt; about follow up with contacts you are losing contact with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What do I use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After BlackBerry acquired us and shut down Gist 6 months ago, I exported about 20,000 contacts and ended up with a bunch of CSV files. This was one of those WTF moments. This is why Gist started, contacts in spreadsheets. So, I&amp;#39;m still working on my best process but right now I&amp;#39;ve found a great new flow with the following;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapportive in Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mon.ki always running in background of browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writethat.name updating Gmail contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brewster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoku just emails me weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contactually emails me weekly for followups &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSV and VCF files saved in Dropbox :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to remember is this: &lt;strong&gt;Technology Doen&amp;#39;t Replace Great Relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to remember is that technology doesn&amp;#39;t solve or create great relationships, it can just makes it easier and more manageable in a world where everyone is becoming too connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the right information to find a common interest or way to be helpful to everyone you meet or would like to meet is one of the most powerful things everyone can and should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people try to justify the time spent interacting with people to what they get out of it. That&amp;#39;s not how you build relationships. The good things that come from relationships are a byproduct, not an outcome. There&amp;#39;s no end game. Give more than you ask, never expect anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s world, meeting people is easy, creating real relationships is the hard part. Use these products to find opportunities and be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>3D Printing Is Here</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/cadelllast_24587739058716.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/cadelllast_24587739058716_small.jpg" alt="Mojo_Engineer-removing-part-small-e1343959687750.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week my friend and I had an interesting discussion on the nature of &amp;ldquo;revolutions&amp;rdquo;.  We both agreed that when historians look back at our era (1990-2010) they will say that we were living through the &amp;ldquo;internet revolution.&amp;rdquo;  However, did it &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like we lived through a revolution?  Well, even though the internet fundamentally changed everything we do, the transition to a world built around the internet didn&amp;#39;t feel like a revolution to me.  It just sort of felt normal.  Of course, part of that has to do with my age (I&amp;#39;m 26 so I grew up with the revolution).  However, this brings up an interesting aspect of revolution: we seem to impose revolution on the past.  We construct the narrative of revolution.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example the two most famous historical revolutions: the agricultural and the industrial.  For someone living through either revolution, they would not have known they were actually living through what we now see as a significant turning point in the narrative of human existence.  In fact, both of those revolutions happened at imperceptibly slow paces compared to the internet revolution.  The agricultural revolution diffused so slowly that it developed in five different geographic regions independently.  The industrial revolution only had one diffusion center, however its global spread took centuries.  The internet revolution arguably took about 10-20 years (even though some would argue it won&amp;#39;t be complete until the end of this decade when almost every human will be online and connected).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I wrote a post explaining that we should anticipate a &lt;a href="http://theratchet.ca/robot-sex-revolution"&gt;robot revolution&lt;/a&gt; in the 2020s-2030s that will change the world more than the internet did between 1990-2010.  However, I&amp;#39;m getting ahead of myself again because I think we should realize that we are on the cusp of an equally revolutionary moment in history &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;: the 3D printing revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you accuse me of using the word revolution too liberally, let me first list the developments in the world of 3D printing this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;design for &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21121061"&gt;first 3D printed building&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production of &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-21328109"&gt;first 3D printed stem cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creation of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/02/3-d-food-printer-space/"&gt;first 3D printed meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production of &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9883441/Scientists-create-artificial-ear-using-3D-printing-and-living-cell-gels.html"&gt;first 3D printed artificial ear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creation of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/autopia/2013/02/3d-printed-car/"&gt;first 3D printed automobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production and implant of &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2289726/Patient-75-cent-SKULL-replaced-3D-printed-implant-groundbreaking-operation.html#ixzz2MyroZhti"&gt;first 3D printed skull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production of &lt;a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-faux-synthetic-tissue-3d-printer-self-assembling-20130404,0,6286611.story"&gt;first 3D printed human tissue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creation of &lt;a href="http://singularityhub.com/2012/04/07/on-demand-robots-from-a-3d-printer/"&gt;first 3D printed robots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;opening of &lt;a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/2013/01/21/3d-print-museum-opens-in-beijing-china/"&gt;first 3D print-only museum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all things that have happened &lt;em&gt;this year&lt;/em&gt; and it is only April!  Is it safe to say that 2013 is going to be remembered as the year of the 3D printer?  Actually, maybe it will be remembered for the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21614176"&gt;introduction to 4D printing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil"&gt;Ray Kurzweil&lt;/a&gt; explained that dynamic systems evolve exponentially.  He called this type of evolution the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil.27s_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns"&gt;Law of Accelerating Returns&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns"&gt;you can read more about this law here&lt;/a&gt;).  The Law of Accelerating Returns has profound implications for the future of technological evolution, especially when applied to something like 3D printing.  However, I don&amp;#39;t think you have to be a technological evolution expert to understand that the human future will be fundamentally transformed by 3D printing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my perspective all the developments in 3D printing this year indicate that we are on the cusp of a revolution.  What does our world look like when manufacturing becomes decentralized?  Many experts predict that affordable, easy-to-use 3D printers will be in peoples homes in 10-20 years.  These printers could be used for replacing spare parts, making food/meals, creating clothing, furniture, cars &amp;hellip; organs?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many 3D printing enthusiasts propose that you will only be constrained by your own imagination.  &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351910088/3doodler-the-worlds-first-3d-printing-pen"&gt;Check out the 3Doodler&lt;/a&gt; as an example of the type of creative products that will emerge over the next few decades.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decentralization of manufacturing will almost certainly change the global economy in ways that are hard to predict.  Will there be jobs for anyone in the manufacturing sector?  What type of value will physical objects have when production is inexpensive?  How will 3D printing (and advanced Watson-like A.I.) transform hospitals?  Will individual people be able to create established companies that required hundreds of people to build in the past (e.g., automobile, clothing companies, etc.).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to contemplate more sinister sides to this revolution.  How will we protect biological information?  Will someone be able to manufacture and print a deadly virus or bacterium?  What about the possibility of an individual 3D printing weapons of mass destruction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the developments in 3D printing this year force us all to contemplate questions like this (both positive and negative).  In terms of the future of manufacturing, we may get a glimpse of what this revolution will look like if we analyze what is happening in media today.  I feel as though the internet revolution decentralized media mediums, enabling individuals to build their own empires.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BoraZ"&gt;Bora Zivkovic&lt;/a&gt; brilliantly explored the dynamics of this transition well in a &lt;a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/incubator/2013/04/02/how-to-break-into-science-writing-using-your-blog-and-social-media-sci4hels/"&gt;recent Scientific American article on science writing&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In the 20th century] very few people could afford to own printing presses, radio and TV studios, etc. Running all that complicated equipment required technical expertise and professional training. Thus media became locked up in silos, hierarchical, broadcast-only with little-to-none (and then again centrally controlled) means for feedback. There was a wealthy, vocal minority that determined what was news, and how to frame it, and the vast majority was consuming the news in silence. Today, all one needs is some source of electricity (e.g., a small battery in your smartphone) and some means of accessing the Internet. The act of publishing is reduced to clicking on the “Publish” button. Yes, this still leaves some people out of the media, especially in the developing countries, but compared to just twenty years ago, vastly larger numbers of people now have access to the means of production of news. The obstacles to access – money, technical skills for running the machinery – are now much, much lower, almost free. This turns everything on its head! Silos are breaking down, economics of media are severely disrupted, former gatekeepers are squealing in distress, old hierarchies are broken down (and replaced by new hierarchies), and now everyone has to learn new “media hygiene” practices: who to trust, how to filter the information, how to organize it for one’s self. The new ecosystem now contains both the traditional outlets and the individuals, “people formerly known as the audience“, as equal players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several examples of dominant media outlets today that would not have been possible before the internet revolution.  I feel as though we will be able to say the same about automobile, clothing, computer, robotics, biotech companies, etc. in the 2030s.  So if you are in business (or want to get into business), understanding how the &lt;a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns"&gt;Law of Accelerating Returns&lt;/a&gt; applies to the 3D printing industry could be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll end by adding that my roommate (who is in business) always tells me that the worlds of science and business don&amp;#39;t communicate enough.  I agree, but when I study &lt;a href="http://theratchet.ca/chimpanzee-fire-1"&gt;chimpanzee behaviour&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://theratchet.ca/another-earth"&gt;future of exoplanet detection&lt;/a&gt; there may not be any relevance to the business world.  However, people who study technological evolution can definitely help inform those in business (and vice versa).  So if you are interested in learning more about what some leading theorists think about how the next few decades of technological change will transform business (and our planet), check out &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceEog1XS5OI"&gt;this panel discussion&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Big Think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you think 3D printing will change our world?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Home hasn't failed, it's just getting started.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/owen_24586398627984.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/owen_24586398627984_small.jpg" alt="att-htc-first-android-facebook.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected when something interesting is released, the posts begin to roll in about how it&amp;#39;s a failure. We&amp;#39;ve already got a ton of articles with titles like &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020769323_ptechfacebookreviewxml.html"&gt;steer clear of Facebook Home&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2013/04/12/facebook-home-suffers-from-poor-early-reviews-as-46-give-it-a-1-star-rating-on-google-play/"&gt;Facebook Home suffering from poor Google Play reviews&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and in traditional Forbes fashion &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2013/04/08/why-the-facebook-phone-will-fail-and-why-it-really-doesnt-matter/"&gt;Why The Facebook Phone Will Fail and Why It Really Doesn&amp;#39;t Matter&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wish the media wasn&amp;#39;t so quick to jump to conclusions. Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/htc_chacha-3787.php"&gt;historically a Facebook phone hasn&amp;#39;t panned out well&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, &lt;a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/windows-phone/22020/microsoft-android-too-complicated-facebook-home-old-and-way"&gt;Microsoft apparently thinks they already did that&lt;/a&gt;. The thing about all of this is that &lt;em&gt;none of these people are the target market.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at this from the perspective of the Android community then yes, Facebook Home is a stupid idea because it dumbs down Android. But, for everyone else out there that doesn&amp;#39;t care about tinkering with their phone it&amp;#39;s perfect. There&amp;#39;s nothing to it, just scroll through your feed and interact or send a text. You&amp;#39;ve got the capability to install Android applications if you want and that&amp;#39;s a bonus, but the two big parts of many potential buyer&amp;#39;s life is front and center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those potential buyers? Teenagers. Young adults. The Facebook generation that is stuck interacting 24/7. They&amp;#39;re sharing as soon as they wake up and go to sleep. This market doesn&amp;#39;t like making phone calls. One of the biggest criticisms of Facebook Home is that it &lt;a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/04/12/review-facebook-home-at-centre-stage-of-phone-makes-other-apps-harder-to-reach/"&gt;makes other apps hard to reach&lt;/a&gt;. I agree, but the teenagers I know really only use Facebook and SMS anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Home isn&amp;#39;t targeted at those who go and manually download it from the Play Store. The application has bad reviews because it&amp;#39;s never It&amp;#39;s not destined for any member of the Android community or even those who currently use a smartphone. It&amp;#39;s targeted at a new generation of young people who don&amp;#39;t actually use their phone as a &lt;em&gt;phone&lt;/em&gt; anymore. It&amp;#39;s intended as a preinstalled experience that some will intentionally seek to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of declaring Facebook Home &amp;ldquo;dead&amp;rdquo; by our standards, let&amp;#39;s wait to see how the HTC First does in the market. That&amp;#39;ll speak much louder than existing Android users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A $99 phone that does 100% of what teenagers need is better for parents who might have otherwise been buying them an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There are no shortcuts</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sparking foundation for this belief is the tech startup I tried to found with no technical background. It failed, I learned lots of &amp;#39;lessons&amp;#39;, and I realized I needed to get technical and bring something to the table before trying again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while later, I chanced upon the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/%7Erobins/YouAndYourResearch.html"&gt;You and Your Research&lt;/a&gt; talk by Richard Hamming, and it made a lasting impact on me. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking and referring to it for probably over a year now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main takeaway: Oak trees come from acorns. In the talk, Hamming goes on to note the &amp;#39;Nobel Prize effect&amp;#39; - the fact that no great work is generally done by a recipient of a Nobel Prize or similar distinction after receiving the award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn&amp;#39;t the way things go. So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I will give you my favorite quotation of many years. The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any institution has created, judged by what they did before they came and judged by what they did after. Not that they weren&amp;#39;t good afterwards, but they were superb before they got there and were only good afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so there are two lessons here. One, which I learned from firsthand experience, is that you can&amp;#39;t try to build a house without a foundation, no matter how fast you want that house built and how too impatient you are to do it right. It will inevitably come crashing down - hopefully, if you&amp;#39;re very lucky, very quickly, and if you&amp;#39;re unlucky, somewhere down the line after you&amp;#39;ve already moved in and it crushes you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time to do things right - a shortcut will end up costing much more time in the long run as things come crashing to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, optimize for the long run. Constantly aiming for the short term, particularly in the frantic and ever-changing startup world (hoping to build a lot of hype, raise a lot of money, and get acquired in two years), tends to encourage the taking the illusory shortcuts which have the fate of failure stamped on them from the very outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, as Hamming said it best, it&amp;#39;s okay not to go for the big thing straight off - take the time to plant the seeds and have the determination to nurture the seedling as it grows over many long years. If you want to grow a huge oak tree, &lt;em&gt;the only way to do it is to plant a tiny acorn and wait for it to grow&lt;/em&gt;. If you try anything else you&amp;#39;re wasting your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps, there&amp;#39;s no need to try to be the next Google or the cure to cancer straight off - take your time and start small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since this is a post rife with pithy and trite statements: The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;ll take time. There&amp;#39;s no getting around that. So get going - now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LEAKED: Twitter's Music App will integrate Spotify, Rdio, iTunes, Soundcloud, Vevo and Youtube</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, I came across &lt;a href="http://music.twitter.com"&gt;http://music.twitter.com&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, I inspected the HTML source just to see if there were any :hidden gems. There were none, bar one curious line of code that caught my eye. The image for the &amp;#39;Sign In&amp;#39; button linked to the &lt;em&gt;/_login/&lt;/em&gt; directory — and so my journey began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;background: url(/_login/btn-login-states.png) no-repeat 0 0;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited &lt;em&gt;/_login/&lt;/em&gt; I was presented with a page that looks something like a 404.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/youssef_24584349199392_small.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my curiosity, I inspected the source of this new page. This time, the CSS document was a lot different. It contained the entirety of the App&amp;#39;s UI. A quick scan revealed a whole lot of words that implicate a very clear picture of what Twitter intends to do with this new Music product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it&amp;#39;s an App, which I guess was obvious; but it seems there will be a mobile app and desktop app (web), as indicated in the page footer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--a href=&amp;quot;/download&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Get the App&amp;lt;/a--&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be able to connect with Spotify, Rdio, iTunes, Soundcloud, Vevo and Youtube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iconmusic-spotify-connect-btn{background-position:-4431px -0px;height:32px;width:179px}

.iconmusic-player-source-rdio{background-position:-2801px -0px;height:19px;width:30px}

.iconmusic-player-source-itunes{background-position:-2751px -0px;height:19px;width:30px}

.iconmusic-player-source-soundcloud{background-position:- 2851px -0px;height:14px;width:92px}

.iconmusic-player-source-vevo{background-position:-2963px -0px;height:9px;width:53px}

.youtube-vid player{position:absolute;padding:10px;height:200px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The music controller even looks like a CD. oooh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/youssef_24584356587078_small.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users –or should that be customers?– will be able to buy songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iconmusic-player-btn-buy{background-position:-1167px -0px;height:49px;width:49px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt; content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/youssef_24584359038372_small.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be able to follow other users, presumably this will be unrelated to their Twitter followers/following lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iconmusic-profile-large-following-btn{background-position:-2046px -0px;height:36px;width:70px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be charts and shows, whatever they are. Perhaps charts will work similar to trending topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iconmusic-menu-charts{background-position:-142px -0px;height:28px;width:28px}

.iconmusic-menu-shows{background-position:-190px -0px;height:19px;width:29px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Font is Proxima Nova, distinct from Twitter&amp;#39;s use of Helvetica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;html,body{font-family:ProximaNova-Bold,HelveticaNeue,&amp;#39;Helvetica Neue&amp;#39;,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users will be able to compose Tweets from the music app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.iconmusic-compose-tweet-btn-bg{background-position:-3305px -0px;height:27px;width:65px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artists will have Biographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.artist-bio{height:484px;width:484px}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often spot things &lt;a href="http://sefsar.com/nokia-faked-the-still-photos-too"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;, so if you liked this post you can &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ys"&gt;follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Twitter have since replaced the CSS file with &lt;a href="https://music.twitter.com/e/error.css"&gt;this file&lt;/a&gt;. They have also removed all unnecessary image assets.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>App-Market Fit: If You Aren't On My Homescreen, Your App Is Probably a Tombstone</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine asked me last week, &amp;ldquo;So, what apps do you use?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a good question, so I whipped out my iPhone and started looking through.  I was shocked to see I have 102 apps on my phone.  Wow, that&amp;#39;s a lot of apps, I thought to myself.  Then I started scrolling through and realized how many of them I hadn&amp;#39;t touched in&amp;hellip; well, since I could last remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead apps.  Tombstones of a great app description and a non-compelling solution.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row after row of dead apps.  And surprisingly, all of them lived on screens after my homescreen.  The homescreen. Turns out it&amp;#39;s home to all of those apps I&amp;#39;d say I use either daily, weekly or really frequently during short infrequent bursts.  iMessage, Google Maps, App Store, Twitter, Facebook, Evernote, Couple, Zaarly, Instagram, Tripit and even Tetris (my guilty pleasure while wasting a few minutes).  Go one screen in and it&amp;#39;s a wasteland.  I did a count and of the ~90 apps not on my homescreen, two I&amp;#39;d used in the past week (Weather &amp;amp; LinkedIn) and four in the last month (Timehop, Bank of America - to deposit a check, Taxi Magic &amp;amp; ParkMobile - to &amp;#39;feed the meter&amp;#39;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoa.  Six apps out of nearly a hundred I could even recall touching in the past month.  A few others I thought I&amp;#39;d use in the future (OpenTable and maybe Flipboard, Uber or Lyft).  It&amp;#39;s shocking if you really think about it&amp;hellip; I&amp;#39;d say 95% of my app activity is locked onto the home screen.  I&amp;#39;m not sure I&amp;#39;d consider myself normal from a smart phone usage pattern, but I wonder if the simplicity of the home screen really is a key.  I can honestly say if Apple &lt;em&gt;forced&lt;/em&gt; me to only have 16 apps, I could do it&amp;hellip; no problem and no issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a lesson in here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you can build a mobile app that your users will and are consistently putting on their homescreen, I don&amp;#39;t think you have App-Market Fit.  Even sixteen apps seems like a lot to incorporate into my life.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking my apps by category, here&amp;#39;s what I saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Five (5) &lt;strong&gt;Communication Apps&lt;/strong&gt; (iMessage, Couple, Twitter, Tweetbot, Facebook)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Two (2) &lt;strong&gt;Photo Apps&lt;/strong&gt; (Camera, Instagram)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Two (2) &lt;strong&gt;Travel Apps&lt;/strong&gt; (Google Maps, Tripit)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Two (2) &lt;strong&gt;Productivity Apps&lt;/strong&gt; (Calendar, Evernote)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; One (1) &lt;strong&gt;Game&lt;/strong&gt; (Tetris)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Three (3) &lt;strong&gt;Utility Apps&lt;/strong&gt; (Settings, App Store, Folder with Calculator+Clock)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;My Own Company&amp;#39;s App&lt;/strong&gt; (Zaarly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2ez21sm.png" alt="My Homescreen"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commonalities are that these apps help me communicate, consume content, capture content and live more productively.  I&amp;#39;d say all are part of my &amp;#39;smart-phone&amp;#39; powered life.  I&amp;#39;m not a huge folders guy (in fact the folder on my homescreen is the only one).  And I&amp;#39;m a very frequent user of the four bottom bar apps (phone, mail, Safari and Music), and I can&amp;#39;t foresee any of the apps above replacing those four (I even tried Mailbox and was &amp;#39;meh&amp;#39; about it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would it take to get your app onto my homescreen?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, you&amp;#39;d probably have to bump one of my Twitter clients or the Settings Apps.  Do-able.  You&amp;#39;d probably be fighting with Open Table, which is &amp;ldquo;On Deck&amp;rdquo; in my brain.  If I was living in SF again, I&amp;#39;d say you&amp;#39;d be fighting with Lyft or Uber.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are building a new app or have an app targeted at smart phone users, I think you need to have a &amp;#39;home screen&amp;#39; strategy.  It&amp;#39;s great to have 96 apps on my phone, but I am really only patronizing the first 16, plus their four compatriots in the bottom bar.  And unless you can convince your users to bump another app and put a spot for you in the &amp;#39;home&amp;#39;, I&amp;#39;m not convinced you can capture mindshare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are a few apps that are doing a good job at capturing Home Screen real estate based on what I hear from friends. The taxi and ride apps such as Uber, Lyft, Sidecar and TaxiMagic are common for frequent taxi takers, but still seem part of the tech set for the most part. Instagram and Path are both common ones I see (Path more in the startup/tech scene though).  Pandora and Spotify seem common homescreen music apps, and I see a few fitness apps such as MyFitnessPal and Nike on home screens.  Yelp, Foursquare and Open Table are each players for real estate.  And games continue to be a common one, but there seems to be little commonality there other than Words With Friends, Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a strategy to get on my homescreen?  Is it something you activity &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; your users, ask for or recommend?  Are there any companies that have done a great job at getting on that home screen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no data to back this up, but I&amp;#39;d bet that 80-90% of any app&amp;#39;s Daily Active Users have that app on the home screen.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is missing from the list?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better address book could snag a spot &amp;ndash; Brewster is trying that route.  Hotel Tonight and Hipmunk could snag a spot for travel, but I don&amp;#39;t find myself booking travel on my phone much.  I also see a spot potentially for online document management, which is currently being fought by DropBox and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And listen, if you think by blasting me with a bunch of push notifications (glares over at Groupon and Living Social apps) that I&amp;#39;m going to put you on the homescreen, you are sadly mistaken.  ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart phones are inherently an extension of the owner.  My apps are personal to me, but I do think it is common that we spend 90% of our time with 5-10% of our apps.  And as you think about your app, figure out how to make something your community and your audience love.  If you build and market something mainstream, you&amp;#39;ll find yourself in the app graveyard and then you&amp;#39;ve got a bunch of downloads and an inactive community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So just what would it take for me to get an app onto your homescreen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Great Grocery Game</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was about 9 o&amp;#39;clock in the morning, early Saturday, with the sun shining and my refrigerator totally empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to buy groceries.  Luckily I live in San Francisco, a city filled with startups who can&amp;#39;t wait to outsource the minutiae of everyday life.  At the tap of a button a complete stranger will come over to my house and live life on my behalf.  It&amp;#39;s both disturbing and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many choices it can be hard to know which one to pick.  So instead of take a gamble, I decided to put them to the test. Three delivery services, head-to-head, in a race to purchase and deliver an identical order of groceries on a Saturday afternoon.  Game on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Experiment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by compiling my grocery list.  I took my last 12 trips to Safeway and built a comprehensive database of every item I had purchased.  From that I crafted a standard basket - the order that I felt was representative of a normal trip.  After a few adjustments to make sure I didn&amp;#39;t get too much food, I ended up with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;: Milk, Cereal, Yogurt, Donuts, Bacon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce&lt;/strong&gt;: Strawberries, Avocado&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Crackers, Soda, Guacamole Mix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner&lt;/strong&gt;: Chicken Breast, Frozen Dinner, Wine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this list may seem simple, it includes some hidden landmines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk - I left a note to check expiration dates and pick up the freshest carton.  I always pull my milk from the back to ensure the longest shelf life in my fridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guacamole mix - I asked for McCormicks, a specialty brand that&amp;#39;s out of the way and hard to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avocado - I left a note to purchase a ripe avocado.  You&amp;#39;d be surprised how many people don&amp;#39;t know how to tell if an avocado is ripe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strawberries - These can be very hit or miss. If you pick the package on top you could end up with a bunch of nasty fruit.  A rational shopper will check for the best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my cart assembled it was time to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Ordering Process&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When ordering on Postmates or Instacart, you start by choosing the store.  You then go through a loop of picking a category, scrolling through the list to find your item, and then adding it to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The merchandising in these apps is terrible.  Sometimes the item you want is right at the top of the list.  Other times you have to scroll through 15 screens of junk to find what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search in these apps can be painful.  Typing in a brand will bring up every single item under that brand name across the store.  When you get in to store brands there&amp;#39;s no way you&amp;#39;ll find what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest value to Instacart over Postmates is the ability to &lt;strong&gt;schedule ahead&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;plan out substitutes&lt;/strong&gt;.  Instacart let&amp;#39;s you take any order and pick the day it will show up where Postmates restricts you to just &amp;ldquo;Get It Now&amp;rdquo;.  You can also pick and choose what alternative items you want on Instacart in the event your favorites are out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ordering on Exec was much simpler in comparison.  Getting an Exec Errand is just a simple text box to fill out.  My typical grocery store process involves my wife texting me a list and me going to the store so it was easy to just copy &amp;amp; paste the list in.  Having simple text is great for fuzzy search.  For example, I asked Exec for the cheapest bacon on sale and I ended up with a much higher quality product at the same price as the others.  The big issue is specificity.  For certain items we struggled with how to word our request such that it was perfectly clear what we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my standard cart and entered it into each app without triggering delivery, double checking each to make sure they were at parity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Cost&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each service has a very different cost structure.  No one service is the best at any pricepoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postmates&lt;/strong&gt; has a dynamic pricing model based on time, demand, distance, and order size.  I paid $12 for delivery on this order, though I&amp;#39;ve seen the price be as low as $7.50.  They also charge a flat 5% fee on top of the purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exec&lt;/strong&gt; has a model that&amp;#39;s purely labor based.  The more time your Exec spends working, the more you pay.  Their rate is $25/hour with a 45 minute minimum.  On top of that, you pay 50¢/mile for travel and a 3% fee on any purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instacart&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s pricing is the most ambiguous.  They charge a flat delivery fee based on order size: $7.99 for under $35 and $3.99 otherwise.  Often on the weekends they will offer free delivery for orders over $60.  Where it gets tricky is that you pay the retail price for grocery items plus an unspecified fee on top.  So if you&amp;#39;re shopping at Safeway where discounting is rampant, it&amp;#39;s not clear just how much more you&amp;#39;re paying.  For my order, the Instacart cost for any food item was ~20% over what I would pay at the checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cost By Order Size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graph helps show how the costs change with order size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Timeline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When noon on Saturday rolled around, I started the race.  I triggered each app simultaneously to delivery my groceries as soon as possible.  I kept a record of every call, text, and push notification I received and compiled them together.  This timeline tracks all communication I received along the way.
&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24575461499826_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_teej_24575461499826_raw.png" alt="grocery-timeline.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Each event is an SMS or Push Notification unless otherwise specified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the orders came in I went through each item and cataloged them along the following criteria&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I get the item I wanted?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When items were unavailable, did I get an acceptable replacement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did they follow my special instructions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the item of a quality I would I have purchased myself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how did they do?  As expected, each service had no problem fulfilling the easy items on my list. Though, for about half of my grocery list, there were problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exec&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453108488_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453108488_raw.jpg" alt="exec.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exec was the first order to arrive with a total delivery time of &lt;strong&gt;65 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.  Exec makes no promises on delivery time and if they run over, it costs you directly.  Of all three services, they were the only ones able to fill my 14 item order. Overall the order quality was top notch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8EC549;"&gt;✔&lt;/span&gt; The strawberries, milk, and guacamole mix came in perfect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8EC549;"&gt;✔&lt;/span&gt; The donuts I wanted were out.  He messaged me through the app and I told him a suitable replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #FFCC33; font-weight: bold;"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; The exec thought the frozen dinner I wanted was out and asked about a replacement.  I realized my description of the item was not specific enough, as he bought the completely wrong thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; The avocado was not ripe. I was never asked about a replacement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Postmates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453535682_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453535682_raw.jpg" alt="postmates.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmates was the second order to arrive with a total delivery time of &lt;strong&gt;75 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.  Postmates promises a 60 minute delivery, making them 15 minutes late.  My postmate was the only competitor who was a woman, a detail that weighed heavily in their favor.  She did a fantastic job on the produce, blowing away everyone on her handling of my avocado request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8EC549;"&gt;✔&lt;/span&gt; The strawberries and milk were great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #8EC549;"&gt;✔&lt;/span&gt; Text messaged me that there were no ripe avocados available in singles, but there were in a 3 pack.  I told them to pick any suitable single avocado.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #FFCC33; font-weight: bold;"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; Text messaged me that the frozen chicken was unavailable, but substituted it with an unnecessarily expensive alternative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; The guacamole mix was substituted with a cheaper variety without consulting me.  This is the variety right next to the avocados in the store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; Postmates did not have bakery items listed and did not have functionality for custom requests.  Therefore I did not get any donuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Instacart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453863660_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.svbtle.com/teej_24583453863660_raw.jpg" alt="instacart.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instacart was the third order to arrive with a total delivery time of &lt;strong&gt;111 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.  They promise delivery within a 3 hour window, so this delivery was well within the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; The milk was not the freshest available, expiring 4 days earlier than the others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; The strawberries were of very poor quality as judged by my wife, the Chief Strawberry Eater&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; Instacart reported that the Guacamole mix was sold out and did not supply a substitute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; The avocado was not ripe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #FFCC33; font-weight: bold;"&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; I got a text message that some items had been substituted.  The chicken had been swapped out for a larger size (1.5lb) and higher coset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #DD5A3C;"&gt;✘&lt;/span&gt; Instacart does not deliver alcohol so I did not receive wine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; Instacart handles custom requests but I failed to place one for the donuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmates was hands down the best &lt;strong&gt;value per dollar&lt;/strong&gt;.  With their inexpensive delivery fees and great accuracy, I feel like I had a great experience relative to the amount I paid.  It&amp;#39;s hard to say whether this was due to the startup or because the competitor was a female and thus had more attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exec excelled at &lt;strong&gt;speed and accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;.  I was stunned by how fast they put my order together and how spot on the items were.  My Exec communicated promptly; I never felt like I was out of the loop.  However, the one thing they messed up on they got majorly wrong, partially due to me not being specific enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instacart wins at &lt;strong&gt;convenience and price&lt;/strong&gt;.  My wife liked the fact that Instacart &amp;ldquo;got the job done without getting in your way&amp;rdquo;.  They try to frontload all of the decision making so you won&amp;#39;t be bothered when the job is happening.  And despite their cloudy pricing model they came out cheapest for small-to-medium shopping trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward I&amp;#39;ll use Exec for all my same-day trips and in the event I need complicated shopping orders. I&amp;#39;ll continue to use Instacart for small, simple orders that I want to plan in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to use &lt;strong&gt;Postmates&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.postmates.com/invitation/c8WoO"&gt;click here to sign up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to use &lt;strong&gt;Exec&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://iamexec.com/j/c6976fa37696aacf1957c89356433f4c"&gt;click here to sign up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;d like to use &lt;strong&gt;Instacart&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="http://inst.cr/t/cSkFJ3"&gt;click here to sign up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to my wife for helping me organize and coordinate this experiment and to Kim MacVaugh for playing along.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tools of the Trade, or Why You Need to Keep a Nail Clipper Handy at All Times</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Journalism is an ancient profession dating back to the early heliomongrel days. (I made that word up, but it sounds old. Also, vaguely veterinarian.) Reporters tapped out articles using a stone tablet, which meant editors did not exist (air five, anyone?). Thankfully, as professions go, journalism has progressed to where it can now serve as an adequate form of income and not just an opportunity for people to flog you or hang you on a pole outside of their hut for making an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, for anyone new to the field, things can be a little daunting. Let&amp;#39;s say you have just registered for a blog. Now what? Do you buy a fedora and a spiral notebook? (No.) Do you start pelting Apple with e-mails asking if you can test an iPad? (Please don&amp;#39;t.) Do you take a speed-typing class so you can blog every 14 seconds about inane subjects? (Not really, but apparently people have done that.) It&amp;#39;s often hard to know exactly what you should do first &amp;ndash; or second, after you have bought a MacBook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a big believer in mentoring, and by &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; I mean I have had too many tacos. Over the years, I have tried to aid the burgeoning career of young writers, mostly by telling them how incredibly difficult it is to get Apple to respond to my e-mails. I will admit I sometimes make up random tips to see if they have any discernment or wherewithal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait outside the office of the Microsoft PR organization. Pick out the oldest person in the group after they get done with a meeting, and slip them some money to see if they will tell you anything about the next version of Windows. Also, pant heavily even if you are not out of breath.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few have been arrested using this tactic. Some are still in prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t claim to be an expert in the field. I think the Columbia Journalism Review is a gadget blog. Last week, I tried to explain what I do in professional terms to someone who was interested in getting a job at a nationally-known magazine or world-famous newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I keep FedEx busy,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In the last month, I purposefully tried to run a snowmobile out of gas to see whether the gauge was accurate, then I installed a thermostat in my hallway. One of my editors asked me to wear nail polish to test a laser keyboard for accuracy and to see if it reacted more to skin tone or finger movement (thankfully, my wife did that test). I wrote a review of the new Vampire Weekend. I played ping-pong with my son. He won.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m a professional router installer. My side job is writing about them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m a whiz at processing e-mail.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shaking his head, he walked away with a look that would make the expression &amp;ldquo;deer-in-the-headlights&amp;rdquo; offensive to deer. He&amp;#39;s now planning for a future in social work or the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m here to help where I can. So I have decided to make a list of the tools you need if you have just started out in this wonderful line of work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. A good nail clipper &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As Gandalf would say, keep them tidy, keep them trim. (I mean if he was talking about fingernails, not the the Ring of Power.) Amazingly, if you do trim your fingernails on a regular basis, you will find you can type faster and more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Extra seat cushions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 They comes in handy. See, you will be sitting for long periods of time. Think: months. I have not moved from my chair since 2004. Once, when I was at the airport with my wife, I overheard a marketing executive describe to a colleague what it would be like to speak at an upcoming conference. He had two pieces of advice. First, he said, make sure you lead off with a joke. Second, speak loudly because most of the journalists are fat, tired, and old. I thought, my gosh he nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Coffee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I have been known to beg for free coffee on Twitter. I have even named specific brands. It is really more like a jet fuel for the mind, an elixir to stir up the mind and promote creativity. If you do not already drink coffee, please consider the field of law enforcement or retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Donuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 They kind of go with the coffee, right? In just about every movie I&amp;#39;ve ever scene where there is a journalist involved there is almost always a donut co-star. You&amp;#39;ll be working late at night, wishing you were doing some sort of investigative bio or uncovering a secret criminal conspiracy and not live-blogging a Samsung event. Donuts help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. A time machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 These help with deadlines. Check with Iran, they just invented one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Wikipedia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 This is one of your most indispensable tools. There are millions of people involved with the site and they all have advanced degrees, at least if you consider &amp;ldquo;having a Gmail account&amp;rdquo; an advanced degree. Some of this encyclopedia is accurate. Part of the joy of using it is discovering what was written by a professional ghost writer on behalf of the profile subject and what was written by a monkey with a good spell checker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Beer&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. A dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Spelling is kind of importent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. A large mirror&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 A like to keep one of these so I can check and see if I&amp;#39;m still breathing. Yup, we&amp;#39;re good. Pressed up against a tight deadline, like a baboon with his face plastered against a glass wall, I like to check and see if all the blood has drained out of my head. Once, I was working so late and typing so fast, I didn&amp;#39;t notice I had fallen asleep. When I woke up, the article I was working on was better than most of the stuff I do when I&amp;#39;m awake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Sigur Rós&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 I hate to think of this Icelandic band as a &amp;ldquo;tool&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; especially when there&amp;#39;s another band with that name. But having a droning percussive ambient rock band handy is good for your productivity level. Also, they sing in gibberish so it&amp;#39;s not distracting like, say, punk rock or Bob Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other tips? Let me know by e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When You Are Your Product</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I became obsessed with the future of work a few years ago, when I was an Associate at Techstars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the youngest associate, I was often asked to be a company&amp;#39;s intern, which turned into a conversation discussing if I knew interns. I quickly became the sherpa between the tech startup scene and my experience-hungry friends. Then, when I ran out of friends, I scaled through NYU clubs and became the product between NYU and the tech startup community. I wanted to build product, but I also wanted to move fast - so I became the product I needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, my job is to evangelize and hire for Betaworks products. I&amp;#39;m essentially employed to become the machine I&amp;#39;ve wanted to build for three years, but on a much bigger scale. And once again, I&amp;#39;ve become the product I&amp;#39;ve wanted to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I create perfect pipelines of every cold email, referral, and potential hire in Streak, which I then share with whoever I want.  I use latent, API filled internal databases to collect up-to-date information on every person and project I come across. And I create perfect shareable marketing materials (in my case job descriptions and specs) so that the buzz can grow around each role beyond my human voice. But there&amp;#39;s so much more to do, and I&amp;#39;m still not a real-time Linkedin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m becoming more automated in my process every day (which is in some ways the leanest form of MVP and in others the messiest). But I&amp;#39;m never going to be able to feel when every talented person is ready to do something that bigger, or to match that person to their perfect process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But having performed around a thousand  experiments that show what&amp;#39;s a real human behavior versus a hypothetical one, I no longer question whether or not the problem&amp;#39;s real. It is, and its buildable, and it&amp;#39;s coming -  and I know the whole competitive landscape, because I try every single one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck serendipity, and fuck connections, and fuck job boards. I&amp;#39;m going to crack this thing. But for now, back to work - and email me if you&amp;#39;re interested in betaworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to comment &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5534406"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Draft: Write Better Report. Plus many other handy tools added.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are many neat &lt;a href="https://draftin.com/"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt; announcements today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context aware comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image hosting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character count&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboard shortcuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the coolest thing. A Write Better Report. Easily see reasons why your published writing is or isn&amp;#39;t getting traffic.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Write Better Report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I promised, Draft isn&amp;#39;t just an online editor. My goal is to make us better writers by investigating the tasks we have as writers and making those tasks simpler and easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One mistake I keep seeing people make, when they publish their writing, is that they don&amp;#39;t pay enough attention to attributes that might affect how much traction that writing will get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;ll publish 2000 word posts, when their audience would prefer 500. Or they publish on Friday night, when no one might be paying attention and Monday morning might be a better idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this type of analysis a lot easier to understand, and help people, including myself, learn what makes our writing get more attention than other writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve launched a feature that&amp;#39;s a little experimental, but I&amp;#39;ve had so much fun using it, I wanted to let you use it already. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any publishers setup in Draft&amp;#39;s settings, you&amp;#39;ll get a Reports button on your home page. (Setup a Twitter account, for example, to get this button.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/0b19uq8DRKiSPbQHOqct" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you click that button you can get a report like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/tdpYJIwcRZ6IJQdEjgLf" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the report tells you is how many Tweets on average your published writing is getting, broken up by various data points: when you published, what day, post length, and reading level. And you can see what attribute is outperforming others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft is using the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_test"&gt;Flesch reading level&lt;/a&gt;. The higher the number the lower the reading level. From Wikipedia, &amp;ldquo;90.0–100.0 is easily understood by an average 11-year-old student. 0.0–30.0 is best understood by university graduates.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you can see if the audience that likes to follow your writing might prefer your days when your writing is more or less sophisticated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Draft&amp;#39;s publishing features to publish to Wordpress and Tumblr, your data will automatically be available in this report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you publish somewhere else or want to add previously published stuff, I&amp;#39;ve got you covered. You can manually record publications you made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just go to edit or view a Draft document (or create a new one) and click the Manually Publish menu item. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6Gq8gDCASTGcyLSRYtG2" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Record what, where, and when you published this document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/a4xCeI04QRWLEzfFfsrU" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you add some data points, you might see some trends in your writing. Maybe you shouldn&amp;#39;t publish on the weekends? Maybe publish in the mornings? Maybe you should make your writing a little easier to understand? Maybe it&amp;#39;s too short? Or too long?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of neat possibilities to explore with this report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Context aware comments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the comment bubble in the lower right corner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/i04rGyhdQRmaAZXPlJVQ" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add comments with the new action menu at the top right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/yHwuO678RRaTea8TLxCD" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments are context aware. If you quote text from your document you&amp;#39;ll see it underlined in your comment. Hover over that quote, and you&amp;#39;ll see where that text is in your document. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/WaQAKqUvR2Wdnc7h0E3A" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now easily add images to your documents. Just use the menu again at the top right, or Shift+Ctrl+I. Pick an image from every cloud service or your local computer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draft will host your image for you and properly format the image to embed it nicely within your text. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Twitter Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use Draft to write and collaborate on your Tweets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to Places to Publish in your Settings to add as many Twitter accounts as you like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new character count feature below, you can make sure to keep the Tweets under 140 characters (yes, it is aware of url shortening on Twitter&amp;#39;s side in its count).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Character Count&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the word count at the bottom right of the page to flip it into a character count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Dw8sTycJRay1r2CqBzaS" alt=""&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s really neat about the count is that the setting will carry over to collaborators. So if you are working on a 500 character email in character mode, your collaborator will also get put into character mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added keyboard shortcuts for common formatting: &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://draftin.com"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. As well as images and comments. Take a peak again at the action menu for what they all are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Improved collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this week if you had a collaborator, they could only see one version of your document. After they made edits, their version wasn&amp;#39;t updated with your latest, making back and forth collaboration difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all been fixed. If you make further edits to your document after your collaborator is done, let them know to take another look at your document, and they&amp;#39;ll automatically be updated to your latest version. If they had any changes that you didn&amp;#39;t accept, they will be moved to a backup draft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it. :) It&amp;#39;s been one month since I publicly launched &lt;a href="https://draftin.com/"&gt;Draft&lt;/a&gt;, and the feedback and use has exceeded everything I expected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much. I hope you enjoy these new features. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stay up to date on Draft, my Twitter account is a good place: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natekontny"&gt;https://twitter.com/natekontny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or the official Draft Twitter account: &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being Bold.</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I emailed my investors and told them we were refocusing our company in a new direction&amp;hellip;  one reply really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have learned that acting from your heart and being bold about it sets the stage for greatness.&amp;rdquo; George Zachary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While pivots tend to have a negative association, our current company wasn&amp;#39;t failing and by many measures it was very successful. COLOURlovers had more than 2 million registered users, was a 5x Webby Awards nominee for Best Community, doing $500k in annual revenue and had organic year over year growth&amp;hellip; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I never intended to build COLOURlovers, it was a weekend project that didn&amp;#39;t die when monday rolled around.  Over the past 7 years it has connected with tens of thousands of people on a deep level&amp;hellip; largely I believe because we made being creative super simple and accessible.  I&amp;#39;m very passionate about the community we created and that empowerment of creativity we enabled, but if I&amp;#39;m honest, wearing the King of Color crown never fit right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had the pleasure of being invited to speak at color conferences &amp;amp; workshops, but my talks are never directly about color and more about creativity.  I run the worlds largest color website &amp;amp; community&amp;hellip; and I&amp;#39;m not all that passionate about color.  What I am and have always been passionate about is the creative process and using technology to enhance that process for millions of people.  Again, if I&amp;#39;m honest, what we were doing was touching on my passion but I felt we could do more.  I felt we could really make a dent in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are now building with &lt;a href="http://creativemarket.com/?utm_source=bubsco&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=being-bold"&gt;Creative Market&lt;/a&gt; is by far a bolder vision that without being cliche, I believe can truly change an industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We launched the marketplace 6 months ago and the response has been awesome. Not just in the personal feedback we get from our sellers &amp;amp; buyers, but for our company too.  We&amp;#39;ve had an evolution purpose internally and it&amp;#39;s been rejuvenating.  The revenue numbers help with inspiration too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we&amp;#39;ve launched and the story we&amp;#39;ve told to date is just a piece of the bold vision we are pursuing.  This week we announced our platform and along with it a big part of the rest of our story.  CreativeMarket.com, in itself is doing things to improve, evolve and enhance the stock media &amp;amp; digital content market.  We&amp;#39;ve simplified licensing for buyers, gave sellers the most fair cut of sales compared to our competitors and brought all the different types of content we buy under one roof and enjoyable experience.  But, in an always-online world where every piece of creative software has an asset that can make somebody&amp;#39;s life easier, what we are doing with a platform will change everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try not to make bold predictions about the future, but I&amp;#39;m confident that not so long from now every app &amp;amp; creative software will have a living breathing marketplace built right into it&amp;hellip; and we&amp;#39;re working hard to cement ourselves into the foundation of this in-app commerce evolution.  It&amp;#39;s pretty crazy when you think about it; you fire up word or pages and the first thing you are presented with is an assortment of template types to help you get started&amp;hellip; because starting with a blank canvas is always the hardest part.  But those templates are limited and stagnant.  You can import images &amp;amp; clipart into your work with a similarly stale library that was packaged and shipped with your app years ago.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a designer, the broken creative process in Photoshop has always been very painful.  You leave the app to go hunting across the web for images, fonts, actions, brushes, etc. often finding shady sources with unclear licenses.  We asked 1,000+ members of Creative Market who use Creative Suite how much they spend each year on assets they use and on average they spend $150/yr.  Multiply that by the 40M customers Adobe has and there is a big $6B annual opportunity without an App-Store equivalent. So we just launched it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://creativemarket.com/photoshop-extension?utm_source=bubsco&amp;amp;utm_medium=post&amp;amp;utm_campaign=being-bold"&gt;The Creative Market Photoshop Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the real story behind this extension launch isn&amp;#39;t just what this means for Photoshop, but the platform that is powering this extension&amp;hellip; the idea that this fluid in-app commerce can exist for all kinds of creative software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Existing stock media companies are largely that, media companies that saw most of their technological evolution happen when they put their CDs online 10 years ago.  Creative Market is a tech company in its DNA and we&amp;#39;re revealing the beginnings of what is coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making big changes &amp;amp; announcing your plans to the world can be a scary process, but I do believe George&amp;#39;s words and am acting from the heart, being bold and chasing for greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iTunes Smart Playlists</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;iTunes smart playlists are integral to the way I listen to purchased music. I currently only use two smart playlists, but they help me track music coming into my library and make sure I&amp;#39;m listening to the newest stuff. I originally created the two lists &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;1 Week&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Last Month&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; because the iTunes library can be a black hole for thousands and thousands of songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1 Week playlist shows only songs I&amp;#39;ve added to my library in the last 7 days and the Last Month playlist does the same, but for the last 30 days. These aren&amp;#39;t too different from the default &amp;ldquo;Recently added,&amp;rdquo; but I needed to split it up and tweak it. As you can see from the playlist configuration picture, I weed out podcasts, only keep checked items, and keep it live updating. This keeps the playlist just music and makes it a good travel, sync-able, option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tylerhayes_24579705887352_raw.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tylerhayes_24579705887352_raw.png" alt="1week.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also keep a smart playlist for each year. All the music released in 2013 has its own playlist, an easy way to remember what came out this year versus last and so forth. It&amp;#39;s handy just a few months into the year, but the reason I originally made it years back was to help with making my best-of-the-year lists in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another smart playlist I don&amp;#39;t currently use, but have in the past is &amp;ldquo;Discovering old favorites.&amp;rdquo; Basically the idea that you have a lot of forgotten favorites lurking beneath the surface of your library. The smart playlist for this looks something like, &amp;ldquo;Find all the songs with over X amount of plays &amp;ndash; maybe 30 &amp;ndash; that haven&amp;#39;t been listened to in over a year.&amp;rdquo; This type of playlist could contain a lot of songs, which is why I stopped using it, but for some people it may be the type of discovery they&amp;#39;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if only Rdio and other streaming service would add a niche feature like smart, user configurable, playlists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have a smart playlist you live by, let me know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How To Price and Sell Your Startup's Product</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/tom_24582345886656_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_tom_24582345886656_raw.jpg" alt="old_cash_register.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every SaaS business must to decide how to charge for the service. Pricing plans are some of the most difficult decisions to make. Equally important to the price is determining the point at which the customer pays - the conversion point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a four different models that I&amp;#39;ve experienced: up front payment, freemium, limited free trials, money back guarantee. Picking the right one depends on a number of different factors. Below is a table that summarizes these four approaches.
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End User Buys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avg Seat $&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freemium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Increases with time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Simple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Yes or No&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Free Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Increases with time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Complex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Low/Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Front Payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Immediate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Simple&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Money Back Guarantee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Immediate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Complex&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="padding: 5px;"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Freemium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freemium is a strategy for products whose value proposition is simply conveyed and whose value increases with time. Evernote&amp;#39;s value compounds with the data the user enters into the database. Expensify&amp;#39;s utility increases with the number of expense reporters on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freemium businesses must target markets with very large user bases because the conversion to paid rates vary between 2 to 4%. To drive $50M in annual revenue at that conversion rate and $100/year subscription, you would need 17M users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the end users are buyers (typically in consumer services). Other times (for enterprise customers), end users are sales prequalifiiers who create a groundswell within an organization to convert to paid. Given enough users of a product in an organization, the enterprise can be upsold to a company wide license. Freemium distribution enables a company to acquire those users inexpensively.
&lt;h2&gt;Limited Free Trial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between freemium and trial products is product complexity: trial products are more complex and need time for the user to gain a deeper understanding of the value. CRM tools like Salesforce and 37Signal&amp;#39;s HighRise both use limited trials. The goal with these marketing mechanisms is to drive customers to explore the product for a brief period of time and then force a conversion. Allow too much time to pass and the customer will forget the value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These kinds of products tend to require significant user behavior change so these products must market a promise and then use the conversion to paid event to enforce that behavior change (carrot + stick).  Because of the behavior change, these products are marketed to decision makers who select the software for their teams: product managers, tech leads and heads of sales. Many of the tests I&amp;#39;ve seen have indicated shorter trial periods are better: 7 days is better than 14 days is better than 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Up Front Payment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pursue up front payment, you need an established brand with a clear value proposition and you sell the product to the end-user. Adobe&amp;#39;s Creative Suite is a canonical example. Customers know what the software can do and if they need it, customers will pay for it. The same is true for AutoCad, MS Office, and operating systems. Most of these products are high cost per seat products. Because they are well-known in the market, they command a price premium.
&lt;h2&gt;Money Back Guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For products lacking an established brand, but offering an immediate value proposition and charging a high average seat value, there is no better solution than the money back guarantee. It mitigates the customers commitment phobia but establishes a billing relationship at the outset. This pricing strategy requires contact with a sales or account management team which implies a higher cost of sales. Ideally, higher conversion rates mitigate these costs. In other words, the up front commitment is a sales pre-qualifier. Your sales team will have fewer, higher quality leads. Plus, your sales team will have direct product feedback to share with the product team.  &lt;a href="http://www.rightnow.com/crm-news-7154.php"&gt;Oracle offers this for many of their products &lt;/a&gt;as &lt;a href="http://montclairadvisors.com/blog/2011/12/sbp-eloqua/"&gt;do Eloqua.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each product and target market have some unique attributes, consider the time to value, complexity of the product, product complexity and your sales model (freemium vs sales) when you do price your startup&amp;#39;s product.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the AP was right to stop saying "Illegal immigrant"</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://blog.ap.org/2013/04/02/illegal-immigrant-no-more/"&gt;Associated Press announced&lt;/a&gt; this month that from now on, &amp;ldquo;illegal immigrant&amp;rdquo; is no longer the correct style. It&amp;#39;s a change that&amp;#39;s been a long time coming, and one that could have a major impact on the debate over immigration. And it&amp;#39;s the correct move because it offers reporters a chance to clarify and inform, rather than inflame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps not surprisingly, not everyone is thrilled with the change. At the New Republic, &lt;a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/112867/associated-presss-illegal-immigrant-change-makes-no-sense"&gt;John McWhorter writes&lt;/a&gt; that it&amp;#39;s a crime against logic, because people who enter the U.S. without proper permission are, &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt;, illegal immigrants, and that we use adjectives like &amp;ldquo;convicted&amp;rdquo; to describe people already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His argument that the basis of the change is the slogan that &amp;ldquo;A person shouldn&amp;#39;t be called illegal&amp;rdquo; is a straw man, though. The change in style has the effect of being more humane, but there are other good reasons, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the AP already recommends using language that describes rather than damns. A good example: someone uses a wheelchair, they aren&amp;#39;t confined to a wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that applies to crimes, as well. For the most part, despite what McWhorter says, in most cases, someone wouldn&amp;#39;t be referred to as a &amp;ldquo;drunk driver.&amp;rdquo; Before trial a reporter would write that a person was accused of drunken driving, and after conviction, that a person was convicted of drunken driving. The larger point is that the word illegal should be applied to the &lt;em&gt;action that is against the law&lt;/em&gt;, which is what the AP now recommends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term &amp;ldquo;illegal immigrant&amp;rdquo; or the use of &amp;ldquo;illegal&amp;rdquo; to describe a person. Instead, it tells users that &amp;ldquo;illegal&amp;rdquo; should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of illegal immigrant&amp;mdash;or worse simply &amp;ldquo;illegal,&amp;rdquo; which despite McWhorter&amp;#39;s protests is a slur, and a clear one at that, because it refers not to an action but the entirety of a person&amp;#39;s existence&amp;mdash;a reporter would write about someone entering the U.S. illegally. Changing that doesn&amp;#39;t imply approval of the act, it just brings the language more in line with the rest of the AP&amp;#39;s style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are extreme cases in which a description is applied to a person instead of an action. Mcwhorter gives the example of a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To frame it as that illegal immigrant is a “slur” requires that on principle we apply the same judgment to, say, serial killer (what about the times in between murders when he isn’t killing anyone?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, of course, no reporter would call someone a serial killer until that person had been convicted. And that&amp;#39;s without mentioning the not-so-subtle false equivalence between serial murder and illegal immigration. Both actions are against the law, but there is an enormous difference of scale, and one is a criminal action, while the other is against civil law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best reason for the change is that it allows a clarification of what, exactly, is going on. Just as journalists are not supposed to convict people accused of crimes with their words, they are now supposed to attribute any accusation of someone entering the country illegally, as well as to clarify the specifics of each case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not describe people as violating immigration laws without attribution.&lt;br&gt;
Specify wherever possible how someone entered the country illegally and from where. Crossed the border? Overstayed a visa? What nationality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are all important questions, and they help actually inform people. And despite protestations from &lt;a href="http://ideas.time.com/2013/04/09/viewpoint-banning-the-term-illegal-immigrant-wont-change-the-stigma/"&gt;McWhorter in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; about political correctness&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;a phrase so overused that it is essentially meaningless and can be marshaled against any effort to make language more humane and accurate&amp;mdash;that information, provided in clear, accurate language, is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both articles, McWhorter presupposes that any change in language about immigration must be an effort to change the way people think about immigration, and to question the rightness of immigration law as it now stands, But that isn&amp;#39;t necessarily the case. Some of the key aims of journalism&amp;mdash;fairness, accuracy, and clarity&amp;mdash;are all served by this change, and that&amp;#39;s enough to make it the correct decision, without delving into the debate over immigration itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration is a serious topic, and it deserves a serious discussion. By removing loaded terms and pejoratives from news stories, the new AP policy will help facilitate that serious discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I know the solution, but it's illegal</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you have two car dealerships, and one of them offers financing&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;which one do you think will sell more cars?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.svbtle.com/peteforde_24580299743676_raw.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/inline_peteforde_24580299743676_raw.jpg" alt="Red vs. Blue"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many start-ups are match-makers that become irrelevant as soon as the buyer and seller party are acquainted. There is value created in these &amp;ldquo;marketplaces&amp;rdquo; but founders are stumped when it comes to capturing any of that value for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal: &lt;strong&gt;make it possible to finance the purchase of goods via instant approval financing, presented as a first-class option&lt;/strong&gt; alongside Visa and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say a founder is passionate about something enough that they create a directory of every place to obtain it, complete with recommendations and reviews. Blood, sweat and tears are emitted and a community emerges. They make no attempt to cheapen the experience through advertising, bait-and-switch membership requirements or elaborate tracking schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founder can approach every vendor listed in their directory with an opportunity to expand their customer base to include people who don&amp;#39;t have cash in hand. They would be paid instantly and never have the hassle of dealing with financial institutions themselves. In exchange, they would agree to give up some percentage of their gross profit on the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the vendors don&amp;#39;t have to agree to participate, at the expense of implicit second-class treatment in the directory. There are many people who simply can not complete a transaction unless the option of credit is on the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of system already exists: &lt;a href="http://www.pay4later.com/"&gt;Pay4Later&lt;/a&gt; is a successful company providing this service to UK retailers today. The company was &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/27/post-credit-crunch-pay4later-lets-uk-online-retailers-offer-customers-finance/"&gt;covered on TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; back in 2010, and my [admittedly cursory] investigation into their developer documentation suggests that they are the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most compelling evidence is that they have competition: Hitachi offers &lt;a href="http://www.hitachicapital.co.uk/pbf/"&gt;PaybyFinance&lt;/a&gt; and there are others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, there&amp;#39;s no comparable service that I can find for US or Canadian companies. It&amp;#39;s a tightly regulated industry and a legitimate company would have to spend millions of dollars in legal fees to get the regulators to consider a new way of doing things. Regulators don&amp;#39;t see the glow of opportunity through the fog of unknowable risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toronto&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.financeit.ca/en"&gt;FinanceIt&lt;/a&gt; would seem to be poised to offer instant approval financing online, but they have no intention of doing so thanks to the rigid inflexibility of the powers that be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically companies like &lt;a href="http://wonga.com/"&gt;Wonga&lt;/a&gt; (260% APR) and &lt;a href="http://moneymart.com/"&gt;MoneyMart&lt;/a&gt; (up to 599.64% APR) could get into this space, but nobody should want that. You can&amp;#39;t care about your users and send them into the jaws of sociopathic usurers in the same breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like the technology for a new player to offer reasonable loans online is beyond us. According to AngelList, there are &lt;a href="https://angel.co/fraud-detection"&gt;21 &amp;ldquo;fraud detection&amp;rdquo; startups&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like &lt;a href="https://siftscience.com/"&gt;SiftScience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.the41.com/"&gt;41st Parameter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://signifyd.com/"&gt;Signifyd&lt;/a&gt; all market powerful tools designed to eliminate risk from transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a market opportunity worth billions. It&amp;#39;s just that it&amp;#39;s illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&amp;#39;s been a way to build it, there&amp;#39;ll be a way to destroy it
Things are not all that out of control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stereolab - &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z-ufNCiK48"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Crest&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do large middle-men stay relevant in the Google era? Usually through banding together and hiring lawyers and lobbyists to intimidate and pay off politicians that will uphold protectionist laws. You can see the fear Uber puts into the taxi industry, and the laughable, red-faced rage of car dealerships throwing temper-tantrums when Tesla only sells their cars online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade organizations that exist to keep anti-competitive laws in place aren&amp;#39;t suggesting that their member companies are doing anything precious or special. They can only rely on making sure that people are afraid of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, it&amp;#39;s sanctioned behaviour for certain kinds of companies to demand legal protection from competition. This is nepotistic counter-innovation in it&amp;#39;s most ugly state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stifling competition to ensure profit? Legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking the monopoly scale of eBay or Craigslist, any attempt to introduce additional process overhead to an existing, well-understood flow — whether it be brokered communication, transaction fees or even just a simple account creation — is often a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web has done an excellent job of purging the world&amp;#39;s bottom-feeding middle-men. The travel, real-estate, and used vehicle industries will never be the same, &lt;a href="http://www.hipmonk.com/"&gt;thank goodness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This market efficiency has come at a terrible cost to those who would seek to make a profit in benevolent arbitrage. Those brave souls who want help someone find what they are looking for are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Advertising makes your site look cheap and generates pennies a month unless you&amp;#39;re operating at a large scale. Few visitors will complete even a free account creation process and fewer still would dutifully report successful financial transactions made. Once the potential customer leaves to go to a 3rd party site, you&amp;#39;re unlikely to hear from either the buyer or seller ever again. There&amp;#39;s no mechanism for oversight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instant-approval financing would be one possible way for a marketplace to add value. Too bad: it&amp;#39;s not legal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without substantial progress towards dismantling the status quo, most value-added listings directory founders would be best advised to keep their day jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
