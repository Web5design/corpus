That said, we shouldn&#8217;t read too much into what is clearly a baby step no matter how Rocket is spinning the announcement.</p>
<p>DropGift&#8217;s new B2B offering builds on its original B2C play (which was already available in the U.S.) and piggybacks Facebook to enable brands to target their &#8220;fans&#8221; with sampling and gifting campaigns and, in turn, as with other social marketing platforms, turn those fans into so-called brand ambassadors. Campaigns appear on the brand&#8217;s own Facebook page via a specific application tab, with their own branding not DropGift&#8217;s, essentially replicating a white-label version.</p>
<p>Companies using the platform can set up a campaign to enable their existing &#8220;fans&#8221; to send samples to their friends and claim samples for themselves directly via the brand&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they can orchestrate a social gifting campaign that encourages consumers to send gifts to one another in a highly public and viral way in order to become part of the &#8220;conversation&#8221; &#8212; again as a wider engagement marketing play.</p>
<p>The result, claims DropGifts, is that the platform generates 35 times more impressions per-sample offered than traditional campaigns, which of course they would say.</p>
<p>While the U.S. push is clearly new for DropGifts, the B2B element may even qualify as a pivot, even though its B2C play already relies on working with brands.</p>
<p>&#8220;DropGifts was initially a consumer facing platform offering free gift cards from many different retailers in one spot,&#8221; says co-founder and CMO Marie Chevrier tells TechCrunch. &#8220;This worked well but it didn&#8217;t allow brands to take full advantage of their existing social media followings. Our B2B solution allows brands to integrate a fully-branded solution in their very own social media channels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smartphones have a lot of on-board sensors, but do they really have enough? No way, say a slew of recent hardware startups, of which Danish Vavuud is only the most recent. Vavuud is turning to Kickstarter to help build <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vaavud/a-wireless-wind-meter-containing-no-electronics">a smartphone-compatible wind meter</a>, one that miraculously contains no electronics and yet still can communicate accurate wind speed measurements wirelessly to iPhones and Galaxy devices.</p>
<p>The Vavuud wind meter provides an easy way to measure wind speed exactly where you are, with a device that&#8217;s remarkably inexpensive and deceptively simple. It plugs into the headphone jack of your device, but that&#8217;s to give it a stable base; it actually uses two magnets in the rotor, which generate a magnetic field that the smartphone can pick up and process using algorithms normally used for sound processing to translate it to wind speed data. Vavuud co-founder Thomas P. Helms says it&#8217;s been tested with iPhone 4, 4S, and 5, as well as Galaxy SII and SIII so far, and it has been calibrated in a wind tunnel at the University of Denmark to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/vaavud-wireless_indoor.jpg"></a>&#8220;To our knowledge we are the first to use the magnetometer in smartphones in this way, so we of course think the technology itself is kind of cool,&#8221; Helms explained via email. &#8220;It&#8217;s also cool because on a mechanical level it appears quite simple, but there is some relatively complex math behind it .&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely that Vavuud will be able to work with any modern advanced smartphone with built-in magnetic field sensors (which is pretty much all of them), so the limited existing test pool shouldn&#8217;t frighten away potential backers. The Vavuud is designed to be used by anyone who might find accurate current windspeed readings useful – a potential group of users that includes windsurfers, sailors, paragliders, model plane pilots and more.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/vaavud-kite.jpg"></a>&#8220;Surfers, sailors, paragliders etc. have needed an online anemometer for ages to be able to create and share crowd-sourced wind information,&#8221; Helms explained. &#8220;Because conditions at your favorite spots may depend on very local factors like mountains, could be affected by thermal conditions, and on and on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vavuud is looking to ship the Wind Meter by June of this year, with pre-orders beginning at the £15 level. iOS and Android apps from Vavuud itself are expected to become available at the same time, but it&#8217;s easy to imagine how, as with <a title="Meet Thermodo: A Tiny External Thermometer That Lives In Your iPhone’s Headphone Jack" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/07/meet-thermodo-a-tiny-external-thermometer-that-lives-in-your-iphones-headphone-jack/">the Thermodo</a>, the developer community might embrace another means of collecting information about the world around you and integrate Vavuud into their own apps.</p>

Though <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.skype.com/2013/03/19/skype-for-windows-phone-8-updated-now-with-hd-video/#fbid=EiY79PjLrFz">today&#8217;s blog post</a> from Skype doesn&#8217;t directly address the Hub&#8217;s former problems, it does hint at them by saying that the new release focuses on &#8220;increasing quality and reliability.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/skype-restores-people-hub-integration-in-latest-windows-phone-update-adds-hd-video/wp8-video-call-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-780469"></a>The renewed People Hub integration means that you&#8217;ll again be able to see your Skype contacts listed there on Windows Phone 8 devices, and you can kick off Skype conversations from users&#8217; profiles without first launching the Skype app.</p>
<p>The other big news in the Skype update for Windows Phone 8 is support for HD video. The company says that it has improved the video calling experience for all users, offering VGA video on lower-end handsets and 720p HD on the higher-end devices like the Nokia Lumia 920, HTC 8X, and Samsung Atvi S, for example. The app will now intelligently determine video quality based on the speed of your current connection.</p>
<p>Landscape mode is also now supported during video calls, as is support for switching between front and back cameras. Based on user feedback and requests, Skype added the ability to switch between accounts, too.</p>
<p>Other bugs fixes are listed in more detail <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.skype.com/2013/03/19/skype-for-windows-phone-8-updated-now-with-hd-video/#fbid=EiY79PjLrFz">here</a>.</p>

The emulator is easily unlocked via a simple sequence of taps (depicted below by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iphoneblog.de/2013/03/19/game-boy-advance-emulator-schummelt-sich-in-den-app-store/">iPhoneblog.de</a>), but if you do want to unlock it you&#8217;d better get it quick because Apple is sure to pull this one quickly.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-9-13-22-am.png"></a>The process of unlocking the emulator is simple, but getting the ROMs and BIOS where you need them to get it up and running is a little trickier. You&#8217;ll need iTools, which lets you access your iPhone&#8217;s file directory (without jailbreaking). Once you have that, navigate to Apps in the sidebar for your connected iPhone or iOS devices, then find the &#8220;Files&gt;Documents&#8221; directory and drop the relevant BIOS and ROM files there.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in emulation, you probably know enough to get you the rest of the way there. If not, there&#8217;s a great search engine called Google I can recommend. Apple will surely be removing Awesome Baby Names from the store now that this is out there and public, so act quickly if you&#8217;re after some emulation action.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, Kamcord is an SDK for iOS that allows mobile game developers using a handful of popular game engines (think Unity, cocos2d, and the like) to quickly and easily add support for recording in-game video without totally killing game performance.</p>
<p>Zitzmann says that February was the startup&#8217;s most active month yet &#8212; gamers shared 200 million recordings of their exploits in that month alone. Not too shabby considering that Kamcord only officially launched last August, and Zitzmann sees that one big month as a portent for bigger ones to come. “It’s still a long way away,” he said. “But looking at the numbers and trends, we think a billion videos a day is very possible.” Now early momentum is one thing, but that’s quite a weighty ambition and one that’s entirely contingent on a strong mobile gaming market and buy-in from developers.</p>
<p>For now it seems as though Kamcord is faring well on both of those fronts — playing games remains one of the most prominent uses for smartphones, and Kamcord has been steadily raising its profile among developers over the past few months. The in-game recording feature was only baked into 22 apps at time of launch, but these days that number has swelled to over 80 since then. Recent changes like a more streamlined sharing UI and a greater focus on sharing videos within games rather than on social networks like YouTube and Facebook are meant to get users recording and engaging with the game with fewer hurdles than before.</p>
<p>It’s that sort of scattershot approach that Zitzmann hopes will help propel Kamcord past the billion daily video threshold. At this point Kamcord is hustling to ingratiate itself with as many game developers as possible — the idea is as one Kamcord-enabled iOS game begins to wane in popularity another one (or hopefully more) will begin to pick up steam and rise through the App Store charts. Granted, it’s not exactly a foolproof plan, but it turns out that support from one developer in particular could act as an anchor for the startup down the road.</p>
<p>Zitzmann confirmed that the social gaming mavens at Zynga have taken note of Kamcord’s approach to mobile game recording and are testing the feature with a small number of Scramble With Friends players. “We’re really excited to be testing Kamcord,” Zynga product lead Andrew Huang noted. “Video is a great way to drive retention and discovery of our games.” There’s no firm timeline for if/when Kamcord support will find its way to more Scramble players (or, for that matter, more Zynga mobile games) but it could be a huge coup for the startup — if the relationship with Zynga pans out and the Kamcord team makes good on its plans to expand into Android games, hitting a billion video recordings a day may happen sooner than they think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/grokr-ios.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="grokr-ios" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://grokrlabs.com/">Grokr</a>, the mobile app<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/grokr-debuts-google-now-for-ios-users/"> offering a &#8220;Google Now&#8221; like experience for iOS users</a>, is today relaunching with a major redesign in tow. And even more notably, the company says that it&#8217;s planning to launch the app on Android, where it will soon compete against the real deal, so to speak.</p>
<p>The startup, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/grokr-debuts-google-now-for-ios-users/">first debuted in December</a> backed by $4.2 million in funding from NEA, U.S. Ventures, Triple Point and Lerer Ventures, previously offered a smart, proactive virtual assistant which provides weather information, flight details, sports team updates, traffic updates, calendar events, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/grokr-the-google-now-for-ios-gets-a-makeover-announces-plans-to-compete-with-the-real-deal-on-android/grokr-ios-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-780450"></a>With today&#8217;s relaunch on iOS, the app offers a few more features &#8211; it has added support for &#8220;predictive March Madness&#8221; via its sports tile button, for example, and it can also alert you to nearby events and important occasions, like birthdays, as well as those from your own calendar. There are more news sources and sports teams available in the app, too, and you can better personalize your notifications.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a new &#8220;beta&#8221; tile which will allow you to test out Grokr&#8217;s upcoming features, in advance of their official debut.</p>
<p>However, the most noticeable change about the Grokr update is the way it looks. The sidebar navigation has been simplified, and the main screen&#8217;s tiles are whiter with just splashes of color, giving it a more &#8220;Google Now&#8221; like look and feel. It&#8217;s a cleaner design, overall.</p>
<p><span id="__mceDel">When we first spoke to Grokr <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/grokr-debuts-google-now-for-ios-users/">back in December</a>, the startup was focused on building only for iOS. However, they&#8217;re recently changed their mind on the matter. Though iOS still dominates here in the U.S., the company says it wants to go after the international market, including emerging markets, which is why they&#8217;ve made the decision to build for Android going forward. In addition, the Grokr team says it has received interest from  hardware manufacturers and OEMs which are powered by Android &#8211; something which could hint at the potential for pre-install deals, deeper integrations, or an outright acquisition of what Grokr has built, perhaps.</span><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Plus, we&#8217;re told that the company believes that there&#8217;s just more opportunity to innovate on Android.</p>
<p>The updated iOS app is available for download <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grokr/id574612070?mt=8">here on iTunes</a>.</p>

		<title>Facebook Isn't Holding Back Their Growth: MessageMe Raises $1.9M And Grabs 1M Users</title>

The company said today that it has more than 1 million users, is sending 500 notifications now per second and recently picked up $1.9 million in funding from a large syndicate of some of the Valley&#8217;s best-known investors. They include True Ventures, First Round Capital, Google Ventures, SVAngel, Resolut.vc, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Social+Capital Partnership. The company&#8217;s angels also include Airbnb&#8217;s Brian Pokorny, Hiten Shah, Eric Wu and TinyCo CEO Suleman Ali. While the messaging space is incredibly competitive with apps from Facebook, Apple&#8217;s iMessages plus the big Asian clients like Tencent&#8217;s WeChat and NHN&#8217;s Line, MessageMe thinks it can carve out a space because of the way it quickly pulls in rich media like doodles and videos. Basically, they think it&#8217;s a lot more expressive than standard messaging and silly as it seems, those doodles will differentiate them from the very large field of competition. The app pulls in images from Google search, music from iTunes or videos from YouTube. Since launching, the company said it has sent more than 10 million doodles and more than 4 million songs from iTunes. Because of the team&#8217;s background from the social gaming world, they understand how to quickly and virally grow a product. CEO Arjun Sethi used to run an early social gaming company called LOLApps before it merged with a publisher 6Waves. MessageMe&#8217;s growth attracted a response from Facebook last week when the company decided to shut down the app&#8217;s access to the social graph. The company cited the part of its platform policy where it says apps can&#8217;t replicate core functionality of the Facebook product if they want access to the &#8220;Find Friends&#8221; feature. But now that they&#8217;ve got momentum, the question is whether users will stick over the long run, especially when there are so many other options. Not only is there standard messaging built into Android and iOS devices, there are plenty of other apps. Sequoia-backed WhatsApp has dominant marketshare in many European countries, while Kakao leads the way in South Korea and Line has pulled in more than 120 million users, largely in Japan. The latter two have become powerful and lucrative platforms for distributing mobile games.]]></description>

<p>Before his sentencing, however, Auernheimer took the opportunity to address some members of the media with a mini ad-hoc press conference. If you&#8217;ve ever yearned to live during the American Revolution, you&#8217;ll most certainly want to watch this act of angry patriotism.</p>
<p>&#8220;America is in a cultural decline,&#8221; he begins. &#8220;In my country, there&#8217;s a problem and that problem is the feds. They take all your freedom and never give it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He talks about all of the helpful, commercial implementations of drones, yet rebukes the government that there are no licensing routes to use this technology for peace or a healthier planet.</p>
<p>He explains that there are engineers &#8220;working tirelessly&#8221; in this country who try to build something useful for humanity, before finding out it&#8217;s against U.S. code.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look at all this, and think, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to prison for arithmetic?&#8217;I added one to a number on a URL on a public server, and I aggregated that data, and gave it to a fucking journalist at that man&#8217;s (points) publication!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;And this is why I&#8217;m going to prison!&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="clear:both;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:5px;width:640px;float:center;color:#0a9400;">I look at all this, and think, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to prison for arithmetic?&#8221;</h3>
<p>&#8220;And if they have any soul, any soul in their whole body. If they understood what they were doing to the rule of law, to the fucking Bill of Rights and to the free and open Internet, they would die in their own goddamn shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the &#8220;AT&amp;T hack&#8221; wasn&#8217;t necessarily an act of &#8220;innovation,&#8221; Auernheimer most certainly sees himself as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weev">a political and cultural hacktivist</a>. He is seen as responsible for disrupting Amazon&#8217;s web services in 2009 when the service excluded a number of gay and lesbian books, and he&#8217;s published a number of podcasts, and shown support for Occupy Wall Street as well as a number of other movements. In fact, you might even consider the AT&amp;T hack to be a public service. Who knows when AT&amp;T would have gotten around to protecting our data?</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope innovation will make a wakeful returns as soon as possible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have much time. I think we have a short window until the currency collapses and this place becomes some third world country. There are new Detroits and Birminghams and St. Louises every year, and we have very little time to manufacture again and bring this country back to its greatness.&#8221;</p>

The new system would see mobile apps request that their users opt-in to sharing their anonymized location data with Placed for market research purposes, in exchange for affiliate fees based on both a 7-day and 30-day volume measurement. The more quality location data shared by its users, the more an app stands to make through the program.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="60" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/placed-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=60&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="placed logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Location analytics startup Placed is debuting a new monetization option for mobile devs today, via its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.placed.com/placed-affiliate">Placed Affiliate program</a>. The new system would see mobile apps request that their users opt-in to sharing their anonymized location data with Placed for market research purposes, in exchange for affiliate fees based on both a 7-day and 30-day volume measurement. The more quality location data shared by its users, the more an app stands to make through the program.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to traditional affiliate marketing arrangements, with the difference that there&#8217;s no overt marketing, advertising or links that users need to click. Instead, they have to respond in the affirmative to a dialog box that pops up asking them their permission to share location data with Placed, after having approved an app to access location information to begin with. Obviously, that&#8217;s also a sensitive request, but Placed CEO and founder David Shim says it&#8217;s not as intimidating to users as you might expect.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve found is that the opt-in rate actually seems to be pretty high,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Because a lot of these applications are already using location or they&#8217;re free apps, where a user knows there&#8217;s some kind of trade-off going on, and so a user says &#8216;Hey, I want to support the app,&#8217; so we&#8217;ve measured about 30 million locations in the past day from our pilot pool of clients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Placed&#8217;s monetization option may have some potential downsides, but the positives might outweigh those for anyone looking at ways in which to monetize their existing free app without sacrificing anything in terms of the user experience. Placed&#8217;s new program requires only the initial setup, after which point users won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something brand new that doesn&#8217;t impact your in-app experience at all,&#8221; Shim said. And now you have another way to kind of monetize your user base, so it should help support the free app community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another advantage for developers, according to Shim, is that even apps that don&#8217;t have sky-high engagement can participate, since they need only be opened every so often and don&#8217;t need to be kept open long to start earning affiliate revenue with Placed&#8217;s new program.</p>
<p>For customers of Placed&#8217;s analytics solution, the new data from affiliates will be used to provide comparables across a wider spectrum. That will mean that Placed customers won&#8217;t only be able to see how often their own app is used in specific locations, but also how that compares to average across their segment, or across different categories of apps. It&#8217;ll be available as a paid add-on to existing service for Placed customers once Placed makes more progress with the Affiliate beta program launching today.</p>
<p>Placed Affiliate is invite-only for the time being, but developers looking to try out this new monetization route can sign up to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.placed.com/placed-affiliate">register their interest</a>. If you do end up joining the program, we (and other TC readers) would be interested in hearing how it affects customer response to your product, as well as how it compares to alternate monetization options like displaying ads in terms of bringing in revenue.</p>

After going through hundreds of applications, TechStars and Nike selected ten finalists. They will now begin a three-month program and take advantage of the Nike+ API and SDK to develop and release new companion products for the Nike FuelBand or Sportswatch. The teams will relocate to Portland — next to Nike&#8217;s headquarters — where they will exchange ideas and information with mentors, such as Nike’s Vice President of Digital Sport Stefan Olander, founder and CEO of TechStars David Cohen and co-founder of Foursquare Naveen Selvadurai. By being selected, finalists received $20,000 of funding. Here&#8217;s the full list of finalists: FitDeck: Digital decks of exercise playing cards that deliver ever-changing workouts for fitness and sports. GoRecess: Helps users find, book and review fitness activities. Chroma.io: An indie game studio that creates virtual worlds tied to real-world activity. CoachBase: Provides a digital sports coaching platform. GoFitCause: Leverages fitness data as a means of raising money for charities. HighFive: Ad network for health and fitness apps that helps people achieve their goals by rewarding them along their journey. Sprout At Work: Provider of corporate wellness solutions leveraging social and gamification tools to inspire employees and empower employers. GeoPalz: An interactive gaming and rewards platform for kids and families. Incomparable Things: Creates activity-driven fantasy sports leagues. RecBob: Offers a platform that makes recreational sports easy by organizing play. When it comes to creating an accelerator program, there are three key advantages for Nike. Even though the details of the deal with TechStars are unknown, the program is a cheap way to imagine and develop new use cases for the Nike+ product line. Instead of paying 20 to 40 engineers for three months, Nike chose to create an incubator and give $20,000 to each team. It is clearly not a money-losing venture. Nike could even hire some of the participants at the end of the process, without having to hunt for those engineers. Second, Nike counts on a long tail effect. If one or two teams make an incredibly successful product, it will entice developers around the world to develop for the Nike+ platform.

<p>Finally, fostering entrepreneurship is a trendy thing to do. It makes Nike look like an innovative company, not afraid of encouraging new ideas and up-and-coming companies. Entrepreneurship could become a brand attribute to differentiate the company from its competitors, which could drive sales.</p>
<p>TechStars gains a bit of mainstream recognition and press coverage by partnering with Nike. It is a well-known incubator that knows how to create and organize an accelerator program. The Nike+ Accelerator represents a new revenue stream for TechStars as well.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for the finalists? They are now working hard on their ideas and will pitch investors, journalists and Nike executives during the demo day in June. It will be interesting to see what comes out of the first batch of finalists of the Nike+ Accelerator program.</p>

Previous investor Solid Ventures also participated in the financing.</p>
<p>BackupAgent’s cloud backup software is designed for service providers, hosting providers and telcos that want to offer a backup service to their SME customers. The software is platform-agnostic and can handle large laptop/desktop environments as well as server farms with file and database servers and virtual environments. They also target service providers, hosting companies and telcos, but SMEs are the main focus.</p>
<p>The platform is currently deployed at more than 400 service providers, hosting companies and telcos, such as KPN in The Netherlands or Portugal Telecom, with 35,000 end-users globally.</p>

It sounds exactly like Pop-Up video in practice: turn your device to focus on Rick Astley, for instance, and get a pop-up picture of the singer belting out "Never Gonna Give You Up."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-7-50-17-am.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-19 at 7.50.17 AM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Apple has been <a target="_blank" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=39&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(apple.ASNM.+AND+20130319.PD.)&amp;OS=an/apple+and+isd/3/19/2013&amp;RS=(AN/apple+AND+ISD/20130319)%22">awarded a patent</a> today (via <a target="_blank" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/19/apples-interactive-augmented-reality-system-identifies-real-world-objects-allows-screen-sharing">AppleInsider</a>) that describes an augmented reality (AR) system that can tag real-world items in a live video stream and display information about them in a HUD overlay. It sounds exactly like Pop-Up video in practice: turn your device to focus on Rick Astley, for instance, and get a pop-up picture of the singer belting out &#8220;Never Gonna Give You Up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patent describes an AR system for iOS devices, which can be used in a variety of different ways. At its most basic, it works by labeling elements of an image in a live video feed, as when it names the parts of a circuit board being shot with the rear-facing camera on an iPad-like device in Apple&#8217;s patent. But it has more advanced features, too: Apple describes a user being able to edit the supplied data in case of inaccuracies or incorrect matches, and also includes various means for sharing the information between users and devices.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s system involves a collaboration aspect, as one user can annotate or edit the information being presented on their own view, and send it to a second user&#8217;s device. The iOS device employing the AR tech is also described as being able to show both the straight image itself, and the version with overlaid information at once in windows side-by-side, allowing both an unobstructed view and one with all the contextual information. In Apple&#8217;s provided example, a real-world view of San Francisco is paired with a computer-generated model of the same. The user can interact with the CG model to navigate through streets, and modify points of interest in case they&#8217;re traveling, something which sounds like it would add considerably to the current iOS Maps experience.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-7-51-04-am.png"></a>This type of dual-view could then be shared live with a second user, Apple says in the patent. So one user could build a virtual map and highlight important POIs, and then sync that with a second user&#8217;s device to help them navigate. It could also be used to collaborate in various professions, including doctors comparing x-rays or other medical imaging.</p>
<p>This AR system is mostly unique because of its sharing and collaboration features, but it also includes techniques that could easily be at home in a wearable AR display like Google Glass. But even as just a simple extension to Maps, it has value, and as an API built into iOS, the possibilities really start to take off. AR is getting more advanced, but we&#8217;ve seen players like <a title="Layar Founder Steps Down In Favour Of Print Publisher Veteran" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/20/layar-founder-steps-down-in-favour-of-print-publisher-veteran/">Layar pivot away from similar products</a>. Still, Apple would have different goals with such an invention, so it&#8217;s still possible this could make its way to shipping product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="97" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/17768v3-max-250x250.jpg?w=97&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="17768v3-max-250x250" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Freetards rejoice. Spotify has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/blog/archives/2013/03/19/great-news-about-the-5-play-limit/">ditched</a> the 5 play limit imposed on UK users of the free version of its music streaming service, Spotify Free, which until today kicked in after six months usage and meant that no one track could be streamed more than 5 times &#8212; it would become greyed out after the limit had been reached.</p>
<p>Removing the cap, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/spotify-takes-the-axe-to-its-free-service-can-it-now-claim-to-slash-music-piracy/">introduced</a> in April 2011 (along with a number of other changes to its free offering), brings it in line with other European markets where Spotify began ditching the 5 play limit in March, <a target="_blank" href="http://musically.com/2013/03/19/spotify-drops-its-five-play-monthly-track-cap-in-the-uk/">notes</a> Music Ally.</p>
<p>The U.S., Australia, and New Zealand have never had a cap, while in Europe, France seems to be the hold out. What hasn&#8217;t changed, however, is the 10 hours of streaming per month limit associated with the Spotify Free tariff, as the company continues to nudge users towards becoming paying customers.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Spotify has to say on its blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve got some mighty fine news for all Spotify Free users. From today, there’s no more 5 play-per-song limit. You can listen to your favourite songs as many times as you like.</p>
<p>That’s right, no more greyed-out songs. The tracks that you couldn’t listen to before will once again be available for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/spotify-the-american-dream-and-why-freemium-is-a-broken-record/">noted</a> when Spotify first introduced the 5 play limit, along with a cap on the number of listening hours overall for its non-paying customers, the idea of drawing a line in the sand between paying users and non-paying users made sense within the context of Spotify&#8217;s freemium model. And for many, the inconvenience of ads, however repetitive they are, wasn&#8217;t enough of a reason to upgrade to a paid account. Introducing false scarcity was always going to be more effective. In that context, capping free usage to ten hours per-month was an easy message to convey, while the 5 play limit seems idiosyncratic to say the least and, as I speculated at the time, probably came at the request of the major record labels who Spotify remains entirely reliant upon.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the oddest thing about Spotify’s new terms for non-paying users, however, is that after 6 months they’ll only be able to play each track up to a total of 5 times. This, of course, produces artificial scarcity and therefore it could be argued that it will push more users to pay for a subscription. But it also feels arbitrary. Why five plays? Is the sixth play more expensive to serve than the previous five?</p></blockquote>
<p>More broadly, however, despite today&#8217;s small change to Spotify Free, it appears to remain the case that a free, ad-supported music streaming service without any limits remains <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/spotify-the-american-dream-and-why-freemium-is-a-broken-record/">nonviable</a>. The economics simply don&#8217;t work, however hard you try to crowbar in a freemium model.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/spotify-said-expanding-pandora-like-web-radio-worldwide.html">reports</a> of its imminent world-wide launch, no word yet on when Spotify plans to bring its U.S.-only <em>free</em> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/19/watch-out-pandora-spotify-just-introduced-a-free-streaming-radio-service-in-the-u-s/">mobile Internet radio</a> feature to its mobile apps in the UK (or elsewhere outside the U.S.). Rightly or wrongly, the Internet radio model, which imposes arcane rules such as how many tracks by the same artist can be played sequentially etc., has a different royalty rate to a pure &#8220;on-demand&#8221; offering.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/newscred-logo.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="newscred-logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscred.com">NewsCred</a>, a company that licenses content from publications like The New York Times and The Economist for use in brand marketing campaigns, announced that it has raised $15 million in new funding.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Shafqat Islam, Iraj Islam, and Asif Rahman in 2008, and it has shifted focus a number of times, from a credibility rating score for publishers, to a &#8220;Ning for newspapers,&#8221; to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/30/third-times-the-charm-a-new-newscred-raises-4-million-to-reinvent-the-newswire-service/">a new kind of newswire and content licensing service</a>. Licensing is actually still a big piece of the NewsCred business, but instead of selling that content to other publications, the company sells it to brands like Pepsi, Toyota, and Johnson &amp; Johnson to use for marketing.</p>
<p>NewsCred says that it works with more than 2,500 news sources, using technology and an editorial team to choose the right articles, images, and videos for each brand, then distributing them via the web, email, and social networks. For example, NewsCred helped power <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/30/pepsi-live-for-now/">the Pepsi Now campaign</a>, in which the Pepsi website was taken over by a pop culture-centric news board. NewsCred says that one month after the campaign launched, traffic to Pepsi.com increased 2.4x.</p>
<p>CEO Shafqat Islam told me that NewsCred&#8217;s content marketing business has exploded in the past year.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the beginning of 2012, there were zero brand customers who were buying content from us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And if you fast forward to now, 60 percent of our customers are big Fortune 500 corporate or consumer brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Revenue has gone up 11-fold in the past year, and there has been a 540 percent increase in customers, NewsCred says. (It also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/content-licensing-service-newscred-acquires-publishing-startup-daylife-appears-to-be-raising-more-funding/">acquired a publishing startup called Daylife</a>.) So from a business perspective, the strategy seems to be working.</p>
<p>As for the implications on the editorial side, there&#8217;s been plenty of discussion (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/15/the-atlantic-scientology-post_n_2477987.html">sparked recently by a controversial piece of sponsored content</a> in the Atlantic from the Church of Scientology) about how the lines between online advertising and content can start to blur. Islam acknowledged that this is a big concern for its publishing partners — for example, he said that signing The Times was &#8220;a feather in our cap&#8221;, but in order to make the deal work, there were a number of limitations on what content NewsCred could use and where it could use it.</p>
<p>Overall, Islam said that NewsCred operates in &#8220;less of a gray area&#8221; because it&#8217;s not pushing marketing campaigns or advertorials onto its publisher sites, nor is it paying those publishers to create specific content for advertisers. Instead, it&#8217;s taking content that was being created anyway and making it available to brands.</p>
<p>NewsCred had previously raised $5 million from investors including FirstMark Capital, IA Ventures, Floodgate Fund, Lerer Ventures, and AOL Ventures. (AOL owns TechCrunch.) The new round was led by Mayfield Fund, with participation from Greycroft Partners, FirstMark, and IA Ventures.</p>
<p>Mayfield&#8217;s Rajeev Batra is joining the NewsCred board of directors. Batra said that he looked at 25 or 30 companies in the content marketing business before deciding to invest in NewsCred, which he said he &#8220;almost&#8221; thinks of as &#8220;Google for high quality business content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Content is the currency for establishing authentic relationships with &#8230; customers,&#8221; Batra said, adding that he was impressed by the NewsCred team because &#8220;they thought about content and the need for content and the role it plays in the market in a very, very comprehensive way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next steps for the company include growing internationally and finding smaller publications to partner with. Islam said that today, the publications with the best reputation in NewsCred are big publishers like The Times And The Economist, &#8220;but tomorrow they might be <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/02/andrew-sullivan-dish-publishing/">the Andrew Sullivans of the world</a>.&#8221;</p>

Videdressing will use it to build its market share in France and go international with an English version of the French fashion site, which has acquired cult status.</p>
<p>Launched in December 2009 by American and French co-founders, Meryl Job and Renaud Guillerm, Videdressing combines a marketplace with a &#8220;highly merchandised, fashion savvy retail&#8221; environment. This is down to Job&#8217;s experience as a former product manager at Chanel before starting the site. She realised the need for a site dedicated to fashion lovers who also wanted to feel comfortable about selling and purchasing pre-loved items. Something of a hard nut to crack in France. Meryl Job says &#8220;our business is changing the way people shop for &#8211; and resell &#8211; fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site claims to have grown five-fold during 2012 with a 400,000 item catalogue from over 1,700 of the top luxury brands growing at 2,500+ products per day. It offers mostly women&#8217;s fashion but also men&#8217;s and children&#8217;s. New or never worn products are almost 25% of the products available.</p>
<p>Hendrik Brandis, Partner of Earlybird, said they were attracted given that Videdressing had had &#8220;impressive growth even before this financing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hee provided no further details about what a Samsung smart watch would look like, what features it would offer consumers or when it would go on sale, but he did say that the South Korean company has been working on a watch product for &#8220;so long,&#8221; and patents back up that assertion. Samsung has patents related to wrist watch tech spanning nearly a decade, as<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unwiredview.com/2013/03/19/samsung-is-working-on-its-own-iwatch-here-are-some-smart-watch-designs-they-explored-over-the-last-decade/"> Unwired View notes</a>, covering various types of wearable phone designs.</p>
<p>In fact, Samsung has even produced some of its creations, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.samsung.com/us/aboutsamsung/news/newsIrRead.do?news_seq=14162&amp;news_ctgry=irnewsrelease">S9110</a>, a smartphone in the shape of a watch it actually shipped in 2009. In fact, Samsung created the first-even watch phone back in 1999, when it created the SPH-WP10. That predated the smartphone, of course, but it did indeed ship.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/samsung-sph-wp10_560.jpeg"></a>Bloomberg also reiterated that Apple plans to introduce its own smart watch design as early as this year, citing an anonymous source in what is likely a reference to an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/apples-iwatch-could-arrive-by-the-end-of-2013-says-bloomberg/">earlier report that said the same</a>. The report also included information about what Apple&#8217;s watch might do, which includes displaying caller information and map data, as well as being able to make calls and track health-related information.</p>
<p>Samsung has created smart watch tech in the past, but this might be another case where Apple takes the tech and leads the way in terms of building a device that actually works with a user&#8217;s existing workflow, popularizing the concept before Samsung and others move to follow its lead. At any rate it&#8217;s definitely an area of renewed interest for the Korean electronics manufacturer.</p>

The company is also announcing $4 million in Series A funding, led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures</a>. As a part of the funding, Union Square&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/albert-wenger">Albert Wenger</a> is joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Sift Science had previously raised $1.5 million in seed funding, bringing its total raise to $5.5 million.</p>

<p>The service is primarily targeting online marketplaces, payment networks, and e-commerce sites, where fraud is most prevalent. Businesses can integrate Sift Science&#8217;s technology by copying and pasting a small snippet of JavaScript code to their sites, the company says.</p>
<p>Co-founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brandon-ballinger/30/b37/655">Brandon Ballinger</a>, who spent four years at Google before leaving to found Sift Science, already has experience fighting fraud at scale thanks to his experience fighting off malicious ads while with his former employer. He notes that <a target="_blank" href="https://siftscience.com/about">five of the engineers at Sift Science</a> are also from Google, some with backgrounds in search and ads, and three from the same team that worked to detect spam ads and scams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that every site on the Internet had some types of bad users &#8211; some types of fraudulent users that they had to deal with,&#8221; he says of the inspiration for Sift Science. &#8220;And so what we decided to do was built [a fraud detection system] for the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ballinger co-founded Sift Science back in June 2011 with former college roommate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jasontan325">Jason Tan</a>, previously of Zillow, Optify and BuzzLabs. They later went through Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2011 program. When getting started, the founders talked to potential customers about spam, fraud and other malicious behavior, to see what sort of problems they were facing. There were already a number of anti-fraud vendors out there, Ballinger explains, so there was some initial concern was that the problem had, essentially, already been solved.</p>
<p>&#8220;But as we talked with people, we realized that it wasn&#8217;t solved at all,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Nobody was using them, and there were a couple of holes &#8211; things that existing products didn&#8217;t do. And one was ease-of-use.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that today, signing up for anti-fraud systems is still somewhat complicated. &#8220;It&#8217;s not like Google Analytics. It&#8217;s not like Mixpanel. In order to use an anti-fraud system today, you actually have to go through a lengthy sales process; there are setup fees; there&#8217;s usually a minimum term,: he says, &#8220;and the APIs, too, are very complex.&#8221; Existing services often use SOAP APIs, and take months to integrate, so Sift Science offers a REST API instead.</p>
<p>The other big issue with the existing systems, Ballinger continues, is that they use a fixed set of rules. That is, they would flag transactions over a certain dollar amount, or every transaction from Nigeria, for example. But using fixed rules is a problem because Internet fraudsters don&#8217;t play by a fixed set of rules &#8211; they&#8217;re always adapting their tricks to stay ahead of the preventative techniques.</p>
<p>To give its customers the edge, Sift Science uses machine learning which adapts to the fraudsters&#8217; changing tactics. Already, the startup has over 1 million different fraud patterns in its database, but will continually add to that, based on its learnings. Though how its algorithms work is something of the startup&#8217;s secret sauce, there are some generalities it offers as <a target="_blank" href="https://siftscience.com/large-scale-machine-learning">examples</a> &#8211; like certain URL navigation sequences, IP addresses coming from Tor nodes, transaction times that occur at late night hours, and more &#8211; to give you an idea of what of what individual signals might look like.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/ex-googlers-launch-sift-science-a-fraud-fighting-system-for-websites-backed-by-5-5m-in-funding-from-union-square-first-round-yc-others/how-it-works-%c2%b7-sift-science/" rel="attachment wp-att-780106"></a></p>
<p>Businesses can receive their fraud alerts via the provided API and/or email, and fraud scores are given a number to indicate their severity. Customers can also train the system by providing Sift Science with more information specific to their own service.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/ex-googlers-launch-sift-science-a-fraud-fighting-system-for-websites-backed-by-5-5m-in-funding-from-union-square-first-round-yc-others/trainer/" rel="attachment wp-att-780107"></a></p>
<p>The primary use case for such a tool is to combat the type of fraud which results in chargebacks, but it can also help detect things like scammers who post fake inventory to marketplace sites, or help to identify which accounts on a site have been created by someone committing fraud. The company claims that the system today can detect up to 90 percent of the fraud happening on its customers&#8217; sites and services.</p>
<p>Sift Science has been in private testing with around twenty companies, but it&#8217;s not permitted to name all clients at this time. However, Airbnb, Uber and Listia are a few of those early testers, as is Levchin&#8217;s Affirm, as well as a couple of marketplaces, payment processors and Top 500 retail websites.</p>
<p>As of today&#8217;s public debut, Sift Science is launching as a <a target="_blank" href="https://siftscience.com/pricing">freemium service</a>, where it charges based on the number of users a website chooses to score each month. Fewer than 5,000 users is free &#8211; which makes it the only anti-fraud service with a free tier. Beyond the first 5,000, it&#8217;s 10 cents per user per month.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Sift Science plans to double its head count, currently nine, with hires in sales and engineering. The team will also update its customer-facing online dashboard with more functionality in the future, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-10-13-55.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="piqora logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinfluencer.com">Pinfluencer</a>, one of the many sites that have sprouted up to help companies track Pinterest usage, is today announcing a rebranding to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piqora.com">Piqora</a>, a move that the company says fits with its wider strategy to mine information not just from Pinterest and Facebook, but other image-based social networks like Tumblr, Polyvore and Twitter. To go along with its longer term social marketing ambitions, it is also spreading its product wings with the launch of  Gallery, which lets brands, retailers and other businesses take products that get pinned elsewhere and aggregate and show them on their own sites.</p>
<p>The two moves come as Pinterest <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/11/pinterest-launches-new-data-analytic-tool-for-businesses-as-it-prepares-to-monetize/">slowly gears up</a> to take more commercial control of its massive data stream of consumers pinning branded content, and brands and other businesses trying to use the wildly popular social network to push their products.</p>
<p>The change to Piquora, says CEO Sharad Verma, was for a couple of reasons. First, it brings to mind &#8220;pics&#8221;, short for pictures, as well as &#8220;pick&#8221;, reminiscent of the curating role that many play on sites like Pinterest.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he says it was also made to set itself apart from the number of other pun-tastic, Pinterest-referencing branded companies in the bunfight for offering analytics, marketing services, influence/sentiment analysis and more, and to also get the company itself away from being too tied to Pinterest by association. &#8220;There are a lot of companies in that bucket whose names start with &#8216;pin,&#8217; and we don&#8217;t want to be confused with being a &#8216;Klout for Pinterest,&#8217;&#8221; he told TechCrunch. They may have also had a quiet nudge from Pinterest itself there, too, since the company these days <a target="_blank" href="http://business.pinterest.com/logos-and-marketing-guidelines/">discourages</a> businesses from using &#8220;Pin&#8221; in their names. &#8220;But also, eventually we are going to be a multi-platform company.&#8221;</p>
<p>That multi-platform strategy, he says, will see the company go beyond sourcing data from Pinterest and Facebook and extend to other social media sites organized around images. First up, he says, will be Tumblr, Twitter and Polyvore. Eventually, other social networks will also be added, Verma says. </p>
<p>The reason for the aggregation of multiple social networks is because Piqora is also expanding its product set.</p>
<p>Today sees the launch of a new Gallery mode that businesses can put on to their own sites, showing users what products of theirs are getting pinned on Pinterest (and tagged elsewhere) and giving users one more way of discovering them directly on those brands&#8217; sites &#8212; and eventually buying them.</p>
<p>This is all-important because it is one more sign of how companies are trying to &#8220;close the loop&#8221; between discovering a product, finding out more about it, maybe passing on the information to others, but most importantly &#8212; actually buying it. This follows on from developments <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/pinfluencer-launches-pin-roi-tracking-system-for-pinterest-supports-integration-with-google-analytics-omniture-coremetrics/">announced in November</a>, where Pinfluence announced integration with Google Analytics, CoreMetrics and Omniture, as well as ROI tracking on pins.</p>
<p>It is also a mark of how, no matter how much marketing budget these companies are ploughing into sites like Pinterest and Facebook, they are still interested in spending more on their own turf &#8212; a trend highlighted by a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/gartner-digital-marketing-survey-2012/">recent survey from Gartner</a>, which found that companies&#8217; own websites still got the lion&#8217;s share of marketing budget above and beyond what companies were prepared to spend on other highly-trafficked sites.</p>
<p>Gallery, Piqora says, will be optimized for tablets and effectively becomes the new public facing-product to sit next to the analytics that the company had already been providing to brands (customers include Overstock, Sephora, Zappos, Etsy, Z Gallerie, Orbitz, and Steve Madden).</p>
<p>It charts not just what&#8217;s getting tagged and trending with consumers, but then also adds more retailer-specific data such as stock availability and purchasing links. This also puts Piqora more in direct competition with companies like Lyst, which also provides a similar level of detail about where to buy products.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how one gallery looks, on World Market:</p>
<p></p>
<p>While Pinterest has yet to release an API, companies like Piqora have been picking up relevant data for its service by crawling publicly-available Pinterest pages. For now Pinterest is totally fine with this, it says, because many of these companies are providing services that Pinterest is not.</p>
<p>As Pinterest&#8217;s product manager Cat Lee <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/pinterest-web-analytics-puts-third-party-developers-and-apis-into-focus/">said to me</a> at the time of its Analytics launch last week, the company is &#8220;super glad&#8221; that businesses like Piqora exist now. In part this is because they help brands keep the faith in using Pinterest as a platform now and in the future. &#8220;We hope that these businesses continue to provide services that we don’t have plans to add at this time,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>Two of the key examples she gave me: those who help businesses run contests and promotions and then measuring the level of engagement on these; and those helping companies manage email campaigns that feed into Pinterest traffic.</p>
<p>So whether the new aggregating business takes off, and regardless of how Pinterest&#8217;s own moves into analytics may pose problems for those third parties that offer the same thing, this puts Piqora into a good position going forward because at least one big part of its business falls squarely into those areas where Pinterest says it has no interest to play for now. Piqora says it has powered some 100 contests and sweepstakes to date, with up to 25 million impressions per contest and 20 pins per participant, &#8220;saving marketers hours of manual work by automatically tracking user eligibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>What we do know is that the idea from Canva is a spin-off from Perkins&#8217; previous startup, Fusion Books, an online publishing system for creating school yearbooks launched in 2007. That company, which she ran with Canva co-founder and COO <a target="_blank" href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/cliff-obrecht/20/a99/79b/">Cliff Obrecht</a>, currently has 10 percent of the Australian yearbook market and has more recently launched in New Zealand and France.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always knew that the technology we developed was much more powerful than just the yearbook market,&#8221; says Perkins. So last summer, the team decided to take that concept to a larger market. Canva, she explains, is supposed to make design accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment, if you have an idea in mind and you want to translate that into a design, there&#8217;s a huge number of friction points,&#8221; says Perkins. &#8220;It takes a very long time to create something &#8211; to create a simple design &#8211; unless you&#8217;re a professional designer.&#8221; During the co-founders&#8217; time at Fusion Books (which now has a GM in place running it), they were able to learn a lot about how non-professionals approach design, and how tools should fit into people&#8217;s natural workflow.</p>
<p>With the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fusionyearbooks.com/">Fusion Books platform</a> (patent filed <a target="_blank" href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20090327850.PGNR.">here</a>), users are able to login and collaborate on not only the text of yearbook pages, but also the visual experience. It takes the creation process online, instead of having pages emailed around among those on the yearbook team, for example. And the system provides users with easy access to page backgrounds, fonts, and layouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;That idea is being transplanted into Canva, but with more applications [than just yearbooks],&#8221; says Perkins. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/canva">Canva LinkedIn description</a> goes into more detail as to what that might mean in terms of actual use cases, saying it could be used to &#8220;<em>design your Facebook cover photo, new business cards, a presentation, menu for your cafe, brochure for your client&#8217;s business&#8230;</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>However, Perkins tells us that Canva won&#8217;t just be about taking design to the masses &#8211; it will have a product offering for design pros, too.</p>

<p>The company is now in the process rebuilding the technology from Fusion Books for the new project, and is using HTML5 as the platform for both web and iPad support. The team has not yet decided if they want to build a native iPad application for Canva, but may consider doing so in the future.</p>
<p>On the Canva team is ex-Googler and co-founder <a target="_blank" href="http://angel.co/themaninblue">Cameron Adams</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/08/heres-what-happened-at-fluent/">whose previous startup Fluent folded</a> after once <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/first-impressions-on-fluent-the-startup-promising-the-future-of-email/">promising</a> to disrupt email. Ex-Googler (Maps, Wave) <a target="_blank" href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/david-hearnden/1/54/555/">David Hearnden</a> is also on board, joining a team of nine full-time employees in Sydney.</p>
<p>With the seed funding, Canva will be focusing on getting its product to launch, at first simultaneously in the U.S. and Australia, then rolled out worldwide. Also under wraps are how Canva plans to monetize its platform, but we should know soon enough &#8211; the public debut is planned for May. In the meantime, users can sign up for the <a target="_blank" href="http://canva.com/">waitlist </a>here.</p>
