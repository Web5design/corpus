Welcome back for part three of our four-part roundtable discussion of  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> COO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/sheryl-sandberg">Sheryl Sandberg&#8217;s</a> new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/56475-sandberg-s-lean-in-tops-bestseller-chart.html">best-selling</a> book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-In-Women-Work-Will/dp/0385349947"><em>Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead</em></a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/techcrunch-tv-lean-in-roundtable-part-1-controversy-fear/">part one</a>, posted Tuesday, we discussed the controversy surrounding <em>Lean In</em> as well as the element of fear and how it plays into women&#8217;s career paths. In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/the-techcrunch-lean-in-roundtable-part-2-guilt-and-the-myth-of-doing-it-all/">part two</a>, posted yesterday, we discussed the emotion of guilt and the myth that women can &#8220;do it all.&#8221; </p>
<p>For our roundtable, we assembled a small group of Generation Y female leaders that represent the Silicon Valley tech industry&#8217;s rising new guard: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/leah-busque">Leah Busque</a>, the former IBM engineer who is now the founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taskrabbit.com">TaskRabbit</a>, the startup that has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/taskrabbit">built a platform</a> for outsourcing errands, tasks, and deliveries; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleymayer">Ashley Mayer</a>, the senior director of communications for cloud-based enterprise storage technology firm <a target="_blank" href="http://www.box.com">Box</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/megan-quinn-2">Megan Quinn</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.square.com">Square</a> alum who last year <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/31/kleiner-perkins-adds-another-female-partner-megan-quinn-former-products-director-at-square/">made the leap</a> into the venture capital world as a partner at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kpcb.com">Kleiner Perkins</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/pooja-sankar">Pooja Sankar</a>, the Stanford MBA and former <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> engineer who is now the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/piazzza">founder and CEO</a> of educational Q&amp;A platform <a target="_blank" href="http://www.piazza.com">Piazza</a>.</p>
<p>In this segment, we first tackled the topic of finding a mentor to help steer your career path. In <em>Lean In</em>, Sandberg argues that many women go about seeking mentors in all the wrong ways, and says that asking outright &#8220;Will you be my mentor?&#8221; is one of the most common mistakes women make. One of our panelists admitted that earlier in her career she was guilty of asking that very question &#8212; to Sheryl Sandberg herself! Though she says it ended up being a positive learning moment, that was certainly a surprising disclosure for us all to hear.</p>
<p>We also discuss Sandberg&#8217;s viewpoint on finding and linking up with the right life partner. Sandberg minces no words in <em>Lean In</em> about how important a solid partner is for having a successful career, and offers very frank advice on how to find one, writing: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When looking for a life partner, my advice to women is date all of them: the bad boys, the cool boys, the commitment-phobic boys, the crazy boys. But do not marry them. Marry the boys who are going to change half of the diapers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tune in above to hear our panelists talk about the mentors in their own careers, Sandberg&#8217;s straightforward view on dating and marriage, and more. And please check back in tomorrow for the fourth and final installment of our roundtable, in which we discuss how women can be their own worst enemies and our favorite takeaways from <em>Lean In</em>.</p>

Founded in 1999, the company got its start by developing technology to make the back-end aggregation of banking data more efficient and secure, leading to the birth of companies like Mint.com, which went on to be acquired by Intuit. Now, with more than 40 million users and $100 million in funding, the financial apps and management solutions provider has turned its focus back to the startup ecosystem. </p>
<p>Last summer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yodlee.com/press_release/yodlee-interactive-announces-new-accelerator-incubator-programs/">Yodlee announced a new accelerator program</a> that aimed to provide entrepreneurs both in and outside of the financial services space with a delivery system to help them more quickly and easily bring their fledgling ideas to market. Powered by Yodlee&#8217;s financial services platform, the accelerator program provides startups with &#8212; among other things &#8212; access to its API, which enables founders to pull in Yodlee&#8217;s reservoir of transaction-level financial data for everything from bank accounts, insurance and rewards programs to investment accounts. </p>
<p>Since then, a slew of companies have used Yodlee&#8217;s financial cloud and accelerator resources to build a range of applications focused on consumer debt protection, lending, taxes, eWallets and targeted marketing &#8212; to name a few. Today, the company is peeling back the curtain a bit to give TechCrunch a peek into the program&#8217;s performance over the last 10 months. </p>
<p>Since launching, Yodlee Interactive (the over-arching arm of Yodlee&#8217;s business that contains its accelerator program) has attracted companies like Xero, Credit Karma and LearnVest, which are now relying on the company for secure access to financial data. As a whole, Yodlee Interactive is now servicing millions of consumers, along with more than 300 companies (and their applications), a number Yodlee expects to grow to 500 by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>Yodlee Chief Strategy and Development Officer Joseph Polverari tells us that, over the last year, the company has begun to expand aggressively into international markets, with 20 percent of its customer base now located outside the U.S. Yodlee is also now powering what he says are two of the fastest-growing startups to come out of this year&#8217;s Finovate Europe conference, EZBOB and FreeAgent &#8212; and the U.K.&#8217;s top financial app, OnTrees, is also on board.</p>
<p>Behind the expansion of its international footprint, Yodlee is also today announcing a new class of startups that will be entering into its API incubator program: FairLoan, Glyph, Planwise and Prime Student Loan. The accelerator has incubated 10 companies to date, six of which have already launched, including Glyph, Planwise, FairLoan, Prime Student Loan, Sociogramics and MatchFund. The other four are still in stealth mode, and the accelerator typically averages two incubations per quarter, Polverari tells us.</p>
<p>Of its recent incubations, Glyph and Planwise have found the most traction thus far, he says, with Glyph recently launching version 2.0 of its app, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/13/glyphs-new-iphone-app-tells-you-what-credit-cards-to-use-to-earn-better-rewards/">which TechCrunch covered last year</a> and integrates account balance and data through Yodlee. </p>
<p>The companies selected by Yodlee do not offer up equity and do not have to pay to participate in the accelerator, which the CSO thinks gives Yodlee a leg-up amidst the glut of accelerators to launch over the last two years. In addition, entrepreneurs are given full access to Yodlee&#8217;s API for six months for free, as well as PR support, mentorship and strategic planning. But what founders have found most appealing, Polverari says, is the access that Yodlee provides to bank distribution for their services &#8212; the 40 million-plus users at some of the world&#8217;s largest banks.</p>
<p>For developers in financial services, overcoming the legal, regulatory and security hurdles is a tall order that often equates to a multi-year process. Yodlee wants to help take that barrier out of the equation for fledgling financial services startups. On rare occasions, the CSO adds, Yodlee may invest capital in its incubations, but only at the prevailing valuation; &#8220;We don&#8217;t act like a VC or the typical incubator,&#8221; he says, &#8220;our interest is solely in facilitating innovation and the growth of the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all philanthropic, of course, as Yodlee isn&#8217;t without self-interest; if it happens to pick a winner, that&#8217;s good for Yodlee&#8217;s business. Its incubations can become a great source of future partnerships. For startups, because Yodlee does not provide a public API (only a private, paid API), this means access to Yodlee&#8217;s relationships with banks and its financial services ecosystem. </p>
<p>The incubator accepts applications on a quarterly basis, with the next due date being March 29th, with final decisions to be made by mid-April. After that the next decisions will be made in June and announced in July. The accelerator doesn&#8217;t have strict application guidelines, Polverari says, and does not limit its startups to the FinTech-focused, instead considering a startup&#8217;s vision and stage of development to determine if it&#8217;s the right fit. </p>
<p>Officially, the program mentors its selected companies for six months, but tries to maintain its relationships for as long as possible &#8212; when those aforementioned partnership opportunities are most appealing, of course. Yodlee has also partnered with external incubators like Y Combinator and Techstars, offering their incubations a similar deal, meaning free use of its APIs for six months &#8212; but without the same level of mentorship and strategic planning. The program has helped accelerate 12 companies from external incubators by offering them the free API, including companies from YC, TechStars, 500 Startups, and Harvard University (like InDinero and ReadyForZero, to name two), the CSO says. </p>
<p>Below, you&#8217;ll find a bit more on the four latest additions to Yodlee&#8217;s accelerator:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairloanfinancial.com/">FairLoan</a> was founded to bring transparent, affordable and fair credit opportunities to the over 70 million Americans with limited access to credit.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paywithglyph.com/">Glyph</a> recently launched its brand-new web app and updated iOS app, which provide smart spending recommendations in order to maximize credit card rewards and improve a user’s overall credit score.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://planwise.com/">Planwise</a> offers an app that lets consumers see visualizations of their financial outlooks, to determine how spending decisions affect the present and future, and allows them to ultimately take control of their finances and save money.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.primestudentloan.com/">Prime Student Loan</a> focuses on refinancing existing student loan debt for qualified borrowers to pursue its goal of bringing fair and logical credit diligence to the student loan market. </p>

We also couldn&#8217;t resist checking out the service in action, and thusly hired Execs from the company&#8217;s standalone Cleaning app to help tidy up our NYC Aol Ventures crib. For those unfamiliar with Exec, the concept is quite simple. Exec lets you hire people on a case-by-case basis for errand-running and cleaning. The app originally launched as an errand-running service, letting Execs who sign on to the platform (and pass background checks) run to get you coffee, pick up your dry cleaning, or assemble that Ikea bed for you. You&#8217;re charged $25 per hour, the majority of which goes to the Exec and a percentage of which goes to the company. After realizing that cleaning was dominating over 50 percent of Exec&#8217;s orders, the company launched a standalone Cleaning app in February. Since, the cleaning side of the business has expanded to Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and here in New York City. &#8220;We wanted the cleaning app to be the easiest thing you can imagine,&#8221; said Justin. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want you to have to make any decisions.&#8221; He mentioned that most of the current cleaning services force you to play phone tag and call a number of services. Meanwhile, on Exec, you simply open the app and are instantly given the availability for your house cleaning and a quote. But even though cleaning makes up a large part of the Exec business, we can&#8217;t forget about errand-running.

As the company continues to enter new markets, the biggest challenge (according to Justin) is handling the logistics on the backend as the apps scale.

Like many kids apps startups, three former Adobe employees, Mike Fitzpatrick, Nigel Pegg, and Fang Chang, founded the company out of personal needs as parents. They came together to develop a service that encourages and develops a child’s love of reading. Bookboard’s library includes more than 300 books targeted at children ages 2-7. Parents can set up individual profiles for each child, track progress, and adjust the reading difficulty of books. According to Pegg, who is the CTO, the overarching goal for the company is “What can Bookboard do to motivate kids to spend more time reading?” That ends up driving many of its design decisions, particularly incorporating game dynamics into the app. As kids get older and the system detects changing interests, the app adapts to the growing child. Bookboard’s secret sauce comes from its librarian Cen Campbell, who defines and applies library organization guidelines to the collection, including classifications, metadata, and reading level assessment. With metadata on hand, the system can tackle two big data problems: 1) unlock relevant &#8220;next books to read&#8221; and 2) apply collaborate filtering techniques to recommend books. Unlocking Books &#8211; Incorporating Game Dynamics To Motivate A prevailing psychological theory, “the tyranny of choice,” argues that when provided with too many choices, people feel overwhelmed and overloaded and are, as a result, unlikely to pursue any of the options available. In building out the product, the Bookboard team encountered their big aha moment when they discovered that progressive unlocking was the key to driving engagement of the service. In the beginning, the app presented the entire library to kids. The team noted that the ratio of time spent browsing titles to time spent was too high. Then the team introduced artificial scarcity into the initial set of books that kids could choose from. Kids are motivated to make it through books to see what will come next. The unlocking of more choices over time serves as a reward mechanism. As a result, the time spent reading, as opposed to browsing titles, is now the bulk of time spent within the app. When a book is earned via unlocking, it is read over 75 percent of the time.

<p><strong>Unlocking Books &#8211; Incorporating Game Dynamics To Motivate</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/unlock.png"></a>A prevailing psychological theory, “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-tyranny-of-choice">the tyranny of choice</a>,” argues that when provided with too many choices, people feel overwhelmed and overloaded and are, as a result, unlikely to pursue any of the options available. In building out the product, the Bookboard team encountered their big aha moment when they discovered that progressive unlocking was the key to driving engagement of the service. In the beginning, the app presented the entire library to kids. The team noted that the ratio of time spent browsing titles to time spent was too high.</p>
<p>Then the team introduced artificial scarcity into the initial set of books that kids could choose from. Kids are motivated to make it through books to see what will come next. The unlocking of more choices over time serves as a reward mechanism. As a result, the time spent reading, as opposed to browsing titles, is now the bulk of time spent within the app. When a book is earned via unlocking, it is read over 75 percent of the time.</p>
<p>As kids progress in the app, they are presented with more book choices. Half of the selections are based on interest matching by looking at subject, characters, genre and theme. Then the rest are generated using collaborative filtering techniques to determine whether “other kids who completed this book also completed that book.”</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/recommendations1.png"></a></p>
<p><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The service currently does not include bestselling children&#8217;s books or Caldecott winners that parents look for. Nor do they have familiar character books like Sesame Street’s Elmo or classics like “Goodnight Moon.” To address this, Bookboard struck content partnerships with Peachtree Publishers and Open Road Integrated Media, a deal that will add popular children’s titles such as the Berenstain Bears and Boxcar Children series to Bookboard&#8217;s catalog. While these partnerships will remedy that in the long run, the question remains, does the service provide sufficiently engaging content for parents and children to keep them coming back for more?</p>
<p>I had a chance to try out Bookboard with my sons (ages 2 and 5) in the past week. The company has really identified something to keep my kids engaged and motivated, which makes Bookboard stand out among the countless ebook services in the market.</p>
<p>There are two plans to choose from: $29.94 for a six-month subscription, or $8.99 per month. The company also offers a free trial. The app is available now for the <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookboard/id607336107?mt=8&amp;uo=4">iPad</a>. Desktop and Android devices are forthcoming.</p>

<p>A close friend of mine asked me why she was never included in a cliquish group of guys who hung out at the same events she visited, and I told her it was because they were, to a degree, facing a very specific and detrimental dilemma. I believe that men/boys in tech are at once inclined to be polite to the point of harm to women &#8211; expressing a protective patriarchalism and elevating the woman in the industry to the level of untouchable Madonna &#8211; and are also inclined to one-up each other in an electronic form of the dozens, slinging the most outrageous things they can think of in order to make the group laugh. This does not excuse their cliquishness or diminish her hurt at being excluded, but tech culture (and many cultures where men are often alone together socially and professionally and the female is the anomaly) is at once hopelessly awkward and horrible at the same time. I would wager that the men at PyCon were called out not because they were an anomaly, but because they were caught by someone who was angry enough to react.</p>
<p>But something far worse happened after the fact. Dunderheaded jokes at professional conferences are not professional, but that&#8217;s not the problem. The problem is the Internet&#8217;s immediate and disproportional retribution and the hu´ers that protest far too much.</p>
<p>The great thinker Joel Johnson addressed this problem <a target="_blank" href="http://moteandbeam.net/reddits-bildungsroman">when he wrote</a>:</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">This is my theory: outcast cultures, formed by those who feel a shared exclusion from the mainstream, must survive an awkward adolescence before integrating fully back into the culture from which they are spawned. And like most teenagers, there is a lot of whining, misfired blame, and crying about “never asking to be born” before those cultures realize that despite their memory of an idyllic second childhood, everyone must eventually grow up.</div>
<p>The culture that bred the sort of behavior at PyCon is, in short, the same instinct that drives other &#8220;outcast cultures&#8221; to dress differently, curse authority, and generally be wildly unpleasant to those around them as a protective measure. The same situation would arise at any gathering of nerds, and PyCon, even given the mainstream nature of Python programming, is such a gathering.</p>
<p>Boys clubs are corrosive and dangerous and have, for the most part, been hidden or destroyed over the past few decades. That doesn&#8217;t mean that these unique cliques won&#8217;t pop up like mold on bread given the right circumstances. And, while I agree that the official reactions were far too harsh for the crimes, it seems that now the complainer, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">Adria Richards</a> is being attacked by Anonymous, and her personal information is being strewn across the Internet.</p>
<p>This is where the old &#8220;Python programmers will be Python programmers&#8221; argument breaks down. Because now, when bad behavior happens and someone is upset, an asymmetrical reaction will occur that attempts to protect the group rather than the individual. It is a rancid form of self-protection that wound its way into the depths via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN-cAsvzsh0">Jesse Slaughter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/the-obscurest-epoch-is-today/">Brian Krebs&#8217;</a> SWATing, and the folk justice meted out by various hordes of Internet vigilantes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen strong, intelligent women stalked online because they were women and their proximity to the things the lads loved was enough to make them targets of derision and anger. The nastiness finds purchase in mundane discussions about one technology versus another, and sexism and misogyny is often celebrated in online forums that, for the vast majority of users, are simply a pleasant diversion. Richards was wrong to publicly shame a pair of dicks, but the reaction to the shamer is far worse.</p>
<p>It needs to stop.</p>
<p>I know this cry into the wilderness will do little to help Richards. However, we as users and creators of technology are partially responsible for the ability of a group of ragers to mass against a common enemy. We take far too much personally and put far too little thought into our straw men.</p>
<p>To defend the laddishness of tech culture is impossible and, I would say, not the point. The laddishness is a product of too much frustration, too much striving, and too much time spent behind the keyboard. When this laddishness metastasize into true hate posing as defense of the herd it becomes truly dangerous. It is a waste of energy akin to methodically lighting a car on fire because you don&#8217;t like the song on the radio.</p>
<p>In explaining &#8220;our&#8221; peccadilloes to my female friend, I was forced to face what I and other men dedicated to the cultivation of their online lives have become: we are shy people lashing out at perceived threats, be it mildly in the form of refusing invitations or virulently in the form of online retribution.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a New Yorker cartoon featuring two <a target="_blank" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Internet_dog.jpg">pups talking</a>. One says to the other: &#8220;On the Internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog.&#8221; That was, once upon a time, a comment on the freedom afforded us by life behind the screen. Now, however, given the nastiness we exhibit and the good heart of the average labrador, I doubt those dogs want anything to do with us.</p>

Apple&#8217;s mobile software team now gets peeks at hardware prototypes sooner than before, the report claims, and Ive is pushing for a &#8220;flat design&#8221; in future versions of iOS.</p>
<p>The report is well-timed: Apple has just released an <a title="Apple Updates Podcasts App, Adds Custom Stations With iCloud Sync And Fixes Playback Resume Bug" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/apple-updates-podcasts-app-adds-custom-stations-with-icloud-sync-and-fixes-playback-resume-bug/">update to Podcasts that removes so-called skeuomorphic elements</a> (those that resemble physical objects, in this case a tape deck) from the design. That could very well be Ive&#8217;s influence at work, if he is indeed working more closely with iOS software interface teams. Or it might just be an indicator of the general shift in design climate at Apple resulting from recent management changes.</p>
<p>Ive now occasionally sits in on the human interface team led by Greg Christie at Apple, according to the WSJ, vetting new designs when they come up for review at regular meetings. And while he is reportedly pushing for change, the paper&#8217;s sources stress that those changes will be relatively subtle.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the claim that Apple&#8217;s newly united Mac and iOS teams are undergoing slow change under Craig Federighi, according to the unnamed sources, with more shifts expected in the summer. Apple also just <a title="Departing Adobe CTO And Cloud Guru Kevin Lynch Joining Apple To Become VP Of Technology" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/departing-adobe-cto-and-cloud-guru-kevin-lynch-joining-apple-to-become-vp-of-technology/">hired ex-Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch as VP of Technology</a>, so there are clearly still changes being worked out in the upper echelon of the company&#8217;s management. Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment on the WSJ&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s minor visual <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/01/29/its-in-the-details-ios-6-1-updates-lock-screen-music-controls/">updates to features like the lockscreen</a>, music playback controls, the music player itself, and the changes to Podcast could be a clue as to where Ive is having an influence on software interface design. The integration of thinking around software and hardware design could be a small but important ingredient in driving still more consumer interest in iOS, even if the impact of design isn&#8217;t always the most apparent.</p>
<p>I wrote about a shift in the thinking around <a title="Developers Lead When It Comes To The Future Of iOS User Interface Design" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/24/developers-lead-when-it-comes-to-the-future-of-ios-user-interface-design/">iOS interfaces being led by third-party developers</a> in a previous post, but a changed internal approach could bring about a similar, but likely more gradual internal shift. Hopefully this means the change to Podcasts today won&#8217;t be the last in terms of modernizing Apple app designs.</p>

		<title>AngelHack Launches A Startup Accelerator, Bringing Its Hackathon To 30+ Cities This Spring</title>

Now it's taking another step in that direction with the launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://angelhack.com/accelerator">its very own accelerator</a>.

As a result, the projects are usually pretty polished, though not yet at the level of full-fledged startups. Now it&#8217;s taking another step in that direction with the launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://angelhack.com/accelerator">its very own accelerator</a>.</p>
<p>The program will admit 40 teams into a 14-week program &#8211; 12 weeks of local mentoring, then two weeks in San Francisco pitch training, investor meetings, and events.

In exchange for the mentorship (and tickets to this fall&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt), AngelHack takes 2 percent equity.</p>
<p>Founder Greg Gopman said that his goal is &#8220;to be the largest funnel of seed-stage technical talent into incubators and investors around the world,&#8221; and he noted that previous AngelHack winners have joined Y Combinator, AngelPad, MassChallenge, TechStars and 500 Startups, and also raised hundreds of thousands of dollars on AngelList.</p>
<p>In addition to launching the accelerator, Gopman is also announcing the spring round of hackathons, which will take place in more than 30 cities, with the goal of enlisting 6,000 participating developers. It starts in late April. He said that last fall&#8217;s AngelHack was held in 11 cities with 2,200 participants (70 percent developers). And the hackathons feed into the accelerator — 10 teams will be selected from direct applications (the deadline is June 8), but the other 30 will be the winners of their local AngelHacks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/zynga-com.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Zynga.com" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Last March, Zynga <a target="_blank" href="http://company.zynga.com/about/press/press-releases/zynga-unveils-new-platform-play">announced</a> its ambitions to create a web and mobile platform for social games. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zynga.com">Zynga.com</a> is a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/zynga-network-adds-social-lobby-for-users-across-all-devices-zynga-with-friends/">destination</a> for both the company&#8217;s own games as well as for third-party developers who want to leverage Zynga&#8217;s social feed and users. In September, Zynga debuted its first third-party games. And today, Zynga is rolling out a number of changes to Zynga.com, namely how you sign in.</p>
<p>The platform itself allows developers to post to the stream of social gaming activity at Zynga.com, and also to include social features like chat and real-time multiplayer. One of the major changes with this update is how players sign in. Previously, you signed in via your Facebook login, and your experience was built around all your previous Zynga gaming interactions on the social network (based on your permissions). With the new sign-in, you actually sign in with a Zynga account that is created and Facebook Connect is optional.</p>
<p>You can still integrate all of your Facebook game boards, progress and friends, but this is no longer required. Reading between the lines, it appears that Zynga wants to continue down the road of becoming less reliant on Facebook for social interactions and more. This isn&#8217;t particularly surprising considering <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/29/zynga-facebook-deal-amendment/">Zynga and Facebook&#8217;s new terms</a> that were released late last year. As part of the agreement at the time, the Zynga.com platform was no longer obligated to use Facebook ad units and Facebook credits. In exchange, Zynga’s right to cross-promote its non-Facebook games using Facebook data and email addresses are limited by the standard terms.</p>
<p>Since launching, Zynga has noticed a number of things about how people are playing games on the platform, namely that people want to be challenged and they want the ability to progress faster.</p>
<p>For example, on the social stream, you can see who else is playing a current game (and your friends), and by interacting in the stream, you can share gifts to the community. So if you are in FarmVille, and you needed a specific tool, you could share this to your social stream, and any friends could click on this to send you the gift as a reward for interacting with the stream. Zynga does keep track of how many people you have helped.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only a way to showcase the millions of players that are playing with you, but it&#8217;s also a way to actually share gifts and benefit not only yourself within a game, but others. Seventy percent of players on Zynga.com are interacting with the social stream, and some are clicking more than 100 times a day.</p>
<p>Zynga also found that interweaving ads within the stream was better for players in terms of monetization than a static ad across the bottom of the page. The company has also been experimenting with actions like watching a video ad to get through a segment of a game.</p>
<p>Right now, Zynga is shipping more third-party games on Zynga.com than in-house. There have been more documentation, SDKs and tools (even a help forum) added to aid developers in building games around the platform.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Zynga is rethinking its approach to gaming at the moment. The company has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/cityville-2-shutdown/">shut down a number</a> of once-popular titles and is releasing fewer games and spacing their releases further apart. Zynga&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/zynga-q4-2012-earnings/">Q4 saw layoffs</a> and a continuing series of executive and mid-level departures. It&#8217;s clear this is a transition point for the gaming company, but the Zynga.com network is one of the areas that the gaming giant is doubling down. The goal is to figure out what&#8217;s sticky for both the player and the developers, and it&#8217;s a challenge to find a balance on both fronts.</p>

Stations are stored in iCloud and synced across devices, and users can choose to start with either the most recent episode or oldest unplayed one.</p>
<p>The update also adds on-the-go playlist creation and syncing of playlists back to iTunes, and fixes a problem users were reporting with playback not resuming correctly when jumping back into the app from another or the home screen. The interface has also been changed, notably <a title="Reports Claim Forstall And Browett Were Asked To Leave Apple Following Crucial Missteps" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/29/reports-claim-forstall-and-browett-were-asked-to-leave-apple-following-crucial-missteps/">doing away with skeuomorphic elements</a> in favor of something cleaner and more in line with the native iTunes music player.</p>
<p>The playback issues and interface were both resulting in some pretty negative reviews from users on the App Store. Now, the app looks to be much improved, and the new Stations feature actually adds a lot of value versus the old instantiation where podcasts were simply rolled in as part of the Music app on iOS.</p>
<p>Apple has a lot of competition in the App Store for its own podcasts app, including Casts, Podcaster, iCatcher and PodCruncher to name a few. Its original release of Podcasts failed to impress a lot of users, but this second kick at the can looks to get a lot of things right on the surface at least, which could mean less breathing room for the non-Apple competition.</p>

While you&#8217;re setting up an event, especially one that&#8217;s going to take place outside, it makes total sense that your potential guests would want to know what the weather conditions are for that day. Today, Facebook rolled out a project that was a part of a hackathon, which drops weather information onto event pages and unowned pages for places like parks and cities. The positive here is that Facebook is carefully surfacing this information in places on the site that make sense for users, rather than cramming it all over the place so that it just feels like clutter. For example, seeing the weather on an event page is fine, but it&#8217;s not something I want to see on my news feed. By providing this information, it&#8217;s just one less step you have to make when you&#8217;re making decisions on where to go. The addition of events is great for the guests, but when you&#8217;re setting up an event, you&#8217;ll also see the weather prediction for that day, which can help you form your description, suggesting that people bring a sweatshirt, perhaps. If the event is within the next 10 days, you&#8217;ll see a 10-day forecast: For people that you invite, they&#8217;ll see the predicted forecast for the location on the date of the event, as well as the the estimated high and low temperatures. For locations like cities and parks that have pages, you&#8217;ll see current conditions. All of this data is provided by Weather Underground: These details are also available on Facebook&#8217;s mobile app: For examples of the integration for location pages that aren&#8217;t owned by any particular user, check out the city of San Francisco, and more specifically Dolores Park, here in our neck of the woods. Once you see the weather information, you can choose to leave Facebook to get more detailed information, like satellite imagery, from Weather Underground&#8217;s site. This reminds us a little bit of Google&#8217;s move to beef up its search results for things like sports scores and schedules, displaying the important data so that you don&#8217;t have to click around to sites to find it. While this might take traffic away from third-party sources, it is helpful for users. Regardless, it&#8217;s a fine line to walk for Facebook, as there is probably a host of relevant information that it]]></description>

BlackBerry says that its devices and services are in the so-called Security Requirement Guide approval state right now, as are others, and BlackBerry will be the first to come out of it.</p>
<p>BlackBerry says that it&#8217;s getting approval for BB10 devices, the PlayBook and the on-device enterprise services that it runs on these, with that expected to come in early April.</p>
<p>From a BlackBerry spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our work with the U.S. Department of Defense is going well and the U.S. Department of Defense is moving forward with testing of BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 and the new BlackBerry Z10 smartphone.  We are currently working with the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and anticipate Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIG) and Security Requirement Guide (SRG) approval for the BlackBerry Device Service, BlackBerry 10 and BlackBerry PlayBook by early April. BlackBerry was the first to go through the new SRG process by the Defense Department and will be the first to successfully come out of it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>BlackBerry is in a critical position right now where each example of a key enterprise customer dumping the company&#8217;s devices is like another thorn in its side, or a straw on its back. The report that its position at the organization was getting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/u-s-department-of-defense-reportedly-planning-to-buy-650000-ios-devices-after-nixing-bb10-to-cut-costs/">replaced by some 650,000 Apple devices</a> would have been a catalysing example of how far it had fallen from its incumbent position as the king of enterprise mobility.</p>
<p>Some believe that while BlackBerry are still making the list for approved devices, when it <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121129/rim-is-losing-the-enterprise-market-to-iphone-and-android/">comes to user choice</a>, many are opting for other devices like Android handsets and iPhones &#8212; an opportunity that companies like Samsung and Apple are now trying to seize.</p>
<p>The DoD had <a target="_blank" href="http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/security/defense-spokesman-says-dod-not-dumping-blackberry">already denied</a> the original report, but what BlackBerry is doing is spelling out that not only will the order include its new range of BB10 handsets but also its ailing tablets as well as its Device Service, putting on a brave face to fight the next battle of the smartphone war.</p>

Founder and CEO Brian Wong told me recently that the fund was supposed to be a one-off promotion, but that enough developers had asked if he was going to do it again that, indeed, he's doing it again.

Just like last year, Wong is looking for the best developers of apps that integrate with Kiip's mobile rewards system, where users receive prizes from advertisers when they achieve certain goals in an app. There are, however, a couple of changes this time around. For one thing, there are only going to be 10 winners this year, not 20, which means that there's more prize money for each developer — $10,000 in cash, plus $5,000 in services from partners like Parse, Urban Airship, Amazon Web Services, Crittercism, and Localytics.]]></description>

Founder and CEO Brian Wong told me recently that the fund was supposed to be a one-off promotion, but this year, enough developers asked if he was going to do it again that, indeed, he&#8217;s doing it again.</p>
<p>Just like the first fund, Wong is looking for the best developers of apps that integrate with Kiip&#8217;s mobile rewards system, where users receive prizes from advertisers when they achieve certain goals in an app. There are, however, a couple of changes this time around. For one thing, there are only going to be 10 winners this year, not 20, which means that there&#8217;s more prize money for each developer — $10,000 in cash, plus $5,000 in services from partners like Parse, Urban Airship, Amazon Web Services, Crittercism, and Localytics.</p>
<p>The contest is also designed around a theme this year: &#8220;Creation.&#8221; The idea, Wong said, is to focus on apps that are really doing something innovative and creating new categories, rather than just offering a small tweak on what others have already done.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to look for the true creators who literally do not care about anything but just making something great for the sake of it being great,&#8221; Wong said.</p>
<p>The other addition this year is that Pepsi is sponsoring part of the Build Fund, specifically by offering sponsorships to the fitness apps that win.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Studio&#8221; opens the spring of 2013 by welcoming one of the best-known &#8220;super angels,&#8221; who arrived to Valley, by way of Boston, Philadelphia, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/08/16/aydin-senkuts-voyage-from-turkey-to-the-heart-of-silicon-valley/">Istanbul</a>, in the mid-1990s, held early product management stints at Silicon Graphics and a little startup called Google, which ultimately catapulted his career into what it is today.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/aydins">Aydin Senkut</a> founded Felicis Ventures after leaving Google, and today is regarded as one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/asenkut">best</a> &#8212; and earliest &#8212; super angel or micro VC funds in the Valley. As Senkut describes it, however, it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;boutique VC&#8221; operation, as Felicis is actually investing in companies that meet its criteria regardless of stage or location across mobile, e-commerce, enterprise, education, and health. As a thesis-driven firm, Senkut and his colleagues have also identified &#8220;frontier markets&#8221; of interest, which include 3D printing, imaging, and vision; genomics; and connected devices.</p>
<p>In this conversation, Senkut and I discuss a range of tactical and investment issues which would be relevant to early-stage founders. As Google&#8217;s first product manager, Senkut brings experience of seeing a rapidly growing company expand internationally and hit scale, an operational point of view which informs his investment intuition. Now as his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.felicis.com/team/">team</a> has grown at Felicis, he and his colleagues have, over the years, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/aydin-senkut">invested</a> in over 80 companies with nearly half of them finding exits. That type of track record underscores the fact that Felicis are active, hands-on investors who understand the pressures (and dangers) founders face with respect to rising valuations in today&#8217;s funding environment. For instance, Senkut warns against the dangers of founders wanting to minimize dilution at the cost of limiting exit options in the future. He is remarkably <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/10/ask-a-vc-aydin-senkut-talks-the-series-a-crunch-natural-selection-for-startups-and-more/">candid</a> on this dimension, and I believe every early founder should hear his rationale.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/eric-schmidt.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="eric-schmidt" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Apple reached out to us today to clarify that regardless of comments made by Google Executive Chairman at the Big Tent event in India earlier today, it hasn&#8217;t yet <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/googles-eric-schmidt-says-the-ball-is-in-apples-court-for-google-now-on-iphone-and-ipad/">received an official submission of Google Now for iOS</a>. Their&#8217;s no such app in the queue, Apple says, so Google Now on iOS is still a pipe dream for the time being.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Schmidt&#8217;s comments are at 17:50 in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/googles-eric-schmidt-says-the-ball-is-in-apples-court-for-google-now-on-iphone-and-ipad/">this video of the fireside chat from Big Tent </a>with Alan Rusbridger. He explicitly talks about Apple&#8217;s approval policy and Google apps submitted to the queue. But it appears his comments didn&#8217;t specifically reflect an iOS version of Google Now in particular, despite bringing up the subject in direct reference to that topic brought up by a Rusbridger question.</p>
<p>Google Now for iOS might still be in the works at Google as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/alleged-promo-video-heralds-google-nows-eventual-debut-on-ios-devices/">this apparently leaked video suggests</a>, but it&#8217;s still in Google&#8217;s hands according to this new information direct from Apple.</p>

Today, it&#8217;s announcing that it&#8217;s opening to iOS developers as well.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2011 and has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/pocket-change-series-a/">raised $6.4 million from Google Ventures</a> and others. Co-founder and CEO Ari Mir said that last year, Pocket Change switched its model from being a virtual currency that users have to pay for in apps, and instead became something that&#8217;s given to users as a reward for &#8220;positive, organic behavior,&#8221; say for achieving certain goals in a game. The currency can then be redeemed for both virtual and physical rewards.</p>
<p>The switch turns around Pocket Change&#8217;s relationship with users, Mir said: &#8220;You cannot build a successful universal currency if you have a negative relationship with the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company offers the currency for free to developers, and it makes money by including sponsored rewards, turning Pocket Change into an ad company. (The sponsorship part of the business is only a few weeks old.) There&#8217;s no revenue sharing with the developers, who benefit instead by increasing user engagement — Mir said that for some apps, Pocket Change has increased the number of sessions per user by more than 20 percent in a month.</p>
<p>The virtual currency is now used in 500 applications and reaches 3 million users per day. Mir said that about 20 to 30 percent of those millions actually convert to become Pocket Change users.</p>
<p>As for why it stuck with Android until now, Mir said, &#8220;It&#8217;s actually really simple. We&#8217;re obsessed with building a good consumer Internet experience, so we need to iterate with the product really fast. As an SDK provider, there&#8217;s already that lag time.&#8221; Adding in the Apple approval process would only make the delay worse.</p>
<p>Now, however, Mir said he&#8217;s comfortable with the product and is ready to go cross-platform. He said this was a big demand from existing Pocket Change developers, but he&#8217;s also hoping to reach a new group of apps.</p>
<p>Other startups make a similar pitch to developers include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kiip.me">Kiip</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sessionm.com">SessionM</a>. Mir argued that Pocket Change is different from the competition because of the direct relationship it builds with consumers, and because of its emphasis on a non-interruptive experience. He also has an ambitious vision for the company, where Pocket Change could eventually be used to make other purchases on the web, such as getting around a newspaper paywall, and to make purchases in physical stores.</p>

At least it appears that&#8217;s what happened with PyCon this week when a sexual joke led to some very public firings, a virulent debate about women in technology, another virulent debate about public shaming, and now, a DDOS attack. So here&#8217;s what happened: 1) While sitting in the 10th row of a Python programming conference, a developer who used to work for mobile monetization startup Playhaven apparently made a joke about “big” dongles and &#8220;forking someone&#8217;s repo.&#8221; 2) Adria Richards, a developer evangelist sitting in front of them, called them out on Twitter and in a blog post for making the conference environment unwelcoming toward women. PyCon then escorted them out to the hallway. Not cool. Jokes about forking repo&#039;s in a sexual way and &#34;big&#34; dongles. Right behind me #pycon http://t.co/Hv1bkeOsYP&#8212; Adria Richards (@adriarichards) March 17, 2013 &#8220;Women in technology need consistant [sic] messaging from birth through retirement they are welcome, competent and valued in the industry,&#8221; she explained in a blog post. 3) Shortly afterward, Playhaven said it had fired the developer. CEO Andy Yang explained, &#8220;As a company that is dedicated to gender equality and values honorable behavior, we conducted a thorough investigation. The result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go.&#8221; He added that the employee wasn&#8217;t Alex Reid, who is the guy looking straight at the camera in Richards&#8217; tweeted photo. Reid still works for Playhaven. 4) The unnamed fired employee showed up on Hacker News by the name of &#8220;mr-hank&#8221; and apologized for the joke. I really did not mean to offend anyone and I really do regret the comment and how it made Adria feel. She had every right to report me to staff, and I defend her position. However, there is another side to this story. While I did make a big dongle joke about a fictional piece hardware that identified as male, no sexual jokes were made about forking. My friends and I had decided forking someone&#8217;s repo is a new form of flattery (the highest form being implementation) and we were excited about one of the presenters projects; a friend said &#8220;I would fork that guys repo&#8221; The sexual context was applied by Adria, and not us. My second comment is this,]]></description>

<p>At least it appears that&#8217;s what happened with PyCon this week when a sexual joke led to some very public firings, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1amhhi/forking_and_dongle_jokes_dont_belong_at_tech/">virulent debate about women in technology, another virulent debate about public shaming</a>, and now, a DDOS attack.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<p>1) While sitting in the 10th row of a Python programming conference, a developer who used to work for mobile monetization startup Playhaven apparently made a joke about “big” dongles and &#8220;forking someone&#8217;s repo.&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Adria Richards, a developer evangelist sitting in front of them, <a target="_blank" href="http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/">called them out on Twitter and in a blog post</a> for making the conference environment unwelcoming toward women. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/pycon/status/313425560313421824">PyCon then escorted them out to the hallway</a>.</p>

<p>3) Shortly afterward, Playhaven said it had fired the developer. <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.playhaven.com/addressing-pycon/">CEO Andy Yang explained</a>, &#8220;As a company that is dedicated to gender equality and values honorable behavior, we conducted a thorough investigation. The result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go.&#8221; He added that the employee wasn&#8217;t Alex Reid, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1alg55/woman_at_pycon_tweets_a_picture_of_two_guys/">who is the guy looking straight at the camera in Richards&#8217; tweeted photo</a>.

<p>4) The unnamed fired employee <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5398681">showed up on Hacker News by the name of &#8220;mr-hank&#8221; and apologized for the joke</a>.</p>

<p>My second comment is this, Adria has an audience and is a successful person of the media. Just check out her web page linked in her twitter account, her hard work and social activism speaks for itself. With that great power and reach comes responsibility. As a result of the picture she took I was let go from my job today. Which sucks because I have 3 kids and I really liked that job.</p>
<p>She gave me no warning, she smiled while she snapped the pic and sealed my fate. Let this serve as a message to everyone, our actions and words, big or small, can have a serious impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>5) After news that the developer was let go came out, Richards <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=adriarichards">said on Hacker News that she didn&#8217;t intend for the developer to get fired</a>. She then started getting some incredibly degrading criticism on her Facebook page and on Twitter. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/adriarichards/posts/633920489967718">I won&#8217;t re-print it here, but you can just read the link. It&#8217;s awful.</a> </p>
<p>6) PyCon recently changed its code of conduct to add this: &#8220;Public shaming can be counter-productive to building a strong community. PyCon does not condone nor participate in such actions out of respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>7) <a target="_blank" href="http://pastebin.com/ubmznGhn">Someone claiming to know plans of the hacker group Anonymous posted a note</a> this morning saying that it had acquired SendGrid&#8217;s client list and was going to attack the company&#8217;s infrastructure if the startup didn&#8217;t fire Richards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adria Richards engaged in malicious conduct to destroy the another individual&#8217;s professional career due to what she perceived as an affront to her own extremist views from a comment that was not directed at her, not meant for her to hear, and certainly not for her to provide unwarranted input on. As such, she should have her professional career destroyed just like her victim in order for justice to be rendered and balance restored to the universe. The hivemind&#8217;s judgement is final and there is no appeal. No forgiveness, no forgetting remember?</p></blockquote>
<p>8) <a target="_blank" href="http://support.sendgrid.com/entries/23417077-21-Mar-Website-Down-Refusing-Mail">SendGrid acknowledged that they had suffered a DDOS, or distributed denial of service, attack today.<br />
</a></p>
<p>9) And now, just hours ago, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SendGrid/posts/10151502570463967">SendGrid&#8217;s Facebook and Twitter accounts plus their company blog posted that Richards has been terminated:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Effective immediately, SendGrid has terminated the employment of Adria Richards. While we generally are sensitive and confidential with respect to employee matters, the situation has taken on a public nature. We have taken action that we believe is in the overall best interests of SendGrid, its employees, and our customers. As we continue to process the vast amount of information, we will post something more comprehensive.</p></blockquote>
<p>SendGrid&#8217;s CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.sendgrid.com/a-difficult-situation/">just posted the company&#8217;s rationale for firing her</a>. Basically they disagree with how she handled responding to the joke so publicly and say that she&#8217;s no longer going to be effective in her role at the company. He didn&#8217;t say whether the company could have offered her a different role. </p>
<blockquote><p>A SendGrid developer evangelist’s responsibility is to build and strengthen our Developer Community across the globe. In light of the events over the last 48+ hours, it has become obvious that her actions have strongly divided the same community she was supposed to unite. As a result, she can no longer be effective in her role at SendGrid.</p>
<p>In the end, the consequences that resulted from how she reported the conduct put our business in danger. Our commitment to our 130 employees, their families, our community members and our more than 130,000 valued customers is our primary concern.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hold on. Wait, what? Did this even really need to happen?</p>
<p>Mix a single tasteless joke with the wrath of the Internet, and this is what you get. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly out of control. <a target="_blank" href="https://amandablumwords.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/3/">None of this had to happen.</a> I can&#8217;t speculate about the firings, because they&#8217;re often complex decisions that factor in more than a single joke or a blog post.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s important to be conscientious about off-color jokes in public or in a workplace.</p>
<p>Secondly, don&#8217;t publicly shame people before discussing it with them in a more direct way &#8212; whether that has to be facilitated by a third-party like PyCon or not. This is not to undermine the very real concern that the tech industry hasn&#8217;t always been that comfortable for women.</p>
<p>I was reading Mahatma Gandhi&#8217;s autobiography this weekend (really) and he wrote: &#8220;We win justice quickest by rendering justice to the other party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, as a tech journalist who has covered many conflicts between companies, going public is always the strategy of last resort. Otherwise, you risk instigating the unpredictable and fickle behavior of the Internet masses. And if you read the tweets and comments <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/adriarichards/posts/633920489967718">that are coming Adria Richards&#8217; way, it is some of the foulest kind of hate that the web harbors.</a> Far worse than a dongle joke. </p>
<p>Indeed, this firestorm is a classic example of how the distance between people on the web can sometimes make us less understanding and empathetic to each other, not more. </p>

The only thing that is between you and millions of people is the tweet button.</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet' lang='en'><p>Exactly one year ago today, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>&mdash; <br />Xeni Jardin (@xeni) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/xeni/status/274895223782510594' data-datetime='2012-12-01T15:18:23+00:00'>December 01, 2012</a></blockquote>
<p>When you see a tweet like the one above, other than it being very personal, you have to remember that Xeni was referencing something she spoke about on Twitter a year before that moment. Using Twitter, she had kept people informed on her progress, her roadblocks and everything in between. If you were to follow her on Twitter you&#8217;d be able to connect with her and her thoughts and emotions in a way that you could never do on Myspace, Friendster or even Facebook. It&#8217;s real, it&#8217;s raw and it&#8217;s right now. It&#8217;s pure. It simply has to stay that way.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_2013-03-21-10-24-04.png"></a>There have been rumors that Twitter will be <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57573859-94/twitter-acquires-we-are-hunted-readies-standalone-music-app/">launching its own music app</a> and that&#8217;s causing some to rehash the discussion about how <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/17/twitter-does-a-lot-of-different-things-for-different-people-deal-with-it/">Twitter will change and become a horrible &#8220;media company.&#8221;</a> That argument doesn&#8217;t hold much water. This music app, which Twitter hasn&#8217;t confirmed or denied, would be a standalone app that simply uses all of the signals that we&#8217;re giving the service to yank out useful recommendations and music listening options. The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/twitters-video-sharing-app-vine-goes-live-in-the-app-store/">same thing happened with Vine</a>. If you remember, Twitter wanted to get into video, so it bought the service and launched it in a standalone fashion. Sure, you can see Vines within your Twitter stream, but if you&#8217;re really into video, the Vine app is where you&#8217;ll spend your time. By segmenting all of these different types of media into their own apps, Twitter is actually protecting its platform. To be successful in the future, this needs to continue.</p>
<p>Having said all of this, Twitter is indeed trying to build a successful business and company in the hopes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/06/heres-why-twitters-road-to-an-ipo-wont-be-as-rocky-as-some-might-think/">going public as early as next year</a>. You can&#8217;t hold that against them, but you can hold them to their original appeal, which is a clean platform that only asks you to share &#8220;What&#8217;s Happening?&#8221; in 140 characters. If that ever changes dramatically, we can then start to worry.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how our founder, Michael Arrington, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/">described Twitter (then called Twttr)</a> when it launched in 2006:</p>
<blockquote><p>Odeo released a new service today called Twttr, which is a sort of “group send” SMS application. Each person controls their own network of friends. When any of them send a text message to “40404,” all of his or her friends see the message via sms.</p></blockquote>
<p>After seven years, this description still rings true. Let&#8217;s hope it stays that way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/thumbs-down1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="thumbs-down1" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Forrester has put out a new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forrester.com/How+To+Build+Your+Brand+With+Branded+Content/fulltext/-/E-RES92961">digital marketing report</a>, off the back of a survey of more than 58,000 online consumers, looking at how brands can better sell themselves and create content that flies in the digital age. One interesting takeaway is a chart (see below) which shows how U.S. and European consumers react to different types of advertising/marketing content.</p>
<p>While the finding that trust in &#8216;traditional&#8217; push marketing techniques (such as banner ads) is at rock bottom in the online world <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/online-ad-survey-most-u-s-consumers-annoyed-by-online-ads-prefer-tv-ads-to-online-want-social-media-dislike-button-and-reckon-most-marketing-is-a-bunch-of-b-s/">isn&#8217;t a surprise</a>, the chart doesn&#8217;t make hugely encouraging reading for proponents of social marketing which also languishes near the bottom of the trust index, just above the mobile apps channel. Text message communications were the least trusted, while online banner ads barely rated above spammy SMS in the trust stakes.</p>
<p>The relatively low trust in social marketing tallies with a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/gartner-digital-marketing-survey-2012/">recent Gartner report</a> that found U.S. marketers ranked spending on the corporate website as more likely to result in &#8220;marketing success&#8221; than spending on social media sites such as Facebook.</p>
<p>Despite SMS, banner ads, mobile apps and social marketing methods being similarly (and lowly) ranked in the consumer trust stakes, the chart in Forrester&#8217;s report actually shows large variation in the effectiveness of different marketing methods &#8212; with the most positively ranked promotions (namely: recommendations from friends and family) up to around 8x more trusted than the least trusted methods.</p>
<p>One amusing result highlighted by the chart is that Europeans are shown living up to their cynical reputation, with Forrester finding for every type of advertising content it asked about in the survey Europeans consistently trusted it less than their U.S. counterparts (including, it has to be said, their own friends and family).</p>
<p>Also interesting to note that &#8220;professionally written online reviews&#8221; still carry a huge cachet &#8212; at least with U.S. consumers. European consumers are far less trusting of the publishing industry, however (55% vs 33% split on that category).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/forrester-digital-marketing-poll/screen-shot-2013-03-21-at-16-40-26-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-782551"></a></p>
<p>The report notes that traditional &#8216;one-way&#8217; marketing techniques like banner ads are clearly ineffective in a landscape of &#8220;perpetually connected consumers&#8221;. Web users are tuning out this old school type of marketing or failing to notice it in the first place or forgetting they ever saw it &#8212; which may also partially explain why personal recommendations from people they know well are so much <em>more</em> trusted. With so many sources of information to filter, better the devil you know and all that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brand-led advertising online and offline has lost its allure,&#8221; notes report author Tracy Stokes. &#8221;Today’s consumers decide where, when, and how they want to engage with brands. With multiple interconnected devices at their fingertips at any one time, these perpetually connected consumers can opt in or out of content as they choose&#8230; Marketers face a higher bar to engage consumers, who have more media options than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey also indicates there is still considerable trust in natural search engine results, and also in consumer written reviews, such as Amazon&#8217;s user reviews &#8212; which were both ranked around 3x more trusted than social marketing.</p>
<p>The North American portion of the survey polled 58,068 US and 5,635 Canadian online adults ages 18 to 88 in Q2 2012, while the European poll was conducted in Q3 2012, polling 20,778 European individuals in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The European survey was based on an online population of ages 12+ (16+ in Poland) who were members of the Ipsos-MORI online panel.</p>

To bridge this gap, Mozilla launched the asm.js project a while back and today, this code has landed in Firefox Nightly. OdinMonkey, Firefox&#8217;s name for its asm.js optimization module, allows developers to write their code in C or C++, compile it to JavaScript using Emscripten and run it at a speed that is within 2x of native performance. Unless the project hits any roadblocks, Mozilla expects OdinMonkey to ship with the stable version of Firefox 22 in June. Asm.js is a strict subset of JavaScript that &#8220;can be used as a low-level, efficient target language for compilers.&#8221; As the asm.ja specs note, this sub-language &#8220;effectively describes a safe virtual machine for memory-unsafe languages like C or C++.&#8221; Because it is just a subset of JavaScript, this also means that the code would still run in any other browser, too &#8211; it would &#8220;just run slower in the other browsers than in Firefox,&#8221; as a Mozilla spokesperson told me earlier today. You can find all the gory technical details about how this works here and in this earlier post by Axel Rauschmayer. Mozilla will also focus on this during its sessions at the Game Developer Conference in San Francisco next week. From a users perspective, this means that you could soon see significantly better and complex games in your browser (and most game developers work with C or C++ anyway, so this is a natural fit for them) as well as generally faster web apps, assuming developers start adapting asm.js. If you want to see what a difference OdinMonkey can make, try the BananaBench benchmark or this Emscripten-compiled falling boxes demo on Firefox Nightly. In my own tests, BananaBench ran about 3x faster using the Nightly. For now, Mozilla has only enabled this feature on desktop Windows and Linux, but the organization says it will arrive for desktop OSX and the mobile version of Firefox on ARM soon. In case you are wondering where the name OdinMonkey came from, Mozilla&#8217;s Luke Wagner says this death metal song was the inspiration (I sadly can&#8217;t understand a word these fine gentlemen are]]></description>
