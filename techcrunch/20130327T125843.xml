				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/siri_icon_lg.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="siri_icon_lg" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Apple is in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/apple-in-court-in-china-over-siri-claim.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=43742&amp;NewsCatID=374">court again in China</a>, defending another of its products from attack based on pre-existing claims from a Chinese company. This time around it&#8217;s Siri, Apple&#8217;s virtual assistant, that has landed it in Chinese legal trouble, after last year another company took issue with the <a title="With Proview Settlement Done And Dusted, Apple’s New iPad Finally Comes To China July 20" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/10/apples-new-ipad-finally-comes-to-china-july-20/">iPad trademark resulting in a $60 million settlement deal</a>.</p>
<p>The claim this time is from Zhizhen Technology Co., a Shanghai company that holds a patent for voice recognition software for its &#8220;Xiao i Robot,&#8221; software that was originally patented back in 2004. Siri, Inc. was founded in 2007, after being spun out of SRI International and before being acquired by Apple in 2010. Zhizhen first <a target="_blank" href="http://bgr.com/2012/07/05/apple-siri-chinese-patent-lawsuit-ios/">filed suit back in July last year</a>, at which time this video supposedly demonstrating a version of Xiao i Robot in action on a Lenovo device surfaced.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ku0H10_G1X4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Xiao i Robot can be installed on smart TVs, and is employed by countries around the world in customer service functions, according to an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/nsp/District/2012/06/25/Xiao%2Bi%2BRobot%2Bstorms%2Bthe%2Bonline%2Bworld/">article from Shanghai Daily</a> published back in June 2012. The tech has apparently been used by 360buy.com, as well as the Chinese government and a number of other enterprise customers.</p>
<p>Zhizhen told says it will ask Apple to &#8220;stop manufacturing and selling products using its patent rights, once Apple&#8217;s infringement is confirmed,&#8221; one of its lawyers told the AFP. Should it be successful, it may also seek compensation down the road for any damage done by Siri to its financials to date. Apple had asked for the case to be dropped, and was rejected in that effort, the lawyer said. Today&#8217;s hearing paves the way for a full trial beginning in July 2013.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple has fallen under attack by Chinese media for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9955056/China-takes-another-swipe-at-Apple.html">customer service and return policy complaints</a>. The company has responded on its official website to respond to some of these attacks, but analysts suggest this could be part of an effort to<a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323466204578382101284619638-lMyQjAxMTAzMDIwNTEyNDUyWj.html"> encourage more consumption of home-grown tech solutions</a> by Chinese consumers. China also recently partnered with <a title="Canonical Is Building A Standardized, Open-Source OS Specific To China" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/canonical-is-building-a-standardized-open-source-os-specific-to-china/">Ubuntu creator Canonical to develop a China-specific open source operating system</a> that seems in part designed to wean its IT sector off of foreign-developed software tools.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bb10stagram1.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="bb10stagram" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>BlackBerry&#8217;s App World <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/just-as-ceo-heins-predicted-blackberry-world-now-plays-home-to-over-100000-apps/">now touts 100,000 BB10</a> applications. An impressive number for a platform just months old. But out of those 100,000 applications, roughly 20% are Android apps, simply ported over rather than being coded specifically for BlackBerry 10.</p>
<p>This is a win for BlackBerry. It&#8217;s a big win. Android or native, it shows that BlackBerry is successfully pulling developers into its fold. Even without the Android apps, App World still has roughly 80,000 native BB10 apps. As it sits right now, the Android ports are simply holding seats for big apps.</p>
<p>BB10 has a good selection of apps now, but it&#8217;s still missing key apps with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/theres-no-native-instagram-app-for-blackberry-10-but-this-ported-android-version-gets-the-job-done/">Instagram</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/blackberry-community-wants-marquee-apps-so-bad-its-porting-them-diy-style-and-blackberry-doesnt-approve/">Netflix</a> being two of the biggest holes. But don&#8217;t worry, there are Android ports available. And while they might not be native to BB10, these apps still work. That&#8217;s what matters at this point.</p>
<p>While the Android ports run just fine, most do not utilize BB10&#8242;s core services making them feel and respond different from native BB10 apps.</p>
<p>BlackBerry foresaw it might have a hard time launching its application platform so, with incredible foresight, the company made sure it could at least lean on Android&#8217;s vast application library. Most importantly, porting an Android app provides a low-cost of entry, allowing Android developers to test BB10 without risking a lot.</p>
<p>“We give them a very nice on-ramp to get onto the platform,” Martyn Mallick, BlackBerry’s vice president for global alliances and business development, <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20130326/one-in-five-blackberry-10-apps-is-really-an-android-app/">said in an interview with AllThingsD</a> Tuesday. “Our users deserve to have great content. If that is the fastest way we can get some of that content, that’s great.”</p>
<p>Of course BB10 users and BlackBerry itself would still prefer native BB10 apps, but at this point in the platforms age, content is content. But the platform is growing at an incredible pace. BlackBerry claims 30,000 applications were added in the last couple of weeks. Each day BB10 early adopters are waking up to new apps with just 20% Android apps.</p>
<p>Now if BlackBerry can just get its CEO <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/sigh/">to focus on current products</a>&#8230;</p>

Posting a new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idc.com/tracker/showproductinfo.jsp?prod_id=655">report</a> for full year 2012 and projections through to 2017, the analyst notes that market expansion last year was &#8220;largely driven&#8221; by 78.4% year-over-year growth in tablet shipments &#8212; which exceeded 128 million units. But this is just the beginning for tablets: IDC expects tablet shipments to surpass desktop PCs in 2013, and portable PCs in 2014.</p>
<p>Overall, worldwide shipments of smart connected devices grew 29.1% year over year in 2012, and the entire market pushed past one billion units shipped, with a total market value of $576.9 billion.</p>
<p>IDC said it expects tablets to grow their share of the overall smart devices market from 10.7% in 2012, to an estimated 16% by 2017 &#8212; with a projected growth rate of 174.5% between 2012 and 2017. Over the same period, the desktop PC category will have negative growth of -5%, and will slide from 12.4% share in 2012 to 6% share in 2017.</p>
<p>Portable PCs are also project to take a declining share of the market, dropping from a 16.8% share in 2012 down to 11% estimated for 2017. The category will still see some growth, according to IDC, which is projecting 19.3% growth for portables over 2012 to 2017. But the powerhouse growth is in the tablets and smartphone categories &#8212; the latter projected to also grow by triple-digits (109.9%).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/idc-tablet-growth-2012-2017/screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-11-22-43/" rel="attachment wp-att-786399"></a></p>
<p>This year IDC said it expects the tablet market to reach &#8220;a new high&#8221; of 190 million shipment units, with year-on-year growth of 48.7%. While the smartphone market is expected to grow 27.2% to 918.5 million units.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers and business buyers are now starting to see smartphones, tablets, and PCs as a single continuum of connected devices separated primarily by screen size,&#8221; said Bob O&#8217;Donnell, IDC Program Vice President for Clients and Displays, in a statement. &#8220;Each of these devices is primarily used for data applications and different individuals choose different sets of screen sizes in order to fit their unique needs. These kinds of developments are creating exciting new opportunities that will continue to drive the smart connected devices market forward in a positive way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powered by growth in the tablet and smartphone categories, IDC predicts the worldwide smart connected device market will continue to &#8220;surge&#8221; &#8212; with shipments forecast to surpass 2.2 billion units and revenues reaching $814.3 billion in 2017. By 2017, 83% of the market is projected to be composed of smartphones and tablets, up from 70.8% in 2012.</p>
<p>Returning to 2012, IDC noted that in Q4 of the year Apple significantly closed the gap with market leader Samsung in the quarter, thanks to the combination of its refreshed smartphone (iPhone 5) and new smaller tablet (iPad Mini). Apple took 20.3% unit shipment share in the quarter versus 21.2% for Samsung, according to IDC. On a revenue basis, Apple continued to dominate with 30.7% share versus 20.4% share for Samsung.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wanelo.com">Wanelo</a>, the hot social ecommerce startup that is reportedly raising new funding at a valuation <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/26/pinterest-for-products-wanelo-raises-at-north-of-100m/">north of $100 million</a>, joined us in the TechCrunch TV studio to talk about how the company is NOT a Pinterest for products to buy, the company&#8217;s fast growth, and, of course, whether the startup is raising new cash.</p>
<p>Founder <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/deena-varshavskaya">Deena Varshavskaya</a> tells us that Wanelo is really about social shopping and creating an ecommerce experience that allows users to not only curate their own favorite products to buy, but also discover new ones. The company hopes to make online shopping about people, not about the stores themselves.</p>
<p>Wanelo allows you to bookmark items that you like and allows you to buy those items via direct links from the site. It is not a Pinterest, as Varshavskaya explains, because the site is based around discovering items you can actually purchase.</p>
<p>In terms of discovery, you can search for specific items, see categories of items (i.e. dresses, shoes, bags), see items that are trending (have been liked the most), items from your friends and more. You can also see top stores, top profiles, and more.</p>
<p>Wanelo (which is derived from Want, Need, Love) aims to be a network of stores, products and people that connects buyers to all products. Varshavskaya tells us above that she saw an opportunity to create an ecommerce experience that was designed for long-term engagement, by allowing users to organize all of their shopping and finding new items they may like online.</p>
<p>Since launching two years ago, the site has quietly accumulated 6 million registered users (70 percent of which are active, visiting the site monthly), and is one of the most downloaded apps on the App Store. Currently there have been 5 million products posted in Wanelo that have been saved 700 million times. In fact, 8 million products are being saved each day.</p>
<p>And brands are catching on. Varshavskaya says that retail chains like Urban Outfitters and Free People are flocking to the site to set up storefronts. The benefit to brands is that users are using the site to purchase items, so conversion rates are reflective of that mentality. Wanelo makes money from affiliate fees via each purchase.</p>
<p>Varshavskaya, who ended up leaving Cornell University two classes short of graduating, says her life really started when she left college. She started a video-based online casting directory, which never really took off. She then pursued UX design at a social network, and then opened a design agency, but started thinking about what was lacking in the online shopping world. Wanelo was born.</p>
<p>And about those funding rumors&#8230;Varshavskaya says that the company is well-funded to grow, and wouldn&#8217;t comment on whether they have raised.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear from talking to Varshavskaya that there is much more to come from Wanelo from a product standpoint. In her view, the company is only getting started, and there&#8217;s still a lot more Wanelo can do with personalization and curation. The one problem she has solved that many startups face is high and frequent engagement&#8211;which is why it&#8217;s no surprise that VCs are champing at the bit to get a piece of the company.</p>
<p>Tune in above for more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-8-05-20-pm.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-26 at 8.05.20 PM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Storytelling has been around for thousands and thousands of years, predating technologies we know as &#8220;writing&#8221; &#8212; and even &#8220;tweeting.&#8221; As one of the oldest forms of communication, storytelling has long been used as a way to transfer knowledge, as a way to teach and to engage an audience.</p>
<p>Although he studied aerospace engineering at MIT, Misha Leybovich has always been fascinated by storytelling, he told me over coffee last week. So, after stints as a post-graduate researcher at both MIT and Cambridge and after working as a consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company (while testing his own storytelling chops as a part-time clown), Leybovich decided to combine his love for technology and storytelling to help people communicate their digital own narratives, be they biographical, historical &#8212; or anything in between.</p>
<p>Leybovich and long-time friend Francis Escuadro founded <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meograph.com/">Meograph</a> last year with the goal of creating an &#8220;Adobe for everybody&#8221; &#8212; to let anybody create four-dimensional digital stories without having to know how to use more advanced content creation tools, like Final Cut Pro, Photoshop and so on. Using Meograph, in under 10 minutes, he says, anyone can log in and create a story through a simple input-type interface, adding YouTube videos, photos, time stamps, maps, annotations and narration. </p>
<p>The result is a kind of Pro Tools/Final Cut for Dummies, in which users can create interactive, rich media narratives that include pop-up-style annotations, a la SoundCloud. This, Leybovich says, gives the resulting &#8220;Meographs&#8221; that 4D feel. Importantly, he continues, what has long been missing from digital storytelling is context, so, by adding videos mixed with maps and links within timelines, Meograph aims to let people give context to the stories they want to tell, whatever they may be.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-10-29-08-pm.png"></a> When Meograph started out, the founders didn&#8217;t necessarily intend for their startup to become another EdTech company. But the &#8220;flipped classroom&#8221; model has been gaining steam over the past year, as teachers look for effective tech tools that will help them retain their control over the classroom, while enabling them to better engage (and educate) students. </p>
<p>Over time, the founders watched as teachers began to use Meograph to help students learn about topics, assigning the tool as part of homework to help them create their own stories around subjects they learn about in class. [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.meograph.com/ahughes17/15303/causes-of-the-civil-war">Here's a great example</a>.] In turn, teachers are looking for digital tools that will allow them to better utilize project-based learning, while allowing students to take the reins in their own learning process.</p>
<p>As Meograph began to be used more frequently as a learning tool, Meograph has shifted focus to the point where it now almost exclusively targets teachers. Today, Leybovich says that there are over 26,000 content-creating Meographers, more than 36,000 stories have been told and the product has been used in more than 1,300 schools. As a result, its users base is growing by 30 percent every month, is seeing 50 percent growth in monthly active users and over 40 percent of its users have created multiple stories &#8212; with 45 percent of its traffic emanating from abroad.</p>
<p>The founders say that teachers are adopting Meograph because it helps them teach their young students communication skills through storytelling, and demonstrate mastery of content while building their digital media skills. The team has also been working to align Meograph with project-based learning and Common Core standards and has been developing a standard &#8220;rubric&#8221; to help teachers measure student performance. </p>
<p>While teachers should be able to determine the factual accuracy of their students&#8217; presentation, the Meograph Rubric is designed to help them understand how proficient students were at, say, adding and introduction, thesis, context, supporting arguments, and the quality of audio, images, video and so on. The team is also busy working on better ways for teachers to connect student projects to their lesson plans (while fulfilling CommonCore requirements), alongside generating a rubric for more comprehensive grading.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-10-33-20-pm.png"></a></p>
<p>To push the service along and to begin generating some revenue from its growing teacher base, Meograph is launching a paid educational license, which includes teacher-focused extras, like student subaccounts, privacy controls and group pages. The plan will be priced by classroom, the founder tell us, with Lite, Plus, and Pro plans at $19.99, $29.99, and $39.99, respectively. </p>
<p>The idea was to tailor pricing in such a way so that teachers can make the purchasing decisions themselves in order to make the process self-service as the startup gets rolling on other features. Next, the team wants to create ways for a school or district to buy licenses for unlimited use on a per-student basis. Meograph can handle case-by-case bulk license purchasing now, Leybovich says, and they plan to make it easier for entire schools and districts to purchase self-service-style soon. [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.meograph.com/education#extras">More details here</a>.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the core tool will remain free &#8212; for both schools and users outside of education. Leybovich tells us that Meograph is also being used by news organizations like ABC, NPR, Univision and others, as well as tourism companies, non-profits and sports fans to help tell their stories. So while the company will focus primarily on educational applications for Meograph going forward, the core vision remains the same: Building a suite of easy-to-use content creation tools, beginning with a service that makes it simple to combine video, audio, pictures, text and so on into contextualized, interactive stories.</p>
<p>Since launching last year, Meograph has been boostrapped, but the founders are currently raising a round of seed funding to help them hire engineers and build out additional premium features for teachers. There&#8217;s definitely still a lot of work left to be done for Meograph, and some additional design and engineering assistance will go a long way. The more the startup can reduce the time it takes to create one of these interactive, mult-dimensional stories, and the more tools it can make available as part of the content building process, the better. </p>
<p>Simplifying the creation process and bringing a breath of fresh air back to how students create interactive presentations has big potential both in the classroom, and outside.</p>

<p>The funding came from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jafco.com">Jafco Ventures</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trinityventures.com">Trinity Ventures</a>, and previous investors, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/04/bechtolsheim-backed-moovweb-develops-mobile-sites-and-smartphone-apps/">including Sun co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim</a>. Jafco&#8217;s Joe Horowitz and Paul Sallaberry have joined Moovweb&#8217;s board of directors, while Trinity&#8217;s Gus Tai is becoming a board observer.</p>
<p>The company says its technology takes the content from an existing desktop website and converts it into a mobile site, as well as apps for smartphones and tablets. And it&#8217;s not just the content, but other features and business logic too, so that it can capture the full functionality of the site. Companies can then use the Moovweb SDK to build device-specific features. And when a customer updates their site in the future, all of those changes are synchronized their mobile versions too.</p>
<p>Moovweb says it has already converted &#8220;nearly 12 billion mobile pages&#8221; for customers like Macy&#8217;s, 1-800-FLOWERS, Sur la Table, and Accenture. It says that revenue has quadrupled over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>The company is also announcing that has hired Tony Russo, who most recently served as CFO at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/30/adobe-acquires-efficient-frontier-to-boost-its-digital-marketing-solutions/">Adobe-acquired Efficient Frontier</a>, as its new chief operating and finance officer.</p>

Spotted by <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/27/boxee-tv-dlna/">GigaOM</a>, the update also adds 3D streaming of content from Vudu, the <a title="Walmart’s Vudu Now Lets You Convert Your DVDs And Blu-Rays To Digital Copies From Your Home" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/07/walmart-vudu-disc-to-digital/">video streaming service from Walmart</a>, and changes to its TV guide and notification settings.</p>
<p>Boxee TV is the follow-up to Boxee&#8217;s original hardware, the Boxee Box. That first-gen device actually had DLNA streaming while the Boxee TV shipped without it. The addition of DLNA means that the Boxee TV can now playback media over a local network from a computer or drive running DLNA server software, and can also play content from select Android devices and from a number of iOS apps. Photos, video and music can all be shared via the DLNA streaming protocol. It&#8217;s like a non-Apple-specific version of AirPlay, and it&#8217;s a very handy addition to Boxee TV that considerably increases its general usefulness.</p>
<p>The Boxee TV also now gets on-device DVR management, which is a big improvement over the old system where you can to schedule recordings via a website on a separate computer. In other words, this whole update seems to have been about ironing out the kinks and making sure the Boxee TV fully delivered on the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/boxee-tv/"> generally good impressions</a> it received when it launched late last year.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the market for a set-top streaming device, the update makes Boxee TV a good option for consumers who might be looking at either an Apple TV or the new Roku 3, but who want a DLNA-capable device to handle streaming of their own media collection. Like both of those devices, the Boxee TV retails for $99.</p>

Samsung <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/24/apple-wins-patent-ruling-as-jury-finds-samsung-infringes/">lost out big to Apple last year</a> in a mobile patent blowout in the U.S., but it&#8217;s been slowly building up an arsenal of patents that potentially will keep it from falling into the same situation again. Samsung, also currently the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/13/gartner-huawei-takes-3rd-place-in-global-smartphone-rankings-in-q4-2012-top-two-samsung-apple-dominate-with-52-share/">world&#8217;s biggest mobile company</a>, received the most mobile patents in 2012, and it now holds the most mobile patents of any company worldwide, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chetansharma.com/Mobile_Patents_Landscape_2013_Chetan_Sharma_Consulting.pdf">latest patent report out from mobile analyst Chetan Sharma</a>, which lays out a thicket of companies scrambling to put a legal seal on their intellectual property in the fast-moving world of wireless communications.</p>
<p>For his study, Sharma looked at more than 7 million mobile patents awarded in the U.S. and Europe, the two biggest markets for patents globally at the moment. He found that the U.S. has stolen a march over its old world counterpart since 1996. The U.S. accounts for nearly three-quarters (72%) of all mobile patents across the two regions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Within the wider world of technology patents, mobile in particular is on the rise. In the U.S., Sharma believes that by the end of this year mobile patents will account for 25% of all patents granted, compared to just 5% in 2001. In Europe, mobile patents will be 10% of the whole patent pool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. Not only is mobile in a rapid period of development at the moment &#8212; the growth of smartphone and tablet usage is fuelling a massive market for services, hardware features, networking innovations and more. But in addition to that, mobile patent litigation has, for better or worse, proven to be lucrative for those who win &#8212; either by way of licensing fees (one example: the cut that <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/microsofts-patent-strategy-against-android/">Microsoft gets on Android devices</a>) or court victories (the $1 billion Apple/Samsung case perhaps being the most notable example, even if it is still getting contested).</p>
<p>On the European side, the fact that the proportion is lower could be due to fewer companies in the region putting as much emphasis on R&amp;D as in the U.S., but also it is a comment about the wider shifts in gravity that we see in the tech world. On that note, it&#8217;s also interesting to note that 2011 was the first year that China outstripped the U.S. in patent growth &#8212; 22% that year compared to 3.3% for the U.S. and 3.8% worldwide &#8212; although it is still far behind the U.S., Europe and Japan in terms of actual patents. &#8220;The numbers of foreign filings are now in the majority for both the applications filed as well as the patents granted,&#8221; Sharma notes.</p>
<p>Sharma notes that Samsung&#8217;s rise to the top has bumped Nokia from its traditional position as biggest mobile patent holder. Others that are still making the top-10 include Sony, Microsoft, RIM, LG, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Panasonic, Alcatel-Lucent, and Nokia. The full ranking for mobile patents granted in 2012 is as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Among mobile operators AT&amp;T, NTT Docomo and Sprint took the top-three slots &#8212; but their numbers were too low to get them to compete against vendors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Part of Samsung&#8217;s prominence in patents, meanwhile, is down to fact that it covers a wide range of business pieces, similar to Nokia in its heyday. It led not only in device patents, but also infrastructure and platform &#8212; the one category where Apple also made it into the top-10:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For a look at what may be coming on the horizon, Sharma also looks at patent applications. He notes that patent applications grew by some 61% in 2012 compared to the same period 10 years ago. Taking into account granted and pending patents, IBM stands out ahead of the group, with Microsoft and Samsung closing in.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-10-26-13.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="SoSocio" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Dutch startup <a target="_blank" href="http://sosocio.com/">SoSocio</a> has raised $600,000 in second round funding from a European consortium of private investors to expand the reach of its Facebook Photobook application. The app lets users create digital and paper-based photo books and cards out of their social snaps. The consortium of investors is led by VC <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brooklyn-ventures.com/">Brooklyn Ventures</a> from The Netherlands, which also funded SoSocio&#8217;s first round.</p>
<p>SoSocio, which was founded in 2011, has raised $765,000 to-date. It said it will be using this latest funding round to fuel international expansion. Currently its products can be ordered around the world but parts of its site are in Dutch, limiting its reach. International expansion will &#8220;primarily focus&#8221; on Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain to start with, followed by the US &#8220;later on&#8221; &#8212; where it said its app is already gaining &#8220;some traction&#8221; (but would not break out specific user numbers).</p>
<p>Discussing general usage, CEO Wouter van den Berg said SoSocio is seeing &#8220;about a thousand books a day&#8221; being created &#8212; although he would not disclose the percentage of those that are its paid-for print product vs free digital photobooks. In future, as user numbers grow, he said the startup plans to add more advertising in the app as another way to monetize the service.</p>
<p>It also has a third business model: SoSocio offers its tools as a white label service to traditional print companies. van den Berg said the proportion of printed photobooks via these third parties is &#8221;much higher&#8221; than via its own label offering &#8212; which he put down to &#8220;Facebook visitors liking to play around with the apps&#8221;. He argued that the white label service differentiates SoSocio from other similar startups that are seeking to sell products based on social networkers&#8217; photo content, name-checking the likes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/02/blurb-book-publishing-ebooks-eileen-gittins-interview/">Blurb</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/pastbook-raises-250k-to-help-preserve-online-memories-instagrammers-first-in-line/">Pastbook</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the larger photo services in The Netherlands and Germany&#8230; already use or are going to use over the coming weeks our app in their own design and connected to their own payment and print facilities,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;We also offer our app to brands (mainly in travel) that like to offer the functionality to their clients (greeting cards during holiday, photo books right after) via Facebook, site and/or mail. Also some famous DJs use it to engage with their fans via Facebook.&#8221;</p>
<p>SoSocio will be releasing a new version of its app early next month, with an updated look and feel, and support for printing both photo books and cards. The app is fully HTML5 so it works across desktops, smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>SoSocio currently offers either a softcover or hardcover photo book for €12,95 ($16,60) or €16,95 ($21,70) respectively.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/screen-shot-2013-01-21-at-01-08-48.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="payleven chip and pin in action" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>There is no single mobile payment company in Europe that has reached the scale and stature that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.squareup.com">Square</a> has in the U.S., where the Jack Dorsey-led startup processed <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/01/business/la-fi-square-dorsey-20130201">$1 billion</a> in transactions in 2012. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.payleven.co.uk">Payleven</a>, one of the many mobile payment startups that want to take that crown on the other side of the pond, is today announcing two more steps in its strategy to convince businesses and consumers to sign on. Payleven, part of the Samwer brothers&#8217; Rocket Internet stable, has been authorized as a payment institution by the UK&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/">Financial Services Authority</a>; and it is also now part of MasterCard&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastercard.com/corporate/mpos.html">mPOS program</a> &#8211; two moves to improve its credibility as a secure payment provider.</p>
<p>This makes Payleven one of the first companies of its kind to get FSA certification in the UK &#8212; but not the first. As one example, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.izettle.com">iZettle</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/izettle">well-backed</a> competitor, has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.izettle.com/gb/security">FSA approval as a financial institution in Sweden</a> because that is where it&#8217;s headquartered. In Europe, approval by one FSA typically extends that approval to the rest of the European countries in the EEA footprint. In the UK, another competitor, <a target="_blank" href="http://sumup.com">SumUp</a>, also has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/register/psdFirmBasicDetails.do?sid=305962">FSA approval as an authorized payment institution</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very proud to be a trusted and fully authorised financial institution in Europe. Payleven is the first mobile payment provider to receive [UK] FSA authorisation, so it’s a major milestone for the company,&#8221; said Alston Zecha, co-founder and COO of Payleven, in a statement.</p>
<p>The mPOS certification from MasterCard, meanwhile, puts Payleven on par with a number of other mobile payment providers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastercard.com/corporate/_assets/img/features/MPOSApprovedSolutions.pdf">who have already signed on</a> to MasterCard&#8217;s authorization scheme, which lays out best practices for merchants and payment providers, not just in terms of unifying standards but keeping security. It&#8217;s another move to improve Payleven&#8217;s credibility as a secure payment provider, with MasterCard regularly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mastercard.com/corporate/_assets/img/features/MPOSApprovedSolutions.pdf">publishing a list</a> for merchants to see which payment services are able to process different types of transactions.</p>
<p>Payleven <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/08/payleven-the-samwer-square-clone-surmounts-visa-hurdle-with-chip-and-pin-reader-now-sold-in-europe/">last year</a> became the first of the mobile payment companies to unveil a chip-and-pin terminal to process card transactions in the UK.</p>
<p>These are required in the UK for payments on the Visa network, which in Europe now only accepts secure PIN entry as a way of authenticating users making mobile-phone based payments. Since debuting the chip-and-PIN reader last year, Payleven has been working hard to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/03/the-founders-of-rocket-internets-square-clone-payleven-on-technology-and-taking-mobile-payments-mass-market/">set itself apart from the Samwer &#8220;clone&#8221; stereotype</a>.</p>
<p>“We are Payleven. We are more than a clone. We are not replicating but we are creating something differently,” Zecha told TechCrunch last year.</p>
<p>Indeed, not only has Square not yet opened for business here in Europe, but it has yet to role out solutions that would work with chip-based payment cards, focusing first on the magnetic stripe that is more common in its core U.S. market, among other point of sale services. eBay-owned payment provider <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/21/paypal-here-is-coming-to-the-uk-its-first-market-in-europe-armed-with-a-new-way-to-read-your-card/">announced in February</a> that it would be offering its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paypal.co.uk/here">Here</a> mobile payment service in the UK, its first European market, later this year. It will also come armed with a separate device for entering PIN identification to work with a merchant app on a mobile device.</p>
<p>In general, what FSA authorization means is that payment providers have been evaluated and approved by the financial regulator, and that they are meeting a required degree of security and risk management. Certifications of this kind help persuade skeptical businesses that they can put their trust into mobile payment startups not to run off with their money or compromise their security at any point. Longer term, it will also mean that Payleven (and others that get FSA approval) will be able to launch more extensive services directly to their enterprise customers without needing to use third parties who have FSA approval for the task.</p>
<p>In the UK, the FSA has been under fire for its role (or lack of role) in various financial problems over the last several years &#8212; one of the most recent being an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bfd0ea20-858c-11e2-bed4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2OjAxtRoG">admission of its slow response to the Libor interest-rate fixing scandal</a>. On the other hand, the FSA has also been making some moves to make it easier for startups like Payleven to get into the transactions game. Just this week, it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/mar/26/fsa-eases-new-bank-rules">announced proposals</a> to make it easier for startups to establish themselves as banks &#8212; needing just €5 million ($6.4 million) in capital for FSA approval. In other words, approval from an FSA may be a mixed blessing, but an important one all the same.</p>
<p>Payleven has to date <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/payleven">publicly disclosed some $15.2 million in funding</a>, with backers including NEA, Holtzbrinck Ventures and Italian businessman/politician Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s family fund.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-2-14-12-pm.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-19 at 2.14.12 PM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>If you&#8217;ve ever been in a sports bar with your friends to watch a big game, you&#8217;ve likely run into the &#8220;muting&#8221; problem. While the bar may have two dozen TVs, each might be playing a different game, and there&#8217;s either too much sound or none at all. At most local restaurants, bars, airports and health clubs, you&#8217;ll find TVs muted for this very reason.</p>
<p>Some have opted to, say, put speakers on tables in their bars to project sound more directly, but the problem is that this puts a damper on any socializing you planned to do with your friends and fellow bar mates. Might just be me, but repeatedly yelling &#8220;WHAT DID YOU SAY?!&#8221; over the audio can detract from the viewing experience. After all, you&#8217;re really there to enjoy some quality time with friends &#8212; the thrilling play-by-play isn&#8217;t the only attraction.</p>
<p>Durango, Colorado-based <a target="_blank" href="http://airbornemediagroup.com/">Airborne Media</a> is hoping to offer another solution with a new product called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.audioair.net/">Audioair</a>, which aims to turn smartphones into your own personal listening device to help unlock sound from the tens of millions of muted TVs out there. Essentially, Airborne wants to put its audio solution anywhere an un-muted TV would add to the location&#8217;s overall noise pollution &#8212; every airport, hospital, sports bar, stadium or health club in the U.S.</p>
<p>But how does it work, you ask? Users download Audioair&#8217;s free mobile app, which taps into the sound system (via Wi-Fi) at any Audioair subscriber location, allowing you to determine which TV you want to listen to, projecting the audio through your smartphone so you can listen from your pocket or through headphones. Airborne is currently piloting its solution at 47 sites, including sports bars, restaurants, student health facilities and even a large resort casino, and plans to be in 800 locations by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>To help get Audioair off the ground, the startup has raised $3 million in seed funding, $1 million of which is convertible debt, from a handful of local investors. But, let&#8217;s be honest, creating a personal audio channel for muted TVs has some appeal, but it could be subject to a fairly limited use case. It&#8217;s not difficult to imagine significant others and friends the world over not being particularly pleased when, in the middle of a conversation, you throw in your headphones to hear the local play-by-play.</p>
<p>Plus, Airborne has to convince enough restaurants that it&#8217;s a good idea to invest in their on-premise hardware and buy another TV for their in-venue display. How does it hope to accomplish that tall order?</p>
<p>Airborne believes that its technology can help change the consumer experience within a multitude of these noisy environments and bridge the gap between mobile devices and customer engagement displays. So, not only does it want to provide a better audio experience for the end user, it wants to act as an interactive social networking experience and dedicated, location-based advertising network for bars, restaurants and any local venue.</p>
<p>The service allows users to chat with other people in the venue directly through the Audioair app, along with checking-in and adding content from their phones to the sports bar&#8217;s local network. This adds a social networking element to the end-user experience; in the meantime, Audioair allows venues to display local advertising on the user&#8217;s phone or on a 42-inch digital display that they install in the bar.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-4-00-50-pm.png"></a></p>
<p>At the outset, the startup has been offering discounts on the cost of the TV (and the installations themselves) to reduce friction for early customer acquisition, but the idea is that &#8212; once/if this catches on, bars will be paying for the cost out of their own pockets.</p>
<p>Audioair charges a monthly fee, which will be an add-on to the fees bars are already paying to DirectTV and so on for cable, but the idea is that the product can help venues reduce the perceived (and actual cost) by helping them attract more customers who stay on the premises longer &#8212; because they can actually hear the sound of the game.</p>
<p>On top of that, bars can distribute on-site promotions through Audioair&#8217;s digital display and mobile app, facilitating increased spend, while engaging customers in an in-bar, interactive social and ad network.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-4-04-47-pm.png"></a>Venues can then share in the ad revenue gained from their displays, while receiving analytics on how customers are interacting, what they&#8217;re sharing and so on. They can also disseminate the needed info publicly or privately as needed (think personalized hospital, airport alerts).</p>
<p>The Airborne Media founders said that they see revenue coming from three buckets &#8212; advertising, installation and licensing &#8212; with revenue initially coming from subscription and installation and advertising revenue becoming the main stream over time. As to the licensing piece, the team says that they&#8217;ve filed for eight patents on their system (which are currently pending), which could help them manufacture some defensibility for a model that could become vulnerable to competition from big players as prices on hardware continue to drop.</p>
<p>Audioair also tries to sweeten the deal by providing an optional on-site server to manage the local, network and cloud-based content and, by splitting a portion of the advertising revenue with the owner, the startup wants to help them cover the cost of the subscription fee and grow their own revenues over time.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-26-at-4-03-40-pm.png"></a>The Audioair creators also believe they have a leg up on the competition because it has inked a partnership deal with one of the original commercial DirecTV installers, which has exclusive territory rights to a big chunk of real estate &#8212; from Florida to Washington, D.C. It provides DirecTV service and support to over 5,000 restaurants and will be helping Airborne make installations throughout its territory, which the founders believe will be critical to helping it expand its footprint.</p>
<p>Again, it seems like a niche play, but if something like this is going to work, it could be a multi-pronged approach that&#8217;s not only an audio helper but a local information and advertising system, complete with hardware support and revenue sharing. There are 38,000 sports bars and restaurants in the U.S., 28,000 health clubs and plenty of airports, casinos and college campuses where Audioair could potentially have some appeal.</p>
<p>If the startup is able to keep its prices from stifling those venues that are willing to give it a try &#8212; and surmount the potential &#8220;this is too complicated&#8221; reaction from local venues &#8212; while offering real value-add on the advertising side (and some better design of its mobile interface), there&#8217;s a chance Audioair could have some real legs.</p>

His last attempt, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">iStockphoto</a>, which he founded in 2000, has since become one of the largest resources for stock images, media and design elements on the Web. And, as a result, Livingstone has become known as one of the pioneers of &#8220;microstock&#8221; or &#8220;micropayment&#8221; photography.</p>
<p>Having learned from the ups and downs of iStockphoto (and its sale to Getty in 2006), Livingstone is now on a mission to put a new spin on the world of stock photography. With Stocksy, the founder wants to create a digital licensing co-op and an online marketplace that is actually owned by its members and is dedicated not only to paying them for sharing their work with the masses, but to helping them sustain their careers.</p>
<p>To do that, Stocksy will give its photographers 50 percent of each transaction it sees, along with 100 percent on extended licenses. In addition to that, 90 percent of all profits will be divided among its members at the end of each year. And, what&#8217;s more, photographers accepted into the co-op will be given equity in the business and &#8220;will have a real say in how the business is operated,&#8221; he says. </p>
<p>Given how competitive the market for selling digital photos online has become over the years, these are some ambitious goals, to say the least. But it&#8217;s also true that Livingstone has a long history with stock photography &#8212; especially on the Web &#8212; one that dates back to the 1990s. </p>
<p>When the graphics company he was working for in the 1990s put the kibosh on his suggestion that they should begin selling online, Livingstone struck out on his own. He built a small collection of stock photography, but struggled to find buyers. Frustrated, he pulled a 180 and opted to give them away instead. In 2000, he founded and launched a site where people could register and download &#8220;as many high-res photos as [they wanted] and use everything with a royalty-free license,&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/iStockphoto-sees-new-rivals-everywhere/2008-1025_3-6173039.html">he later told CNET</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/">iStockphoto</a> was born.</p>
<p>But, again a funny thing happened: People didn&#8217;t want Livingstone&#8217;s images; instead, photographers and designers wanted to upload their own images to share with the community. The platform started to snowball thanks to its user-generated content and, over the next year as bandwidth expenses became too high, iStockphoto began selling credits &#8212; but at a much lower price than competing stock photo sites. Users could get high-res images for a buck and artists got paid a royalty. </p>
<p>The site continued to grow from there &#8212; to the point where it now has millions of images, members and tens of thousands of contributing artists. In 2006, Livingstone sold to Getty for $50 million, where he stayed on as CEO until being fired in 2009.  </p>
<p>However, in the years after the acquisition, the microstock and royalty model that Livingstone put in place in the early years was slowly eroded. Over time, Getty changed its format and licensing deals and decided to reduce its high royalty rate, which, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3007439/tech-forecast/istockphoto-creator-bruce-livingstone-takes-second-stab-stock-photos">as Fast Company</a> points out, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/forum_messages.php?threadid=252322&amp;page=1">Livingstone himself defended</a>. Since then, Getty has struck up a deal with Google that allows Google Drivers to use its photos in their work, paying only a relatively minor one-time fee.</p>
<p>Now, with the capital gained from the $50 million sale of iStockphoto, Livingstone has the runway to develop a model that is, in fact, much more favorable for the photographers. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-2-57-51-am.png"></a></p>
<p>Again, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3007439/tech-forecast/istockphoto-creator-bruce-livingstone-takes-second-stab-stock-photos">as FC points out</a>, compared to iStockphoto, which gives photographers 15 percent of sales and as much as 45 percent of exclusive sales, and Shutterstock which offers 20 to 30 percent royalties, the share that Stocksy doles should look pretty attractive to photographers. 90 percent of profits divided equally among contributors and shareholders at the end of each year? Hard to beat that.</p>
<p>Livingstone says that photographers have continuously sought him out to tell him how tough the industry is and how unfavorable the terms are for artists on most digital photography sites. So, while there are plenty of big names out there, like Shutterstock, the Canadian believes that there&#8217;s plenty of demand for the Stocksy model &#8212; one that gives photographers and artists a more equitable shake. </p>
<p>The model has already attracted people like Sean Locke, who Fast Company says had nearly one million license sales on iStockphoto until the company ended the relationship <a target="_blank" href="http://seanlockephotography.com/2013/02/11/a-change-in-things/">because he had criticized the Google Drive partnership</a>, he explained on his blog. Locke is now one of 220 photographers on board at Stocksy at launch &#8212; photographers who are collectively uploading 1,000 photos each day and selling those images at prices that range from $10 to $100. </p>
<p>From that price range, it&#8217;s easy to see that Stocksy is making a play at becoming not only a resource for stock photography, but a repository for premium photography. The founder says that you won&#8217;t find the traditional, run-of-the-mill images that comprise the bulk of the inventory on most photography sites. Instead, Stocksy will prioritize quality over quantity, screening each image before it goes on the site. </p>
<p>Of course, Shutterstock also plans to launch its own premium stock photography site in the near future (<a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/61111695">called Offset</a>), so even if Stocksy is seen as being relatively alone in the space for now, it won&#8217;t be for long. Stocksy plans to add vector-art illustrations to its catalog at some point in the near future, and may look to video after that, but it likely won&#8217;t be soon. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-27-at-2-59-38-am.png"></a></p>
<p>The problem is that, while Stocksy may be an incredible deal for photographers, the average person on the Web looking to use photography for their content or website (or whatever the case may be) isn&#8217;t looking to pay $100 for a photograph, unless they plan to frame it and hang it on their wall. So you won&#8217;t be seeing Stocksy opt for the iStockphoto or Shutterstock model anytime soon, and, naturally, that&#8217;s just the way Livingstone wants it. </p>
<p>The hope is that, just as consumers are becoming increasingly interested in Fair Trade coffee and how their food is grown, packaged and distributed, for example, and interest has grown in brands like Tom&#8217;s that put social good ahead of profits, they&#8217;ll be willing to do the same for photography. Stocksy may have a leg up on the bigs in this market by not worrying itself with profits and big quarterly returns, and it certainly has plenty of appeal to photographers.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to support the careers of its resident photographers requires enough sales to make that possible. There&#8217;s no reason to think it can&#8217;t get there over time, but relying on the consumers of stock photography to be as fair-minded as those buying Tom&#8217;s Shoes may mean that Stocksy is waiting for a long time. </p>

The former head of Google China, who was once booted off Sina and Tencent Weibo for three days, recently made a graph of how often his microblogging posts have been censored. Computer scientists Jed Crandall and Dan Wallach conducted a study on how quickly censorship on Sina Weibo can work, with findings reported by the BBC and originally published on arXiv.org. The two researchers, who believe their study is the first &#8220;real-time analysis of Weibo posts,&#8221; say they &#8220;found a landscape in which a post could be deleted as quickly as five minutes after being put online and where the censors appear not to work a regular day, but seem to take a break when China&#8217;s all-important 19:00 news comes on.&#8221; Censors work rapidly: most deletions happened within the first hour after a post had been made, with about five percent of deletions happening within the first eight minutes, and 30 percent in the first half hour. Nearly 90 percent were made within the first 24 hours. Crandall and Wallach spent 30 days tracking posts by 3,500 users on Sina Weibo. During that time, they write, 300 of the accounts, or 12 percent of the total, were deleted. Accounts that got censored the most often also had posts censored the most quickly, showing that they might be the target of more scrutiny. Though they could not estimate the exact number of people dedicated to deleting posts on Sina Weibo, the two computer scientists said that Sina Weibo would need to employ at least 4,000 censors every day if none of the process was automated. Crandall and Wallach called censorship a &#8220;sophisticated operation,&#8221; with &#8220;relatively sophisticated programmers who build their censorship tooling.&#8221; Automated systems appear to include keyword alerts for sensitive topics, as well as monitors for certain users who write frequently about controversial issues.

That&#8217;s its job, right? Well, ahead of NAB, the company is launching a couple of features that will help do just that. That includes a new discovery engine that its clients can use to extend the amount of time people spend watching their videos. It also includes a plugin for improved video viewing on Android devices and a way to connect with *ahem* connected TVs.</p>
<p>The new Ooyala Discovery Guide provides a way for its customers &#8212; big media companies with lots of videos &#8212; to increase the number of videos that viewers end up watching. The product works with both linear and on-demand video feeds and provides a list of videos that users might want to watch next.</p>
<p>Using behavioral data, as well as content metadata, program schedules, and other information, the Discovery Guide offers up a TV-guide-like directory of content to choose from. But it&#8217;s done in a way that is probably more enticing for viewers, as each guide is personalized to fit their specific tastes or viewing patterns. Even if users aren&#8217;t watching the content immediately, they can save it for later with a new DVR-like feature.</p>
<p>In tests with viewers, the discovery guide has shown an increase in engagement of up to 47 percent, according to Ooyala director of engineering Belsasar Lepe. That will hopefully enable its clients to better monetize their videos through advertising. Or at least keep subscribers happier. For that reason, the Discovery Guide will come as an add-on rather than a free feature for Ooyala&#8217;s clients.</p>
<p>In addition to the launch of its new Discovery Guide, Ooyala is hoping to help increase viewing on Android devices. It&#8217;s doing that with the introduction of its Hook video runtime. Hook enables Android users to download a single application from the Google Play store and then enjoy high-quality streaming video directly from within the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>Due to the number of devices and form factors, as well as differing video capabilities throughout the Android ecosystem, providing a single viewing experience across them all wasn&#8217;t always possible, especially for media companies that required a certain DRM or copy protections. With Hook, Ooyala can serve up videos with live, adaptive bit rate, DRM and other capabilities across almost all Android phones and tablets. It also provides publishers with advertising and reporting tools.</p>
<p>That will allow Ooyala clients to serve up high-quality video directly in their mobile websites without having to develop expensive native applications. Android users typically watch half as much video as their iOS counterparts, but the one-time Ooyala Hook install should hopefully change that. Users can download it themselves from Google Play, or they&#8217;ll be prompted to do so when they hit a page that uses it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also that matter of getting videos from mobile devices, tablets, etc. and being able to watch them on the TV. More and more, people are browsing (discovering!) content on their phones and whatnot. But who wants to watch that on a 5-, 6-, or 7-inch screen? No one! So Ooyala is rolling out XTV Connect, a cool little feature that lets users beam content from their little screens to their big screens.</p>
<p>The feature uses DLNA technology to connect with a number of supported connected TVs, Blu-ray players, game consoles, and other companion streaming devices. That will give it access to a whole bunch of screens for beaming and viewing.</p>
<p>Ooyala is showing off all this &#8212; and more! &#8212; ahead of the NAB Show in Las Vegas, hoping to <a target="_blank" href="http://go.ooyala.com/nab">stir up excitement</a> from broadcasters and cable networks who wish to make more of their content available online, on mobile devices, and on connected TVs. The company has raised more than $80 million since being founded in 2007, including a big <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/18/ooyala-series-e/">$35 million round</a> last summer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/y-combinator-nice.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Y Combinator Nice" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>&#8220;This is way better.&#8221; That was the prevailing sentiment at today&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> Demo Day where 47 fresh startups strutted their stuff for investors. Compared to the 65 demos a year ago and tedious 75 in August, investors told me this tighter Demo Day was more manageable, the quality of the startups was higher, and it felt like the old YC that earned the reputation as tech&#8217;s premier incubator.</p>
<p>The founders who <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/top-y-combinator-startups/">presented today</a> at Mountain View&#8217;s Computer History Museum dug the more exclusive version of YC too. &#8220;I thought the class size was pretty perfect&#8221; said one co-founder of an ecommerce startup who preferred not to be named. &#8220;There was a huge round of applause when they announced [how few applicants were admitted]. Everyone felt so much more special.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the feeling like they&#8217;d won the startup lottery, cutting the class size by a third granted each company more face time with YC&#8217;s partners and mentor network. While Demo Day presentations are always meticulously practiced, that guidance may have led the companies to clearer visions of where they were headed. I heard fewer vague ideas where monetization would get hammered out later, and more concrete roadmaps.</p>
<p>Amongst the batch were the typical &#8220;Airbnb for X&#8221; (Flightcar&#8217;s airport vehicle rentals) and &#8220;Kayak For Y&#8221; (SimplyInsured&#8217;s health insurance selector). There was as also a bit of deja-vu. Swapbox, which sets up public lockers for package delivery, was nearly identical to the previous YC class&#8217; BufferBox, which got <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/30/google-acquires-waterloo-based-e-commerce-startup-amazon-locker-competitor-and-yc-graduate-bufferbox/">acquired by Google</a> leaving an opportunity for an independent approach. And WeFunder&#8217;s equity crowdfunding platform for startups does almost exactly the same thing as YC Summer 2012&#8242;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/25/fundersclub/">FundersClub</a>. Great minds think alike, I guess, especially when there are big markets to chase.</p>
<p>There were a fair number of &#8220;no-brainers&#8221;, said investors in attendance, though that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing. It just means there were plenty of startups tackling offline problems where people: 1. Hate the experience, 2. Spend a lot of money, and 3. There&#8217;s little technology being applied. Wevorce wants to smooth out divorces, Zenefits makes doling out employee benefits easier, and Lawdingo connects people to attorneys. These companies are a bit like modern art. &#8220;Anyone could make that!&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, but you didn&#8217;t, and they did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps there weren&#8217;t as many crazy moonshots as years ago. Some investors mused that many of the building blocks of the web have been built, so now founders are addressing more discrete problems. However, it can be very tough to tell the difference between a startup that sounds too simple, and one whose simplicity could turn it into a backbone of the Internet.</p>
<p>A handful had the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/top-y-combinator-startups/"> whole crowd impressed</a>, though. Thalmic&#8217;s armband that senses electrical impulses to control apps was downright futuristic. And Watsi&#8217;s platform for crowdfunding medical care tugged our heartstrings when it showed a little Nepalese girl whose life it saved. Their success will determine that of YC itself now that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/09/meet-kirsty-nathoo-y-combinators-secret-financial-and-operational-weapon/">Sequoia&#8217;s funding has been spent</a>. YC has to support itself on exits from its investments from here on out.</p>
<p>Time will tell whether the startups that presented today will eventually change the world. But Y Combinator&#8217;s willingness to scale back it size shows admirable modesty. Entrepreneurship has grown into a full-fledged fetish these last few years, and YC grew along with it. To buck that trend, raise the bar, and offer more personal attention took handing out some tough rejection letters. But the benefits could be felt in the excited atmosphere. This isn&#8217;t a startup factory anymore.</p>
<p>Today Graham, Jessica Livingston, Garry Tan, and the other YC partners looked visibly less frazzled than at past Demo Days, like they&#8217;d been sleeping at night rather than fielding emails from frantic founders. This time they could sit back in confidence and watch the companies they nurtured make their big debut. And I think the startups made their parents proud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rob_thomas.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Rob Thomas" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>After the initial success of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project">the Kickstarter campaign</a> for a movie based on the TV show <em>Veronica Mars</em> (with a goal of $2 million, it has currently raised $3.9 million, and there are still 17 days to go), I had a chance to interview the show&#8217;s creator Rob Thomas and his agent Julien Thuan about what&#8217;s next for the movie, as well as what the campaign&#8217;s success means for other TV shows and films.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/veronica-mars-kickstarter/">speculation about whether this could change the funding model in Hollywood</a>. Thomas said the campaign should make things easier for people who want to do something similar, but they&#8217;re &#8220;guinea pigs&#8221; for just &#8220;a specialized subset of projects&#8221; &#8212; namely, cult TV shows with a fan base that wants to bring them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is <em>Veronica Mars</em> destroying the Hollywood business model?&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan of Thomas&#8217; work, particularly <em>Veronica Mars</em> and <em>Party Down</em>, both of which were prematurely canceled. When I asked whether Thomas could see himself running a similar campaign for a<em> Party Down</em> movie, he replied that he&#8217;s still pursuing a &#8220;traditional path&#8221; on that front.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will say this about the path that we took [on Veronica Mars] &#8211; it is labor intensive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It took me a year and a half to get to this point. … To pitch a movie to a studio that buys it is clearly the simpler way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thuan told a similar story, saying that Thomas called him up a 18 months ago, reported that he&#8217;d heard about crowdfunding, and asked, &#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s crazy?&#8221; Thuan didn&#8217;t think it was crazy, and in fact he said the United Talent Agency (where he&#8217;s a partner) had been looking for ways to experiment with marrying crowdfunding and &#8220;a branded, preexisting property.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, once they actually decided to put pursue the campaign, they had to put a plan together, get people on-board, figure out the prizes and how to fulfill them, and get approvals from the various departments in Warner Bros. (which owns <em>Veronica Mars</em>).</p>
<p>As for whether Thomas was nervous about the campaign&#8217;s success, he said he was &#8220;ridiculously confident&#8221; until the night before it launched, when he and star Kristen Bell tweeted at each other with hints about their plans. That didn&#8217;t seem to start much discussion, prompting Thomas to wonder, &#8220;What if it has just been the same 20 fans talking about it all these years, and I&#8217;ve allowed them to talk me into this?&#8221; (Thuan compared the experience to taking a &#8220;a trust fall&#8221; into the arms of the show&#8217;s fans.)</p>
<p>Naturally, Thomas is relieved that the movie campaign didn&#8217;t just reach its goal, but is already exceeding it by a healthy margin. Apparently he outlined the script based on a budget in the $3 to $5 million range, so if he had only raised $2 million, he would have had to cut back.</p>
<p>And yes, there&#8217;s been some criticism of the campaign, much of it boiling down to the fact that fans are being asked to bankroll a studio movie &#8211; the Kickstarter funding is supposed to cover the production budget, while Warner Bros. handles the marketing and distribution. For example, Alyssa Rosenberg at ThinkProgress <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2013/03/14/1720321/the-veronica-mars-movie-kickstarter-and-why-fans-need-to-start-thinking-of-themselves-as-investors/">wrote</a> that she would have been more excited if Thomas was was looking for funding to buy the <em>Veronica Mars</em> rights from Warner Bros.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not on the table,&#8221; Thomas said when I asked if he&#8217;d considered that. However, he said that before he reached the current deal, he had initially proposed a more independent production, where the studio would grant him a one-picture license to make the movie on his own. He also noted that without the Kickstarter campaign, the film would not happen, because Warner Bros. doesn&#8217;t normally make movies for this small a budget. (My two cents: A certain amount of skepticism is healthy when it comes to the movie studios, but I&#8217;m also part of fan communities that have been asking for years to get opportunities like this to support work that they care about, so it&#8217;s hard for me not to get excited. And yes, I did back the campaign.)</p>
<p>Finally, I asked Thomas if the movie could lead to sequels. He said he&#8217;s trying to have it both ways, writing the script so that it&#8217;s a satisfying conclusion to the story, but also leaving the door open for more movies or another TV show: &#8220;Spoiler alert: Veronica survives the movie.&#8221;</p>

		<title>Russia's Growth Leads Yuri Milner Back As Ostrovok Takes $25M From General Catalyst, Accel and Others</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/yuri.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="yuri" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>It&#8217;s often difficult to discern the mind of Yuri Milner. Despite building his investments out of Russia initially, he hasn&#8217;t invested in a startup there for over three years. What&#8217;s luring him back? No doubt the enormous growth and potential of the market there. So it&#8217;s not a huge surprise that he&#8217;s invested in one of Russia&#8217;s hottest startups today &#8212; hotels booking service <a target="_blank" href="http://Ostrovok.ru">Ostrovok.ru</a>, which has pulled in a $25 million Series B round. Ostrovok may now be the best funded startup in Russia. However, putting boots on the ground to build up the hotels inventory &#8211; which is really only just coming online in Russia &#8211; is a very capital-intensive business.</p>
<p>Milner joins lead investor General Catalyst Partners, Frontier Ventures, Accel Partners, and Eric Blachfor, the former CEO of Expedia, as well as high-profile investor Shervin Pishevar, and the former head of UBS Russia, Edward Kaufman. Ostrovok even got $2 million from the founders themselves, they are so confident. Formerly, Founders Fund and Atomico invested $13.6 million in the Series A round two years ago. For context, <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/13/oktogo/">two weeks ago</a> Internet travel agency Oktogo.ru raised $11 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by former Google and Slide employees Serge Faguet and Kirill Makharinsky, Moscow-based Ostrovok aims to become the Hotels.com / Priceline / Booking.com for Russia. They told me they intend to turn Ostrovok into a &#8220;multi-billion dollar company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Online sales are growing at a clip. Russia has Europe’s largest Internet market, ahead of former leader Germany, with 60 million users and counting. Ostrovok has 1 million unique visitors a month, 25,000 hotels in the database, 200 employees and API partnerships with Yandex, Google, Megafon and Russian airline systems.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s the signal that Yuri Milner&#8217;s involvement indicates that is perhaps most interesting. Because many of his investments in Russia &#8211; Mail.ru among them &#8211; add up to around 70% of the actual page views in Russia, he is in a position to influence where that traffic is directed. Point it vaguely in the direction of a startup like Ostrovok and away, as they say, you go.</p>
<p>As Serge Faguet told me: &#8220;In most emerging markets, the local players have won the market. Russians love travelling and spending money so it&#8217;s a great market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Russians spend $60 billion a year on travel and $20 billion on hotels. The online share of that is small, 8% of the total market. In the US the comparable number is 40%. In China it is 30%.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what of Shervin Pishevar? Will we see Uber come to the streets of Moscow I wonder out loud to Faguet? &#8220;I have no idea but I would love it if it did,&#8221; he says. Watch this space perhaps.</p>

The Beijing-based company, which specializes in arranging tours to North Korea, said: “3G access is no longer available for tourists to the DPRK. Sim cards can still be purchased to make international calls but no internet access is available.&#8221; Foreigners visiting North Korea were allowed to get uncensored 3G data for the first time on March 1. Typically banned services like Twitter and Skype were available on the network, which was set up by Koryolink, a joint venture of Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding and North Korean state-owned Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC). North Koreans are blocked from accessing the global Web and allowed only a few services, such as MMS messaging and subscriptions to Rodong Sinmun, the state-run newspaper. There&#8217;s no word yet on why North Korea decided to cut off 3G access for visitors, but it could be because the government was unnerved by the worldwide interest in tweets, Instagram pics, and other online missives sent by visitors to the highly-secretive country. The news that the DPRK has suspended 3G access for foreigners comes hours after North Korean state media said that the country&#8217;s military has ordered rocket and artillery units to be on &#8220;highest alert&#8221; to strike bases on the U.S. mainland, Guam, Hawaii, and other targets in the Pacific and South Korea. In response, Seoul said it hadn&#8217;t detected any warning signs of an attack, while the Pentagon said that U.S. military bases are ready to respond to &#8220;any contigency.&#8221; Image from Wikimedia Commons]]></description>

The Beijing-based company, which specializes in arranging tours to North Korea, said: </p>
<blockquote><p>“3G access is no longer available for tourists to the DPRK. Sim cards can still be purchased to make international calls but no internet access is available.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Foreigners visiting North Korea were allowed to get uncensored 3G data for the first time on March 1. Typically banned services like Twitter and Skype were available on the network, which was set up by Koryolink, a joint venture of Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding and North Korean state-owned Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC). North Koreans are blocked from accessing the global Web and allowed only a few services, such as MMS messaging and subscriptions to Rodong Sinmun, the state-run newspaper. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no word yet on why North Korea decided to cut off 3G access for visitors, but it could be because the government was unnerved by the worldwide interest in tweets, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/28/instagrams-of-the-fiery-tyrant-how-3g-networking-could-chip-away-at-north-koreas-power/">Instagram pics</a>, and other online missives sent by visitors to the highly-secretive country.

Look at how pretty this web app is!&#8221;? Because I don&#8217;t. </p>
<p>At least, not before this morning when I saw <a target="_blank" href="http://forecast.io/">Forecast</a>.</p>
<p>Warning before anyone is like &#8220;WTF? Why is TechCrunch writing about a weather app? UNSUBSCRIIIIIBE&#8221;: Yeah, Forecast is a weather app. But it&#8217;s a really, <em>really</em> pretty weather app.</p>
<p>Brought to you by the same guys who built <a target="_blank" href="http://darkskyapp.com/">Dark Sky</a> (which is already one of the prettiest <em>native</em> weather apps), Forecast is a rather remarkable demonstration of what web apps — in both mobile and standard form — can do with good scripting and solid design (You can read all about the development of Forecast <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.forecast.io/post/46290267206/announcing-forecast">here</a>)</p>
<p>First, check it out in your computer&#8217;s browser. Click around a bit. Tap the little Play button beneath the globe. Drag the pin around. Shift through historical weather data in the Time Machine. Your mind blown yet?<br />
<br />
Now check it out on your Android phone or iPhone. Play with the amazingly smooth sliding drawers, and the buttery slide-in navigation bar. If your mind still isn&#8217;t blown, you&#8217;ve never tried to build something like this on the web. Or you have and you&#8217;re just way, way too cool for your own good.</p>
<p>I figured I was just easily impressed, but just about every code-minded person I follow on the Twitters has raved about Forecast sometime in the past two hours. Even the <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5446134">Hacker News crowd</a> had nary a negative comment. I kind of wish I didn&#8217;t have to add the web app to my homescreen before I was allowed to play with it, but given the way people tend to stumble upon weather apps when they need them and then immediately forget about them once they&#8217;re done, it&#8217;s a forgivable retention trick.</p>
<p>Hell, even people who look at web apps <em>all damn day</em> for work are impressed. Here&#8217;s our friend Lisa Brewster, who used to fight for better web apps at Palm and now reviews web apps and web app standards for Mozilla&#8217;s upcoming Firefox OS:</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>Now THIS is a web app:  <a href="http://www.forecast.io"> forecast.io</a>&mdash; <br />Lisa Brewster (@Adora) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/Adora/status/316712775269380096' data-datetime='2013-03-27T00:46:24+00:00'>March 27, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Bar, set. Welcome to my homescreen, Forecast.</p>
