According to an interview with BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins conducted by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/blackberry_chief_lays_news_survival_eDD7I35OesjnkEY5anJlZP">Australian Financial Review</a>, Heins expects the BlackBerry World content portal to cross the 100,000 app mark in time for the company's big Z10 smartphone launch later this week.

According to an interview with BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins conducted by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.afr.com/p/technology/blackberry_chief_lays_news_survival_eDD7I35OesjnkEY5anJlZP">Australian Financial Review</a>, Heins expects the BlackBerry World content portal to cross the 100,000 app mark in time for the company&#8217;s big Z10 smartphone launch later this week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a notable (if not entirely significant &#8212; there&#8217;s an argument for quality over quantity) milestone, and one that BlackBerry may be trying to highlight ahead of its fiscal Q4 2013 earnings release on March 28. That&#8217;s a sizable jump from the roughly 70,000 apps that debuted along with BlackBerry 10, but the platform still needs support from big-name developers and services if it wants to pose a credible threat to Apple and Google&#8217;s mobile hegemony.</p>
<p>Recent reports about <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20130221/native-instagram-app-is-not-coming-to-blackberry-10/">Instagram</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20130304/netflix-has-no-current-plans-for-a-blackberry-10-app/">Netflix</a> for instance painted a portrait of two companies that were hesitant to devote engineering resources to an unproven platform &#8212; granted, Instagram appears to be working on an Android port of its app, but the experience of Android apps running BB10 in general leaves something to be desired. The severity of the situation isn&#8217;t lost on Heins &#8212; he noted to Financial Review&#8217;s Paul Smith that BlackBerry is working to further talks with these sorts of prominent parties, and that some companies may be warming to BlackBerry 10.</p>
<p>“I think we are seeing the dynamic changing over time as they want to watch and see how BlackBerry 10 is making it in the market,&#8221; Heins pointed out. &#8220;They want ROI on their development dollars as well&#8230; it is our job to convince them that BB10 is a successful platform.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the process of proving BlackBerry 10 to be a successful platform involves a little smack talk. In a curious display of fighting up, Heins jabbed at Apple for taking the conservative route in fleshing out iOS. As he put it, the &#8220;rate of innovation is so high in our industry that if you don’t innovate at that speed you can be replaced pretty quickly,&#8221; before pointing out that the iOS interface is five years old. It&#8217;s a valid criticism to be sure, and BlackBerry 10 definitely sports some neat new UI flourishes, but let&#8217;s not forget that the company&#8217;s stock is worth a fraction of what it was five years ago. It&#8217;ll take more than talk to fix that.</p>

Introducing SIP, short for Session Initiation Protocol, into Twilio&#8217;s portfolio of services will not only give the company more flexibility to target enterprises (who use SIP in their calling systems) more directly, but since it is a protocol also used for services like video, could also be a signal of what services Twilio has planned next.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s launch is the result of a limited beta first launched in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/17/twilio-is-crushing-it-150k-developers-1-5m-api-calls-a-day-1b-total-phone-calls-expanding-to-20-more-countries/">October</a> around the time of Twilio&#8217;s last developer conference. And unlike Twilio&#8217;s other services that rely on carrier interconnects in different countries to work, SIP is all-IP based and therefore available globally.</p>
<p>Initially covering inbound voice calls, with outbound calls coming soon, the move initially gives Twilio two service openings: Twilio can potentially become the bridge between callers and a company&#8217;s internet IP-based PBX. It will also allow for, say, a Twilio service on a website to integrate with a company&#8217;s wider SIP-based calling system. Both give Twilio a crack at deeper integration into those enterprise phone systems, and give enterprises another way to cut out traditional carriers and their costs out of their operations.</p>
<p>Twilio&#8217;s SIP code effectively replaces the role that both a carrier and business PBX have in a company&#8217;s phone system, by taking that functionality into the cloud. Twilio&#8217;s diagram of how that works is here:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This not only takes away the need for the PBXs, but it makes it easier for enterprises to modify how these calls are routed &#8212; with the big disruption here being that the heavy stuff is getting effectively transformed into some lines of code; or as one early user, RealPage&#8217;s Joe McCorkle notes, it&#8217;s &#8220;a highly modern system being updated with simple API web development.&#8221;</p>
<p>“SIP enables companies big and small to realize the flexibility of pairing their existing IP technology with the easy to use Twilio communications platform,” Twilio CEO and Co-founder Jeff Lawson said in a statement.</p>
<p>By switching the call to IP, it also takes away the cost of routing it on a traditional PSTN network. Charges for Twilio&#8217;s SIP service, the company says, begin at half a cent per minute for the first 500 minutes per month, and discounting from there based on volume.</p>
<p>The introduction comes at an interesting time for VoIP telephony services: Skype, which had also been thought to be considering a close SIP migration at one time, recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/brain-drain-at-skype-tech-leader-jonathan-rosenberg-latest-to-leave-now-at-cisco-as-cto-cloud-collaboration/">parted company</a> with its chief technology strategist, Jonathan Rosenberg, who was considered by some to be one of the &#8220;fathers of SIP.&#8221; Skype had done very little with SIP beyond Skype Connect functionality, and it appears that it will not be doing any more going forward, with that sort of functionality appearing instead in Microsoft&#8217;s Lync suite. In the meantime, SIP is used extensively in enterprise systems, as well as the main protocol in some consumer-focused services like Google Voice and Vonage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think of what we&#8217;re doing with SIP as less as a response to Skype,&#8221; Thomas Schiavone, director of product management at Twilio, in an interview. &#8220;They always faced challenges approaching the developer ecosystem. This is more response to market demand. It opens up another endpoint for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, he says that the company&#8217;s move to offering SIP was a long time coming, considering that developers &#8212; there are some 175,000 in all on Twilio&#8217;s platform today &#8212; have been &#8220;clamoring&#8221; for SIP integration for the last three years.</p>
<p>Schiavone says that outbound SIP calls should be coming &#8220;in the next quarters,&#8221; but that the inbound had been the most-requested feature so far, and Twilio estimates that it will account for some 80% of the use cases.</p>

However, the Paris-based startup&#8217;s broader plan is to become a music-based social network, and today it&#8217;s flipping the switch on its recommendation engine to match users with similar tastes.</p>
<p>Like Songdrop, users install the Whyd bookmarklet to their browser to begin adding tracks from various sources online, such as YouTube, Soundcloud and Vimeo, for later playback. And although the service already lets users subscribe to the streams of other users, today&#8217;s update sees the company making that process more efficient by recommending users to connect with based on the tracks they bookmark, and a whole host of other data that Whyd is capturing. In other words, this is a now very familiar play: Give us enough usage data and we&#8217;ll give you recommendations in return.</p>
<p>Applied to music, the idea isn&#8217;t new of course. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/last-fm">Last.fm</a> was a pioneer in music-based recommendations with its music &#8220;scrobbling&#8221; service which mines a user&#8217;s listening data to surface similar music based on the tastes of other Last.fm users who algorithmically match. And in the early days of Napster, when it was an illegitimate file sharing service, one of its best features was the ability for a user to discover new music by delving into the music collections of potential taste-makers who matched their own tastes. </p>
<p>Whyd&#8217;s recommendation engine seems to be attempting to follow in the steps of these two trailblazers. Piggybacking the bookmarking habits of its users, it combines data drawn from multiple sources such as artist data, track data, affinity of subscriptions, listening history, and more. Appropriately, users can also connect their Last.fm account to Whyd if they have one.</p>
<p>Here the on-boarding process is paramount, however. Without any initially seeded data, the engine won&#8217;t be able to accurately recommend who a user should subscribe to. &#8220;We worked just as hard to make it effective at recommending other similar people for you to subscribe to even if you are new to the site&#8221;, says co-founder Gilles Poupardin. &#8220;Obviously the more tracks you add the better, but it should still give you good results if you add at least three songs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the focus on social and discovery that Poupardin says sets Whyd apart from others in the music streaming space, such as Spotify, Deezer, rdio, and whatever Apple and Google are planning, along with more direct competitors such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/songdrop">Songdrop</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/musicplayr">Musicplayr</a>. &#8220;We do not intend to be a full service music consumption destination,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but rather a social network built around music, where new music lovers collect and share tracks that touch them.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s undoubtedly oversimplifying the battle lines somewhat. Spotify, for example, is de-emphasising its reliance on Facebook&#8217;s social graph by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/06/spotify-following/">rolling out its own</a> user and artist &#8220;following&#8221; features, which is essentially the same as subscribing to a user in Whyd, even if there is less focus &#8212; for now &#8212; on finding users with similar tastes to follow.</p>
<p>However, it may be that the two services (and others like it) can complement each other. &#8220;We see that today, people discover music on Whyd and then add it to Spotify or whatever service they use for offline access, even though it happens frequently that the music is not (nor will ever be) on Spotify,&#8221; says Poupardin.</p>
<p>Whyd&#8217;s only funding to date is a €150K French government Innovation grant to research different ways that people connect to each other around music data, along with winning support from Réseau Entrepreneurs, a French mentorship and support organisation.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t talking monetization, for now, but hints that the logical step after connecting music consumers to each other is to enable them to connect with and &#8220;support&#8221; the artists they enjoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/ipad-mini-couch-player.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="ipad-mini-couch-player" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Swiss mobile development and design firm <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cleverandson.com/">Clever &amp; Son</a> bills itself as a &#8220;maker of premium apps,&#8221; and judging by Couch Player, its latest creation, the startup lives up to its name. Couch Player is essentially a replacement for the built-in Apple Music app on the iPad, but it manages to be much more with just a few simple tweaks.</p>
<p>In particular, Couch Player emphasizes the playlist, and reorganizes the entire experience to make that the central focus of the app. Playlist creation on Couch Player is handled via simple drag-and-drop gestures, with a browsing interface that takes better advantage of the iPad&#8217;s ample screen real estate to make it possible to simultaneously navigate your entire iTunes library (either stored locally or in the cloud via iTunes Match) while also keeping an eye on and adding to your playlists.</p>

<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/couch-player-is-an-ipad-music-app-that-puts-the-playlist-front-and-center/img1-2/' title='img1'></a>
<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/couch-player-is-an-ipad-music-app-that-puts-the-playlist-front-and-center/img2/' title='img2'></a>
<a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/couch-player-is-an-ipad-music-app-that-puts-the-playlist-front-and-center/img4/' title='img4'></a>

<p>You can easily create multiple playlists on the fly, and switch between them too, all while keeping your library open and browsable in a column on the left-hand side. Small features like the ability to swipe left on any song in a playlist and get related albums, artist and song suggestions for other content to add to the playlist add feature functionality.</p>
<p>Couch Player doesn&#8217;t offer much flare in terms of interface design, but there is a playback progress bar that&#8217;s color-coded based on the album cover for the currently playing track. And the simplicity is actually one of its most attractive features: everything gets out of the way so you can concentrate on building the perfect playlist for an outdoor picnic or pick-up basketball game.</p>
<p>Simplicity was the name of the game for Clever &amp; Son co-founder and managing director Tobias Gemperli in designing Couch Player, he explained in an interview. The point wasn&#8217;t to replace default system software, but to transform playlists from a feature into a focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aim was not to create a feature complete music app but rather to concentrate on the core functionality which is the playlist creation,&#8221; he explained in an email interview. &#8220;Since we couldn’t find any app which does this well on the iPad we decided to build our own. Our aim was to make playlist creation an experience on its own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some unfortunate things missing from Couch Player include an AirPlay or Bluetooth sound device source selector from within the app, but it&#8217;s a relatively minor complaint because you can still use your iPad&#8217;s multi-tasking bar to choose a speaker to connect to. But the simplicity with which you can build and switch between playlists is what makes Couch Player appealing, and that part is well executed.</p>
<p>Couch Player will be released Thursday, March 21 in the App Store for the public, where it&#8217;ll be available for a starting price of $2. If you&#8217;re looking for a home jukebox experience that works with your existing library, it&#8217;s an intelligently designed app, and the kind of thing Apple should be looking at for clues about improving on its own inbuilt player experience.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;d like to recognize that Max&#8217;s birthday was on March 14. We failed to post on that momentous day but I felt that it would be unwise for us to completely ignore the birth of such an influential commenter. I hope your birthday was a good one.</p>
<p>Max is important. While we don&#8217;t always ask ourselves WWMWD, I think we all should. Should I go work at Apple? WWMWD? Should I ignore my studies at Carnegie Mellon and comment on TechCrunch all day? WWMWD? Should I be really cool and shy when we meet you at Disrupt in San Francisco? WWMWD?</p>
<p>So thanks, Max. Thanks for hanging out, thanks for being an integral part of our community, and it&#8217;s been a pleasure to see your career blossom as you&#8217;ve hung out in the comment listings. To paraphrase Bette Midler, you are the dude who comments a lot beneath our wings, and that&#8217;s important to us. If you need a birthday present email me at john @ techcrunch.com and I&#8217;ll dig something out of my stuff pile. Otherwise, let&#8217;s all give Max a big hand.</p>

The issues appear to be intermittent, and not all Google Drive users are affected at this time.</p>
<p>In my case, for instance, Google Drive struggled to load one particular folder, but loaded others with no more than the usual delay. Others are seeing no issues with their Drive associated with their Gmail account, but are having trouble with their Google Apps account sign-ins. And others still are reporting seeing messages that the service is down entirely, and are getting a &#8220;502 error&#8221; for several minutes.</p>

<p>For those who were signed in and seemingly unaffected, be aware that you might have issues saving your work. (See example error below).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/google-drive-experiencing-intermittent-issues/drive-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-779612"></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Google for details on this outage or service interruption, as the case may be, and will update when we hear back.</p>

<p>After taking a $225k investment from Reed Elsevier and Jeff Zwelling late last year, Docracy is now ready to unveil what it&#8217;s been working on for so long: The Document Genome project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many lawyers and others use a standard template for documents, and then lift certain phrasing from other contracts to mix and match,&#8221; explained Docracy founder Matt Hall.</p>
<p>The new product will allow users to upload their lease agreement, M&amp;A contract, etc. to the service and find the most similar contracts to compare and contrast the differences. Algorithms find the tiniest differences in phrasing and highlight those differences to make for easy comparing.</p>
<p>In essence, it&#8217;s a reliable way to ensure that you&#8217;re about to sign or submit a standard contract as opposed to something a bit less orthodox.</p>
<p>To start, the product will be used for patent applications and patents. <a target="_blank" href="https://searcher.io/">Searcher.io</a> will allow users to see if their patent is similar to anything else in the database, to ensure that someone else hasn&#8217;t already patented your idea and that you&#8217;re using the proper language and format.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it stands now,&#8221; explains Matt Hall, &#8220;finding similar documents is an entirely manual process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Docracy still has an open database product that lets you search for contracts. However, the higher-end Searcher product will eventually be rolled into Docracy&#8217;s database, letting people search for contracts <em>and</em> compare similar ones all from one place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/n4-8mp.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="n4-8mp" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Google&#8217;s next reference smartphone is the subject of many rumors over the past few days, but only one stands out as not too outlandish. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Rumor-Google-Nexus-5-might-feature-a-revolutionary-camera-with-Nikon-branding_id40968">Phonearena reports</a> that according to a source, the next Nexus could have Nikon camera technology on board, with a &#8220;triple sensor&#8221; array. The camera is being referred to as the &#8220;selling point&#8221; of the Nexus 5, the source claims.</p>
<p>The tipster in this case also cites more reasonable specs for the Nexus 5, including a 5-inch display capable of 1080p output, a Snapdragon 600 processor, 2GB of RAM and 8/16GB storage options. There&#8217;s also a beefy 3140 mAh battery on board, which should outlast the current device depending on the power requirements of the display. These refute an earlier claim from <a target="_blank" href="http://androidandme.com/2013/03/news/rumor-is-this-the-lg-nexus-5/">AndroidandMe</a> about a super-powered 5.2-inch LG device being next in line for the Nexus name, with a bizarre 3GB of RAM supposedly on board.</p>
<p>By contrast, the more recent Nexus 5 spec report makes much more sense in the context of how Google has iterated its flagship Android device in the past. And the Nikon camera tech also echoes an earlier statement from Google&#8217;s Vic Gundotra, who said <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/+VicGundotra/posts/GRiKrc41oGL">on Google+ last month</a> that Google is specifically &#8220;committed to making Nexus phones insanely great cameras,&#8221; teasing that consumers need only &#8220;wait and see&#8221; to realize the truth of that statement.</p>
<p>The one sour note on the otherwise impressive Nexus 4 from Google released last fall is the camera; reviewers mostly seem to rate it either adequate or sub-par compared to cameras in devices like the iPhone or Android handsets from other OEMs. Accordingly, it makes sense that Google would focus attention on improving the camera in the next Nexus, since that would provide good upgrade incentive for those following the brand, and also help Google better show off Android&#8217;s built-in camera features, which is one of the primary purposes of its line of Nexus reference hardware.</p>
<p>Google and Nikon have worked together in the past, including on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.androidcentral.com/os-nikon-coolpix-s800c-yeah-it-s-android">Nikon Coolpix S800c</a>, which features an Android-based firmware. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/google-acquires-nik-software-the-company-behind-the-popular-snapseed-photo-editing-app-for-ios/">Google also acquired Nik software last year</a>, makers of Snapseed, and a company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.niksoftware.com/company/usa/entry.php?info=company/pressroom/nikcoop.shtml">Nikon had previously made a sizable investment</a> in.</p>
<p>The sensor of the new camera will reportedly be a three-sensor affair, which sounds like it could resemble the tech used in HTC&#8217;s Ultrapixel or Sigma&#8217;s Foveon X3 sensors, by combining three sensor layers, each with a smaller megapixel count, to create a single higher resolution image with better color rendering and light capture. This is still very much a rumor, but it&#8217;s an interesting one and definitely seems to be in line with Google&#8217;s apparent goals for the Nexus line.</p>

The round was led by Rincon Venture Partners, and saw participation from 500 Startups, Daher Capital, Floodlight Ventures, Cooley LLP, Drummond Road Capital, and Eric Hammond.</p>
<p>Work on Divshot actually began at a Startup Weekend event in Kansas City. After receiving an enthusiastic response from developers, co-founders Michael Bleigh and Jake Johnson decided to dedicate themselves to Divshot full-time. They later pitched their idea to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crowdfunder.com/crowdstart-la">CrowdStart LA</a>, got in, and <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.divshot.com/post/26988406234/boom-divshot-wins-crowdstart-la-launches-rebranded">won</a>, where they were awarded $25,000 in funding from Right Side Capital, and access to further investment meetings.</p>
<p>At that time, Divshot also rebranded itself with a new look that was cleaner and more utilitarian, which developers often prefer.</p>
<p>The service was initially built on a popular UI framework called<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, developed by Twitter, and offers users a WYSIWYG editor that speeds up the process of creating wireframes and mockups. But the plan, explains Bleigh today, is not to develop &#8220;a niche tool that caters to a single framework.&#8221; The company also announced support for the ZURB Foundation and Ratchet mobile CSS frameworks, proving that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Divshot has the potential to be as ubiquitous for web development as Adobe’s Creative Suite is for visual design,&#8221; Bleigh claims.</p>

<p>After private testing with over 2,000 developers, the service <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/09/divshot">was released to the public this past October</a>, where 9,000 more developers were already waitlisted. The company has now grown to over 40,000 users, primarily through word-of-mouth, and other organic growth.</p>
<p>It also recently launched &#8220;Divshot Docs,&#8221; an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/divshot/docs">open source</a> documentation site for Divshot developers, which provides guides, tutorials, tips and tricks and more. The company <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/divshot">actually open sources</a> a lot of its content, in fact.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s currently free to sign up for Divshot&#8217;s public beta <a target="_blank" href="http://www.divshot.com/">here</a>.</p>

The company claimed another record year for 2012, as it competes against traditional video conferencing solutions. It&#8217;s trying to make adopting its technology easier and cheaper, especially for large resellers and enterprises, with the introduction of products that work through a new, virtualized infrastructure.</p>
<p>Vidyo claims to have grown billings by 68 percent in 2012. A lot of that has come through partners: Vidyo says business through its top 25 reseller partners has expanded 435 percent over the course of 2012. Partnering with service providers has the benefit of recurring revenue and being in new markets. Now more than half of billings come from international markets, according to the company.</p>
<p>Hoping to further capitalize on that growth, Vidyo will soon make available a new virtualized infrastructure that will lower the cost for enterprises to deploy video conferencing services. The new products, the VidyoGateway and VidyoPortal Virtual Editions (VE), should provide video conferencing services at the same price as audio conferencing.</p>
<p>According to Vidyo CEO Ofer Shapiro, will help enterprise customers to cost-effectively manage conferencing across multiple sites. There are huge benefits for Vidyo&#8217;s service provider partners as well, as they can make those services available all over the world.</p>
<p>For Vidyo, introduction of its new infrastructure follows a broader trend toward virtualization, rather than running on traditional server hardware. It also provides more flexibility for clients who will be able to run either on-premises equipment, private cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud offerings. The VidyoGateway VE and VidyoPortal VE will be available for sale in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Vidyo is based in Hackensack, N.J., and now has more than 250 employees worldwide. It&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/juniper-vidyo-funding/">raised about $100 million to date</a>, with investors such as QuestMark Partners, Menlo Ventures, Rho Ventures, Star Ventures, Four Rivers Group and Juniper Networks.</p>

This is the new look with bigger pictures and more discovery features that it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/pinterest-redesign/">first began testing back in January</a>, with the proviso that if it proved popular it would roll it out more widely. Today, it said it would be turning it on for everyone, with invites to all appearing soon.</p>
<p>The main idea here is that the new look with bigger pictures and more linkage focuses on discovery, and specifically getting people more engaged and pinning on the site &#8212; engagement being one of the key metrics for social networks like Facebook and Twitter as well. The importance for Pinterest with engagement is that it potentially helps it justify further down the line how to charge for services like analytics and marketing opportunities. These are areas where currently the company does not take any revenue at the moment.</p>
<p>Some of those new features include the ability for users to explore pins on someone&#8217;s board without leaving the page they are visiting, as well as more links to related pins to those you&#8217;ve already pinned. This will come by way of discovery tabs alongside the main pictures, as illustrated in the screenshot below. As Josh pointed out in January, giving users options for more content discovery right on the page where they are already has been an important lesson from the likes of YouTube, which has used this to keep users from sampling one video and then bouncing somewhere else altogether. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, users will be given pinning recommendations based on what other people are pinning similar to what you are flagging on your own board. Pinterest says that the recommendations feature is also soon getting rolled out to its iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>Pinterest has a challenge ahead of it. As it evolves into the next stage of its life &#8212; specifically as a revenue-generating business &#8212; it will have to add more bells and whistles, which may include more forms of commerce, or ads or something else altogether.  The opportunity there is obvious &#8212; one that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pinterest">$338 million in venture backing</a> clearly also sees &#8212; but so is the fact that putting all that into Pinterest could take away the clean-yet-massively-full-of-information feel that Pinterest has today. Indeed, it&#8217;s telling that lead product designer Jason Wilson writes in the blog post that the basic idea is to &#8220;make things simpler and cleaner, without requiring you to learn anything new.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other changes, he notes, are bigger pins, better ways of navigating back through your browsing in case you start to feel lost or to engrossed in checking out other people&#8217;s boards. &#8220;Now, when you scroll through pins and click on something that interests you, the back button lands you right back where you were no matter how far you’ve gone,&#8221; he writes. This may also be something that brands and those who are trying to attract people to their landing pages as much as their individual pins may have requested.</p>

This means that apps for any Windows 8 PCs and tablets can start including photo editing immediately, not just ones with AMD processors. The company has already gotten serious traction by being included within Flickr, Twitter, Photobucket and thousands of other apps, so Windows 8 was a logical move for them. The collaboration is actually backed by an investment from AMD Ventures, which came in its last round. AMD would clearly love to see popular photo apps crop up on the Windows platform. Since social photo editing is such a popular behavior on the web these days, not having a platform to easily deploy the feature within apps left a massive hole in the Windows app store. To pump up the partnership, Manju Hegde, an AMD VP, referred to Aviary as &#8220;the standard in mobile and online photo editing,&#8221; something we&#8217;ve said about the company before. As far as the investment, Hegde shared &#8220;AMD is committed to supporting the future of industry changing innovators like Aviary, through investment by AMD Ventures and by enhancing user experiences on our award-winning APU platforms.” AMD was involved in Aviary&#8217;s last funding round, which also included Spark and Bezos Expeditions, so these resources have clearly come to fruition. The SDK for Windows 8 is available now and comes with enough documentation and examples to shake a stick at. Aviary also has released its first Windows 8 app through the Windows Store to showcase the features and functionality of the Aviary SDK for Windows 8. The company has also launched a photo editor itself in the Windows Store, to show off the type of functionality that developers can now leverage for their own apps. Aviary says that with the AMD APUs, effects can be processed up to 16X faster than on other processors, an advantage of working directly with AMD. Said Aviary CEO, Tobias Peggs: AMD&#8217;s APUs allow us to enable the most processor-intensive photo effects we have ever been able to offer. They&#8217;ve helped to push our technology forward, and in turn, end users can push the limits of their creativity even further. Along with Windows 8, Aviary&#8217;s SDK is available for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7 and HTML5. Its launch partners]]></description>

<p>The SDK for Windows 8 is <a target="_blank" href="http://aviary.com/w8">available now</a> and comes with enough documentation and examples to shake a stick at.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_3_18_13_4_41_am.png"></a></p>
<p>Aviary also has released <a target="_blank" href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/app/photo-editor/cdd22d88-c0c4-4fff-a741-fe5ea3692b22">its first Windows 8 app through the Windows Store</a> to showcase the features and functionality of the Aviary SDK for Windows 8. The company has also launched a photo editor itself in the Windows Store, to show off the type of functionality that developers can now leverage for their own apps. Aviary says that with the AMD APUs, effects can be processed up to 16X faster than on other processors, an advantage of working directly with AMD.</p>
<p>Said Aviary CEO, Tobias Peggs:</p>
<blockquote><p>AMD&#8217;s APUs allow us to enable the most processor-intensive photo effects we have ever been able to offer. They&#8217;ve helped to push our technology forward, and in turn, end users can push the limits of their creativity even further.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with Windows 8, Aviary&#8217;s SDK is available for iOS, Android, Windows Phone 7 and HTML5. Its launch partners for Windows 8 are Rowi, Memorylage, Vol8t by Volevi, MyFrames, Photo Annotater and Selektiv. The functionality from the Aviary SDK should be available for those apps within the next week on the Windows Store.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/introducing_w8_landing2.png"></a></p>
<p>Having apps with photo editing built-in could be a competitive advantage for Windows 8 laptops (or even on a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/i-got-one-but-i-dont-get-it/">Surface</a>!), I mean&#8230;if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing. This is good news for Aviary, especially if some of these manufacturers start including photo apps that happen to use their SDK by default.</p>

The total value of the crowdfunded loans, which have been spread across 65 countries mostly in the developing world, is $400 million, Kiva said today. The loans typically back individual economic activity to help alleviate poverty through support for entrepreneurial ventures in places where other sources of funding are hard to come by. It also supports loans for educational purposes, such as to pay tuition fees.</p>
<p>Kiva&#8217;s community of lenders is also approaching the one million mark, with some 900,000 lenders now on its books. These lenders are crowdfunding more than $1.5 million in loans per week &#8212; a considerable hike up from the just under $500,000 lent by Kiva&#8217;s platform in its first year of operation.</p>
<p>Kiva said the repayment rate for loans via its platform is 98.9%. Once loans are repaid, lenders are able to keep relending their money again and again if they wish, or withdraw it from the system if they prefer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been an amazing journey over the last seven years,&#8221; said Matt Flannery, Kiva Co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;I want to thank the one million borrowers who have proven to the world that it was worth taking a chance on them. You have made Kiva possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fundamentally, Kiva is about recognizing and supporting the potential that each person has whether they live across the street or across the world,&#8221; added Premal Shah, Kiva Co-founder and President, in a statement. &#8220;When we recognize and act on the potential in ourselves and others, as lenders or borrowers, powerful things can happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to a new study by Oxford University, reported in yesterday&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://m.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/17/aid-trade-reduce-acute-poverty">Guardian</a>, a total of 1.6 billion people are living in &#8220;multidimensional&#8221; poverty in 2013 but some of the poorest people in the world are becoming &#8220;significantly less poor&#8221;, with marked poverty-reduction in nations including Rwanda, Nepal and Bangladesh, as well as Ghana, Tanzania, Cambodia and Bolivia. The study uses 10 indicators to create a poverty index measure &#8212; namely: nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling and attendance, cooking fuel, water, sanitation, electricity assets and a covered floor.</p>
<p>The study found that the poorest one billion people live in 100 countries, most in South Asia &#8212; with India home to close to half (40%) of them, followed by sub-Saharan Africa with a third (33%). It also found that close to a tenth (9.5%) of the bottom billion poor people live in developed, upper middle-income countries.</p>

The timelines reveal that Microsoft seems pretty committed to an 18-month support cycle for mobile software releases, but it is interesting to see this information made official before Microsoft has done much at all to indicate what comes next.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this is a good example of a company being refreshingly transparent about their product plans. With iOS, you never know exactly when Apple will drop support for its previous iterations of iOS, for example. And when Microsoft introduced Windows Phone 8, it blindsided many by announcing that devices running Windows Phone 7 wouldn&#8217;t be able to upgrade to the next major revision.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2416002,00.asp?kc=PCRSS05039TX1K0000762">Microsoft has said that indeed there will be &#8220;an upgrade path&#8221; for Windows Phone 8 devices</a> this time around, so an end of support could be less significant. But it&#8217;s clear that Microsoft is thinking in terms of desktop products (this is how it lays out support cycles for Windows releases) with this kind of end-of-life announcement, and it might confuse mobile subscribers, especially given that Microsoft hasn&#8217;t yet made it exactly clear what will follow Windows Phone 8 as its next-generation mobile platform.</p>
<p>There are rumors that suggest we&#8217;ll see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Microsoft-Major-Windows-Phone-update-coming-during-2013-holidays_id40436">next big update for Windows Phone arrive in time for the 2013 holiday season</a>, but for the sake of developer and consumer confidence, it would be in Microsoft&#8217;s best interest to provide more details on those plans before releasing an EOL timeline for the OS that&#8217;s powering the devices it&#8217;s currently offering for sale. In the mobile game, end of OS software support can look an awful lot like a death sentence, especially for developers who don&#8217;t want to deal with the added headache of serving up different versions of apps for a fragmented market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to know when Microsoft will be officially ending support for its mobile OS releases, but it&#8217;d be even better to know that those currently using their devices can expect something excellent to follow, with an upgradeability path that does indeed guarantee those with an 18 month-old or younger handset won&#8217;t be left behind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-18-at-09-18-49.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-18 at 09.18.49" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Make way for one more big venture fund coming out of Europe, this one with some colorful backers. Oliver and Marc Samwer &#8212; founders of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rocket-internet.com">Rocket Internet</a> startup incubator among other things &#8212; have teamed up with Fabian Siegel, one of the people behind online food delivery company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deliveryhero.com">Delivery Hero</a>, to launch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalfounderscapital.com">Global Founders Capital</a>, a new €150 million ($194 million) fund aimed at any and all startups worldwide &#8212; but initially with a focus first on developing markets and e-commerce ventures, according to Siegel.</p>
<p>The first funding deal from GFC, Siegel says, will close in about five weeks.</p>
<p>The Samwer&#8217;s influence on startups and entrepreneurship in Europe has been pretty huge over the years. Critics have alternately accused them of being <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/04/features/inside-the-clone-factory?page=all">clone merchants</a> &#8212; simply copying models created by others in other markets and not really offering much in the way of innovation &#8212; and of being, in effect, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4079280/greed-is-groupon-can-anyone-save-the-company-from-itself">bullies</a> that have had a negative impact on the businesses that they build up and run.</p>
<p>On the other side, you cannot deny that have built up a massive startup empire, with some 27,000 people working across its portfolio of mainly e-commerce businesses in 43 countries. Financiers have come flocking, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/rocket-internet/">pumping hundreds of millions of dollars</a> into their different operations, and buyers have come too &#8212; with some of the most notable exits being selling <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/16/groupon-invades-europe-with-acquisition-of-citydeal/">CityDeal to Groupon</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/01/01/8250238/index.htm">Alando to eBay</a> to help those U.S. companies in their international ambitions.</p>
<p>This new venture is something a little different, though, as it appears that it will behave more like a traditional VC rather than an incubator. Although it will start first with what the three founders know best &#8212; e-commerce &#8212; ultimately it will look at anything and everything, at all stages of investment from seed to growth capital, with typical investments, Siegel says, going anywhere from €100,000 to €10 million. It will behave more like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.europeanfounders.com/">European Founders Fund</a> also started by the Samwers.</p>
<p>In fact, the idea for the Samwers appears to be to use this fund to get involved in the kinds of businesses that they otherwise might not incubate at Rocket itself &#8212; or, if you are a cynic, to get ideas that it can then replicate at Rocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are businesses that Rocket cannot build or do not have time to build,&#8221; is how Siegel describes the motivation behind the fund. &#8220;This is about opportunities elsewhere that Rocket does not do but wants to participate in, to give back to entrepreneurs. Things we don’t understand as well as e-commerce will be investments later.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for those later investments, two areas he names that GFC is likely to consider are apps, big data solutions, and other areas of e-commerce that Rocket does not touch right now, such as travel. Travel alone, he points out, &#8220;could keep us busy for 1-2 years, with the number of promising startups out there that are currently bootstrapped in markets like Vietnam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly, Siegel is a sort-of rival to the Samwers in that one of Rocket Internet&#8217;s portfolio companies is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foodpanda.com">Food Panda</a>, which is not unlike Delivery Hero in its premise. In fact, Siegel points out that the two companies have more or less been engaged in friendly coopetition, with the only crossover market being Poland in Delivery Hero&#8217;s quest to blanket Europe with online take-out options, and Food Panda focusing on emerging markets.</p>
<p>Siegel says that the impetus for GFC came from Ollie Samwer, and that in fact the whole process of creating the fund was actually very quick. &#8220;Ollie reached out to me 6-7 weeks ago, and I’ve been working with them for only a couple of weeks,&#8221; he told TechCrunch in an interview. While this will not be an incubator as such it will follow on from the model set out by U.S. and other VCs of trying to offer mentorship in addition to money. &#8220;The idea is that maybe we can help other teams to scale as we have. That’s something that you will see in the investments from our fund. We do like to build things want to help others build them, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siegel points out that GFC will not be making any investments into Rocket Internet-backed companies &#8212; but it&#8217;s not clear whether they will support any potential rivals, either.</p>
<p>In addition to the three principals, there are a number of limited partners, Siegel says, whose names are not being disclosed, except to note that a &#8220;large proportion&#8221; comes from the Samwer family itself &#8220;plus other entrepreneurial families.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siegel is new to the Samwer fold but he&#8217;s also not a stranger to the brothers&#8217; reputation. He remains neutral and wait-and-see for how it plays out in terms of partnering with them as VCs. &#8220;It’s hard for me to say because i’m just starting to work with them, but my experience is that great entrepreneurs are very passionate and have a clear perspective of how the world should be,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That’s how they get things done but as a result they polarize people. But even among those who ask questions or have bad opinions, none would say they don’t respect what they’re doing.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="68" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/st-ericsson.jpg?w=100&amp;h=68&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="st-ericsson" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>More developments on the grim story of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stericsson.com/">ST-Ericsson</a>, the unprofitable JV between <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericsson.com">Ericsson</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com">STMicroelectronics</a> that tried to kickstart a semiconductor business in Europe. Failing to find a buyer for the full operation, they will commence <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/press/releases/2013/03/1685852">splitting up the assets</a> instead, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stericsson.com/press_releases/20130318.jsp">laying off 1,600 employees</a> in the process.</p>
<p>The story goes back to last year, when the two companies decided to call time on the JV, first founded in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ST-Ericsson">2009</a>, and explore strategic options, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/ericsson-will-take-a-1-2b-hit-on-decline-of-st-ericsson-chip-jv-confirms-it-wont-buy-stmicros-stake/">taking multi-billion-dollar hits in the process</a>, after Ericsson and STMicro both confirmed neither wanted to subsume the entire loss-making business themselves. That followed a review that first started in April 2012, amid reports that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/14/us-stericsson-takeover-idUSBRE82D17D20120314">Qualcomm</a> might buy the business. ST-Ericsson in Q4 2012 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stericsson.com/press_releases/Q42012.jsp">reported</a> net sales of $358 million, but an operating loss of $133 million, after the joint owners waived a credit line of $1.5 billion. The story took a further turn a couple of days ago when it was reported that there were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-12/stmicro-ericsson-s-search-for-buyer-for-unit-said-to-stall-1-.html">takers for the complete assets</a>.</p>
<p>Then, this morning, the two owners <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/press/releases/2013/03/1685852">laid out a formal plan</a> for how they planned to split up the assets in a divorce. Ericsson is taking on take on the &#8220;design, development and sales of the LTE multimode thin modem products, including 2G, 3G and 4G multimode.&#8221; ST, meanwhile, will assume all other products, including some assembly and test facilities. The remaining parts would get closed down. Those transfers are expected to be completed by Q3 2013, the company says.</p>
<p>As part of this, for the time being ST-Ericsson is also getting a new president/CEO, Carlo Ferro, who will take over on April 1, 2013. Ferro had been COO, and he will replace Didier Lamouche, who is leaving the company.</p>
<p>The 1,600 people getting laid off today are worldwide, the company says, with just over one-third in Europe. In addition to this, Ericsson will be taking on 1,800 employees and contractors, mainly in Sweden, Germany, India and China. STMicro will take 950 workers in France and Italy. They are still looking for a buyer for its connectivity business, employing 200 people &#8212; and the fact that they&#8217;ve kept that on the table seems to imply that there may be an offer on the table at least.</p>
<p>Once the dust settles on today&#8217;s news, it may be likely that the workers transferred to STMicro and Ericsson will also be under review, as those businesses get integrated into their new parents&#8217; operations.</p>
<p>But there are still areas that ST-Ericsson has been developing amid all the doom and gloom for the bigger business. The 4G multimode business is one area where ST-Ericsson has been hoping for progress, on the back of the growing number of LTE networks worldwide. One recent product, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stericsson.com/press_releases/VoLTE-demo_Ericsson.jsp">demoed at Mobile World Congress</a>, featured its new Thor chipset and &#8220;the world’s first&#8221; dual-mode high-definition voice over LTE connection between two different LTE standards, LTE FDD and LTE TDD (TD-LTE), which it showed off with China Mobile.</p>
<p>The story of the JV is the mobile infrastructure leitmotif to the bigger decline of the European mobile manufacturing industry over the last several years. While the region remains a very important market in terms of consumers of mobile services, the center of gravity for production and R&amp;D in mobile has moved to China and companies like Samsung, Qualcomm, Google and Apple. Meanwhile, in Europe, once-global leaders like Finland&#8217;s Nokia (significantly, once one of ST-Ericsson&#8217;s biggest customers) are now on their knees, with others like Siemens exiting handset making years ago, and Ericsson following slowly in Siemens&#8217; path.</p>

That&#8217;s partly because slower data connections prevented studios from having enough confidence that they could provide a fast, twitchy user experience. At the same time, it was questionable whether there would be enough of a critical mass of players to match them in real-time. But one Founders Fund-backed company called Jawfish Games says it has a multiplayer platform that can pit up to 16 players against each other in a single tournament at the same time. They&#8217;ve partnered with Seattle&#8217;s Big Fish Games, a privately held casual gaming company that made more than $180 million in 2011, to distribute a game called Match-­‐Up! The title is really a collection of several well-worn classics like a word unscrambling game, a puzzle game that has players match items of three colors in a row and Mahjong. Players advance through a bracket that matches 16 players, then eight, then four, and then &#8212; you catch the drift. In keeping with short attention spans on mobile devices, each round is 30 seconds, so a full tournament is only a few minutes long. At first, the title will be more of a proof of concept. Then the two companies will build it out with more games going forward. Since Big Fish has a library of more than 300 mobile games, there are plenty of titles they could work into Match&#8211;Up! Jawfish took an $885,000 seed round in January of last year and then added a $2.8 million bridge note with participation from Founders Fund. (Yes, I was surprised that Founders Fund &#8212; as in Peter Thiel&#8217;s fund that wants flying cars, not tweets &#8212; backed a gaming company.)

<p>&#8220;We believe we&#8217;re the best in the world at supporting mobile gaming in real-time,&#8221; he said. He&#8217;s facing down a number of other companies eyeing this area. Zynga <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/26/zynga-boosts-support-for-synchronous-multiplayer-mode-in-several-games/">expanded its capacity for supporting synchronous multiplayer mode in its arcade games,</a> while other startups like Israel&#8217;s Nextpeer partner with third-party developers to offer multiplayer support. Nextpeer often matches up players with a &#8220;replay&#8221; of their opponent&#8217;s gameplay, however.</p>
<p>Jawfish&#8217;s platform shows you your opponent&#8217;s screen and performance in real-time in a small &#8220;Spycam&#8221; in the corner of the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such an obvious idea, but it&#8217;s an extremely difficult technical challenge,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gordon says he&#8217;s only partnering with Big Fish Games and isn&#8217;t looking to expand his platform to work with other big gaming companies.</p>
<p>Match Up! is naturally free-to-play. If a user wins a tournament, they&#8217;ll start accumulating virtual chips that they use later on. They&#8217;ll have special tournaments that more experience players can wager more in. &#8220;As you build up your chips, you can imagine where this is going,&#8221; he said, hinting that players might be able to top-up on extra chips through in-app purchases.</p>

		<title>Messaging Service WhatsApp To Extend Subscription Model To iOS This Year, But Don't Hold Your Breath For A Desktop App</title>

Jan Koum, WhatsApp&#8217;s CEO, says that the company is planning this year to shift its iOS app to one where new users would pay annually to keep using, taking it away from a one-off download fee and bringing it in line with how it is distributed on the Android, BlackBerry, Nokia and Windows Phone platforms.</p>
<p>The comments were made to Dutch journalist Alexander Klopping, and reproduced in part in two Dutch blogs, <a target="_blank" href="http://tweakers.net/nieuws/87887/whatsapp-stapt-over-op-jaarabonnementen-voor-ios-app.html">Tweakers</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techtastic.nl/2013/03/whatsapp-gaat-betaalde-abonnementen-introduceren-voor-ios-versie/">Techtastic</a>. Klopping also provided us with recording of the interview, in English.</p>
<p>The new subscription model would apply to new users, Koum said, and would likely follow the same pricing structure as its other apps, which are free for the first year and then cost $1/year, compared to the single, for-life $0.99 purchase that users make on iOS today. &#8220;We&#8217;re relaxed on dates, but definitely this year. It&#8217;s on the road map,&#8221; Koum said.</p>
<p>There are signs that WhatsApp is already making the necessary tweaks to implement the change. On an area of the site where users can contribute translations for future WhatsApp services, a <a target="_blank" href="http://fyre.it/Po0del.4">commenter below</a> points out it&#8217;s already <a target="_blank" href="http://translate.whatsapp.com/pt_BR/iPhone/edit/312409">crowdsourced four ways of saying &#8220;purchase now&#8221;</a> to renew a subscription on an iPhone.</p>
<p>Koum did not spell out too much of the logic behind why WhatsApp is changing its model &#8212; &#8220;We want to keep things simple,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>On the competitive landscape, WhatsApp is currently one of the most popular messaging apps around, with 17 billion messages transmitted daily (7 billion inbound and 10 billion outbound), with over 100 million users on Android alone. But it is also facing challenges from the likes of messaging apps like Line, which in January passed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/18/line-100m-users/">100 million users</a> across multiple platforms. Line is free to download and it makes its revenues through in-app purchases for stickers and virtual currency for games and other content, alongside other services like messaging and free voice calls, part of a strategy of presenting itself as a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/line-the-social-entertainment-platform/">social entertainment platform</a>. Making WhatsApp free for the first year doesn&#8217;t match that feature set, but it at least better matches what Line (and others) offer to App Store browsers looking for messaging apps. And of course free downloads are what drive many of the most popular apps today.</p>
<p>Some other noteworthy details from Koum&#8217;s short interview:</p>
<p>&#8211; He says that WhatsApp is not likely to be making a desktop version of its service any time soon. &#8220;We get that question asked a lot,&#8221; Koum said of desktop apps. &#8220;We feel strongly that the world is moving to mobile and [so] we want to be mobile-only. Your phone is with you all the time, and desktop is to many becoming a secondary experience. [So] our answer is no, not anytime soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Similarly, adding live streaming video to WhatsApp is &#8220;definitely not this year,&#8221; said Koum. (Also on the list of feature speculation is gaming. A <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/17/whatsapp-reportedly-moving-into-gaming-after-inking-deal-with-korean-games-maker/">report</a> over the weekend claimed that WhatsApp was making a move into gaming on its platform, per a deal with gaming company WeMade, although later the <a target="_blank" href="http://techrux.net/whatsapp-game-platform/">original source</a> for that report was pulled citing wrong information.)</p>
<p>&#8211; No comment on <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/02/whats-up-with-whatsapp-facebook-might-want-to-buy-it-thats-what/">acquisition rumors</a> but a wider statement on exit strategies in general. &#8220;We don&#8217;t discuss exit strategies internally,&#8221; Koum said. &#8220;A lot of companies in Silicon Valley talk about exit strategies. The way we look at it, is it&#8217;s like entering a marriage and talking about divorce. We just don&#8217;t have one. We don&#8217;t have one because we don&#8217;t plan or want to think about it. We want to focus on good products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; On cannibalizing carrier revenues. &#8220;We actually have really good relationships with a lot of carriers. We&#8217;re doing some revolutionary stuff. The world is switching to data [and we have] some good partnerships, for example with Three in Hong Kong.&#8221; That partnership gives Three subscribers access to WhatsApp when they travel internationally for the equivalent of about $6/day. &#8220;We understand that a lot of people are switching to our product instead of SMS but we look at it as evolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Android Police notes, Google Keep resembles <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/googlenotebook/faq.html">Google Notebook</a>, which allowed users to clip and organize information from the Web but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/01/14/google-axes-dodgeball-jaiku-video-and-more/">was discontinued back in January 2009</a>, and Evernote (which was <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2009/01/evernote-releases-google-notebook-importer/">quick to extend a welcome</a> to former Google Notebook users). This isn&#8217;t the first time that Google Keep has been spotted, either. Last July, Google <a target="_blank" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+google/posts/Hd2UvuoUHb3">accidentally included a screenshot</a> in an official Google+ post that included &#8220;save to Google Keep&#8221; label.</p>
<p>If Google Keep does indeed officially go live later, it will compete with other note-taking services like Evernote, Pocket, and Onenote.
