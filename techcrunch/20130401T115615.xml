Existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners and IndoUS Venture Partners also participated.</p>
<p>The news was first reported by Indian tech blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nextbigwhat.com/ebay-invests-in-snapdeal-297/">NextBigWhat</a>, and we have now confirmed the details with our own sources. It will make eBay a minority shareholder in the company. Snapdeal&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Kunal Bahl has declined to comment. This means that Snapdeal has now raised about $102 million in funding since 2010.</p>
<p>The news will mean one further step into India for eBay: the company already has a full subsidiary in the country, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebay.in">eBay India</a>, but that only has 5 million users. Ebay India recently noted in its <a target="_blank" href="http://shopping.ebay.in/census/statistics/averageDay.php">2012 Census</a> that it enables transactions at the rate of about 1 per minute. That&#8217;s for smaller items like mobile accessories and beauty products.</p>
<p>Snapdeal, meanwhile, was first established in 2010 as a daily deals site but more recently, in 2012, moved into a marketplace model &#8212; similar to the one built out by eBay and Amazon, offering a platform for merchants to sell goods. Some of the verticals that it has focused on include fashion, home goods, and consumer electronics and it now has 20 million users, or about 1 in every five Indian people who are online. It&#8217;s expected that Snapdeal <a target="_blank" href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/internet/Snapdeal-expects-online-sales-to-touch-Rs-2000-cr-in-FY14/articleshow/19322065.cms">will generate about $400 million in sales in 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, eBay already has a strong business outside of the U.S. In its analyst day last week, Wendy Jones, VP of geographical expansion and cross border trade, noted that 61% of its Marketplace revenue comes from non-U.S. markets. </p>
<p>Within that, the BRIC block of Brazil, Russia, India and China are playing a key role. Last week, eBay chose to hone in on Russia&#8217;s role there: Jones called Russia eBay&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ebayinc/status/317311383597375488">number-one priority</a> for expansion, partly because it now has the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/global-it-spend-will-rise-4-1-to-3-8t-in-2013-with-mobile-and-enterprise-leading-the-way/">largest internet population in all of Europe</a>, and partly because that population is still growing fast. For eBay in particular, Russian users bought <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ebayinc/status/317311914579488768">$400 million in goods on the site in 2012</a>, growing by 54% over 2011. </p>
<p>But that is also growing beyond Russia: eBay <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ebayinc/status/317311914579488768">believes</a> that 25% of total active users, and 12% of global sales will be coming from the BRIC block by 2015. Within that eBay says it <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ebayinc/status/317310738836377603">wants</a> to build out active users in BRIC and emerging markets 6.5-fold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/vmpw0sl.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="vMPW0sl" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Facebook is making an announcement this Thursday, and our own Josh Constine reports that at this event we&#8217;ll see the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/facebook-android-phone/">company unveil its own slightly tweaked flavor of Android</a>, to power select HTC smartphones. But why would the company do that, and why now? A new <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/31/net-us-mobile-apps-facebook-idUSBRE92U09C20130331">report from Reuter</a> provides very good motivation: Facebook sees a potential threat in the growing success of mobile-first messaging platforms that make the social networking experience more about conversation and less about broadcasts.</p>
<p>In the article, Reuters flags a number of successful mobile-first startups and companies that have managed to attract a very sizeable user base, and which it claims are especially popular among a younger demographic, including KakaoTalk, LINE, WeChat, Kik and WhatsApp. These apps mostly seem to succeed by focusing on brief one-to-one or group communication, with provisions that also allow for direct sharing of media like YouTube clips, audio and games, where Facebook and other web-based social networks before it have emphasized one-to-many broadcasts, and a less direct model of social interaction.</p>
<p>Facebook has obviously seen the effect of this shift, and has altered its product to try to anticipate or react to it, with moves like the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/01/facebook-beluga/">Beluga purchase in 2011</a>, which led to the launch of Facebook Messenger. It also built a Snapchat clone, over the course of just a few days, in a move that seemed to be little more than a display of power: the big dog saying essentially, &#8216;if this is what people want, we can do that too, and without breaking a sweat.&#8217;</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s reason to suggest Facebook is sweating. The Reuters piece cites <a title="30M Users Strong, Kik Tries To Preserve Messaging Simplicity While Adding Features With Kik Cards" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/29/30m-users-strong-kik-tries-to-preserve-messaging-simplicity-while-adding-features-with-kik-cards/">Kik&#8217;s recent introduction of Kik Cards</a>, a means for sharing content on the messaging platform quickly and easily, and most importantly, without cluttering the core experience. I spoke with Kik founder Ted Livingston twice about Kik Cards, once before their launch and once shortly after, and he agreed with me that there&#8217;s a huge opportunity out there for someone like Kik or another mobile-native startup to take things further and become a full-fledged mobile-first social network, possibly even one to usurp Facebook&#8217;s dominant position.</p>
<p>Kik has 40 million users, however, and event WeChat&#8217;s 400 million users is a far cry from Facebook&#8217;s more than 1 billion monthly active users, 680 million of which are active on mobile. Others like LINE and KakaoTalk, which have been primarily successful in Asia so far, still only have 120 million and 80 million users respectively. Point being, according to the numbers in black and white, Facebook still has an immense lead on its mobile competitors, and one that isn&#8217;t likely to suffer a huge reversal in the immediate future.</p>
<p>But Facebook&#8217;s Thursday announcement (which is where it tellingly directed Reuter&#8217;s when the pub sought comment for its story today) suggests that even if its crown isn&#8217;t under immediate threat, the company is thinking hard about how to woo mobile users in a meaningful and lasting way. Building Facebook DNA into the very core of the OS could be a good way to do that, and one that others might find hard to replicate owing to Facebook&#8217;s stronger influence. The bottom line is that Facebook is looking ahead to anticipate a time when it might not be in a position of power, and a strike at the young, mobile demographic right where they feel most at home could help considerably in avoiding that future.</p>

<p>Like all new startups, we&#8217;ve <a target="_blank" href="https://angel.co/unerdwear-1">registered on AngelList</a> which we&#8217;re pretty sure will be land us a funding round any day now.</p>
<p>Shipping starts in a few weeks, which will be fine, because at this rate Winter will still be here in Europe. </p>
<p>You can check out our research into this amazing new space here and Like our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Unerdwear">Facebook page here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Unerdwear">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>After extensive AB testing the initial line will heavily feature nerds, dinosaurs and cats.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;re as excited  &#8211; and warmed up &#8211; but this new development as we are. Underdwear here we come.</p>

Gametize has a platform called GameMaki that gives clients a way to work challenges into their customer-facing services. It&#8217;s been working with Standing Sushi Bar since 2011, when the sushi restaurant started listing weekly &#8220;challenges&#8221; at its outlets in exchange for points to be redeemed for discounts. While Gametize&#8217;s CEO, Keith Ng, will become the sushi bar&#8217;s technology head and CTO, Damon Widjaja, will manage Indonesia&#8217;s technology office, it seems Standing Sushi Bar wants them for more than their technology prowess.

The stark difference between them and the likes of JobStreet and Monster highlight how much room there is for innovation in the traditional jobs classifieds scene. I&#8217;ve always found that cold calls tend to come from the most mismatched employers, and trawling through job listings on classified listings seems to throw up dismal harvests. LinkedIn caught onto this potential a couple of years ago, when the company went public and started a recruiting service. The recruitment business is now the largest contributing pillar to its revenues, which in the third quarter last year hit $252 million—up 81 percent from the corresponding quarter a year prior. As a comparison, Monster&#8217;s revenues were $250 million in its second quarter last year, but are flattening out at 2 percent growth. In Japan, Swimmy Minami founded a jobs site called BizReach.jp in 2009. Earlier this year, he launched a separate entity for the Asia-Pacific (focusing on Hong Kong and Singapore) called RegionUp. The difference between Minami&#8217;s sites and other classifieds is that jobseekers pay a subscription to be listed on these sites, and you also have to be qualified for a job that will make you US$100,000 and up per annum. Minami said that this helps keep the listings to higher-paying management roles, so users don&#8217;t waste their time on jobs they don&#8217;t want. The company also screens each user to make sure they are qualified for the pay bracket. This helps BizReach and RegionUp approach employers (which don&#8217;t pay to interact with the sites) with a portfolio of candidates that are more likely to get the jobs, he said. All of this started because Minami was looking for a job himself back in 2008. Up to this point, he had worked at Morgan Stanley and for Hong Kong magnate, Lee Ka Shing. He co-founded and ran a baseball team, The Rakuten Eagles, under the Rakuten firm, and he was getting restless. &#8220;I talked to 27 recruiters in one month, and they all showed me different positions in different companies. I felt that if I could pay someone to gather information on jobs for me, I’d do that rather than spend 40 hours meeting 27 recruiters,&#8221; he said.

Minami&#8217;s Japanese operations with BizReach employs 160 people, and the new Singapore headquarters has six. Minami splits his time between Japan and Singapore now to grow the new operations.</p>
<p>He said the site attracts about 140,000 jobseekers and about 1,600 recruiters daily. In February 2010, it got $2.6 million in funding from Japanese VC, Jafco.</p>

Another site that just launched, <a target="_blank" href="http://tribehired.com/my_landing">Tribehired</a> is tapping users&#8217; social networks to make more meaningful job connections. The company is based in Malaysia, and recently started global expansion plans, thanks to a $560,000 round of funding from Singapore&#8217;s TNF Ventures and a couple of angel investors.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/tribehired-logo.jpg"></a>The site graduated from Singaporean accelerator, <a target="_blank" href="http://jfdi.asia">JFDI Asia</a>&#8216;s bootcamp program. The idea is that users hook up their Facebook networks to the site, and uses friends to recommend jobs to them. Its operations manager, Illum Khan, said the company started in May 2012, and is now using the funding to hire sales people and UI developers in Singapore.</p>
<p>The beta site is being tested across a few thousand users in Malaysia, and Tribehired plans to launch proper in about two months.</p>
<p>Tribehired received some funding from Cradle Fund Sdn Bhd, a government agency under the Ministry of Finance, Malaysia.</p>

<p>The startup’s approach sits somewhere in the middle of the competition in this space. It argues its technology is more sophisticated than more basic over-the-counter physical products such as home urine tests or body-basal-thermometers (which are also cheaper than DuoFertility&#8217;s offering), as the data captured by its wearable sensor is more accurate. Data is also sent back to DuoFertility staff for monitoring and reviewing – so it’s being looked at by specialist staff using bespoke algorithms rather than generalised models.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the product is cheaper than a cycle of artificial insemination &#8212; and much cheaper than IVF. It&#8217;s also nowhere near as invasive as either of those alternatives. DuoFertility costs £495 with unlimited support vs around £800 for a cycle of artificial insemination (including drugs and tests) and around £4,5000 for a cycle of IVF, says CEO and co-founder Shamus Husheer.</p>
<p>“It is this combination of both automated analysis and expert review of this data that sets us apart from anything else out there, and probably to a large extent explains why our pregnancy rates are so high for patients who are well past buying something off the shelf at the pharmacy,” he says</p>
<p>“The really surprising thing is that, for only a relatively small increment in cost over the [more basic, competitor] at-home devices, DuoFertility gives a vastly higher pregnancy rate than artificial insemination, and even matches or exceeds that of IVF.”</p>
<p>Success is a little difficult to measure, however, as a variety of factors have to be considered – as Husheer explains: “Although 80% of normally fertile women will get pregnant within their first year of trying to conceive, infertile couples (those who have been trying for more than two years) have only about a 12% chance of getting pregnant over a year. Therefore simply saying x% of patients will get pregnant is meaningless (or worse, misleading) – this does not however prevent some less scrupulous clinics and products from doing exactly this.</p>
<p>“Therefore we publish our success rate data only on these ‘difficult cases’ of infertile patients, and specifically those who have qualified for or already been through IVF. We then break this data down by both female age and time trying for a baby, which are the most important factors in determining success rate. A peer-reviewed <a target="_blank" href="www.duofertility.com/duofertility-vs-ivf">scientific paper</a> on exactly this was published at the end of 2011, demonstrating a pregnancy rate that was higher than that from a cycle of IVF for every age group under 45 (the rates themselves ranging from over 40% to less than 15%).”</p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p>So what exactly does DuoFertility’s technology do? The product consists of a wearable sensor, worn inside an adhesive patch so it remains attached day and night, which logs the woman’s “body temperature and movement thousands of times a day and night to calculate deep sleep core temperature”, plus a reader unit which receives the data from the sensor via a modified version of RFID. The reader calculates likely future fertility &#8212; based on &#8220;all of the information it has seen about you to date” (users can enter “a range of different parameters on the reader, from menstruation to ovulation pain to illness”).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=788915" rel="attachment wp-att-788915"></a>The reader connects to a PC via USB to display past and near future fertility charts. Additional data can then be added by the user, such as medical or home test results and notes for DuoFertility’s staff to read. And all the data is automatically transferred to DuoFertility’s servers in Cambridge, U.K. for analysis and expert review.</p>
<p>“We use all of the data for each individual woman, and all of the thousands of others that we’re monitoring, to work out exactly which algorithms work for the woman most similar to this one,” says Husheer. &#8220;That allows us to dramatically improve the prediction of fertility, but also allows us to identify a range of underlying issues that may be preventing conception. There are of course many cases where the data does not perfectly fit any existing model, and so these cases are escalated to human fertility experts for review and, if necessary, a discussion with the patient or their doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>DuoFertility aims to identify the 42-78 hour monthly window when couples should be trying to conceive &#8212; and says that by continually monitoring women it can pick up on signs that a particular cycle is similar or different to a previous cycle, as well as compare a cycle to similar cycles in its database.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Basically, there is zero point in providing a prediction of ovulation down to the minute, if in fact it is five days wrong. Far better to give couples a realistic assessment of when they are likely to be fertile, and update this as we get more data. This means that for some couples ‘the goalposts move’ – they can quite literally see our algorithms updating the prediction when they connect to our servers. And if we recalculate something at our server, and they haven’t connected recently so might miss the newly calculated critical moment – we send an email or give them a call. That call has resulted in more than one baby,&#8221; adds Husheer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course not every couple will be able to get pregnant &#8212; even after using the product for a long time &#8212; so customer relationship management is a &#8220;pretty critical&#8221; component of the business. Raising false hope is certainly not part of DuoFertility&#8217;s business model, says Husheer &#8212; although he notes that for couples who can&#8217;t afford IVF, continuing to use DuoFertility despite poor &#8220;absolute chances&#8221; may be their best hope. &#8221;We find that being absolutely crystal clear about this often makes for a difficult but ultimately necessary and productive conversation with the couple,&#8221; he says. The startup also offers refunds to new users if it believes it won&#8217;t be able to help them, and reviews users after four to five months (and regularly after that) to ensure continued use still makes sense for them.</p>
<h3>Starting up</h3>
<p>The idea for Duofertility was conceived during Husheer’s PhD research at Cambridge University. The link is indirect, since his research was actually building instruments for particle accelerators. “I realised that several of the instrumental techniques we used could be applied to human physiology, and specifically to monitoring fertility,” he tells TechCrunch. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=788912" rel="attachment wp-att-788912"></a></p>
<p>Husheer (pictured right, with fellow co-founder Oriane Chausiaux) and a group of fellow graduate students – “scientists and medics”, some with PhDs in infertility – then got together and entered a university business plan competition in 2006, going on to win £20,000. The money funded a prototype and the filing of the first patent. “By mid 2007 we had brilliant data and several local Angel investors telling us to hurry up and graduate so that they could fund the project,” says Husheer. “Just 18 months and less than £1 million later, DuoFertility had been through design, development, trials, medical approvals and sold to the first customer.”</p>
<p>The first DuoFertility was bought in May 2009, although Husheer says the first pregnancy was &#8220;actually somewhat before that&#8221; &#8212; during early trials. &#8220;Sales really stepped up when DuoFertility was stocked by the largest UK pharmacy chain, Boots, in 2011 as the result of our participating in a reality-TV show hunting for innovative new products for the major retailers,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Further funding came via the competition route, after DuoFertility won Qualcomm’s European QPrize in 2011. That in turn led to attention from Qualcomm’s venture capital arm. Husheer says the company has now raised a little over £2 million in funding from three Angel investor groups and from <a target="_blank" href="https://qualcommventures.com/">Qualcomm Ventures</a>.</p>
<h3>Growing In The U.S.</h3>
<p>DuoFertility&#8217;s next big step will be raising its profile in the U.S. &#8212; by targeting key national medical conferences such as the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in May, and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October to properly enter the market. Husheer notes the company “recently achieved FDA clearance”, and although U.S. users can buy the device via DuoFertility&#8217;s website and be supported in using it, he says the business needs to spend time introducing the product to the medical community to make doctors aware of it and ensure they are happy to recommend it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We have a small team on the ground in the U.S., calling on doctors in New York and California to introduce the product and make sure that DuoFertility fits into the way that they practice medicine. Over the next few months we will be hiring several more commercially focused people, both for activities directed at the medical community and the consumer &#8212; so any [TechCrunch] readers with experience in bringing similar technologies to market in the US should drop me a line,&#8221; says Husheer.</p>
<p>“From a regulatory perspective we are clear to sell anywhere in the E.U. or U.S., and in several countries that accept their medical clearances (e.g. South Africa and many Arab states). As a company selling on the Internet it will be no surprise that we have patients in almost all of these places – in fact we now have babies on every continent except Antarctica. That said, our primary focus is the U.K. and U.S.,” he adds.</p>
<p>Part of the issue with the U.S. market is that, for legal reasons, DuoFertility is not allowed to provide medical advice to the patient directly &#8212; but must work through the patient&#8217;s doctor. &#8220;This means their doctor is preferably included ‘in the loop’ from the beginning, however if the patient just uses DuoFertility without a doctor we can refer to a doctor we work with in their city if they need one,&#8221; Husheer adds.</p>
<p>DuoFertility has more than 30 staff at present, working shifts to ensure U.S. timezones are covered. The number of staff is likely to rise over the next year &#8212; especially if the company  replicates its U.K. fertility centre on U.S. soil so that American couples can be monitored by staff in the same timezone.</p>
<p>The company broke even in 2011 but has been ploughing investment into ramping up for the U.S. market so, overall, the business has not been profitable recently but Husheer says that&#8217;s all part of its growth plans: &#8220;Our investors seem to be very happy with this strategy, as everyone can see that the US will be the major market for us.&#8221;</p>

During the period, we would not be able to serve new order and we apologize for the inconvenience caused. We will resume the operation as soon as possible and keep you informed. Any returns and refund will also be honored according to the term agreed. All customers can contact us on cs@zalora.com.tw. Our customer service agent will response within 1 working day. We deny any rumors that we are going through a bankruptcy or closure. All payment to customers and our vendors are proceeded or will be preceded. All of our employees will be managed according with Taiwan labor law. We reserve the right to take legal action against anyone making untrue statement about us. One year after launching in Taiwan, Rocket Internet-backed Zalora may be shutting down its operations in the country. Though the Singapore-based fashion e-tailer has yet to issue a confirmation, e27 notes several signs that a closure of its Taiwan branch is already in progress. Zalora Taiwan&#8217;s Web site currently says that it will no longer provide telephone services for customer support after today. Furthermore, Taiwanese TV news station TVBS reported last week (link via Google Translate) that more than 100 employees were suddenly laid off as Zalora canceled orders from suppliers. Reasons cited by TVBS for Zalora Taiwan&#8217;s potential demise include the high cost of marketing in Taiwan&#8217;s saturated online retail market, which is already dominated by e-commerce sites Yahoo! Taiwan and PChome. Zalora recently landed several high-profile investments, including $26 million from German retail conglomerate Tengelmann Group, but as Jacky Yap of e27 notes, Rocket Internet has already encountered several setbacks in Southeast Asia, including the closure of Home24. &#8220;Rocket Internet will not hesitate to pull the plug when it comes to evaluating a likely failure,&#8221; just as it shut down its operations in Turkey last August, Yap writes. Despite Zalora&#8217;s rapid growth, the reported closure of its Taiwan operations is a reminder that Rocket Internet&#8217;s foothold on the Asian market is still not a sure thing. I&#8217;ve reached out to Zalora&#8217;s HQ for comment and will update if I hear back from them.]]></description>

If your company is doing something amazing to help a charitable cause or doing some good in your community, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:drew@techcrunch.com">please reach out</a>.</em>]</p>
<p>It seems like every time we make purchases online or in a store, we&#8217;re collecting some sort of points or rewards. For the most part, those points go unused, mostly because the companies who give them out don&#8217;t do a great job of explaining what you can actually do with them. </p>
<p>You know the drill, you purchase a video game and you get some GameStop points that you can use after you purchase three more games, or something along those lines. Inevitably, you forget to use them when the time comes or you refuse to sign up to get their card.</p>
<p>A company called <a target="_blank" href="http://kulacauses.com">KULA Causes</a> wants to point those points, rewards and frequent flyer miles to good use &#8212; for charity. KULA converts those points into actual currency, spreading goodwill all over the world.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_3_31_13_7_08_pm.png"></a></p>
<p>According to the research firm Colloquy, at least $16B worth of reward points and miled went unredeemed in 2011 alone. KULA has built a service to turn those unused rewards into cash contributions for over 2.5M causes around the world. By working with brands on building this three-way bridge between companies, causes and consumers, KULA is making a real difference in over 80 countries all over the world. Since there are so many causes in KULA&#8217;s database, it&#8217;s easy to find a few that you really care about, and then you&#8217;re motivated to put your unclaimed rewards to good use.</p>
<p>KULA calls the process &#8220;democratized transactional giving,&#8221; which the company hopes will build goodwill between companies and consumers, even if the reward points that someone has collected aren&#8217;t used by them for in-store purchases. The company was founded in 2010 and has raised $1.6M to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to the companies to integrate KULA into their reward offerings, but it&#8217;s a win-win for everyone involved.</p>

<p>The company also has a great blog called &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.currencyofgiving.com/">The Currency Of Giving</a>&#8221; that is worth a read. The mixing of companies focusing on both profitability and non-profit programs is an important one, as consumers do care more about companies that do social good.</p>
<p>Would you give your points and rewards away for charity?</p>

Just a few hours later though, NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory shot down that claim noting that the tell-tale sign of hitting interstellar space (a &#8220;change in the direction of the magnetic field&#8221;) hasn&#8217;t been detected yet.</p>
<p>Still, this whole thing got me thinking: NASA launched Voyager I in 1977 to peer more closely at the outer planets. By late 1980, the probe had completed its tour of Jupiter and Saturn and made a gravity-assisted beeline for the edge of the solar system. In the 40 or so years that Voyager has toured the outer fringes of the solar system, our focus on space has grown more limited, and in many ways it&#8217;s a new breed of space-based startups that are helping to spark imaginations the way NASA has done for decades.</p>
<p>You see, back on Earth, some people are looking to the heavens with renewed vigor &#8212; emphasis on &#8220;some.&#8221; There’s still plenty of work to be done in low Earth orbit, with SpaceX and a handful of other companies crafting and perfecting their cargo-ferrying space taxis for trips to the International Space Station. But the U.S. government&#8217;s drive to search out newer and farther frontiers in space has been seemingly tempered by political pragmatism and a dearth of available funds. </p>
<p>Ventures like Curiosity&#8217;s Mars landing were highlights in the history of space science and exploration, but these days NASA can&#8217;t even maintain its public outreach programs thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.space.com/20411-nasa-education-sequester-petition.html">recent budget cuts</a>.</p>
<p>That’s why the promise of privately operated space startups is so captivating: national priorities have shifted since the sixties, but that hasn’t kept some ambitious entrepreneurs from almost literally reaching for the stars. SpaceX founder Elon Musk famously noted that he hoped to establish a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/11/elon-musk-mars-colony/">full-fledged colony on Mars</a>, and at least one <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/12/mars-one-paragon/">mildly kooky organization</a> is looking to get people living and working on the Red Planet as soon as possible by way of a televised spectacle meant to raise funds and select the first batch of Martian astronauts. Mars isn’t the only floating hunk of rock that entrepreneurs are currently eying up, either. A startup called (unimaginatively enough) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planetaryresources.com/">Planetary Resources </a>has received backing from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/11/meanwhile-in-space-asteroid-mining-startup-planetary-resources-inks-deal-with-virgin-galactic/">some serious names </a>and aims to explore/hopefully mine nearby asteroids for precious materials with a fleet of specialized robots. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as though every space startup has ambitions as wild-eyed as those listed above. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.altius-space.com/">Altius Space Machines</a> took home the top at NewSpace 2011&#8242;s business plan contest for its vision of simplifying the process of wrangling out-of-control satellites and the like. Meanwhile, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spacegroundamalgam.com/space/SID.html">SpaceGround Amalgam</a> won that same prize a year later for its inflatable antenna concept &#8212; they fold up for easy storage during launch, and can inflate and harden once in orbit. These sorts of less-flashy startups are just as important as SpaceX and Planetary Resources &#8212; should their long term visions pan out, they could help lay the groundwork (spacework?) for more majestic, horizon-expanding ventures to come. Even the Startup Weekend guys are getting into it: the very first SW event <a target="_blank" href="http://space.startupweekend.org/">dedicated solely to space</a> is slated to kick off in late May with the goal of coaxing would-be space entrepreneurs into cooking up the next great space startup.</p>
<p>Some of the plans above sound like spurious tales of science fiction, pages ripped from a pulp novel, but they shouldn’t be immediately discounted just for that. I suppose the notion that a device of mankind’s creation would break free from the influence of the sun would’ve sounded like science fiction a few decades ago, so who’s to say what the next few years will bring.</p>
<p>Speaking of the next few years, Voyager doesn&#8217;t have much longer to live. At the probe’s current rate of power consumption, it has enough juice in its plutonium-powered generators to keep it going until about 2020, when NASA will begin to remotely shut down Voyager&#8217;s instruments one by one. Ultimately, Voyager will continue to drift in the sea of interstellar space, but humanity will lose contact with its most far-flung explorer in short order &#8212; here&#8217;s hoping that some savvy startups help to kick off a second Space Age before then.</p>

He&#8217;s a professor at the Columbia School of Journalism, and he said he&#8217;s been published in The New Yorker, Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, and Sports Illustrated — in other words, he seems to be on pretty good terms with those gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Yet Shapiro is launching a new journalism startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/23520052/the-big-roundtable">The Big Roundtable</a>. The reason? He said that there are a lot of untested assumptions in the journalism world. As a parallel, he pointed to book publishing, where he said it was long believed that &#8220;black people don&#8217;t buy books.&#8221; There was, in fact, &#8220;this whole sub rosa world&#8221; of independent black book stores, with its own bestsellers like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_Slim">Iceberg Slim</a>&#8216;s <em>Pimp: The Story Of My Life</em>. Yet traditional publishers had no idea that world existed until the mainstream success of writers like Terry McMillan in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Similarly, Shapiro isn&#8217;t criticizing anyone in particular, but he said that submitting to the shrinking number of magazines that support long-form journalism means subjecting yourself to the taste of individual editors. He said he&#8217;s often asked by students and colleagues whether the New Yorker or a similar magazine might be interested in a particular story: &#8220;The answer is probably not. This is not the era in which I came of age.&#8221;</p>
<p>The web has spawned new venues for selling that long-form journalism, like the Atavist, Byliner, and Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Singles program, but Shapiro said they&#8217;re still applying the same editorial model. With The Big Roundtable, he hopes to do things differently. Shapiro has assembled a group of 50 readers, who are supposed to vet the stories. The first 1,000 words of each submission are sent to a subset of those readers, who are then asked whether they&#8217;d read more. (That&#8217;s <em>all</em> they&#8217;re asked — Shapiro said that in earlier versions of the system, readers offered more detailed feedback, but &#8220;it felt like homework&#8221; and &#8220;it quickly devolved into workshopping — you know, &#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t choose a semicolon here.&#8217;&#8221;)</p>
<p>If someone in that first group likes the excerpt, then it&#8217;s passed to a second group, and if someone likes it there, only then does an editor — specifically Mike Hoyt, executive editor of the Columbia Journalism review — start working with the author. Ultimately, Shapiro plans to sell a new nonfiction novella on the site every week, and the writer will get $1 from each sale.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will allow The Big Roundtable to find work that didn&#8217;t catch the attention of particular editors but will still resonate with some readers. In that vein, Shapiro is looking for finished pieces rather than commissioning articles in advance — this should be a story that someone <em>had</em> to write, and they just haven&#8217;t found a home for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to say, &#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t know, I want to take my idea to some place where they can pay in advance,&#8217; my response is: Go with God,&#8221; Shapiro said.</p>
<p>He also said he wants to expand the reading group from 50 people to &#8220;hundreds&#8221;, with a broad set of tastes and experiences, but Shapiro emphasized that it&#8217;s not quite the same thing as crowdsourcing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing about crowdsourcing is, it&#8217;s a crowd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By its very nature it&#8217;s a huge, undifferentiated bunch of people.&#8221;</p>
<p>To illustrate his point, he mentioned the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Literary_Digest">Literary Digest</a>, a magazine that, in 1936, polled millions of people and as a result predicted that Alfred Landon would beat Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the presidential election — which was completely wrong. Shapiro&#8217;s point: That it&#8217;s less important to have an enormous group of readers, and more important to make sure that it&#8217;s the right mix. Put another way, Shapiro is emulating the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table">Algonquin Round Table</a> (a famous group of writers) and &#8220;scaling it out intellectually.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help fund The Big Roundatble&#8217;s costs, Shapiro has been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/23520052/the-big-roundtable">raising money on Kickstarter</a>. He recently passed his $5,000 target, but he said he deliberately set the goal low to make sure that he would meet it. He&#8217;s hoping to raise more money, which would presumably support The Big Roundtable for a longer period of time and allow it to get a little more ambitious. Shapiro said he&#8217;s going to be exploring other funding options, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be looking at things like grants or investors to establish a real, ongoing laboratory, a laboratory in which &#8230; this is all to be shared,&#8221; Shapiro said. &#8220;I&#8217;m welcoming competition. If this spawns more digital publishing ventures based upon our knowledge, then I will believe that we are succeeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>With <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/nose/">Google Nose</a>, you&#8217;ll be able to stop and smell the roses without having to stop a damned thing. </p>
<p>So, how can you take part in on Google&#8217;s new olfactory odyssey? It&#8217;s easy! You don&#8217;t even have to tweet at Google in hopes that you&#8217;ll win the opportunity to give them a pile of money for the appropriate hardware. You&#8217;ve already <em>got</em> the appropriate hardware! Just Google for your scent of choice (be it a<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wet+dog"> wet dog</a>, a cracklin&#8217;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=campfire"> campfire</a>, or the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gym">gym</a>), tap the &#8220;smell&#8221; button, and sniff away. Google will &#8220;intersect photons with infrasound waves&#8221; to emulate the requested aroma. That, my friends, is <em>science</em>.</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t work right away, just lean closer and keep on sniffin&#8217; — like many a Google product that came before it, this one is in Beta, so it might not work every time. (And, like many a Google product that came before it, they&#8217;ll probably kill it off in about 2 weeks)</p>

<p>[I'm pretty sure we'll have a running list of April Fool's gags tomorrow (it is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/01/april-fools-2011-the-big-list/">tradition</a>, after all), but this one is hittin' early enough and got a hearty enough laugh out of me that it's worthy of its own post.</p>
<p>Plus, it had me contemplating what the hell a ghost would smell like for at least 5 minutes.]</p>

<h3>Buyers Beware</h3>
<p>That feeling is mutual on the buyers&#8217; side too. Warner Bros said last week that it would be opening a gaming studio in San Francisco. <em>In other words, it is choosing to build, not buy. </em></p>
<p>&#8220;Every time we looked at a company that was really interesting, we found that the price tag was more money than we thought was reasonable to pay,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=54853988&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=xxY2&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=eff8113d-365e-4483-bfa3-037355e1b680-0&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=68&amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_*1_Greg_Ballard_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_*1_*51_*1_*51_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2&amp;pvs=ps&amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link">Greg Ballard</a>, who is Warner Bros. senior vice president of digital games.</p>
<p>Similarly, EA is holding off after some big ticket deals in the last few years to buy <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/confirmed-ea-buys-popcap-games-for-750-million-plus-earn-out/">Seattle&#8217;s PopCap for up to $1.3 billion</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regards to a large acquisition, we&#8217;re probably OK for the time being,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nick-earl/14/b33/186">Nick Earl</a>, who oversees most of EA&#8217;s free-to-play games as a senior vice president there. &#8220;If the right deal presents itself, we would make that deal. But we&#8217;re not actively seeking it.&#8221; He said his arm of EA&#8217;s business, the All Play label, is putting more effort into a smaller number of games this year.</p>
<p>Likewise, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/06/zynga-coo-ko-acquisitions-discipline/">Zynga&#8217;s COO David Ko emphasized a more &#8220;disciplined&#8221; approach toward acquisitions</a> in an interview with me last month. Zynga&#8217;s shares were <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/21/done-deal-zynga-gets-draw-something-phenom-by-acquiring-omgpop-were-hearing-210m/">burned after the $180 million deal to buy Draw Something-maker OMGPOP</a>. After some layoffs and a hard pivot to mobile platforms, Ko said the company is a lot more rigorous about what it looks for. Since OMGPOP, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/17/zynga-acquisition-a-bit-lucky/">Zynga has only done a few talent deals with startups such as A Bit Lucky.</a></p>
<p>Basically, buyers and sellers are at odds over what these companies should be worth. Sellers want several times annualized revenues &#8212; based on the months where they have hits. Buyers have limited cash and are aware of how difficult it is to integrate acquisitions and retain talent in such a competitive market. GREE&#8217;s U.S. CEO Naoki Aoyagi told me in a panel at an event put on by investment bank <a target="_blank" href="http://www.covertandco.com/">Covert &amp; Co.</a> earlier this week that the company was much more careful about <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/01/gree-acquires-mobile-social-game-developer-funzio-terms-are-undisclosed/">structuring retention with the $210 million deal to buy Funzio</a> compared to the time <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/21/japanese-company-gree-buys-mobile-social-gaming-platform-openfeint-for-104-million/">that they spent $104 million to buy OpenFeint</a>. He said he was much &#8220;happier&#8221; with the Funzio outcome, given that the co-founders have stayed on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a few years ago top media companies would pay high multiples for game companies on emerging platforms whose ultimate profitability was still unclear,&#8221; said Kristian Segerstrale, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/26/segerstrale-ea/">who just stepped down as executive vice president of EA&#8217;s digital business</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/not-playing-around-electronic-arts-buys-playfish-for-275-million/">came to EA through the $300 million acquisition of Playfish</a>. &#8220;Most large media companies are still digesting past acquisitions and can simply not afford a reasonable multiple on today&#8217;s stars.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Why Sell?</h3>
<p>At the same time, if you can run a creative business that generates loads of cash when you have a hit, why work for anyone else?</p>
<p>On the back of two hit iOS games &#8220;Clash of Clans&#8221; and &#8220;Hay Day&#8221;, Finland&#8217;s Supercell is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/supercell-2/">opting for a massive round of more than $100 million</a> over acquisition conversations, sources tell me.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a set of profitable, cash generating companies that feel they have a very legitimate shot at challenging the existing cadre of public game companies as the industry&#8217;s next leaders,&#8221; added Segerstrale, who didn&#8217;t comment specifically about Supercell. His early-stage firm Initial Capital is one of Supercell&#8217;s largest shareholders.</p>
<p>What that means is that is that the M&amp;A market for big gaming deals might be quiet in the short-term &#8212; at least in the West. (The Japanese market is an exception with deals like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/gree-pokelabo/">GREE&#8217;s deal to buy Pokelabo</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/online-games-giant-nexon-acquires-japanese-mobile-games-developer-gloops-for-468-4m-cash/">Nexon&#8217;s acquisition of Gloops</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/news/press/2013/20130325_01/">Softbank&#8217;s recent investment in Gung Ho Entertainment</a>.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the big gaming companies could start to feel comfortable with public markets in a few years, if they have a broad enough portfolio of hit franchises. Companies like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/28/kabam-180m-revenues/">San Francisco&#8217;s Kabam</a>, Seattle&#8217;s Big Fish Games and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/07/rovios-big-year-angry-birds-helps-gaming-company-soar-to-106m-in-sales648m-downloads/">Finland&#8217;s Rovio already regularly report</a> basic revenue figures to generate interest &#8212; either from future public shareholders or buyers.</p>
<p>On top of that, it looks like this year is the first one where a single mobile game&#8217;s revenues could rival that of a traditional console blockbuster. Japan&#8217;s Gung Ho Entertainment published a financial statement a few days ago suggesting that its iOS game Puzzle &amp; Dragons <a target="_blank" href="http://www.serkantoto.com/2013/03/27/gungho-puzzle-dragons-february-sales/">made somewhere between $62 million and 86 million</a>, all in a single month and all from Japan. That company&#8217;s stock has surged by more than 2,000% in the last year because of that single title, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/3765:JP">Gung Ho is now worth more than $4.8 billion, according to its market capitalization.</a></p>
<h3>IPO Window Still Feels Closed</h3>
<p>But none of these companies are going out to market now, especially considering that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?cid=481720736332929">Zynga shares fell by almost three-quarters in the first year after the company went public.</a></p>
<p>Instead, this generation of gaming companies is biding its time, riding the wave of surging iOS and Android revenues and making sure that their businesses are more hit-proof.</p>
<p>&#8220;IPOs are fine, but there have also been scenarios where it was too much of a focus. Ultimately, they&#8217;ve been very destructive to companies that were doing notable and amazing things,&#8221; Barber said. &#8220;Those variables have to be weighed super carefully, so we&#8217;re not in a rush.&#8221;</p>
<p>King, an arcade-gaming company that started more than a decade ago, just made the leap to mobile last fall. Its game Candy Crush Saga has been competing with Supercell&#8217;s &#8220;Clash of Clans&#8221; for the top-grossing spot in the U.S. That single title blew through all of the&#8217;s company 2013 financial targets in a single month and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/king-candy-crush-saga/">brought them more mobile daily active users than Zynga had last quarter</a>. They&#8217;ve quadrupled their headcount in the last two years ago, haven&#8217;t taken funding for eight and have always been profitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not planning to be acquired. There&#8217;s a bright future for us, whether we will do an IPO or not,&#8221; said <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/riccardo-zacconi/0/3a7/b39">King&#8217;s CEO Riccardo Zacconi</a>. &#8220;We&#8217;re just working on execution.&#8221;</p>

You can follow him on Twitter <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tiedtiger">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gdconf.com">Game Developer&#8217;s Conference</a> was, as expected, a whirlwind. Folks from all across the games industry and associated media came together, ate, drank, talked, queued, played, partied and even danced with wild abandon, and everyone&#8217;s takeaways from the event were different.</p>
<p>GDC is so big that nobody is able to objectively summarize what it is, but the separation between the talk and the business sides is palpable. If you mostly hung around in Moscone West and North then your GDC was probably all about education and big ideas. If you stayed more in the Expo, Moscone South or around the W hotel, it was more likely a sea of business cards. Depending on where you spent your time, there were whole parts of GDC you&#8217;d never see, news that you heard indirectly, rumors and issues which emerged on one side that the other either misunderstood or was completely unaware of.</p>
<p>This year I found myself straddling the divide, with many meetings and talks filling my calendar to bursting. I saw some things, learned some stuff and met some people, and some themes emerged for me. No doubt others who attended had a completely different experience.</p>
<p>My first theme was the increasing voice of women in games. The role, perception and treatment of women in the industry has been a long-standing issue. The most visible sign of this is the use of booth babes at trade shows to promote games, but it goes way beyond that. Female game makers have long felt that they have to struggle twice as hard to be taken seriously. They also feel woefully underrepresented by the industry&#8217;s output &#8211; even though women make up the majority market for casual and social games, for example, representations of women are often anodyne at best.</p>
<p>As a result of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/1reasonwhy-reveals-sexism-gaming-industry_n_2205204.html">#1reasonwhy</a> meme of last year (which saw many female game makers express their frustrations on Twitter) this issue of women in games was the subject of the <a target="_blank" href="http://borderhouseblog.com/?p=10484">#1reasontobe talk</a>. It also featured heavily in the &#8220;microtalks&#8221; and &#8220;rants&#8221; sessions, with Leigh Alexander talking about the tone-deaf practises of game marketing and Anna Anthropy advocating that male conference panelists should refuse to participate on a panel that doesn&#8217;t feature at least one woman. (As someone who participated on an <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/26/free-to-play-publishers/">all-male panel</a> this year, this talk in particular has made me think hard about the unconscious culture in which I participate.)</p>
<p>Yet these noble expressions were undermined by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) party, which featured skimpily dressed female dancers. A catastrophic misjudgment of sentiment, the party &#8211; sponsored by Yetizen &#8211; led to many outbursts on Twitter and the subsequent resignations in protest of many high-profile IGDA members. Most notable was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/28/4157266/igda-gdc-party-brenda-romero-resignation">Brenda Romero</a>, who only hours previously had been the leading light of the #1reason talk. It seems that the issue of women-in-games has gained much (rightful) traction on the Moscone West side of the conference. However it has yet to permeate through to the Expo side, the people who run marketing departments and PR events. Calls such as Anthropy&#8217;s are a start, but there is still a great deal to do to get those who aren&#8217;t really aware of the issue to care about it.</p>
<p>My second theme was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whatgamesare.com/2013/03/why-microconsoles-are-a-big-deal.html">microconsoles</a>. There were two parties, one for OUYA and another for GameStick, where unveilings and announcements were made. Perhaps most impressively, Julie Uhrman announced that OUYA had shipped in March as the original Kickstarter had promised, that a much larger network of retail partnerships have been formed than most industry insiders expect, and that there are around <a target="_blank" href="http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/game-news/android-game-news/5839-ouya-will-launch-with-over-100-games-available">100 games available</a> at launch (including a mix of vintage titles like Canabalt along with brand-new games). The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/gaming/consoles/gamestick-sort-of-comes-out-to-play-at-gcd-1141241">GameStick event</a> was also apparently very interesting (I wasn&#8217;t there) and it too is set to ship very soon (June, by all accounts). And there are other microconsoles in the pipeline.</p>
<p>However the resistance from the main industry to an app-style console that costs little and runs free, free-to-play and cheap games is very high. Many really don&#8217;t see what the fuss is about, comparing the microconsole to the console in a like-for-like comparison. Many question who the devices are for exactly, and what they are supposed to achieve. Personally I think this resistance comes from the same mindset that led many game developers to misunderstand the importance of social games, netbooks, tablets and a whole host of similar left-field market movements. It will probably take a year for a Supercell, Zynga or Rovio to emerge on microconsoles for game developers to suddenly realise that they&#8217;ve missed the boat.</p>
<p>The more relevant question is whether any of the existing microconsole contenders will be the ones to ultimately win. A rumour surfaced, for example, that Apple is almost ready to release a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/apples-long-rumored-game-controller-may-soon-see-the-light-of-day/">dedicated iOS game controller</a> &#8211; which led some tweeters to tell me that this means microconsoles are already dead when it actually validates the idea. There is also the haunting feeling that Samsung and some of the other big Android handset makers are eyeing the space. Could Amazon get in on it? It&#8217;s entirely possible.</p>
<p>My final theme was the idea that real-money gaming is becoming respectable. This is a time when many publishers are facing up to the hard reality of making money in online gaming (and many are still advancing deals that will likely lead to game-a-day or vertical operations down the road), while retail games are capable of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-26-tomb-raider-has-sold-3-4-million-copies-failed-to-hit-expectations">selling 3.4 million copies and still not meeting expectations</a>. Real-money wagering, betting and the like were prevalent in back-channel talk at the conference. There is the expectation that at some point the United States will legalize real-money gaming in the form of small wagering, sports betting and similar, and various companies are poised to provide solutions when it does.</p>
<p>What surprises me is how less stygmatized that idea has become. There was a time, perhaps five years ago, when the games industry considered itself entirely separate from real money, but not quite so much any more. Perhaps as a result of free-to-play gaming starting to go indie (such as through games from Nimblebit and Spry Fox, both of whom talked about their experiences), sensitivity to the very idea of real-money seemed a little more confined to sensitivity about predatory practises. Provided the model is well-managed and controlled, some game makers seem quietly open to the idea. Personally I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that yet, but the sentiment on the Expo side was palpable.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the ethics, morality and practise of real-money gaming will be next year&#8217;s hot button issue in Moscone West.</p>
<p>(PS: if there&#8217;s one GDC game that I recommend you look at Jason Rohrer&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://thecastledoctrine.net">The Castle Doctrine</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/game-of-phones-sigils.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Game Of Phones Sigils" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>The mainstream has had little reason to care that Android gives developers much more customization freedom than iOS. But if Facebook&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/facebook-android-phone/">fabled Android homescreen</a> is a hit, the stubbornness of Apple&#8217;s closed mobile platform could be framed as a drawback after years of its cohesive design and ease being seen as assets.</p>
<p>Cheapness and handset/carrier choice are two of the biggest factors convincing people to pick up Android phones today. There&#8217;s its premier integration of Google&#8217;s app suite and the &#8220;rebel without an iPhone&#8221; attitude too. But Android&#8217;s flexibility for app developers has been more of a selling point for geeks and early adopters than for the average Joe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the straight forward &#8220;it just works&#8221; aspect of iOS that leans on its rigidity has made it a popular introduction to smartphones for hundreds of millions of people. There just hasn&#8217;t been a killer brand name app to grab the mainstream&#8217;s attention that depends on Android&#8217;s cooperative architecture and that iOS won&#8217;t support. No one has forced the issue of open vs closed on the common man.</p>
<p>But six years after the iPhone&#8217;s debut, the average mobile consumer has matured. They crave more personalization through homescreen widgets and custom launchers. They want to make their phone truly theirs. The mobile world may finally have reached the turning point where the benefits of Android&#8217;s customization outweigh the benefits of iOS&#8217; simplicity. And it&#8217;s Facebook homescreen for Android that could crystallize this moment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Last week, Facebook sent out invites to a big press event to &#8220;see our new home on Android&#8221;. My sources got us <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/facebook-android-phone/">the scoop that Facebook plans to unveil a new homescreen</a> for Android that pipes in its news feed content and notifications for instant access. We&#8217;re told this experience will be debuted on an HTC handset running a version of Android that&#8217;s been modified by Facebook. The homescreen replacement is also likely to make its way to other handsets, either in the form a launcher app that can run on standard Android builds, or through Facebook partnerships with other OEMs.</p>
<p>The kicker is that Facebook&#8217;s homescreen cannot run on iOS as it exists today.</p>
<p>Now, for any of this to actually alter the mobile landscape, Facebook &#8220;Home&#8221; as it may be called will have to be a real success. Not just &#8220;Oh that looks cool&#8221;, but &#8220;I need to have that on my phone&#8221;. A lot people will never say that, because they just don&#8217;t care that much about Facebook. Beyond that, it may be tough to add a lot of value on top of the full-featured Facebook For Android app that&#8217;s just a few taps away.</p>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s possible that Facebook&#8217; heads up display, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/facebook-home/">a sixth sense for your social life</a>, could be good enough to shift the balance in the Game Of Phones. Even if not directly or immediately, the mere existence of Facebook Home could bring the open/closed debate into the sphere of public consciousness. In that sense, it could at least begin to generate momentum for Android&#8217;s &#8220;do as you please&#8221; ecosystem.</p>
<p>Apple is typically resistant to diverging from its roadmap to head off potential threats. As I&#8217;ve said, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/12/nasty-crazy-apple-doesnt-care/">Apple doesn&#8217;t care what competitors do</a>. But if it stays locked down, we might outgrow its hand-holding. For all Google&#8217;s talk off Android being open, it could take Facebook to make us realize its liberty we really want.</p>

We all know that co-founders with a longstanding personal bond have a better chance of building a successful company than co-founders who don&#8217;t share a strong friendship. But what about when that bond between two co-founders is a bit deeper, as a romantic relationship? </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.eventbrite.com">Eventbrite</a> co-founders <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/julia-hartz">Julia</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-hartz">Kevin Hartz</a> have shown that building a business with your significant other &#8212; in this case, a spouse &#8212; can lead to big success. The online event planning and ticketing platform, which is understood to be making its way to an IPO, just hit a major milestone this week, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/eventbrite-passes-1-5b-in-sales-13-of-it-in-the-last-9-months/">crossing $1.5 billion in gross sales</a> and 100 million tickets sold. </p>
<p>I had the pleasure of interviewing the Hartzes in a fireside chat last month at the really fantastic <a target="_blank" href="http://startupgrind.com/2013/">Startup Grind 2013</a> conference headed up by tech entrepreneur <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/derek-andersen">Derek Andersen</a> in Silicon Valley. In our 30-minute conversation, we talked about all things Eventbrite, from the early days as a budding startup to its current status as a sizable tech company, and you can watch it all in the video embedded above.</p>
<p>But, being that today is said to be the wedding of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/wildfire-interactive">Wildfire Interactive</a> co-founders <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/victoria-ransom">Victoria Ransom</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/alain-chuard">Alain Chuard</a>, another <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/06/google-wildfire-100-million/">uber successful co-founding couple</a> (congratulations!), I especially wanted to highlight Julia and Kevin&#8217;s comments about running a business with a loved one. </p>
<p>Kevin and Julia said placing a priority on keeping their interpersonal relationship strong was a smart decision that should be used by other co-founding teams, whether they&#8217;re in a romantic relationship or not. Starting at around 4:50, Kevin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been famous husband and wife teams where it&#8217;s worked out remarkably, and famous husband and wife teams, as in the case of Cisco, where it&#8217;s kind of a disaster &#8212; but, you know, Cisco became a great company. Like anything, it&#8217;s a co-founder relationship, and in our case we had to be extra sensitive about it because there was this extra personal relationship important aspect about it.</p>
<p>So, we approached it somewhat cautiously. We had many different chances where we would say, &#8216;OK, we&#8217;re not going to ruin the marriage,&#8217; so you know, one of us steps out, and we have this kind of a Plan B if things went poorly. I also think it&#8217;s a great exercise in really ensuring we&#8217;re compatible founders, and we were very conscientious of it. When you&#8217;re working with founders, your fellow founders, that relationship is fundamental whether it&#8217;s romantic or not.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And Julia added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We were so cautious about the decisions we made and what kind of modes of operations we would have. We had this law that we would divide and conquer, and wouldn&#8217;t work on the same thing at the same time. It just so happened we had complimentary skills so that was an easy thing to do. </p>
<p>When I overlay that over any co-founder relationship, it&#8217;s vital actually to be talking about those kinds of things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There was much more where that came from, and you can see it all in the video above.</p>

They&#8217;re initially about as unexciting as gifts can get, only to become the <em>best gift ever</em> in a pinch. Got a meeting in 20 minutes and your normal sock reserve is empty? Thanks for the bag-o-socks, Uncle Steve! Your hard drive just exploded, taking the past 3 years of your digital life with it? Thanks for the backup, past-me!</p>
<p>Besides being the day that keeps the people who make Peeps in business, today also marks the Third Annual World Backup Day. World Backup Day is a tradition that started on reddit back in 2011, and has been rippling out through the rest of the tech-loving world ever since.</p>
<p>Making today&#8217;s Backup Day particularly special is the fact that it falls on Easter, which, if nothing else, means you get to use &#8220;BRB! Gotta go check my backups!&#8221; as a way to escape any awkward family conversations that pop up before the ham is done. Or you could be a cool guy and introduce your less tech-centric family members to the concept of backin&#8217; up their bits.</p>
<p>Oh, and tomorrow is April Fool&#8217;s day. Probably not the safest day for data, you know?</p>
<p>So, how should you go about backing things up?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re trying to keep it simple, just go buy/find a big ol&#8217; external hard drive, plug it into your operating system&#8217;s built-in backup tool (Here&#8217;s a guide to <a target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/backup-and-restore">Backup</a> on Windows, or <a target="_blank" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427">Time Machine</a> on OS X), let it do its thing, and then stick the backup somewhere safe. If you can find somewhere off-site (like a trusted friend&#8217;s house), that&#8217;ll help you retain your data in case of fire or flood.</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy and push your backups online, a couple of the big backup guys are doing deals in honor of today&#8217;s techno-holiday. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crashplan.com/backupreddit/">Crashplan</a> dropped their annual price from $71 down to $42 for the day, and <a>Backblaze </a> is giving away 3-months free to all newcomers. If you&#8217;ve only got a handful of files that you need to keep backed up, Dropbox&#8217;s free 2GB plan is a solid option.</p>
<p>Hard drives are cheap. Lost data isn&#8217;t. Go, go, go!</p>

Early last week, Y Combinator-backed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/equity-crowdfunding-sec/">FundersClub received notice from the SEC</a> that the agency would not pursue action against its crowdfunding platform. But it wasn&#8217;t alone: a few days later, <a target="_blank" href="https://angel.co/">AngelList</a> received a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daniellemorrill.com/2013/03/angellist-receives-sec-no-action-letter-days-after-fundersclub/">similar letter from the SEC</a>. [hat tip to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daniellemorrill.com/">Danielle Morrill</a>] </p>
<p>The regulatory response came after AngelList requested its own assurance from the SEC that the agency wouldn&#8217;t pursue enforcement action against its investment platform, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/angellist-now-gives-smaller-investors-a-piece-of-the-action-with-launch-of-angellist-invest/">AngelList Invest</a>. </p>
<p>In its letter to the agency, AngelList noted that it was going to form a limited liability corporation that would serve as investment advisors, and would operate a platform through which accredited investors would be able to put money into startups. Like other crowdfunding investment platforms that are popping up, under AngelList&#8217;s plan, the company would introduce individual investment vehicles for each portfolio company that its users invested in. </p>
<p>According to the filing, AngelList Advisors would determine whether to create an investment vehicle for particular startups, then negotiate the terms of the investment for the larger pool. It would also exercise all voting rights for the investment vehicle and decide on whether it should distribute cash and marketable securities to investors, subject to any lock-up agreements or similar restrictions.</p>
<p>Already, AngelList is being used to help raise funds for some companies and funds, through its <a target="_blank" href="https://angel.co/invest">investing tool</a>. Open only to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm">accredited investors</a>, the tool lets users put as little as $1,000 each into startup companies that it&#8217;s created an investment vehicle for. </p>
<p>The whole idea is to allow a larger number of individual investors to make small investments in interesting startups, but to do so in a way that reduces the friction of most funding rounds today. Under current SEC rules, startups can&#8217;t advertise or announce that they&#8217;re raising funding, which means that investors might not even know that they can put money into a certain company. And, in a sense, to increase the efficiency with which startups can get funded.</p>
<p>According to a filing from the SEC last week, AngelList has gotten the green light to operate this online investment platform. You can read the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mr-noaction/2013/angellist-15a1.pdf">full letter here</a>, but it all comes down to this paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, and without necessarily agreeing with your conclusions and analysis, the Staff will not recommend enforcement action against AngelList, AngelList Advisors or any Lead Angel to the Commission under Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, ifthe parties engage in the activities described herein without registering as a broker or dealer in accordance with Section 15(b) ofthe Exchange Act.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With both AngelList and FundersClub receiving the blessings of the SEC, we can expect more platforms for crowdfunding investment in startups to take off. A few weeks ago, for instance, another Y Combinator-backed startup called WeFunder launched with its own <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/wefunder-launch/">crowdfunding platform for startup investing</a>.</p>
<p>These letters are also being sent in the wake of the passage of the JOBS Act, which is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/obama-to-name-new-sec-chair-crowdfunding-may-finally-move-foward/">expected to go into effect by the end of the year</a>. That act will make it easier for non-accredited investors to make investments in non-public companies, while also enabling startups to publicize that they are raising funds.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve requested comment from AngeList and will update when we hear back.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> AngelList has confirmed the SEC has approved the network&#8217;s investment platform. </p>
<p>AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant explains: <em>It lets us know the legal boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in the space and will inform our future products, but right now we&#8217;re happy with the SecondMarket partnership &#8211; SM vets investors for sophistication, companies for background, and provides Broker-Dealer level protection and compliance.</p>
<p>The /Invest feature on AngelList is working well so far. We do curate the opportunities to those with a high-quality lead investor, and to date we&#8217;ve announced 7 fundings, 14 are closed or in closing, 18 are currently open for Accrediteds, adding about one per day. We&#8217;ve received over $6M in commitments in the last Quarter in 915 separate transactions. We have 12,000 Accrediteds on AngelList, and via our SecondMarket Partnership, can reach another 20,000.</p>
<p>Unlike others in the space, we don&#8217;t think we can pick the winners &#8211; rather, it&#8217;s a more open approach for any company with a high-quality lead investor. We also don&#8217;t view it as a money-maker for AngelList &#8211; more of a community service. We also think it makes sense to augment it with our base service of introducing high-quality companies to sophisticated investors (VCs, Seed Funds, Professional Angels) &#8211; we currently drive 500-700 of those introductions per week, and drive about $10M / month there.</p>
<p>Other updates &#8211; on the talent side, we&#8217;re adding 600 candidates per week, and doing 1,600 introductions per week now between talent and 3,300 recruiting startups.<br />

Some say we are losing our sense of narration and storytelling. It&#8217;s not this at all. We are just experiencing a shift that other civilizations have faced when the traditional means for storytelling transform to give a sense of the changing times facing society. That does not mean a rejection of the narrative form. The ancient Greeks developed a rich oral tradition for telling stories. Out of that they created a common language, which formed the foundation for fables, legends and myths. Now we see that data, shaped by software, creates a space to tell stories in new ways. Narrative methods to express our imagination will change as techniques emerge that allow us to use programming languages to carry on what we know for the next generations. Om Malik says it&#8217;s this sense of data storytelling that will become so important. Today, he explains, data is used as a blunt instrument. The ones that use data more effectively well remind of us how we relate to each other. Cloudera Co-Founder and Data Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher said on the Charlie Rose show earlier this month that it&#8217;s not that &#8220;numerical&#8221; imagination&#8221; is better than using &#8220;narrative&#8221; imagination. It&#8217;s just that now, for the first time in thousands of years, we need to think more about using data analytic methods for developing stories. For example, Hammerbacher is working as an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, developing a storage and data analysis infrastructure. Like Malik, Hammberbacher said it&#8217;s how we find ways to pair data that will give us insights. For instance, finding ways to integrate genetic databases and electronic health records that tell a story that both physicians and patients understand. Hammerbacher recounted a story to Rose about a lump that appeared on his chest. The doctor examined it and sent him to another doctor. Hammebacher asked the question: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to quantify what is in my body?&#8221; He followed by saying the amount of insight we get into a server at Facebook is greater than we have about our own bodies. The ones who can quantify our own human data and network it will give society new ways to explain who we are through dimensions we never imagined. Hammerbacher and Malik have views from different spaces across the information spectrum. But they]]></description>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/26/why-data-without-a-soul-is-meaningless/">Om Malik</a> says it&#8217;s this sense of data storytelling that will become so important. Today, he explains, data is used as a blunt instrument. The ones that use data more effectively well remind of us how we relate to each other.</p>
<p>Cloudera Co-Founder and Data Scientist Jeff Hammerbacher said on the <a target="_blank" href="http://cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/resources/library/aboutcloudera/jeff-hammerbacher-charlie-rose.html?cq_ck=1363978812938">Charlie Rose</a> show earlier this month that it&#8217;s not that &#8220;numerical&#8221; imagination&#8221; is better than using &#8220;narrative&#8221; imagination. It&#8217;s just that now, for the first time in thousands of years, we need to think more about using data analytic methods for developing stories.</p>
<p>For example, Hammerbacher is working as an assistant professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, developing a storage and data analysis infrastructure. Like Malik, Hammberbacher said it&#8217;s how we find ways to pair data that will give us insights. For instance, finding ways to integrate genetic databases and electronic health records that tell a story that both physicians and patients understand.</p>
<p>Hammerbacher recounted a story to Rose about a lump that appeared on his chest. The doctor examined it and sent him to another doctor. Hammebacher asked the question: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to quantify what is in my body?&#8221; He followed by saying the amount of insight we get into a server at Facebook is greater than we have about our own bodies. The ones who can quantify our own human data and network it will give society new ways to explain who we are through dimensions we never imagined.</p>
<p>Hammerbacher and Malik have views from different spaces across the information spectrum. But they both point to a new reality that will require us to think much differently about how we imagine our world and the data that is now far visible than ever before.</p>
