So the search giant is taking the bull by the horns and rolling out a new service to combat that: a calculator, called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.howtogomo.com/fullvalueofmobile">Full Value of Mobile</a>, that helps businesses that use Google&#8217;s mobile advertising services &#8212; specifically using AdWords &#8212; to measure how their mobile marketing translates into actual business, both online and offline.</p>
<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, Google&#8217;s calculator is launching on the same day that local listings service <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/yelp-revenue-estimator/">Yelp is releasing its own estimating tool</a> for small businesses to measure the impact that Yelp is having on their business. It&#8217;s like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport_bus_service">the old saying about buses</a>. </p>
<p>Google has already made some efforts in this space, for example by <a target="_blank" href="http://analytics.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/expanding-universal-analytics-into.html">extending AdWords analytics into mobile</a>, but as Johanna Werther, head of Mobile Ads Marketing, notes in a <a target="_blank" href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/the-full-value-of-mobile-new-calculator.html">blog post</a>, &#8220;with more work to be done to improve measurement tools, most marketers still account only for sales happening on a mobile site and aren’t seeing the full picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The calculator, she says, provides &#8220;simple equations and benchmarks&#8221; that speak to different aspects of a mobile marketing campaign. For example, how many people phone you as a result of an ad (using Google&#8217;s automatic dialling feature); and what impact is a cross-device campaign having versus one across a single platform? The metrics, in a sense, bring into context the many features that Google has been building out for the platform, and provide a way for businesses to better access those analytics. This is important for small businesses in particular, who may not have the budgets for larger campaigns and teams of people to do this work for them.</p>
<p>Google claims that the set-up for using the new calculator takes only about 30 minutes, and other metrics that are revealed incude total value, value per click, and ROI for a campaign. &#8220;You’ll also see how cost-effective your mobile CPAs are,&#8221; Werther notes. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/insync-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Insync logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.insynchq.com">Insync</a>, a startup offering an advanced, business-focused alternative to the Google Drive desktop client, is today taking the service out of a beta with a 1.0 release for Mac and Windows users. The updated client application includes a number of features not found in the earlier build (or in Google Drive itself, for that matter), including support for multiple Google accounts, selective sync, desktop notifications, support for external and network drives, built-in sharing, and more.</p>
<p>The company, based in Singapore and the Philippines, actually <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/30/insync-dropbox-revamp-free/">got its start as &#8220;Dropbox for Google users&#8221;</a> &#8211; a sort of proto-Google Drive back at a time when Drive was still just known as Google Docs. But when Google moved to launch its own Dropbox-like client with the Google Drive desktop app, Insync reincarnated itself by adding the missing features which the official client lacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the course of building this thing, what we discovered was that there was this huge group of users who wanted advanced features,&#8221; says co-founder and CEO <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/terencepua">Terence Pua</a>, who previously ran Friendster&#8217;s Philippines operations, before starting Insync back in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started asking users what they needed, and things that kept popping up were multiple account support, and being able to watch any folder outside of the Insync folder&#8217;s location. We kept wondering why these things were not being built, so we went ahead and built them,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/insync-a-google-drive-client-for-power-users-businesses-exits-beta-with-pro-features-pricing-plans/built-in-sharing-baked-into-windows-explorer-and-finder/" rel="attachment wp-att-785105"></a></p>
<p>Designed for power users of Google Drive, the client allows for other handy features like built-in sharing, which lets users right-click on folders or files to initiate the sharing process, plus other features that pro customers want like permissioning, better onboarding, selective syncing of folders and files, and more. And getting even geekier, Insync 1.0 has added symlink, junction and alias support. Pua explains that now, users can keep their folder hierarchy structure in place, instead of having to drag-and-drop files directly inside the Insync folder mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/insync-a-google-drive-client-for-power-users-businesses-exits-beta-with-pro-features-pricing-plans/sync-on-demand-incoming-share-notifications/" rel="attachment wp-att-785104"></a></p>
<p>The 1.0 release is available for Mac and Windows, while the Linux version is still at 0.9, but is expected to launch soon. Combined, Insync has &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of beta users across its supported platforms, around 40 percent of which are business customers on Google Apps.</p>
<p>As a part of today&#8217;s announcement, the company is also releasing its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insynchq.com/pricing">pricing plans</a>. The Pro plan, which offers full access to the features, is available for a one-time payment of $9.99. In a few weeks, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insynchq.com/pricing">business edition</a> will be available containing an admin dashboard and centralized billing, allowing I.T. to get a bird&#8217;s-eye view of a company&#8217;s Drive storage, and add or delete employees, for example. An enterprise version is also in the works which will support document audits, advanced search queries, and the ability to drill down to see usage on an employee-by-employee basis.</p>
<p>Pua explains that the bigger goal for the company isn&#8217;t about just being a Google Drive client. &#8220;Our vision, really, is to do more with cloud storage,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Google Drive &#8211; and even Google &#8211; is just a first step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s about syncing, whether it&#8217;s about backing up, whether it&#8217;s about different devices &#8211; you&#8217;ve got all this data out there and it&#8217;s hard to manage in one place,&#8221; Pua adds.</p>
<p>Insync raised $800,000 in angel funding in January 2011, and had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/14/insync-is-dropbox-for-google-users-special-offer-for-crunchbase-companies/">also raised</a> $300,000 in seed funding back in 2009. Investors include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman">Reid Hoffman</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/toivo-annus">Tovio Annus</a> (Skype co-founder), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joi-ito">Joi Ito</a> (Neoteny Labs), and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/santosh-jayaram">Santosh Jayaram</a> (formerly VP, Business Operations at Twitter).</p>
<p>Co-founded by Marte Soliza, Insync is now <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insynchq.com/about">a team of nine</a>, and currently hiring.</p>
<p>The new Insync release, version 1.0, is available for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.insynchq.com/">download here</a>.</p>

<p>The new tools for publishers are designed to help Pocket continue to capitalize on its ability to extend the life of content – something that content producers, especially on the web, are very interested in doing. When Twitter and Facebook are among your highest referrers, the lifespan of any specific article tends to be very brief: it&#8217;s published, it flickers briefly and then it&#8217;s crushed by a wave of &#8220;new,&#8221; which is the number one currency on social networks.</p>
<p>Pocket has recently shown that its platform can give <a target="_blank" href="http://getpocket.com/blog/2013/03/how-pocket-extends-the-life-of-a-story/">articles from major pubs a big boost when other channels have run out of steam</a>. It showed that a Verge article on the Surface Pro managed to spread out 80 percent of its readership over the course of six days, versus just two for the same on Twitter. For publishers, that looks mighty attractive, since it&#8217;s readership through a new channel that they likely wouldn&#8217;t have had elsewhere. The new publisher tools are designed to add even more value on the publisher side, with free tools that anyone can use via Pocket&#8217;s new web and mobile software developer tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always talked quite a bit about publishers and their needs,&#8221; Pocket Editorial Director Mark Armstrong explained in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been trying to understand how we could be helpful, frankly. There were a lot of things that we were learning about this as well, and one is that publishers have a lot of very diverse interest and needs. Some are focused on social, some on growing readerships, some on paywalls. We wanted to formalize the relationship with publishers, and it boiled down to that the very first step was that they wanted clarity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pocket says they know their service is changing the way readers consume content, but it was imperative to lay that out in a straightforward manner for publishers, so they could easily grasp the effect Pocket and save-for-later has on their audience and how their content is consumed. That led to the creation of the Publisher Tools, which include analytics that show how content is performing in Pocket, which articles are getting the most traction from a pure popularity perspective, which are better in terms of quality and attracting loyal readers, and which authors are among your top saved.</p>
<p>Pocket also now has a &#8220;Save to Pocket&#8221; button for websites to build into their page, much like the social share buttons that exist for Twitter and Facebook, and the option to add Pocket integration to mobile apps, too. Plus, it also <a title="Pocket Rolls Out New Site Subscription Partners: Is This A Better Way Forward For Mobile Magazines?" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/07/pocket-rolls-out-new-site-subscription-partners-is-this-a-better-way-forward-for-mobile-magazines/">offers site subscription</a> for those publishers who have introduced a paywall, and a new custom footer option that allows publishers to specify what should appear at the bottom of any article or video saved from their site.</p>
<p>The footer in particular is an interesting new addition. Pocket says that publishers can do whatever they want with it: direct users back to related content from their site; use it to promote their social media accounts; even direct people to newsletters or other forms of content digests that are potentially even competitive with Pocket itself. I asked if you could even theoretically display a banner ad, and Pocket said that it was completely up to publishers to determine what appears there. It&#8217;s a good faith gesture, with Pocket acknowledging that the content is most definitely the publisher&#8217;s, and giving them more influence over how it appears in Pocket&#8217;s service.</p>
<p>Pocket says its monetization plans are distinct from these publisher efforts, so the free tools it&#8217;s providing will remain so. Publishers are already seeing the value proposition, too; launch partners including GigaOM, WordPress, The Verge, Wired, Buzzfeed, Bloomberg Businessweek, USA Today and more. The ultimate aim for Pocket is to become as important a publication and sharing channel as Twitter and Facebook, but with a value proposition and role among readers that is complementary to, not competitive with, those media giants. The publisher program is a way to deal directly with publishers to help make that happen, and a very promising one, based on this inaugural version.</p>

<p>CamBoard Pico is German firm <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pmdtec.com/">pmdtec&#8217;s</a> next-generation gesture input reference device. We <a title="The CamBoard Pico Wants To Take On Leap Motion, Offers Full Depth Gesture Control In A Smaller Package" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/the-camboard-pico-wants-to-take-on-leap-motion-offers-full-depth-gesture-control-in-a-smaller-package/">showed you before</a> what it could potentially do to change the computer interface, and now there are a couple of new videos from the company showing how it&#8217;s working with middleware makers and what it can truly accomplish in practice in actual shipping products.</p>
<p>The gesture detection in these videos is impressive, and shows a solution that&#8217;s not only small enough to be incorporated into devices like notebooks, but also works at a sufficient distance that it&#8217;s actually usable, accurately, when you&#8217;re up close and working with said devices as you would normally.</p>
<p>Individual finger detection and the ability to use the CamBoard Pico tech to accomplish simple, practical things like switching between open apps. Unlike Kinect, it looks like you can use the CamBoard pico even from your standard typing position on a notebook computer, just by raising a finger while typing. That&#8217;s much, much more useful than gesture tech that requires a user to adjust themselves back from the screen, or even worse, stand up to interact with a computer, and much more likely to gain wide adoption, rather than acting as a sort of novelty.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/JRU41isG708?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>The second demo video, which shows pmdtec working with Metrilus middleware, demonstrates more the general gesture sort of control we&#8217;ve come to expect from Kinect and similar technologies, but again, the distance and flexibility are impressive. I&#8217;m excited to see what the forthcoming <a title="Leap Motion’s Michael Buckwald Lays Out His Vision For Gesture-Based Computer Interaction" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/12/leap-motion-michael-buckwald-demo/">Leap Motion controller</a> can accomplish when it ships later this year (it seems to offer similar functionality and working distance), but pmdtec&#8217;s goals and sales strategy are very different.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s targeting original design manufacturers (ODMs), who in term will sell through to OEMs. That means that together with its middleware partners, pmdtec can sell these things directly to computer manufacturers, meaning when you buy a future Acer, Asus or Sony laptop, it&#8217;ll come with accurate gesture recognition tech onboard if this product catches on. With these new practical demonstrations of how that might be of use even with current operating systems and interfaces, that&#8217;s a pretty exciting prospect.</p>

<p>Under proposals <a target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-263_en.htm">laid out today by EC VP Neelie Kroes</a>, every new home that will be built in Europe will be equipped for high-speed broadband. She also suggested a drastic reduction in the time it takes to get broadband building permits approved, with the maximum wait time capped at six months, but with the ideal being automatic approval.</p>
<p>The same will go for the building of new masts for wireless 4G services &#8212; something that could cause some controversy, considering the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/9533120.Phone_mast_protesters_ready_to_do_battle_again/">opposition</a> that has surrounded the building of radio masts for mobile services up to now in some places like the UK.</p>
<p>Part of the context for these proposals is that money that had been set aside in the European budget for improving broadband connectivity is disappearing amid ongoing economic problems in Europe. Between now and 2020, legislators are proposing cuts of €50-70 billion from the digital portion of the Connecting Europe Facility. &#8220;Savings have to be found in other ways or the networks will not be built,&#8221; a person close to Kroes writes in an email. &#8220;This regulation is the most efficient way to achieve up to €60 billion in savings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other is that cutting red tape, and making this a proposal ordered down by the EC, will potentially mean more harmonized implementations on the local level, both in terms of actual regulations but also in terms of how, for example, utilities like water and electric companies interface with broadband providers for service provisions. That would mostly benefit larger companies, like multinational telecoms operators or construction companies who may be involved in buildouts in more than one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;In most places, today&#8217;s rules hurt Europe&#8217;s competitiveness,&#8221; said Kroes in a press conference in Brussels earlier today.</p>
<p>Other proposals seem to speak more to demands from to smaller players in the broadband ecosystem as well. One key point, Kroes notes, is opening access to broadband infrastructure on &#8220;fair and reasonable terms and conditions, including price.&#8221; This would give competition advocates another battlefield on which to argue for fair prices for smaller startups to offer services alongside big incumbents. </p>
<p>&#8220;The proposals to reduce the costs of deployment of fibre networks are very welcome,&#8221; Tom Ruhan, chair of ECTA the European Competitive Telecommunications Association, noted in a statement. He says that more than 70% of all fibre-to-the-home investments in Europe are made by alternative operators, who &#8220;thus share the highest investment costs proportionally. Reducing those costs would speed up the deployment of open networks and the provision of competitive communication services to businesses and consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcements come ahead of a bigger piece of legislation, a <a target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-80_en.htm">10-point broadband plan</a>, which will be announced this summer and provide a blueprint for how Europe plans to achieve a single market for ICT. One big concern is how to get less developed European countries, as well as more remote and rural areas, up to speed with metropolitan centers in the biggest countries like the UK, France and Germany.</p>
<p>Europe has estimated that a 10% growth in high-speed broadband adoption could have a knock-on effect on GDP growth of up to 1.5%.</p>

It's a neat trick, and one that could help portable gadgets save battery life by not invoking the most battery-hungry element in their construction nearly as frequently.

It&#8217;s a neat trick, and one that could help portable gadgets save battery life by not invoking the most battery-hungry element in their construction nearly as frequently.</p>
<p>The patent also notes that the screen doesn&#8217;t have to be off for these no-look commands to work; a user could do things like swipe a finger in circle to change volume or tracks, for instance, even while a display is active. That adds new control options, but also makes it possible to both remove external buttons should a design benefit from that, and also make the device easier to use when in a pocket or clipped to an armband or waist during a workout.</p>
<p>While the display is inactive, the patent describes that it could use gestures that mirror the button press actions on current iPod and iPhone headphone remotes. So, a single click could play/pause, a double click could skip tracks, and a long press could call up Siri, for instance.</p>
<p>In terms of recognizing when touch is and is not wanted, the patent suggests implementing a special mode that would allow it to both keep the screen dark but also receive touch inputs. This might involve a way to activate a mode between a full lock and a completely on and active device, which can be selected specifically for when a user is commuting or using the device while working out, but disabled when there&#8217;s risk of accidental touch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting patent, and one which Apple has shown off as working with its previous iPod nano design, which essentially featured a square display and little else in terms of physical buttons. The trick might be making this work in such a way that it still completely eliminates any chance of accidental input – the lock screen concept is synonymous with touchscreen devices for a reason, after all.</p>
<p>Not activating the screen as much as possible is the key to prolonging device battery life, though, so it&#8217;s good to see Apple looking at ways to deal with that primary limiting factor. It&#8217;s no<a title="Yota To Mass Produce E-ink Phone In Singapore" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/19/yota-to-mass-produce-e-ink-phone-in-singapore/"> e-ink display built into the back of a smartphone</a>, but it&#8217;s something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/money-bag-dollar-sign.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="More retro clipart at http://www.clipartof.com/" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Another step along the long road of ICANN expanding the number of sanctioned top-level web domain names, so that TLDs such as .pepsi, .food and .app can join the usual suspects of .com, .org, .net and so on. ICANN has launched a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trademark-clearinghouse.com/">Trademark Clearing House</a> (TMCH) to create a &#8221;foundation mechanism for brands to protect their trademarks against potential infringement&#8221;. If you&#8217;re opening the Pandora&#8217;s box of allowing almost .anything to become a TLD &#8212; and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/iab-calls-on-icann-to-withdraw-controversial-plan-for-new-top-level-domains/">ICANN has been criticised for the entire endeavour</a> &#8211; creating and maintaining &#8220;a single database of validated trademarks&#8221; to provide a &#8220;rights protection mechanism&#8221; for tracking trademark ownership and claims was always going to be unavoidable.</p>
<p>ICANN started accepting applications from companies and organisations for customised or generic TLDs at the start of last year.  The full list of businesses that had applied was released in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/13/icann-applicants-for-new-tlds-revealed-the-full-list/">June</a>, with ICANN saying it would take it between nine and 12 months to consider the applications before the new TLDs can go live.</p>
<p>ICANN said the TMCH is aimed at helping to allay brands&#8217; concerns about how their trademarks can be protected when the new TLDs are launched. However brands will have to pay for the privilege of protecting what&#8217;s theirs: recording trademarks with the TMCH costs between $95 to $150 per year per trademark record per year &#8220;depending on the number of trademarks submitted and their registration period in the TMCH&#8221;.</p>
<p>This yearly fee buys brands two things: firstly the &#8220;pre-launch opportunity&#8221; to proactively register domain names which match their trademarks ahead of wider public availability of the new TLDs. And secondly, they get access to a trademark claims service – which will mean they receive a warning when anyone else registers domain names that match their marks.</p>
<p>Any trademark holder &#8212; private individual or company &#8212; can apply to register their marks with the TMCH. Only registered trademarks that are already owned by businesses may be recorded &#8212; so the service will not apply to generic TLDs (such as .food and .books) unless a company owns the term as a trademark.</p>
<p>The TMCH is operated by Deloitte. &#8220;Recording marks into the TMCH is the most effective way to ensure that IP is appropriately safeguarded across all of the new web extensions that will go live this year,” said Jan Corstens, Partner, Deloitte in a statement.</p>

But alas! The YC-backed company isn&#8217;t shoving wrist bands, smartwatches or pocket pedometers in the faces of its users. In fact, founder Richard Talens believes that the quantified self devices of today actually encourage the wrong strategy of &#8220;eat less, move more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Fitocracy has grown to host over one million users, which it announced this morning, by focusing on true progress through gamification. Talens explains that streaks, as seen with the Nike FuelBand (11 days making goal, for example) can be both motivational and demotivational. Rather than focusing on the number of days you can work out in a row, the focus should be on running a faster mile time or lifting heavier weight, aka progress.</p>
<p>This is how Fitocracy keeps its users in shape. Talens told TechCrunch that Fitocracy users are in the app for more than five hours a month, making them more engaged than users across any of the other social networks except Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;They come back seven days a week, even if they&#8217;re not working out, just because they&#8217;re so engrossed by the community,&#8221; said Talens. Speaking of community, Fitocracy has a very special new member this morning, in celebration of 1 million users.</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger will be partnering with the platform with his own challenge. The Challenge from Arnold will take 15 to 20 minutes, and will be centered around weight lifting (classic Arnold).</p>
<p>Fitocracy works by letting users provide challenges (sometimes to see who can run the fastest mile or lift the most weight), which provides the motivation for its large group of users. When you participate in a challenge, your activity is tracked and you&#8217;re rewarded for your progress with points.</p>

<p>With Arnold&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fitocracy.com/spark/">Spark Challenges</a>, those points will be converted into a new type of currency called &#8220;spark points.&#8221; Enough spark points per month gets the user a Super Elite Fire Badge.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Arnold had to say about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>From my first day of training, I&#8217;ve known the importance of counting reps to constantly improve. Then, my only technology was chalk and a chalkboard, but innovation has opened up endless possibilities to track health and fitness. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m excited to launch this challenge with Fitocracy, so that we can inspire others to find the joy in doing one more rep today than they did yesterday. We are starting small, with a 15 minute &#8220;Spark Challenge&#8221;, but we expect big results as people discover the power of tracking their health and fitness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though Fitocracy has had some big names on the platform, Arnold is far and away the most mainstream celebrity to join the fitness tracking network.</p>
<p>Fitocracy&#8217;s growth has been pretty incredible. The company boasted around 300,000 users when it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/fitocracy-finally-exits-private-beta-celebrates-with-a-new-ios-app/">launched out of beta</a> almost one year ago. Since then, it has launched an iOS app which has surely increased engagement, and grown to now serve over one million highly engaged users.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself, readers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lg-spotify.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="LG Spotify" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>No, Spotify has not just officially announced a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/130325/p22#a130325p22">reported</a> move into video services, but the music streaming startup is continuing to put itself into the same places where video is. Today, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/newsroom/contents/63379">Spotify announced with LG</a> that it would be integrating its premium, paid service on to a range of connected media devices from the consumer electronics giant. Devices will include Blu-ray home cinema systems, speakers and more, and they will start getting sold in April. To be clear, the LG deal will only cover music: Spotify has a catalog of some 20 million tracks that it offers across 26 countries in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and across Europe.</p>
<p>As with previous smart device deals &#8212; Spotify also has an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/blog/archives/2012/10/10/spotify-is-your-samsung-smart-tvs-new-best-friend/">agreement with Samsung, announced in October 2012</a>, to integrate into its smart TV content platform &#8212; the LG deal is geared towards driving more usage of Spotify&#8217;s premium service. For $9.99 per month, this lets users extend their Spotify listening from PC-only to other devices.</p>
<p>For Spotify, as more consumer electronics devices get linked up to the Internet, this creates an ever-expanding range of end points for its service, helping it to scale and find more paid subscribers. On the hardware makers&#8217; part, adding in already-popular services like Spotify helps them sell the idea of premium, connected consumer electronics to consumers. As with other peripheral device deals, LG consumers will get a one-month trial free. Other hardware deals include integrations with Roku, TiVo, Sonos, Onkyo, Logitech, Western Digital, Boxee and Ford and Volvo.</p>
<p>Included in the in initial wave of LG devices will be the company&#8217;s high-end speaker system, the catchily-named BH9530TW, as well as its Blu-ray media players. These already feature a long lineup of premium content including games, social media services like YouTube and Facebook, Netflix, and LOVEFiLM in the UK.</p>
<p>Asked about the reports that surfaced yesterday around a move into video and how they might relate to today&#8217;s news, a spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment to TechCrunch. However, <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57576124-93/is-spotify-gearing-up-to-take-on-netflix-not-soon/">comments made to CNET</a> prior to yesterday point to the company partnering with video providers before embarking on a standalone service itself, were it to move into video at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what the user experience would be where we would do that considerably better than anyone else,&#8221; Ek told the site. &#8220;If we did think we could make it better than YouTube or Vevo, then maybe. But it would seem easier to partner with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>With <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/11/with-spotify-web-expansion-coming-rdio-opens-its-web-based-music-streaming-service-in-7-new-markets-now-at-24/">would-be competitors like Rdio</a> also working on video (appropriately called Vdio), and providers like Apple (via iTunes) already providing both media, offering both would not be a stretch, even if for now Spotify remains firmly set on growing its platform as a place for music.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s our mission to make all the world’s music available instantly to everyone, everywhere, so we’re delighted to partner with LG to make our music service available on their smart media devices,&#8221; said Kate Opekar, director of hardware business development at Spotify, in a statement. &#8220;Spotify wants to be at the heart of the home entertainment experience, so it’s a natural fit to make our music service available on Blu-ray players and home cinema systems.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rev.com/">Rev.com,</a> a freelancer marketplace founded by early oDesk employees, is today announcing $4.5 million in Series A funding led by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/venky-ganesan-2">Venky Ganesan</a> of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/globespan-capital-partners">Globespan Capital Partners</a>. Also participating in the round were <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meritechcapital.com/about/team/craig_sherman">Craig Sherman</a> (former COO of <a target="_blank" href="http://ancestry.com/">Ancestry.com</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Ligon">Austin Ligon</a> (founder of CarMax). All three are now members of Rev.com&#8217;s board of directors, following the round which closed back in August 2012.</p>
<p>The company had actually been quietly operating under different branding for the past couple of years, but today it&#8217;s now publicly launching as &#8220;Rev.com.&#8221; It&#8217;s a name that co-founder and CEO Jason Chicola explains is meant to reflect the company&#8217;s focus on using technology to increase the turnaround speed on customers&#8217; projects.</p>
<p>Chicola says that the idea for Rev.com was inspired by his time at oDesk, a well-known freelancer marketplace. He started the site with co-founder Josh Breinlinger, also of oDesk, but who is no longer involved at Rev.com day-to-day. (He&#8217;s currently a venture partner at Sigma West, but still sits on Rev.com&#8217;s board.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw work-from-home as a huge trend &#8211; and we think it&#8217;s barely in its first inning &#8211; but we also saw ways to do it better,&#8221; says Chicola of the original inspiration. &#8220;What we observed is that the thing that makes work-from-home tough for businesses is that it&#8217;s really hard to manage workers who are far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Businesses have a tough time interacting with people who are overseas and in different time zones, he explains. There is also the hassle involved with having to select the best workers from a large pool of possible freelancers, leaving business customers unsure of what the final results will be.</p>
<p>To solve the former challenge, Rev.com steps in to act as middleman, managing the freelancer workers itself. And as for the latter, it focuses on screening workers in advance, and proofreading their projects upon completion. The company doesn&#8217;t let in everyone like many freelancer sites do, but instead only accepts around 10 percent of those who apply. Applicants have to pass a formal screening process involving tests indicative of the types of jobs Rev.com offers. A second pool of pre-qualified freelancers works then makes sure that the quality of these workers&#8217; efforts remain high by proofing and grading projects upon completion.</p>
<p>Today, the company is focused on two areas: audio transcriptions and translations. But it&#8217;s planning to grow its services lineup to include other popular work-from-home job types in the near future. Pricing for these services is displayed on Rev.com&#8217;s homepage. <em>(It&#8217;s $1 per min. transcription; 12 cents per word business translation; $33 per page certified translation)</em>. Rev.com takes its cut of each project, paying workers a little over half of what it charges businesses for the work performed.</p>
<p>Chicola explains that what makes Rev.com different from other freelancer marketplaces isn&#8217;t just the way its business is structured &#8211; it&#8217;s the focus on developing an online technology platform that helps freelancers speed up and streamline their processes. For example, the transcription product that Rev.com offers freelance workers will have special features designed for their needs, like ways to rewind the audio by a set number of seconds, tools to quickly denote each speaker&#8217;s name while transcribing, ways to create shortcuts for words that appear often or are complex terms that could be easily misspelled, and more.</p>
<p>Plus, he adds, &#8220;by having this transcription environment in our browser, the worker doesn&#8217;t have to download the file separately and upload it somewhere else&#8230;they can just play and go.&#8221; Chicola says its platform is about &#8220;half done,&#8221; but continuing to build out the product is one of the key things the new funding will be put towards.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/founded-by-early-odesk-employees-freelancer-marketplace-rev-com-raises-4-5-million-series-a/rev-homepage/" rel="attachment wp-att-785205"></a></p>
<p>In order to attract talent, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rev.com/">Rev.com</a> focuses on giving workers more jobs and helping them complete those jobs more quickly, though Chicola admits that Rev.com doesn&#8217;t pay the most on a per-job basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;On most sites that are out there, workers spend half their time or more looking for work &#8211; that&#8217;s time they&#8217;re not getting paid,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We designed our whole system to keep them busy. If we can keep them higher utilized, they can make more money per week than somewhere else.&#8221; He also notes that at Rev.com, the goal is also to offer freelancers a &#8220;nice&#8221; place to work, where they can make friends, have a good social environment, where they think it&#8217;s fair, and where they can get recognized for their work.</p>
<p>Today, Rev.com translators make on average around $1,000 per month part-time, while some of the busier workers make up to $4,000 per month. Transcriptionists tend to make around a quarter of that.</p>
<p>As noted above, Rev.com had quietly launched its services in 2010, beginning with translations, followed by transcriptions in late 2011. These were under different branding (<a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130115085718/http://www.foxtranscribe.com/">FoxTranscribe</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130220172819/http://www.foxtranslate.com/">FoxTranslate</a>). During this open beta of sorts, the company grew its user base to include a combined total of around 1,000 regular business customers, including Pfizer, VisaNow (global immigration), U.S. Bank, NYU, Land O&#8217; Lakes and Princeton University, as well as several government agencies, such as the National Park Service and U.S. Small Business Administration. On the transcription side in particular, 20 percent of its user base is the media, which uses it for transcribing interviews.</p>
<p>The company will continue its product development and hire additional engineers. Interested users can <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rev.com/">sign up here for Rev.com services</a>.</p>

Now the BBC &#8212; via its commercial operations of BBC World News TV and BBC.com &#8212; is also weighing in, with an international study out from BBC World News and BBC.com looking at how news is consumed today. It shows that the role that tablets are playing in TV usage &#8212; which we already knew was strong in the U.S. &#8212; is actually an international phenomenon. </p>
<p>The survey, BBC says, polled some 3,600 consumers across Australia, Singapore, India, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Poland, Germany, France and the U.S., the BBC, working with InSites Consulting, says this is the biggest study of its kind. The geographical reach complements the ongoing work from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/tablet-owners-read-more-news-longer-articles-report/">Pew Research Center</a> on digital media usage, which focuses on the U.S. only. </p>
<p>Specifically, the BBC notes that it found the following:</p>
<p>&#8211; Some 43% of tablet owners say that they watch more TV now than they did five years ago. 83% say they use tablets alongside TV. </p>
<p>&#8211; 25-34 year-old professionals are the biggest &#8220;news enthusiasts.&#8221; But that enthusiasm is still TV-first, other screens second, with tablets remaining distinctly in a secondary, not primary, role. Across all age groups, 42% of news consumption is still happening on TV, with laptops (29%), smartphones (18%) and tablets (10%) scoring in significance.</p>
<p>&#8211; Advertising may be appearing in different formats, but users are not surprised by that. The BBC found that &#8220;news audiences expect to see advertising nearly as much on mobile.&#8221; The exact figures: 79% tablet and 84% smartphone were unsurprised with ads compared to 87% on TV and 84%  online. But response times on mobile are still less good.  1 in 7 users said they responded to a mobile ad in the last four weeks with responses to TV and desktop are 1 in 5 and 1 in 4 respectively.</p>
<p>&#8211; TV remains first screen. &#8220;In breaking news situations, users turn to television as their primary and first device (42%), with the majority (66%) then turning to the internet to investigate stories further. Users rated national and international news of most importance (84%, 82%), closely followed by local news (79%). Financial and business news (61%) were more highly valued than news about sports (56%) and arts/entertainment news (43%).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Avid news consumers are hungry for information wherever they are and expect to stay in touch on all the devices they now own. There’s been speculation for years that mainstream uptake of smartphones, laptops and tablets will have a negative impact on television viewing, but this study has found that the four devices actually work well together, resulting in greater overall consumption rather than having a cannibalising effect,&#8221; said Jim Egan, CEO of BBC Global News Ltd, in a statement.</p>
<p>But while these conclusions are definitely interesting and will continue to shape what consumer tech services get rolled out, there are two provisos to note. </p>
<p>The first is that the BBC, like Twitter, Google and Nielsen, has a vested interest in showing how well these services work together. For the BBC, it runs a pretty extensive multi-screen operation. The BBC says its &#8220;24-hour news and information channel is available in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, and over 350 million households and 1.8 million hotel rooms. The channel&#8217;s content is also available on 151 cruise ships, 40 airlines and 23 mobile phone networks.&#8221; Maximizing advertising across that is a priority.</p>
<p>The second is that the BBC and InSites only talked to consumers that were deemed &#8220;high earners&#8221; and who already owned at least three of the devices in question: TV, smartphone, tablet and laptop. That effectively skews this survey and demonstrates that although there are some strong correlations, at this point in time, they are only true for a part of the population.</p>

<p>Chrapaty initially joined Nirvanix last November as chairwoman of the board when Khosla became lead investor in the company that is also funded by Intel Capital. She replaces Dru Borden, who will remain a part of the Nirvanix leadership team as senior vice president of planning &amp; development and remain as a board member Chrapaty will start her new job in April.</p>
<p>Chrapaty led Zynga&#8217;s build out of its infrastructure. While there, Zynga became AWS largest customer before she directed the build out of the company&#8217;s own gaming cloud.</p>
<p>Prior to Zynga, Chrapaty worked at Cisco, helping direct the development of its collaboration platform. Before Cisco, she worked at Microsoft where she said in an email she built out Windows Azure.</p>
<p>Nirvanix has earned a place in the market for its capability to store petabytes of data. Chrapaty said the company builds out storage infrastructures for the cloud, on-premise or hybrid. Its technology replaces more traditional technologies like magnetic tape and EMC/ NetApp boxes.</p>
<p>She said the company has an opportunity to build out an analytics stack. With that in mind, I asked if Nirvanix also plans to offer compute capabilities? She said she need to explore what an analytics stack would look like.</p>
<p>Chrapaty echoes what is becoming a roar. Fortune 1000 companies are embracing the cloud. And storage needs a home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing for Nirvanix but also AWS, Windows Azure, Box, Dropbox and the host of other companies looking to carve a niche in an increasingly commoditized storage market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dell_logo-avatar_200x200.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="dell_logo-avatar_200x200" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Carl Icahn has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/26/us-dell-offers-idUSBRE92N0L020130326?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">said</a> he is open to a partnership with Blackstone Group in a move that could make it easier for the rival investors to overtake Michael Dell&#8217;s $24.4 billion buyout bid for the company he founded, reports Reuters. This means Michael Dell could also potentially lose control of the PC maker he founded when he was 19.</p>
<p>This development comes a day after it was revealed <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/24/michael-dell-may-lose-control-of-pc-maker-after-two-competing-buyout-bids-emerge/">that Icahn and Blackstone had made separate bids </a>for Dell that valued the company at more than Michael Dell&#8217;s original offer, which was made in partnership with the Silver Lake Group. Negotiations could potentially go on for a month. Icahn, who owns a $1 billion stake in Dell, said on Monday that he has started discussions with Blackstone. The billionaire investor has offered $15 per share for 58 percent of Dell, while Blackstone said it can pay more than $14.25 per share. Michael Dell and the Silver Lake Group had offered $13.65 per share.</p>
<p>Michael Dell will meet up with Blackstone to discuss its bid, reported Reuters. The private equity group has already unsuccessfully tried to convince Oracle Corp president Mark Hurd to run Dell if it buys the company.</p>
<p>Several major investors <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2013/03/05/southeastern-asset-management-fires.html">have voiced their opposition to</a> Michael Dell and Silver Lake&#8217;s offer, claiming it undervalues the company. Southeastern Asset Management, Dell&#8217;s largest shareholder with 8.5 percent of shares outstanding and a vocal opponent of Michael Dell and Silver Lake&#8217;s offer, has said it is pleased with the terms of the new proposals offered by Icahn and Blackstone. Earlier this month Southeastern Asset asked Dell&#8217;s board of directors to disclose a full list of shareholders in a move to shore up its resistance to Michael Dell&#8217;s bid.</p>
<p>Another point of contention had been taking the company private. Both Icahn and Blackstone Group have said that their proposals would allow investors to retain publicly traded shares of Dell.</p>

<p>To make its estimate, Yelp separates customer leads from page views — those leads can include things like bookmarking a Yelp business listing, mapping directions to the business, placing a phone call from the Yelp app, purchasing a Yelp deal, making an OpenTable reservation, and more. (That&#8217;s information Yelp already provided in monthly reports.) Then, <a target="_blank" href="http://officialblog.yelp.com/2013/03/yelp_survey_findings.html">using a recent study from the Boston Consulting Group</a>, it estimates the average spend per customer in a given business category. (Businesses can also enter their own estimate for the value of a lead.) Finally, it takes the total leads and multiples it by the average value of each lead, giving businesses a sense of the total revenue generated by Yelp.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/yelp-revenue-estimator/revenue_estimator_screenshot/" rel="attachment wp-att-785328"></a></p>
<p>Explained this way, it seems pretty simple, but a Yelp spokesperson said it&#8217;s pulling from a lot of data to determine what a lead is, and it would be hard to pull off without all the user data that the company has collected. (They added that the company had 100 million unique visitors in January.) This feature will be available for free to all Yelp businesses, though it&#8217;s available initially for those in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>The spokesperson added that this is just the first of a number of simple tools that Yelp plans to offer small businesses for calculating return on investment on ad spending.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/06/yelp-misses-in-q4-with-a-net-loss-of-5-3m-while-revenues-grew-65-percent-to-41m/">its most recent earnings report</a>, Yelp <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp-ir.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=250809&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1782405&amp;highlight=">said</a> there are now 39,800 active local business accounts, a year-over-year increase of 68 percent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/199044.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="199044" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that a new bug has temporarily reset Like counts and comment threads on sites sporting its Like buttons and Comments plugin. Luckily, all the counts and comments should be restored soon as Facebook is finalizing a fix. Everything should go back to normal, though the problem may frighten some regarding how much the Internet relies on a centralized service.</p>
<p>At around 1pm PST today (March 25th), reports came in that some websites, in many cases those without the www URL prefix, had seen counts on their embedded Like buttons nuked. Also, some of these sites that use the Facebook Comments plugin saw comments threads on old pages and posts appear blank as if no comments were ever published. Bug reports were filed on Stack Overflow, some personal blogs, including <a target="_blank" href="http://minimaxir.com/2013/03/facebook-outage/">that of Max Woolf</a>, reported the issues, and we received several tips about the situation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you can see above, a popular TechCrunch article about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s wedding showed zero Likes or comments despite being heavily shared and commented on. After asking Facebook this afternoon whether the user-generated content and social sharing popularity scores were actually deleted or just failing to render properly, we&#8217;ve just received this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier today, a display bug made it appear as if the Like counts and comments on some sites had been reset. We are in the process of addressing the issue now, and sites should be displaying the correct number of Likes and comments soon. No Likes or comments were lost. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue follows <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/there-goes-the-neighborhood/">a more disastrous bug</a> in February that temporarily made websites using Facebook Connect appear broken and inaccessible to people logged in to the social network. Though it was quickly fixed, it was a reminder of just how much the web depends on Facebook these days. Then again, Facebook provides a free, generally reliable commenting and sharing service, and no software is perfect.</p>

		<title>Fingerprints Instead Of Credit Cards? YC-Backed PayTango Aims To Make Payments Work Through Biometrics</title>

It has so far defied the threat of mobile phones, and less plausibly, QR codes, among many other forms of payment. One YC-backed startup is betting that fingerprints and other forms of biometric identification may be the payment method of the future though. Called PayTango, they&#8217;re partnering with local universities to offer a quick and easy way for students to use their fingerprints to pay instead of credit cards. The four-person team is basically almost fresh out of Carnegie Mellon University. The co-founders, Brian Groudan, Kelly Lau-Kee, Umang Patel and Christian Reyes, graduating later this summer and have experience in human-computer interaction and information systems. They built an initial prototype with a fingerprint scanner and credit card reader with off-the-shelf parts for between $1,500 and $1,700. They&#8217;re bringing the costs down after iterating on it for 10 weeks and they have a working version of it at three locations on the Carnegie Mellon campus. &#8220;The very earliest product was just basic,&#8221; said CEO Umang Patel. &#8220;But it was a great product to get out there and users responded to it very early on.&#8221; The on-boarding process for users is really easy. They touch the fingerpad with their index and middle fingers and if they&#8217;re not in the system already, PayTango automatically detects that. It will ask them to swipe a card to associate with their fingerprints and then enter in their cell phone number. That sign-up process made it fast enough for 100 students to sign-up within four hours on campus. The reader plugs right into a merchant&#8217;s existing point-of-sale terminal and software. &#8220;We developed a way to integrate with the major systems and users don&#8217;t have to worry about these complex software integrations,&#8221; Patel said. Of course, like all point-of-sale offerings, PayTango faces a huge chicken-and-egg problem. How do you handle outbound sales to small and medium merchants? How do you make sure sales employees are trained well enough to use the hardware and software? It&#8217;s a fairly difficult model to scale. That&#8217;s why Patel said the company is focused on very dense networks of merchants and consumers &#8212; like the kind of you might see on a college campus where students repeatedly go to a few places for lunch. Gyms are another target market since the same small group of consumers have to quickly]]></description>

		<title>Crowd Surfing The Zombie Apocalypse, Or Why Spotify's TV Ad Is So Creepy We Made A Parody</title>

Today you showed off your first television commercial. It&#8217;s supposed to introduce the mainstream world to the wonder of listening to almost any song ever on demand. Yet with a useful product to sell and all the emotional resonance of music to lean on, the ad comes off vague, haunting, and devoid of soul. So much so I couldn&#8217;t help but parody it.</p>
<p>The commercial is called &#8220;For Music.&#8221; Your first sign that your ad agency Droga5 sh*t the bed was that there is essentially none. No music in the minute-long spot. Nothing to excite or remind us how thrilling music discovery can be. Just a long, dreary drone.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/E-wbGBc4BuY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>The visual language isn&#8217;t much better. An anonymized man crowdsurfing in the dark over an endless sea of throbbing humanity. It&#8217;s enough to trigger claustrophobic nightmares. Also, if you&#8217;ve ever had someone dropped on your head while you&#8217;re trying to watch your favorite band&#8217;s encore, you too will think of crowdsurfers as selfish distractions more than some symbol of liberty.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the hollow voice-over. &#8220;Why can a song change the world? Because music is a force, for good, for change, for whatever. It&#8217;s bigger than us. It lives inside us.&#8221; Seriously, Spotify? Your mission to democratize access to music deserves better than this trite nonsense.</p>
<p>And anyone seeing this ad as their first taste of Spotify deserves better, too. Congratulations, you didn&#8217;t trot out a geeky feature list. But perhaps communicating that you can search for any song and listen to it in full for free would have piqued people&#8217;s interest a little better. You&#8217;re not Facebook, and you don&#8217;t get to have a weird, artsy <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/toilets-are-just-like-facebook-a-nsfw-video-parody-of-facebooks-chair-ad/">&#8220;Chairs are like Facebook&#8221;</a> commercial. Many people have no idea what Spotify is. And I&#8217;d bet that after watching your ad tonight during The Voice or whenever else, they still won&#8217;t, other than that you have something to do with music.</p>
<p>Or maybe zombies. That&#8217;s all I could think about while watching &#8220;For Music.&#8221; Droga5 has produced memorable <a target="_blank" href="http://www.droga5.com/#/work/puma/lift/pumaliftspot">spots for Puma</a>, and even made <a target="_blank" href="http://www.droga5.com/#/work/prudential/bringchallenges/prusunrise">Prudential</a> insurance seem inspiring, so this is atypically terrible. The two additional commercials it made for you, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HRMF1HXIb0&amp;feature=youtu.be">&#8220;Her Song&#8221;</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwd3aCXYncM&amp;feature=youtu.be">&#8220;Getting Weird,&#8221;</a> are only little stronger. Still too subtle and lacking emotion, but at least they don&#8217;t conjure visions of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Which is why I made this parody. Think of it as the internal monologue of what someone unfamiliar with Spotify might assume &#8220;For Music&#8221; was about. Again, this criticism comes from a place of love. Maybe next time an Internet company makes their television debut, they&#8217;ll keep it simple. Just tug our heartstrings and show us what you solve.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-5-25-39-am.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-22 at 5.25.39 AM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Once unfathomably expensive, thanks to scientific and technological advances, the cost of genome sequencing for your average Joe is dropping fast on its way to a big, historical benchmark: The $1,000 genome. We&#8217;re not quite there, but we&#8217;re getting close. This is exciting for a host of reasons, but particularly because it has the chance to usher in an era of personalized medicine, in which it will be far easier to discover if we have a genetic predisposition to cancer, Diabetes, and so on.</p>
<p>Companies <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/11/23andnotme/">like 23andMe</a> are moving towards full-genome sequencing, while some 2,000 sequencing companies are already there. Yet, there&#8217;s a problem. These companies churn out piles of sequenced genomic data, but that data is still too complex for downstream research and clinicians to use. The number is projected to reach 8,000 sequencers by 2015, which means that the amount of valuable genomic data &#8220;hitting the lab floor&#8221; (so to speak) will only continue to grow.</p>
<p>This is where <a target="_blank" href="http://www.binatechnologies.com/">Bina Technologies</a> comes in. Founded in 2011 by a group of Ph.Ds, big data junkies and bioinformaticians from Stanford and University of California Berkeley, Bina picks up and analyzes this genomic data that has been, until now, almost unusable. Through Bina, research universities, pharmaceutical companies and clinicians can get access to data that focuses on the rare variants in our genetics &#8212; in other words, those that cause our predispositions to cancer, newborn disorders, down syndrom, sickle cell, and so on.</p>
<p>Through the ability to better parse and make use of this data, the idea is that these downstream players can then facilitate significant improvements in patient care, treatment and, really, basic understanding of how the body works via insights at the molecular level.</p>
<p>Bina has previously raised a round of seed funding from a handful of Silicon Valley angels, including Bobby Yazdani (an investor in Dropbox, Google, Klout, Kissmetrics, Salesforce and others) and Farzad Naimi, and today the company announced that it is adding $6.25 million to its coffers in a Series B round led by Sierra Ventures. As part of the round, Tim Guleri from Sierra will be joining the startup&#8217;s board of directors. </p>
<p>With its new funding Bina plans to triple its headcount, half on the business side and half on the engineering side. Since the company&#8217;s official launch in February, they&#8217;ve started to see some traction, and the founders hope that the new funding will allow them to really begin turning those years of R&amp;D into applications for the real world. </p>
<p>To get a sense of Bina&#8217;s applications, here are a few examples. As a part of its new financing, Bina announced a new partner in Liz Worthey at the Medical Center of Wisconsin, who focuses on newborn whole genome sequencing in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In the next few years, Worthey and team hope to begin sequencing every baby born in the medical center, analyzing that data using Bina. </p>
<p>The Stanford Genetics Department, led by Dr. Michael Snyder, was originally piloting Bina&#8217;s platform, but has since become a formal customer, doing large-scale genetic analysis and research. Snyder used the Bina platform to analyze several hundred whole human genomes in less than 5 hours &#8212; something that has traditionally taken several days (or weeks) to do. </p>
<p>In each instance, both Snyder and Worthey said that they began using this technology because it offers scalability alongside on-premise security, which is interesting given that most of the other players in this space are pure in their cloud-focus. Bina opts for the hybrid approach. It seems that, for the clinical market, that security is a priority (as it should be), and cloud solutions aren&#8217;t yet seen as being able to provide that level of security. Whether that&#8217;s true or not for all sectors remains to be seen (AWS would certainly beg to differ), it seems to be the prevailing mentality in healthcare.</p>
<p>The $15 billion genomic research industry is on the verge of some enormous changes and as sequencing solutions begin to pump out more and more genetic information, it would seem that ther will be increasing demand for scalable genomic analysis. But not just any old Big Data port will do, it has to be vertical-specific. Technologies like this take years to develop, but in the long-run they could have a big impact on our own health &#8212; and medicine as a whole.</p>

<p>Great! There&#8217;s a new BB10 device launching by the end of the year. How&#8217;s the Z10 doing, Mr. Heins?</p>
<p>The Z10, the current standard-bearer in BlackBerry&#8217;s army, launched in Europe and Canada in early February. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/Rogers-confirms-record-breaking-BlackBerry-Z10-launch_id39563">Rogers said</a> it was the most successful BlackBerry launch ever. But then, just over a month later, Rogers, along with Bell and Virgin, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.berryreview.com/2013/03/18/rogers-bell-and-virgin-drop-blackberry-z10-price-to-99-99-on-a-3-year-term/">cut $40 off the Z10&#8242;s price</a>, making it just $99 &#8212; the same price as the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>The phone just hit AT&amp;T in the States. It launches on Verizon and T-Mobile this week. It&#8217;s $199 from all three providers.</p>
<p>But wait. Don&#8217;t buy the Z10. Didn&#8217;t you hear the CEO? There&#8217;s an exciting new one a few months away!</p>
<p>I want to believe in you, BlackBerry. One year ago Friday, I wrote &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/its-time-to-believe-in-rim-and-the-blackberry-again/">It&#8217;s Time To Believe In RIM And The BlackBerry Again</a>.&#8221; People said I was crazy. <a target="_blank" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/03/30/time-to-believe">Gruber filed the post away</a> for claim chowder. But here you are, a year later, the Z10 actually made it to market and it&#8217;s a quality device. There are 100,000 apps in BB10&#8242;s App World with more additions each week. But you&#8217;re killing me, Smalls.</p>
<p>Talk about your current devices, Heins. Keep the focus on the Z10 and not-yet-launched Q10. They&#8217;re actually quality handsets and BlackBerry should be very proud.</p>
<p>Upon reading CNET&#8217;s article, our Canada-based reporter, Darrell Etherington, said today that his Canadian rage and sadness are all mixed together in a confusing yet delicious soup (I think that means he&#8217;s disappointed).</p>
<p>The first rule they teach you in Consumer Electronics 101 is &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about a future product until your current device is available.&#8221; The Z10 isn&#8217;t fully available until tomorrow! The QWERTY-packing Q10 won&#8217;t hit U.S. carriers for a couple of months! And you&#8217;re already talking about future flagship devices? Settle down and concentrate on the present.</p>
<p>At this point, consumers understand that their cell phones will be outdated within a few months. This is especially true in the Android world where HTC, Samsung and Motorola constantly trump one another. But the accepted churn is slower, more methodical when there&#8217;s one only manufacturer involved. Like with Apple.</p>
<p>There is one iPhone a year. When you buy an iPhone on Day One, it&#8217;s pretty well accepted that you&#8217;ll have the best iPhone for a year. That&#8217;s a superficial but valuable feeling and an advantage of the Z10 until this CNET interview.</p>
<p>Now, BlackBerry is asking its remaining fans to not only take a chance on an unproven platform but do so knowing that their device, which they likely purchased with a 2- or 3-year contract, will likely be outdated by the end of the year.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re on the subject of doing things wrong, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/03/23/blackberry-real-time-marketing/">this Forbes report</a>, the one about full screen takeovers, better not be accurate. You&#8217;re not going to renew any friendships by annoying people with full-screen adverts. You&#8217;re going to piss people off.</p>
<p>The BlackBerry of 2013 is very different from the Research in Motion of 2012. There&#8217;s life in the system. BlackBerry feels like a scrappy, young fighter instead of a former champion now overweight and out-of-shape. Research in Motion is dead and the young, and seemingly inexperienced BlackBerry has taken its place. I still believe the company can recover and find some level of success. But only if they throw all their weight behind the Z10 and stay quiet about future devices.</p>

His Internet connection was on the fritz, and he had a <em>huge</em> project due the next morning. He'd called his ISP, and they were no help. As his only friend that, as he said, "knew computers and stuff"*, I was bound by International Homie Law to fix his crap.

His Internet connection was on the fritz, and he had a <em>huge</em> project due the next morning. He&#8217;d called his ISP, and they were no help. As his only friend that, as he said, &#8220;knew computers and stuff&#8221;*, I was bound by International Homie Law to fix his crap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve reset your modem, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, man — Comcast had me do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You reset your router, too, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s still broken!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be over in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>I arrive at his house a bit later, and have him point me toward his networking gear. It&#8217;s stuffed behind the TV in his living room, as it&#8217;s the only place in his apartment with a functioning coax cable coming out of the wall.</p>
<p>I ask him to reset his modem again. He reaches over and unplugs his modem. So far, so good.</p>
<p>I ask him to reset his router again. He reaches over and unplugs his roommate&#8217;s AppleTV.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<hr />
<p>Every geek has a story (or 10) like this one. The Amazing Jellybean, an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/68406921/the-amazing-jellybean">ongoing Kickstarter project</a>, wants to make them a little less common.</p>
<p>The Amazing Jellybean is, at its core, a power switch. But it&#8217;s a power switch with smarts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You see, the modem/router reset dance is a bit more complicated than it probably should be. Unplug both. Wait 60 seconds. Plug in modem. Wait 60 seconds. Plug in router. Wait 60 seconds. That&#8217;s 180+ seconds! Nicholas Cage could have stolen your car like <em>three times</em> by then.</p>
<p>The Amazing Jellybean (a name which I am starting to feel ridiculous typing) handles all that with a single button push. Push the button, walk away. It&#8217;ll kill both the modem and the router, then bring them back online in the right order and with enough time in between for a proper boot sequence.</p>
<p>That alone makes it a pretty killer product to get for, say, your mom. Or your uncle. Or that one friend who has <em>no idea</em> how he keeps getting spyware from all of the <em>totally</em> legit sites he browses on his curiously sticky Dell. Cough.</p>
<p>But you, <em>you</em> don&#8217;t need this, right? You&#8217;re a titan of technology! You don&#8217;t nee no stinkin&#8217; box rebooting your modem for you! Oh, did I mention it has Bluetooth connectivity so you can reset your broken connection without getting out of your chair to battle dust bunnies? Yeah, that&#8217;s what sold me on it, too.</p>
<p>Is it a more of a band-aid than a permanent solution to a bigger problem? Sure — but it&#8217;s a problem that has been lurkin&#8217; around consumer grade networking gear for <em>decades</em> now. It&#8217;s probably not gonna disappear anytime soon.</p>
<p>As for why it&#8217;s shaped like a Jellybean? I have absolutely no idea.</p>

<p>[* Pro tip: When a conversation starts with "Hey, you know computers and stuff, right?", the <em>only</em> correct answer is a straight-faced "What's a computer?"]</p>
