				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/thehunt-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="thehunt-logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehunt.com/">The Hunt</a>, a site that helps you find items to buy from photos posted on Pinterest, Instagram, Tumblr, and elsewhere, is today announcing $700,000 in additional funding, on top of the $2 million it had previously raised from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/javelin-venture-partners">Javelin Venture Partners</a> and others.

<p>Reportedly, the site has already attracted a handful of half a dozen &#8220;celeb&#8221; users, including a few TV actresses, as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://TheHunt.com/ChristinaMilian">Christina Milian</a>, and others which the company is not yet disclosing. The interest from this group, to some extent, prompted the follow-on investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started talking to them, they immediately &#8211; in particular, Ashton &#8211; got how we were very different from all other curation sites and all other fashion tech startups,&#8221; explains Tim Weingarten, co-founder and CEO of The Hunt. &#8220;And once you get one or two of these [celebs] in, the word spreads,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The draw for the service, for those unfamiliar, is that it helps connect the images being shared across the web and social media, to products people can actually buy. For celebrities and other well-known fashionistas, The Hunt offers them a new way to engagement with their fans or audience.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/crowdsourced-shopping-site-the-hunt-raises-additional-700k-from-ashton-kutcher-other-high-profile-investors/thehunt-homepage/" rel="attachment wp-att-799553"></a></p>
<p>The bigger picture, however, is that The Hunt makes online shopping a more directed, active experience. While today&#8217;s retailers are only now slowly experimenting with solutions to track and convert their younger, social, photo-sharing user base to paying customers, The Hunt allows these individuals to take matters into their own hands. After joining the site, you can post a photo of an item you like, including those from websites you&#8217;ve visited, plus you can connect to Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest to import your likes and posts.</p>
<p>Then, to start a &#8220;Hunt,&#8221; you simply click on the image of the item you liked, and fill out some additional information.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/crowdsourced-shopping-site-the-hunt-raises-additional-700k-from-ashton-kutcher-other-high-profile-investors/the-hunt/" rel="attachment wp-att-798938"></a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting here is that The Hunt isn&#8217;t simply an image-matching algorithm at play. Instead, users can specify that they want a look that&#8217;s &#8220;similar to this,&#8221; &#8220;this look for less,&#8221; &#8220;what goes with this,&#8221; or even &#8220;this exactly.&#8221; They can also specify the max they want to spend, and which categories should be &#8220;hunted&#8221; in to find other options.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehunt.com/">The Hunt</a> relies on an active community of fashionistas who solve the quests others post. In January, the company said that around 20 percent of its user base solved hunts, and that ratio has remained the same as the startup has grown over these first few months. Weingarten says the draw for this crowd of problem solvers is that this is something they do as a hobby anyway, and now through the service they&#8217;re surrounded by others like them, while also being able to track how well they&#8217;re doing with their styling suggestions through built-in feedback mechanisms like the &#8220;gem&#8221; button (a favoriting function), or the ability to track when a hunter marks their hunt as solved by clicking &#8220;Perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weingarten also notes that, at present, clicks from The Hunt are converting to purchases on e-commerce destinations at around 1.5 to 2 percent &#8211; an increase from the typical conversion rates of somewhere in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 percent that social media, in general, drives.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/crowdsourced-shopping-site-the-hunt-raises-additional-700k-from-ashton-kutcher-other-high-profile-investors/thehunt-items/" rel="attachment wp-att-799552"></a></p>
<p>The majority of the sites&#8217; users are simply in search of a favorite look for less. This intent to purchase is an area The Hunt could later capitalize on by working with merchants and e-tailers more directly to address.</p>
<p>Prior to its official launch, the startup had generated over 65,000 active members who spent an average of 24 minutes on the site per day. Today, the company says that number has grown to over 200,000, and it is now steadily adding 50,000 new members each week. Users are still spending roughly the same amount of time-on-site as before, at 25 minutes per session. The Hunt is also now seeing 1 million monthly uniques.</p>
<p>In January, members had found 115,000 products from over 10,000 unique stores, leading to 250,000 e-commerce referrals. Now, The Hunt says its members have found over 200,000 products. These tend to be items in the women&#8217;s fashion space for now, but the company wants to expand further into decor, beauty, and men&#8217;s fashion going forward.</p>
<p>The immediate plan for the funding is to grow the team of nine by adding a handful more engineers (iOS and web), and to continue product develop. This quarter, The Hunt will ship an iPhone application, which will allow users to snap photos on the go of either street style on in-store inspiration. In the meantime, interested shoppers can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thehunt.com/">sign up to start hunting try here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/mercedes-benz_11.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Mercedes-Benz_11" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot lately of car companies sidling up the technology world and vice versa. Consider Ford&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/07/ford-launches-open-developer-program-to-let-mobile-apps-interface-with-its-cars/">Open Developer Program</a> for instance. But today, three big companies get involved in startups, one of them being the huge Mercedes-Benz. It, along with industrial giant Bosch and insurance company HDI, are partnering with tech accelerator <a target="_blank" href="http://www.startupbootcamp.org/">Startupbootcamp</a> in Berlin to create a new kind of accelerator vehicle called SBC2go. </p>
<p>This new project will support a selection of start-ups in a 3 month program open to any startup team globally. Ten teams will be selected and given €15,000 investment, free office space and support and access to a global network of mentors. Given the nature of the partners, the program focus areas are Mobility, Connectivity, and Big Data. The idea, they say, is to tap into the innovation driven by early stage, nimble start-ups which are normally below the radar of global companies.</p>
<p>With Mercedes-Benz, Daimler has a number of initiatives already such as the car sharing service car2go which has over 7,000 vehicles in 18 cities on the road in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Spennemann from Daimler lab and Mercedes-Benz says partnering with Startupbootcamp Berlin will &#8220;accelerate our access to innovation and will plug us into an impressive community of alumni, mentors and investors. At the same time we support start-ups in developing business ideas and increase their market value.  Due to our global presence we can open doors to new markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>HDI is part of the Talanx Group, one of the major insurance groups in Germany and Europe with premium income of €26.7 billion (2012) and more than 22,000 employees. Its interest in the project stems from its stake in insurance concepts based on telematics &#8211; so think cars, insurance and big data and you&#8217;ll get the drift. Gerhard Frieg there says &#8220;Mobility, connectivity and big data are a top priority in this environment and that’s why we’re partnering with Startupbootcamp.”</p>
<p>Robert Bosch Venture Capital has invested in 14 start-ups since it was established in 2008 and Bosch itself has invested about €50 billion in its own research and development over the last 20 years. As you can imagine SBC2go is a little more affordable.</p>
<p>Dr. Claus Schmidt there will partner on the programme. He says software development for the interconnection of devices and systems is now a &#8220;focal point of research and advanced engineering work at Bosch. The internet of things and services gives rise to a large number of new business models, which will form a network of extremely diverse services. Bosch intends to exploit this potential for growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Startupbootcamp Berlin is led by Alex Farcet, who co-founded Startupbootcamp and launched its initial program in Copenhagen in 2010. Farcet says part of the deal will be do do with the huge global reach of these companies: &#8220;This is a game changer for the Berlin program. We now have the resources and global reach to have an impact on innovation in the fields of Connectivity, Mobility and Big Data. Collectively Mercedes-Benz, HDI and Bosch have well over 10,000,000 likes on Facebook, and they have passionate followers who care deeply about their products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Applications for Startupbootcamp Berlin are open until June 2, 2013. Start-up teams can apply <a target="_blank" href="http://www.startupbootcamp.org">here</a> and the program runs from August to October and concludes with an Investor Demo Day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ryerson-atd.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="ryerson-atd" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Microsoft Windows Phone chief Terry Myerson took the stage at the D: Dive Into Mobile conference this morning, and wanted to make it very clear that he sees Windows Phone a little differently than others might.</p>
<p>Given that Windows Phone is still an underdog when it comes to the mobile OS arms race, it&#8217;s not exactly a surprise to hear Myerson characterize the WP team as a scrappy (albeit &#8220;incredibly well-funded&#8221;) startup operating within Microsoft &#8212; especially since Myerson himself helmed a startup that was ultimately acquired.</p>
<p>As such, there are certain places where Windows Phone is performing admirably (Fried points to recent reports that Windows Phone is outselling Apple&#8217;s iPhone in certain markets) and Myerson says Microsoft is keen to capitalize on those hotspots where they can. That&#8217;s not to say that Microsoft isn&#8217;t committed to making a splash in the United States where Windows Phone hasn&#8217;t been able to move the needle very much, but Microsoft seems eager to strike wherever those potentially fruitful opportunities arise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to be successful somewhere before we can be successful everywhere,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked by ATD&#8217;s Ina Fried about where Microsoft sees opportunities to go after the competition, Myerson noted that Windows Phone is meant to focus on the consumer, and hesitantly poked at some of Microsoft&#8217;s more prominent rivals. &#8220;With Apple I sense a lack of urgency,&#8221; he said before jabbing at the latest version of iOS and the 5th row of apps and referring to Android as &#8220;kind of a mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Windows Phone&#8217;s success is just as dependent on the hardware as it is on the OS that runs on it, and Myerson talked up the sort of measured approach that Microsoft has been sticking to on that front.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not necessarily going out and pushing for lots and lots of OEMs, he noted, adding that watching manufacturers like Nokia, HTC, and Huawei find success with their Windows Phones is what&#8217;s &#8220;really important right now.&#8221; Even so, rumors of even more Microsoft-crafted hardware in the pipeline (think a smartphone or a wrist-worn computing device) continue to make the rounds. Myerson was quick to downplay the notion that Microsoft would cobble together a smartphone of its own by pointing out that Microsoft would have to provide a consumer experience that current OEM partners couldn&#8217;t. That said, one could look at the Surface as a strong example of Microsoft doing just that, so I wouldn&#8217;t rule out a Microsoft smartphone entirely.</p>

The round was led by Fairhaven Capital, and included participation from existing investors SoftBank Capital, RRE Ventures, Aol Ventures and Betaworks, as well as new investors kbs+ Ventures and Rand Capital Corporation. The company says it plans to use the funding to expand upon its current product lineup, and expand its reach through partnerships. Today, SocialFlow offers two key tools known as Cadence and Crescendo. The former helps businesses manage the messages they tweet or post to Facebook, using algorithms that try to figure out when the social audience would be most receptive to that message&#8217;s content. It can then automatically post that message on the company&#8217;s behalf, and proceed to measure message conversions and clicks. Meanwhile, the latter product, Crescendo, was introduced last summer, taking that same audience measurement technology in order to help a brand with its ad buys &#8211; that is, which messages should it pay to promote on Twitter, for example. The company now has solid traction in the enterprise, where brands like Walmart, Pepsi, Burberry and others are among the over 70 enterprise customers who have adopted SocialFlow&#8217;s technology. Its customers operate in a number of industries as well, including retail, automotive, consumer products, hospitality and more. Six of the ten largest media companies are actively using Cadence, the company notes. New York City-based SocialFlow had previously come out of betaworks, and raised a $7 million Series A in spring 2011. At the time of the funding Twitter platform lead Ryan Sarver had praised the company as &#8220;exactly what we want to see out of the [Twitter] ecosystem,&#8221; saying that SocialFlow was building &#8220;a real business.&#8221; The funding news and expansion plans follows a time when SocialFlow competitors have been bought up by larger companies, including Salesforce&#8217;s acquisition of Buddy Media last summer for $689 million, and Oracle&#8217;s acquisition of Vitrue for $300 million. Pointedly, SocialFlow declined to discussion its own valuation, in light of the new funding. However, the company would confirm that its revenue is in the &#8220;low seven figures.&#8221; Now a team of 32, SocialFlow plans to add 12 new hires in sales and marketing]]></description>

Google today is <a target="_blank" href="http://googleretail.blogspot.co.uk/">releasing</a> a report it compiled in partnership with Compete to show how that is playing out in one market in particular, the U.S. It shows that while carriers may still hold the key to making a call or getting online with a smartphone, when it comes to buying one, carriers are taking a backseat as users seek out brands and best prices first, with carriers as the follow-up to that.</p>
<p>Here is the graphic from Google&#8217;s report that spells out how the retail landscape is changing:<br />
</p>
<p>Google notes that while we are still seeing some competition among handsets, it&#8217;s on the decline. Some 66% of users surveyed in March 2013 noted that they considered 2 or more handsets when buying their last device in the past year. That number, however, is down by 9% over 2011.</p>
<p>This speaks to the continuing consolidation we&#8217;re seeing in overall smartphone rankings, where brands like Samsung and Apple increasingly dominate in sales, to the detriment of companies like Nokia, HTC, RIM and others. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/01/android-and-windows-phone-gain-blackberry-loses-in-smartphone-os-share-according-to-kantar/">These figures</a> out earlier this month from Kantar Worldpanel put iOS and Android sales at nearly 93% of all smartphone sales in the U.S. in the last three months, with Samsung very much the biggest of the Android OEMs.)</p>
<p>But look over to the next graphic and you can see quite the opposite trend. When it comes to considering carriers, some 47% of users are these days considering more than one, with that number up by 134%: in other words, carriers are gradually losing their brand grip. And I&#8217;d hazard to guess that carriers come into the equation with a heavy price rider: with those offering the best deals getting more attention if a user isn&#8217;t locked into a plan elsewhere. That&#8217;s further demonstrated by the fact that these days, 30% of consumers switch carriers when they&#8217;re upgrading, a rise of 39%.</p>
<p>Although a lot of people made a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/09/verizon-iphone-data/">big deal</a> about users switching to Verizon when it finally started to carry the iPhone in 2011, after years of exclusivity on AT&amp;T&#8217;s (less good quality, they argued) network, the Google/Compete numbers seem to tell a slightly different story: It found that one-third of buyers select phones first, and carriers second, with 25% of those purchasing devices in the last year doing so because they wanted the &#8220;latest and greatest.&#8221; So much for network quality. Meanwhile, upgrade eligibility, which ties users in to signing with the same carrier, only motivated 9% of purchases.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are other signs that many of the stronger controls by carriers are on the wane. T-Mobile&#8217;s big marketing push in the U.S. as the &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/t-mobile-gets-its-un-carrier-iphone-assault-off-to-a-running-start-with-579k-new-users-in-q1/">Un-carrier</a>&#8221; plays testament to that, as do services like Three in the UK, which lets users sign up to smartphone tariffs on rolling, monthly contracts. (Yes, you can argue <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/t-mobiles-uncarrier-pricing-isnt-so-different-from-the-contract-devil-you-already-know/">as Darrell has</a> that these are more marketing tactics, with the user getting billed one way or the other; but all the same tariffs that further decouple phone services from contracts are on the rise.)</p>
<p>Among its other findings &#8212; unsurprisingly highlighted by a company that makes the bulk of its revenues from digital advertising &#8212; Google said it found that 80% of all mobile phone shoppers research for their handsets online, although the majority (61%) of sales are still completed in physical stores, with another 4% on the phone. It also found that the trend for multi-screen content consumption is also being echoed in mobile device shopping habits: the number of those using mobile handsets and tablets to look up info about mobile phones has tripled; with one-third taking that browsing into stores themselves. That&#8217;s also seen a rise in video usage too, with those browsing for phones online including 30 minutes or more of video-watching as part of their research.</p>
<p>As with other kinds of technology, younger demographics are proving to be the least price sensitive: 62% of 18-34 year-olds spent over $100 on phone purchases last year, Google notes.</p>
<p>Google will be publishing the full report on its <a target="_blank" href="http://googleretail.blogspot.co.uk/">retail blog</a> later today.</p>

<p>As of today, Snapchat sees a whopping 150 million images shared each day &#8212; that&#8217;s up from the 60 million images sent as of this past February.</p>
<p>That means plenty of people have taken to the service, but who are they? AllThingsD&#8217;s Liz Gannes pressed Spiegel on who exactly uses Snapchat, and as you&#8217;d expect much of Snapchat&#8217;s growth is thanks to adoption from the younger set. There&#8217;s a so-called &#8220;dead spot&#8221; when it comes to people in their 30s and 40s, but Spiegel thinks that the service&#8217;s value isn&#8217;t just limited to kids and teens &#8212; as he puts it, Snapchat makes for more &#8220;emotional content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spiegel is naturally very bullish on Snapchat&#8217;s future &#8212; while he artfully dodged a question from Gannes about what the company will do next, he did note that the team has &#8220;some really cool product releases coming up.&#8221; Even through Snapchat has managed to pick up a crazy amount of steam recently, there are still some weighty questions that Spiegel and the rest of the team have been able to adequately answer.</p>
<p>Take monetization, for instance. Snapchat recently raised a $13.5 million Series A round led by Benchmark Capital presumably with the expectation that the company would eventually make some sort of money, but the company isn&#8217;t there quite yet. That doesn&#8217;t seem to worry Spiegel though.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will eventually be several revenue streams,&#8221; Spiegel said. He didn&#8217;t dive into much detail, but he did note that he thinks that ads can &#8220;work very well on mobile&#8221; and that the young company has been playing around with some early prototypes.</p>

Microsoft marked the occasion with a decrease in pricing for cloud services and virtual instances, ranging from 21 to 33 percent. Windows Azure&#8217;s infrastructure services have been in preview since last June. Specifically, Azure will match price drops from AWS on commodity services such as compute, storage and bandwidth. Virtual machine instance prices will drop 21% and PaaS will go down by 33 percent. The move is meant to quiet the perception that Azure is more expensive than AWS, said Bill Hilf, general manager of Windows Azure product marketing in an interview yesterday. Hilf that they will also offer new high memory instances of up to 28 and 56 gigabytes to accommodate applications such as Microsoft Sharepoint that just need more memory. Hilf noted that Azure originated as a PaaS cloud, targeting .Net and new apps. Adding IaaS capability allows developers to come to Azure in an easier way, marked by the release last week of Active Directory, which allows for IT to manage identity across Azure and Microsoft environments. Microsoft has consistently added new capabilities over the past several months to its Azure platform. For example, in March, Windows Azure added new support for a number of services including PhoneGap, Dropbox and Hadoop. Like Amazon with AWS, Microsoft does not break out revenues for Azure. He did say that Azure has spun up 1.5 million virtual machines for customers and has 200,000 customers, signing up as of late about 1,000 per day. Hilf said the core differentiator with Amazon and Google is the choice they provide on-premise in the cloud or the combination of the two. Enterprise shops want that capability to enhance their own infrastructure and take advantage of what the cloud offers. The difference for Azure will come down to how well it can convince enterprise customers to use its service over AWS, which had an estimated $1.8 billion in revenues last year and is projected by at least one analyst firm to hit $20 billion in revenues by 2020. AWS has grown so rapidly by giving developers choice and being the go-to service for its massive computational and storage capacity. It has dozens of instance types and consistently drives down its pricing. But success in the enterprise remains elusive for AWS. It has]]></description>

AWS has grown so rapidly by giving developers choice and being the go-to service for its massive computational and storage capacity. It has dozens of instance types and consistently drives down its pricing.</p>
<p>But success in the enterprise remains elusive for AWS. It has not made a big mark there and may not due to its public cloud centric approach. Google faces challenges for similar reasons.</p>
<p>OpenStack means a CIO has to think about installing software and orchestrating the infrastructure correspondingly.</p>
<p>Overall, Microsoft has a strong offering for the enterprise customer. The question becomes how it can compete with AWS across the entire spectrum of what the cloud leader offers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-16-at-12-35-34.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Nosto logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Finnish startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nosto.com/">Nosto</a> has closed a $2.8 million seed round, including debt and grants, with backing from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/open-ocean">Open Ocean Capital</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/sanomaventures">SanomaVentures</a> and a number of undisclosed angel investors. The startup is building an online marketing SaaS targeting SMEs who want to amp up the power of their online stores with minimal effort and no up front cost.</p>
<p>Nosto&#8217;s SaaS platform offers features designed to drive more sales to online stores, including tailored product recommendations and automated emails. The startup claims it can be implemented &#8220;in less than an hour without any risk&#8221;. The &#8216;no risk&#8217; claim refers to the lack of any up front fees: Nosto&#8217;s current business model is based on taking a percentage revenue cut of any sales generated.</p>
<p>The SaaS platform includes the following features at present:</p>
<ul>
<li>personalised recommendations for shoppers, based on tracking data such as their browsing habits and purchase history in order to make tailored suggestions for repeat visitors;</li>
<li>triggered personalised emails (and email recommendations) to encourage shoppers to buy more, by, for example, emailing a shopper who abandons their carts in the middle of a purchase, or who hasn&#8217;t visited the store a while;</li>
<li>analytics and optimisation tools, including A/B testing to help tweak store layouts to drive more sales or compare the performance of different promotion types</li>
</ul>
<p>Nosto is still in stealth mode, ahead of a full public launch of its product, but has been piloting the software with a group of around 50 customers in Europe. Brands on its books so far include Angry Birds, Intersport, JOY, Reima, Outnorth and Sanoma’s Huuto.</p>
<p>CEO Juha Valvanne  told TechCrunch Nosto will be using the seed funding to finalize its platform for launching on the market, and to maximise  interoperability with existing SME infrastructure &#8212; by building plugins for &#8220;10 major commerce platforms used by SME segment merchants&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition, he said Nosto plans to hire an &#8220;initial international partner sales organisation&#8221; and expand its R&amp;D team.  He added that it intends to add several new services to the SaaS in future to &#8220;enable merchants to communicate their products with customers in new ways&#8221;. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Asked about competitors,<strong> </strong>he said the core difference between Nosto and other online marketing players is that it is zeroing in on the SME online store space, which he described as &#8220;the underserved long tail of the market&#8221;, rather than going after sizeable but better served enterprises.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are players that are building business intelligence systems and software (Neolane, IBM, Marketo, Avail..). However most of these companies are targeting the top companies and the projects are heavy implementations with a hefty price tag,&#8221; Valvanne told TechCrunch. &#8220;Nosto is targeting SME online stores, the underserved long tail of the market. We are bringing easy to implement solution with no upfront costs to the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An online store&#8217;s sales consist of Visitors x Conversion Rate x Average Order Value and we aim to increase all those three factors and in addition reduce the amount of manual work from the merchant side and increase customer satisfaction,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Early customers have seen sales improvements using Nosto&#8217;s platform, according to Valvanne. &#8221;We have lot&#8217;s of data but most of these data is not public as most of the merchants do not wish to publish their KPI metrics such as conversion rates. But for example in the Budget Sport store that is a concept from Intersport, we saw an increase of 18% in conversion rate after one month since Nosto was implemented,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Reima&#8217;s store (which is selling children&#8217;s outdoor clothing) we saw 50% increase in the number of products customers visit by average and spend time on the site. In Rovio&#8217;s global Angry Birds online store we have seen significant impact on average order values.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the seed round in statement, Monty Widenius, partner at Open Ocean Capital, described Nosto as having ”a revolutionary and easy to use concept for providing shopping recommendations for any online shop&#8221;.</p>

The display is said to be equivalent to viewing a 25-inch HD display from eight feet, the camera captures 5 megapixel stills and 720p video, there&#8217;s 16GB of flash memory, of which 12GB are usable, and it has both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on board.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of weird talking about what Google Glass has inside, since there&#8217;s nothing to compare it to in terms of a broader device category. Phones are easy to stack up; we know roughly what constitutes a high-end or a mid-market device at any given time, and you can check the specs of a new handset and say it&#8217;s either deficient, adequate or above average based on those standards. But with Glass, is 16GB of storage paltry or plenty? No 802.11n Wi-Fi? Do I care? So many questions.</p>
<p>Other key specs include confirmation that it&#8217;ll use a Bone Conduction Transducer to deliver audio, which eliminates the need for earbuds, and the built-in battery should last for around a full day of use, just like your average smartphone, though shooting video and participating in Google Hangouts might be extra taxing. It also ships with a Micro USB cable and charger, and Google advises that users stick with the included adapter, instead of just any USB wall wart, for improved long-term Glass battery life.</p>
<p>Apple sparked a trend in computing of focusing more on the experience than on the specs, and nowhere will that be more true than with Google Glass, which has precious little in the way of precedent. The software (including the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/googles-glass-companion-app-for-android-and-web-based-setup-wizard-are-now-live/"> MyGlass companion app for Android</a>) will be key, but it&#8217;s still cool to see what kind of guts Google is packing into its grand Glass experiment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/tibbr.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="tibbr" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tibbr.com">Tibbr</a>, the social networking service from enterprise software company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tibco.com">Tibco</a>, has over 1.5 million subscribers &#8212; all paid &#8212; and today it&#8217;s announcing two platform partners, Amazon Web Services and Dutch carrier KPN, as it embarks on a new drive to grow that user base as a cloud service. Putting tibbr on the <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/">AWS Marketplace</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kpm.com/grip">KPN&#8217;s GRIP platform</a> will be the first time the social networking service will be sold, billed and provisioned via third-party platforms. And that is a sign of how app store-style enterprise marketplaces continue to evolve and become a go-to place for cloud software companies looking to connect with customers.</p>
<p>Tibbr has traditionally sourced many of its users from among the businesses that look to Tibco for other enterprise software solutions &#8212; with companies like Macy’s, KPMG, and Schneider Electric among those users across desktop and mobile devices (tibbr currently works on iOS, Android and BlackBerry platforms). But the bigger opportunity is in targeting enterprises that are not already owned by Tibco, competing for business users against other products like Microsoft&#8217;s Yammer and Chatter from Salesforce, which also offer closed social networking services for smaller workgroups and the very largest enterprises. Tibco has 4,000 enterprises on its books; of the 1.5 million users of tibbr, some 40% are existing Tibco customers, while 60% are not. &#8220;We are leveraging Tibco&#8217;s customer base, but we are also reaching out to a whole new set of customers,&#8221; Ram Menon, president of Tibco&#8217;s social computing unit, told TechCrunch in an interview. </p>
<p>And increasingly it seems that its growth is not premises-based but in the cloud. Right now, some 60% of tibbr users are already using the social networking software in the cloud, and that proportion is on the rise.</p>
<p>There are no signs that tibbr will launch a freemium version of its service &#8212; Menon likes to highlight that when Yammer sold to Microsoft for $1.2 billion it had only about 800,000 paid users on its books, compared to tibbr&#8217;s 1.5 million. But tibbr is starting to play around more with pricing. </p>
<p>At its most basic level, tibbr sold through Tibco costs $12 per user per month (that fee gets reduced as the number of users increase), but that pricing changes if purchased via AWS or KPN. For instance, on AWS, the service is <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results/ref=gtw_navgno_search_box?searchTerms=tibbr&amp;search=">sold in increments of 25, 50, 100 and 200 licenses</a>, and pricing is in the typical AWS format, starting at $0.58 per hour for the smallest package. This includes charges not only for the software, but the RedHat Linux supporting software, as well as for use of Amazon&#8217;s EC2 infrastructure. Similarly, KPN bundles tibbr with other services and prices accordingly; it&#8217;s GRIP service already has 80,000 customers, the company says. </p>
<p>Part of the reason for the change is because this is what customers themselves are demanding these days. &#8220;We are seeing a fundamental change in how businesses are buying apps and services,&#8221; Sriram Chakravarthy, VP of social computing products and engineering at Tibco, said in an interview. &#8220;They are expecting to get everything in one place. Those who use platforms like KPN&#8217;s GRIP and AWS want everything in one place.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is also one more by-product of the ongoing <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/05/the-rise-of-the-enterprise-startup-consumerization-and-clouds-open-the-door-disruption-closes-the-deal/">consumerization of enterprise IT</a> and the opportunity for developing dynamic services for business users, not just consumers (see also: &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/27/the-enterprise-cool-kids/">The enterprise cool kids</a>.&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that Facebook has taught us is the concept of the 21st century dashboard,&#8221; says Menon. &#8220;For the casual user, this is the best way of aggregating disparate streams of data. Tibbr shows how you can use that concept for work.&#8221; While Facebook (as one example) lets you follow friends, organizations, news sources, and so on, Menon describes the tibbr version as &#8220;following people, subjects, and machines.&#8221; The latter means you can track different tasks as they are working through the system, and share that information with others. &#8220;We&#8217;re bringing all this now on to your wall,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>On the side of Tibco&#8217;s new partners, adding tibbr is akin to a mobile app storefront picking up an app that will hopefully get more users flocking to the platform overall. </p>
<p>&#8220;We were looking for an intuitive service that users love and adopt, satisfies IT with enterprise-grade security and control, and drives real ROI benefits for customers through contextual integration with current and next-generation applications. Only tibbr met all these criteria,&#8221; Gerard Schiebroek, VP of marketing and sales at KPN&#8217;s IT solutions division, noted in a statement.</p>
<p>And while tibbr has in the past been hosted on AWS infrastructure by some of its existing users, this will be the first time that AWS is adding it into its Marketplace, integrating it into its billing and provisioning infrastructure and giving Amazon one more name-brand to check off on its list of must-have enterprise software companies (this is the first time that a Tibco service will be sold on the the AWS Marketplace). &#8220;Working with TIBCO demonstrates how innovative and forward thinking software companies can leverage the power of AWS to provide greater value to their customers,&#8221; said Sajai Krishnan, General Manager, AWS Marketplace, in a statement. </p>

AT&#38;T has officially put the Galaxy S 4 from Samsung <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/galaxys4">up for pre-order</a> on its website. For now, only the 16GB models in both black and white are available, and only in select areas. 

AT&#38;T will likely make more models available in the next few days as pre-orders ramp up. The 16GB model starts at $199 with a two-year contract. According to AT&#38;T, the phone will ship on April 30, in two weeks. ]]></description>

AT&amp;T has officially put the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/samsung-galaxy-s-4-beats-the-best-with-5-inch-1080p-display-1-9ghz-processor-gesture-controls-and-a-q2-2012-release/">Galaxy S 4</a> from Samsung <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/galaxys4">up for pre-order</a> on its website. For now, only the 16GB models in both black and white are available, and only in select areas.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T will likely make more models available in the next few days as pre-orders ramp up. The 16GB model starts at $199 with a two-year contract. According to AT&amp;T, the phone will ship on April 30, in two weeks.</p>
<p>The Galaxy S 4 is arguably one of the best Android phone made to date, alongside its fiercest competition the HTC One. Though its plastic-y exterior may turn you off, it has more than a few new software features to keep you excited.</p>
<p>Smart Pause, which stops playing video when the phone can&#8217;t detect you&#8217;re looking at it, and Air View, which lets you access extra information by hovering over a picture or email subject, are both worth it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Plus, you can&#8217;t forget about that 440ppi 5-inch Super AMOLED display.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve been excited about the new Galaxy S 4 ever since that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-great-launch-event/">random little kid started singing and tap dancing on a Broadway stage</a> (and Samsung made a fool of itself), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.att.com/galaxys4">head on over to AT&amp;T</a> and make it happen.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also heard that there are a few issues with ordering pages, so if at first you don&#8217;t succeed, you can hit refresh and try again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-16-at-7-34-07-am.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-16 at 7.34.07 AM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Ontario-based <a target="_blank" href="http://fusebill.com">Fusebill</a>, a company that offers online software to help companies deal with and support subscription-based businesses and billing cycles, has raised a new $2 million round of funding. The financing will be used to help the company expand its offering and grow its user base, Fusebill CEO Steve Adams explained in an interview.</p>
<p>Securing this funding from OMERS and Covington is significant, as both are among Canada&#8217;s top investment firms. Fusebill&#8217;s offering is definitely in OMERS&#8217; wheelhouse, as it deals with a key transaction point for online businesses. Managing the subscription billing process for companies is definitely a growth market, as more businesses are turning to a recurring fee model in offering SaaS-style products. Fusebill automates the entire process of accepting payments, targeting mid-sized businesses mostly with a solution that&#8217;s more affordable than the bigger players in the space like <a target="_blank" href="http://zuora.com">Zuora</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good class of solutions for enterprises, they&#8217;re good products, they&#8217;re just extraordinarily expensive,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;They&#8217;re not acceptable to smaller businesses, so we&#8217;re working with companies that are smaller and that don&#8217;t need quite the range of functionality that you might get from a Zuora, and are happy to work with a standardized product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fusebill also offers pricing options aimed at startup companies, which is another thing that makes it clearly separate from the larger players. It fields credit card payments, can handle adjustments, discounts on a one-time or recurring basis  is completely PCI compliant and also integrates with other popular e-commerce software. Another issue that Adams made sure was built into Fusebill was an analytics component, which can help identify churn and its causes, as well as spell out ARPU and other key metrics in detail.</p>
<p>Plans for the funding include future product development, but a key area for Fusebill now is marketing, and this round will help most with those efforts, according to Adams.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the near term it&#8217;s sort of steady as it goes, but the expansion will really be around building out the product for another set of customers that we have in mind, and more product development, and also building out a sales and marketing side of the business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what we&#8217;re really focused on is getting the product in front of more customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>SaaS and other subscription-based online e-commerce ventures are on the rise, and Fusebill provides the tools companies need to make that happen without building their own in-house solution. Fusebill already has a strong customer base, mostly in the U.S., and with this fresh investment it now hopes to accelerate that growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/relayrides.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="relayrides" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Peer-to-peer car rental startup RelayRides has grown pretty aggressively ever since it enabled users to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/relayrides-national-launch/">rent their cars from wherever throughout the U.S</a>. Now it has cars listed in 1450 cities in the U.S., including all 50 states. But what do users do if they live in a place where there are no available cars around?</p>
<p>Starting today, users who find themselves in that predicament will be able to share their interest in renting a car on Facebook. The new feature, which RelayRides calls &#8220;Renting Social,&#8221; is designed to help increase supply in markets where there&#8217;s a limited number of cars listed.</p>
<p>As part of the new feature, RelayRides users can advertise their need for a car on Facebook, including the duration that they need to rent one, as well as the location that they&#8217;re looking to rent from. Once shared with contacts on Facebook, the listing will appear in their news feed. If someone with a car nearby sees it, that person will be able to instantly respond by listing his vehicle. And once that&#8217;s done, the user who initially posted the request will be notified.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/relayrides-renting-social/4-fb-request-on-facebook/" rel="attachment wp-att-799246"></a></p>
<p>The idea is for RelayRides to help boost the number of cars wherever there&#8217;s demand. But to some extent that flips the usual marketplace model on its head. Usually marketplaces work and demand is built where there&#8217;s already an abundance of supply. With &#8220;Riding Social,&#8221; RelayRides is trying to boost supply by first showing demand in underserved areas.</p>
<p>While Renting Social is designed to raise awareness of RelayRides among car owners who aren&#8217;t yet users, the feature can also be used to improve discoverability in markets where supply is abundant. By sharing on Facebook, they can be connected to cars nearby through the company&#8217;s &#8220;carcierge&#8221; service.</p>
<p>Thanks to a growing number of listings, RelayRides has seen a pretty drastic uptick in the number of rentals across its platform. Its transactions have increased 300 percent over year-over-year, and are 45 percent month-over-month from February to March. As it sees users extend the length of rentals, it&#8217;s also benefiting from people renting cars for days and weeks as opposed to just a few hours.</p>
<p>CEO Andre Haddad sees the increase in the rental time as primarily due to a growing adoption of regular users who are looking to use RelayRides in the same way they use traditional rental car agencies. Today, he says, the average rental is about 2 or 2.5 days. To support that, RelayRides has also added the ability to rent cars monthly, in addition to hourly, daily, and weekly. As a result of all these things, the number of rental reservation hours has increased 750 percent.</p>
<p>RelayRides was founded in 2010, and has raised funding from Google Ventures, August Capital, Shasta Ventures, and GM Ventures. It recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/05/car-sharing-startup-relayrides-partners-with-gm/">partnered with GM</a> to make car rentals <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/relayrides-gm-onstar/">more accessible through OnStar integration</a>, but the majority of rentals still occur through the handoff of keys between users.</p>

The London-based company has rolled out dedicated sites for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adzuna.com.br">Brazil</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adzuna.co.za">South Africa</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adzuna.com.au">Australia</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adzuna.ca">Canada</a>. That&#8217;s an interesting mix of countries and territories &#8212; the U.S., for now, is still notably missing in action &#8212; but, nonetheless, we can safely now call Adzuna a startup with global ambitions.</p>
<p>Like its UK and German versions, the new localised sites feature the same job search functionality by indexing job vacancies found on classified ads and job boards around the web, and mining that data for its search engine and to provide free access to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/12/want-to-know-how-much-more-you-could-earn-adzuna-launches-free-market-insight-tool-for-jobseekers/">labour market trends</a>, such as tracking salaries for a particular vocation and region.</p>
<p>Adzuna&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/18/adzuna-raises-new-funding-to-makes-job-ads-fully-social/">social features</a> have made the flight, too. Dubbed Adzuna Connect, users can sign in to Adzuna via Facebook or LinkedIn to leverage their social graph to help them get an in at a particular company which has a job vacancy they wish to apply for.</p>
<p>In addition, in a move that could be seen as partly cheeky PR but also has some genuine utility, Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter says that the startup is offering to build an employment market data dashboard to be used by the governments of each of the newly supported countries, similar to the one it <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/07/too-many-twits-make-a-pm/">currently</a> powers for the UK’s Number 10 and Prime Minister’s own iPad web app, which we&#8217;re told has been well-received.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feedback we&#8217;ve had from Number 10 is that the PM uses the app regularly,&#8221; says Hunter, &#8220;and that there are discussions happening at the moment around rolling out the dashboard to wider government. The opposition have not approached us asking for an app yet, but in the interest of open data, we&#8217;d happily talk to them about providing something similar.&#8221; </p>
<p>Back to today&#8217;s international expansion. I asked Hunter why, for example, Canada was chosen before the U.S. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, U.S. is coming,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re generally really excited about the Canadian market because job seekers clearly aren&#8217;t satisfied with any of the job search engines currently there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also says that he and co-founder Doug Monro, having been at eBay Classifieds for a number of years, previously worked &#8220;very closely with the folks at Kijiji.ca&#8221; (the craigslist or Gumtree of Canada), so they already had the required business relationships and market knowledge in place. &#8220;That always helps&#8221;, he says.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dinorama.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Dinorama" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://recurious.com/">Recurious</a>, a new game development platform that aims to help kids rediscover their curiosity, is announcing $1.5 million in funding led by Greylock Partners (Reid Hoffman).</p>
<p>Founded by James Miao, Recurious wants to create better educational games for children. Miao believes that there is a gap in quality game design for kids. As Miao explains, most kids games dress up education into gaming, which he compares to &#8220;covering broccoli with chocolate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thinks that having a more thoughtful approach to design of kids&#8217; games is essential for self-motivated learning because it immediately engages kids and then gives them just enough of an information gap where the actual curiosity element kicks in. And it&#8217;s this curiosity that helps kids actually learn while playing a hame.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s first title Dinorama, which is aimed at kids ages 7 through 12, is based around encouraging children to build a dinosaur theme park. The actual gaming and creative element centralizes around how to make the park successful from a financial standpoint.</p>
<p>In Dinorama, kids learn about earning, spending, and saving money by building amusements for their visitors, caring for their dinosaurs, and weathering events like rainstorms that increase maintenance costs and lower ticket sales.</p>
<p>Kids are encourages to feed the dinosaurs, hire a tour guide, pop popcorn, inflate balloons, and photograph visitors; clean and repair the park; guide visitors to their favorite dinosaur and more. Kids can name dinosaurs, feed them, use money to build a park, create better habitats for dinosaurs, and more. It&#8217;s sort of like Farmville meets Petsville, plus dinosaurs.</p>
<p>As Miao tells us, the aim is &#8220;how to crate an aspirational environment where kids want to pay attention, and are learning.&#8221; Part of this is allowing kids to be entrepreneurial with their money, adding problem solving elements (i.e. how to deal with a rainy day in the dinosaur park and unexpected issues like food shortages, or no tourists because of a bus breakdown).</p>
<p>Miao previously founded another gaming startup, thesixtyone, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/23/thesixtyone-redesign-users-revolt/">blended</a> gaming elements with indie music discovery. He says he learned a tremendous amount about gaming (he also worked at EA) and thought he could apply this to children&#8217;s games as well.</p>
<p>Next up, Recurious will be launching new games in creative play, as well as multiplication and division.</p>

This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $48 million.</p>
<p>Booker provides a unified platform that includes tools necessary to run a service business, including scheduling, point of sale, CRM, employee management, marketing and loyalty programs, and comprehensive reporting. Over 60,000 service professionals use Booker’s products across multiple verticals, including: health, wellness, beauty, home improvement, and professional services.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/gramercyone-raises-14-5m-from-revolution-others-for-cloud-based-business-management-software/">founded</a> after its SpaBooker platform was developed as a business division within SpaFinder, a spa media and marketing company. The software functionality required to enable online scheduling of spa appointments began to gain traction outside of the spa industry, and thus the SpaBooker division was spun out in to what is now Booker (and was formerly known as GramercyOne).</p>
<p>The appeal of Booker’s platform is that it facilitates and captures the entire purchase cycle and customer history from promotion to sale. The company says that in 2012 it saw triple-digit revenue growth for the fourth consecutive year and doubled the company&#8217;s annual transaction volume to nearly $1 billion. In fact, Booker processes over one million appointments each month across 73 countries in 11 languages.</p>

And that&#8217;s a good thing. Try as they might, startups have yet to provide a true remote control replacement. A dedicated remote is like a trusty pickup truck: It might not be the best looking vehicle but it gets the job done with little fuss. But even though dedicated remotes probably won&#8217;t be replaced, that doesn&#8217;t mean smartphone apps can&#8217;t supplement their existence.

Their latest, the affair of hardware including a multitude of buttons, touchscreens, and easy setup through Harmony&#8217;s web-based interface. However Logitech also made this $349 system compatible with its Logitech Harmony Smartphone apps, allowing smartphones to fill in when the remote control inevitably goes AWOL. Or, if you just prefer to use a smartphone altogether, the company also just announced the $129 Logitech Harmony Smart Control, a system that puts the smartphone as the primary controller (like the old Harmony Link) but also includes a small physical remote for backup (below left). Both systems are compatible with nearly every home entertainment device ever made including game systems and the Philips Hue lighting system. Using IR blasters and your home&#8217;s WiFi network, devices can be controlled from the remote or smartphone even when they&#8217;re packed away out of sight. With the rise of the smartphone, many technology pundits put the venerable remote on death watch. But it&#8217;s still here. Many smart TVs can now be controlled through a smartphone, but most cable boxes and entertainment systems require extra hardware like the Harmony Smart Control or Griffin&#8217;s Beacon. I&#8217;ve owned and tested about a dozen high-end universal remote controls starting with an original Harmony before the company was purchased by Logitech. I&#8217;ve also tried most of the iOS remotes but find using my smartphone (or tablet) clunky and not nearly as intuitive as a physical remote. A remote control, while often a mind-boggling mess of buttons, is still the best way to control a complex home entertainment system and mindlessly channel surf on lonely Saturday nights.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/waywire-feature.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Waywire Feature" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Where do you put the videos you find around the web, and how do they express your identity? #waywire 2.0 aims to be the answer. Co-founded by Newark Mayor Cory Booker and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/waywire-video/">launched</a> nine months ago, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/30/waywire/">#Waywire focused on</a> original and user-generated content. But with today&#8217;s update the beta recenters around you collecting videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Vine and news sites into <a target="_blank" href="http://waywire.com/users/corybooker/playlists">themed playlists</a>.</p>
<p>From one perspective, this update is sensible. It&#8217;s #waywire trying to find its niche. &#8220;Pinterest for video&#8221; is a bit confining, but it symbolizes the value #waywire hopes to offer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/30/waywire/">initial ambitions of the startup were huge</a> &#8212; to turn a generation of news-watchers into news-makers by letting them film and broadcast news segments or responses about things that fascinated them, and to augment those with original in-house news content. But shooting a newscast is tough work that creates a big barrier to user participation, and people have zplenty of news sources and behavior patterns already. Though #waywire was only in alpha, I didn&#8217;t see it gaining any traction and the company refuses to provide any user counts.</p>
<p>Moving towards curation bases #waywire on a quicker activity that piggybacks on the consumption most already undertake. And even if it&#8217;s official #waywire-produced videos people are curating, it makes peers you trust the source of news rather than another traditional establishment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In #waywire 2.0, you don&#8217;t just post videos to your feed. You collect them from any of the few dozen most popular video providers on the web, and organize them into &#8220;wires&#8221; about certain topics. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://waywire.com/users/corybooker/playlists">Mayor Booker has wires</a> dedicated to civil rights, gun speeches, and a collection of his speeches.</p>
<p>You can also now add hashtags, set which video is the featured of a topic wire, and what thumbnail is displayed on each video. These all give you the power to create more compelling video compilations about fascinating subjects. It also opens the door to easier monetization through traditional video pre-rolls and overlays as well as sponsored posts since the update gives advertisers topics to advertise against. That should please <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/waywire">investors who include</a> First Round Capital, Troy Carter, and Oprah.</p>
<p>#waywire is now piping in content from 200 trusted sources including BedRocket Media, CollegeHumor, HuffPost Live, Refinery29, Slate, The Young Turks, and more. This ensures there is quality for people to curate, while the #waywire bookmarklet lets them easily grab content from around the /web. The site&#8217;s interface definitely still needs some work before it deserves to drop the beta title. Vines get the bottom of their portrait shape cut off by #waywire&#8217;s landscape player, and there appeared to be no way to add existing videos you&#8217;d shared to a specific wire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Still, there is no doubt in my mind that watching a curated video playlist assembled by an expert is an extraordinarily efficient way to learn about something. For that reason, #Waywire could have a serious impact in its new form.</p>
<p>Some part of me wishes Booker would keep pushing the audacious mission of changing the way news is created and discussed. But maybe that&#8217;s for the next generation who don&#8217;t just love video but have been producing their own since they were little kids.</p>
<p>This modest update may create the right product for this generation. At first there were bookmark sites for curating links, then Pinterest for curating images and ecommerce. Now may be the time for us to curate video news, even if we can&#8217;t produce it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/google-malware-android-logo.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="malware android" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Mobile malware remains a small and nascent issue, especially when compared to the scale of threats crowding around desktop OSes, but the threat that is out there continues to mostly affect Google&#8217;s Android platform. This despite Apple&#8217;s iOS technically having more vulnerabilities, according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_main_report_v18_2012_21291018.en-us.pdf">new report</a> by security software firm Symantec. The difference in threat level is a natural consequence of the two differing mobile ecosystem approaches: Apple&#8217;s walled garden vs Android&#8217;s open playground.</p>
<p>Symantec identified just 108 new unique threats to all mobile platforms in 2012, 103 of which targeted the Android platform vs one targeting iOS. Symbian was second after Android, with three unique threats identified, while Windows Mobile had one. But when looking at platform vulnerabilities Symantec said there were 387 documented vulnerabilities for iOS vs just 13 for Android. Elsewhere, BlackBerry also had 13, and Windows Mobile had two.</p>
<p>Symantec&#8217;s report notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, mobile vulnerabilities have little or no correlation to mobile malware. In fact, while Apple’s iOS had the most documented vulnerabilities in 2012, there was only one threat created for the platform. Compare this to the Android OS; although only thirteen vulnerabilities were reported, it led all mobile operating systems in the amount of malware written for the platform. Vulnerabilities likely will become a factor in mobile malware, but today Android’s market share, the openness of the platform, and the multiple distribution methods available to applications embedded with malware make it the go-to platform of malware authors.</p></blockquote>
<p>The root cause of the (small) threat level for Android is typically downloads from third party app stores (i.e. not Google Play) or users directly side-loading apps &#8212; something the Android platform allows, via a user-enabled setting, while iOS users wanting to sideload apps or use third party app stores have to jailbreak their device. It&#8217;s that open vs closed approach that explains the differing threat level, says Symantec, noting: &#8220;Android users are vulnerable to a whole host of threats; however, very few have utilized vulnerabilities to spread threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Symantec does flag up one example in its report of &#8220;rogue software masquerading as popular games on the Google Play market, having bypassed Google’s automated screening process&#8221; last year. But clearly the vast majority of Android malware lands on devices via the unofficial routes cited above.</p>
<p>In terms of location, Android threats are &#8221;more commonly&#8221; found in Eastern Europe and Asia, according to the report. China has a thriving market of Android-based devices that dispense with Google&#8217;s Play store, which likely explains some of the Asian distribution of Android threats.</p>
<p>Another security issue affecting Android is platform fragmentation, with multiple older versions of the OS potentially creating a risk, says Symantec, along with carrier additions and Android skins &#8212; since these can delay the progress of OS updates. So while Google has made changes to Android 4.x to help bolster security, the vast majority of users (circa 90% last year) are stuck using older versions of the platform.</p>
<p>Symantec notes security-focused tweaks made by Google in Android 4.x include adding a feature to allow users to block any particular app from pushing notifications into the status bar (to combat adware); and in Android 4.2 adding a feature to prompt the user to confirm sending a premium text (to combat premium SMS threats).</p>
<p>The report adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;at around 10 percent market penetration at the end of 2012, Android 4.2 devices account only for a small percentage of the total devices out there. The Android ecosystem makes it harder to keep everyone up to date&#8230;</p>
<p>For most exploits in the OS, Google released quick fixes; however, users still had long waits before they received the fix from their network operators. Some exploits are not in the original OS itself but in the custom modifications made by manufacturers, such as the exploit for Samsung models that appeared in 2012. Samsung was quick to fix it, but the fix still had to propagate through network operators to reach users.</p></blockquote>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect, Symantec is predicting continued growth in levels of mobile malware this year, as tablet and smartphone use continues to grow and attract more malware writers. Specifically it is expecting to see &#8220;ransomware and drive-by website infections on these new platforms in the coming year&#8221;.</p>
<p>Security companies been charting &#8216;rising levels of mobile malware&#8217; for years but overall relative threat levels remain low. Still, Symantec said 2012 saw a 58 per cent increase in mobile malware vs 2011, and said the year&#8217;s total accounts for 59 per cent of all mobile malware discovered to-date &#8212; so while the threat is still small it is now more than doubling year-on-year.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/symantec-mobile-malware/screen-shot-2013-04-16-at-10-22-51/" rel="attachment wp-att-799364"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Symantec&#8217;s breakdown of the types of mobile threat it identified last year, with information theft being the most common threat. Add in user tracking and more than fifty per cent of the mobile malware identified was trying to steal user info or track their movements:</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/16/symantec-mobile-malware/screen-shot-2013-04-16-at-10-25-40/" rel="attachment wp-att-799366"></a></p>
<p>On Sunday <a target="_blank" href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/14/apple-enterprise-android-malware/">Forbes</a> covered a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/security-awareness/articles/mobile-malware-growth-continuing-2013.aspx">McAfee report</a> that claimed it had identified 36,699 pieces of mobile malware, 95% of which cropped up last year &#8212; a hugely higher figure compared to Symantec&#8217;s figure of 108 new unique threats. In its report, Symantec says its figure is smaller than &#8220;other estimates on the scope of the mobile threat landscape&#8221; owing to other companies&#8217; estimates counting overall threats (rather than new unique threats).</p>
<blockquote><p>Many estimates are larger because they provide a count of overall variants, as opposed to new, unique threats. While many of these variants simply undergone minor changes in an attempt to avoid antivirus scanners detecting them, Symantec counted at least 3,906 different mobile variants for the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even Symantec&#8217;s variant figure &#8212; 3,906 &#8212; is orders of magnitude smaller than McAfee&#8217;s count. Differing approaches to counting malware variants and threats presumably explains the discrepancy. We&#8217;ve reached out to Symantec to ask what specifically it includes in its mobile malware count and will update this story with any response.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/15/malware-on-mobile-grew-163-in-2012-infecting-around-32-8m-android-devices-report-says/">another report</a> into mobile malware, conducted by mobile security software provider NQ Mobile, apparently identified more than 65,000 distinct forms of mobile malware, such as app repackaging, malicious URLs and SMS phishing.</p>
<p>Security companies of course have a vested interest in hyping malware threats, since they are in the business of selling security software, so it&#8217;s worth taking the highest figures with a big pinch of salt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/212196v2-max-250x250.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="212196v2-max-250x250" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Just a few years ago, e-invoicing was mainly the realm of large companies, with SMEs ruled out by legacy systems that carried prohibitive licensing fees and were expensive to implement. More recently, the cloud has helped to change this with a number of startups offering free e-invoicing for small companies. VC-backed Tradeshift, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/23/tradeshift-intuit/">recently</a> took a multi-million investment from accounting software company Intuit, has probably garnered the most mind-share. And today, Dublin-based <a target="_blank" href="http://www.senddr.com">Senddr</a>, a new e-invoicing startup, is throwing its wares into the ring.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012 by brothers Morgan Lynch (previously founder of online accounting software company Yendo) and Malcolm Lynch, Senddr&#8217;s e-invoicing service aims to help small businesses know when they are getting paid by providing a feedback loop on their invoices. The system delivers a company&#8217;s sales invoices and sends an alert back when the invoice is approved or scheduled for payment.</p>
<p>At the other end, larger companies want to save on the time spent dealing with supplier enquiries, which Senddr says it does by providing end-to-end connectivity between the supplier and the customer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its claimed USP is support for multiple accounting software/SaaS, in which invoices are transferred directly between accounting systems, thus eliminating errors and data-entry, says the company.</p>
<p>And indeed the list of supported SME accounting software is extensive and includes Xero, Freshbooks, Sage 50, SageOne, Quickbooks, Yendo, Zoho, FreeAgent and Kashflow, along with connecting to a number of ERP systems including Microsoft Dynamics and Oracle Financials.</p>
<p>In contrast, Tradeshift, which offers a business interactions platform that extends far beyond just e-invoicing, publicly <a target="_blank" href="https://go.tradeshift.com/apps/list">lists</a> support for accounting software Intuit, Sage, KashFlow, Twinfield, and E-conomic. (The KashFlow support isn&#8217;t without <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/25/kashflow-tradeshift/">controversy</a>, however.) </p>
