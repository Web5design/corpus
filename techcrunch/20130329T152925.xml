And, as of Monday, the company is expanding into Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/bespoke-post-raises-850k-from-great-oaks-500-startups-others-for-its-subscription-based-box-of-awesome-for-men/shavekit/" rel="attachment wp-att-788122"></a>Launched in summer 2012, following participation in NYC’s <a target="_blank" href="http://eroundtable.net/accelerator/">Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator</a>, Bespoke Post is targeting the men&#8217;s shopping space by offering themed boxes that cost around the same price as a gym membership ($45/month, shipping included). When the service arrives in Canada next week, that price will increase by $15 to $25, depending on location, to cover shipping, duties, and taxes. Boxes typically retail at over $70, however, so it&#8217;s generally still a savings over directly buying each individual item they contain.</p>
<p>Past boxes have included a shave kit, a travel theme, a high-end cocktail set, a shoeshine kit, a &#8220;weekender&#8221; box, and others. What makes Bespoke Post&#8217;s model different, is that though it&#8217;s offered only on a &#8220;subscription&#8221; basis, customers can opt-out of receiving the box as often as they want after receiving the email that details the current box&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/bespoke-post-raises-850k-from-great-oaks-500-startups-others-for-its-subscription-based-box-of-awesome-for-men/polished/" rel="attachment wp-att-788121"></a>&#8220;We kind of bastardized the subscription model to better cater to our customer,&#8221; explains company co-founder Rishi Prabhu. Men aren&#8217;t typically big online shoppers, which is why companies like Bespoke Post, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.manpacks.com/">Manpacks</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meundies.com/">Meundies</a>, and others are trying to entice men with more passive subscription-based commerce options, as of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to deliver an experience to men from interesting brands &#8211; we don&#8217;t want to just deliver products,&#8221; Prabhu explains. Still, despite its focus on men only, he notes that 10 to 15 percent of the company&#8217;s current subscribers are women.</p>
<p>Bespoke Post has targeted its customer base by cultivating relationships with media companies and brands, beginning with a Details Magazine partnership last year. Last week, it partnered with AskMen, which will syndicate Bespoke Post&#8217;s boxes through its network. And the startup has a long-standing relationship with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.diageo.com/en-row/Pages/default.aspx">Diageo</a>, which owns 17 of the top 100 distilled spirits (e.g., Johnnie Walker, Tanqueray, Baileys, etc.), beers (Guinness, Red Stripe, etc.) and wines.</p>
<p>The company works with these bigger brands on content, but also with smaller brands for the products in the box. &#8220;The cool thing is that we&#8217;re not sending overstock to people, we&#8217;re often custom-making these products with designers,&#8221; Prabhu notes.</p>
<p>Up until the close of the funding, the company was just a team of two, and was lacking the necessary infrastructure. Now, Bespoke Post is a team of seven and hiring. Prabhu declined to provide subscriber numbers, but had hinted last June that it was approaching a $1 million annualized run rate. He says the subscriber count has more than doubled since that time, and the company is seeing consistent double-digit growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/bespoke-post-raises-850k-from-great-oaks-500-startups-others-for-its-subscription-based-box-of-awesome-for-men/weekender/" rel="attachment wp-att-788123"></a>However, Prabhu says that subscription-based commerce is only the beginning of where the company wants to go. Though the team is discussing the introduction of a higher-price point box as another option for customers, its long-term vision may see it moving towards a more traditional e-commerce model where customers buy the products/&#8221;experiences&#8221; from the site itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Subscription is a great way for us to start because it gives us scale and an interesting value proposition to customers,&#8221; Prabhu says, &#8220;but we see a lot of opportunity in expanding generally into commerce, and introducing a really innovative way for men to buy products.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="67" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hd-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=67&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="hd-logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.getfanba.se/">Fanbase Media</a>, a new social media marketing startup which has been flying under the radar for over half a year, helps companies use Instagram for connecting with their customers. Despite the company&#8217;s low profile &#8211; its turnkey, self-serve solution won&#8217;t launch until next week, in fact &#8211; it has already attracted the interest of some bigger-name brands, including <a target="_blank" href="http://fallinginlovewith.destinationkors.com/">Michael Kors</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SHAPEmagazine/app_131298163674310">Shape Magazine</a>, and others which the company isn&#8217;t allowed to publicly name.</p>
<p>Currently a bootstrapped team of three, the startup helps businesses create, manage and promote campaigns involving user-generated photos posted on Instagram. For example, a company might want to run a photo contest on Instagram, specifying that entrants tag their photos with a particular hashtag to qualify.</p>
<p>Fanbase Media then helps to aggregate those photos, which can be pulled into a business&#8217;s Facebook Tab page, mobile microsite, or another page on the company&#8217;s own domain. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://fallinginlovewith.destinationkors.com/">you can see this page on a Michael Kors website</a>, which shows a Fanbase-managed photo contest which the fashion brand ran in February for Valentine&#8217;s Day. The company had asked users to tag their favorite things, using the hashtag #fallinginlovewith.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/fanbase-media-debuts-its-social-marketing-platform-for-instagram-and-maybe-one-day-vine/mk-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-788107"></a></p>
<p>Explains Fanbase founder Michael Zsigmond, &#8220;a lot of brands are starting to tap into user-generated content for marketing, and we realized that there&#8217;s really no platform that made it really simple for a brand to tap into user-generated content on Instagram.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not entirely true, of course. Fanbase will compete with a growing handful of companies offering &#8220;Instagram marketing solutions,&#8221; including but not limited to, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/26/nitrogram-raises-1m-to-mine-the-growing-instagram-eco-system-for-businesses/">recently funded</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://nitrogr.am/">Nitrogram</a>, as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.olapic.com/">Olapic</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://statigr.am/instagram-contest-toolkit">Statigram</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getchute.com/">Chute</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.curalate.com/">Curalate</a>, and others. But Fanbase Media&#8217;s focus on photo campaigns specifically may appeal to those looking for an end-to-end, targeted solution.</p>
<p>The company offers three pricing tiers, starting at $299/month for 100 approved photos, then $499/month for 500 photos, and custom pricing beyond that. In an online dashboard, businesses can view the photo entries, approve or deny them, comment, and share them back to social networks, or mobile or desktop websites. The campaigns also support features like user voting mechanisms, Facebook &#8220;Like&#8221; gating, embeddable widgets, and more. And tools to design the photo websites and contest pages are provided, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/fanbase-media-debuts-its-social-marketing-platform-for-instagram-and-maybe-one-day-vine/approved/" rel="attachment wp-att-788103"></a></p>
<p>The company has been working on the platform over the past eight months, Zsigmond says, and they believe this is the direction social media marketing is headed. &#8220;The first generation of social marketing platforms was really about helping brands manage the content they push out, and we think the next generation of social marketing platforms is helping brands tap into their audience for content, and then use that content for marketing results,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/fanbase-media-debuts-its-social-marketing-platform-for-instagram-and-maybe-one-day-vine/step2/" rel="attachment wp-att-788106"></a></p>
<p>He says that the long-term goal is not to stop with Instagram, however. The company is already considering plans for Vine, Twitter&#8217;s new and increasingly popular mini video sharing app. Vine doesn&#8217;t have an open API yet, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/vine-tribeca-film-festival-launch-6secfilms-vine-competition-for-viners-obsessed-with-vining-vines/">but</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/313655494411710465">it&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/big-moment-for-vine-as-first-wolverine-movie-footage-comes-via-6-second-tweaser-instead-of-trailer/">already getting traction</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/prnewser/10-of-the-best-brands-on-vine_b59545">with brands</a>, Zsigmond notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really focused on integrating with purely mobile apps,&#8221; Zsigmond explains, &#8220;places where people are creating content on their phone. That allows us to focus on a feature set that&#8217;s built specifically for mobile,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s self-serve solution will be available early next week, but interested businesses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getfanba.se/pricing.html">can sign up here as of now</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/3d-printer-kiosk-fuji-16.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="3d-printer-kiosk-fuji-16" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>3D printing is still in its infancy. But, to use an overused phrase, it is the future. From home use to enterprise use, 3D printing will continue to grow and break into new areas. With that comes price reductions. So much so that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2388415">Gartner predicts</a> enterprise-class 3D printers (read: 3D printers not made by hipsters in Brooklyn) will drop under the $2,000 mark by 2016.</p>
<p>The report pegs continued adoption and progression in 3D technology as the cause for the price drop. It&#8217;s all rather predictable but still a welcomed whisper of the future.</p>
<p>The current cost of 3D printing relegates it to the well-off hobbyist or successful small businesses. Most dads, for instance, cannot yet afford one to print game pieces with his son. On the flip side, most small businesses cannot afford the high sticker price of professional 3D printers to occupy space next to an aging HP OfficeJet.</p>
<p>But, as with most emerging technology, the report goes on to say that the gradual progression will move the devices from &#8220;niche adoption to broad acceptance, driven by lower printer prices, the potential for cost and time savings, greater capabilities, and improved performance that drives benefits and markets.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Businesses must continuously monitor advances to identify where improvements can be leveraged,” said Pete Basiliere, research director at Gartner, in a released statement. “We see 3D printing as a tool for empowerment, already enabling life-changing parts and products to be built-in struggling countries, helping rebuild crisis-hit areas and leading to the democratization of manufacturing.”</p>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s likely that even small businesses able to afford a 3D printer do not see a need for one. 3D printing is growing and expanding as new uses are constantly formed for the technology. In short most small businesses do not need a 3D printer yet.</p>
<p>At this point 3D printing still needs more than just a lower cost of entry. It needs an ecosystem. It needs a retail marketplace where designers can sell professional-level designs rather than just giving them away on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>. 3D printing needs local retailers and repair shops. It needs to make inroads into lower educational institutions (lower prices will help there). But 3D printing needs to get here. After all, it&#8217;s the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/huawei.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Image (1) huawei.jpg for post 352723" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Sprint Nextel and SoftBank have pledged not to use equipment from Chinese telecommunications company Huawei Technologies after they merge. Congressman Mike Rogers, a Republican state representative from Michigan who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said today that the two companies told him they would not use gear manufactured by Huawei in their networks.</p>
<p>The Chinese company has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/21/huawei-again-mulling-ipo-as-it-hits-back-against-accusations-of-espionage/">repeatedly had to fend off charges of espionage</a> in the past. Though an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-huawei-spying-idUSBRE89G1Q920121017">18-month White House-ordered review cleared Huawei</a> of spying for China, concerns over Chinese cyber-espionage have ramped up recently. Back in October, the House Intelligence Committee <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/us-panel-calls-huawei-and-zte-national-security-threat.html?pagewanted=all">said in a report</a> that equipment from Huawei and its main domestic rival ZTE can potentially give an opening for Chinese intelligence services to use U.S. telecommunications networks for spying. More recently, a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/new-u-s-cyber-security-law-may-hinder-lenovos-sales-growth/">provision</a> included in the funding bill signed into law by President Barack Obama this week requires U.S. federal law enforcement agencies to get approval before buying information technology systems made by Chinese companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have met with SoftBank and Sprint regarding this merger and was assured they would not integrate Huawei into the Sprint network and would take mitigation efforts to replace Huawei equipment in the Clearwire network,&#8221; Rogers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/softbank-sprint-said-by-us-lawmaker-to-make-huawei-pledge/2013/03/28/759abf78-97f0-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_story.html">said in an emailed statement </a>to the Washington Post. Sprint owns a share of Clearwire, which currently uses Huawei gear at the edges of it network, with its core network supplied by U.S. companies Cisco Systems and Ciena.</p>
<p>In response, Huawei spokesman William Plummer <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/softbank-sprint-said-by-us-lawmaker-to-make-huawei-pledge/2013/03/28/759abf78-97f0-11e2-b68f-dc5c4b47e519_story.html">told the Washington Post</a> &#8220;if government approval of the transaction is somehow contingent on an agreement to restrict purchase of equipment from any vendor based on the flag of heritage, then it is a sad day for free and open global trade, and it does nothing to secure the network. Everyone is global and every company faces the same cyber-challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sprint Nextel, the third largest U.S. carrier, and Tokyo-based Softbank are currently awaiting approval for<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/softbank-confirms-it-is-buying-70-sprint-for-20-1b/"> a proposed $20.1 billion merger </a>, and are being reviewed for national security implications by the Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.</p>

New direct-selling companies, however, are using social media to disrupt the industry. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chloeandisabel.com/">Chloe &amp; Isabel</a> is part of the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/14/direct-selling/">new wave of startups </a>currently re-defining direct selling, and giving people with an entrepreneurial bent&#8211;in particular young women&#8211;a way to leverage their social medial contacts into a business.</p>
<p>Launched in 2011 by Chantel Waterbury and based in New York City, Chloe &amp; Isabel stands out with a strong focus on branding, a selling platform with data analytics that integrates social media networks, and a business model that gives the company&#8217;s hand-picked merchandisers opportunities to move into management roles.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/backed-by-general-catalyst-partners-first-round-capital-chloe-isabel-offers-a-modern-tech-savvy-take-on-direct-selling/chloeisabel/" rel="attachment wp-att-788062"></a></p>
<p>Waterbury&#8217;s first experience with direct selling was during her freshman year of college when she sold Cutco knives door-to-door to pay her tuition. She became one of Cutco&#8217;s top sales representatives on the West Coast, selling almost $30,000 worth of knives in three months, and kept the gig for three years.</p>
<p>After graduating, Waterbury spent 14 years working in the fashion industry, developing jewelry brands for retailers including Target, Macy&#8217;s, Gap, LVMH, and Kenneth Cole. While on maternity leave, Waterbury began working on a business plan for a direct-selling startup that would target Generation Y college graduates, who were hit with particularly high rates of unemployment during the global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Thinking back on her own direct-selling experience, Waterbury realized that the industry could offer new opportunities for social media-savvy entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past 20 years, even the past 125 years, there hasn&#8217;t been any innovation within the industry. That shocked me,&#8221; said Waterbury. &#8220;I had experience building brands and I thought this is an opportunity to do something I love and, more important than that, create an opportunity for young women to become their own bosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chloe &amp; Isabel quickly gained traction among investors. The company has raised $11.75 million so far. That amount includes $3.25 million in a seed round led by First Round Capital, Floodgate Fund, and angel investors including SV Angel Ron Conway, Founder Collective’s Caterina Fake, Felicis Ventures’ Aydin Senkut, The Consigliere’s Mike Duda, Red Swan Ventures’ Andy Dunn, Forerunner Ventures’ Kirsten Green, and Ashton Kutcher, and a $8.5 million Series A round led by General Catalyst Partners.</p>
<p>Chloe &amp; Isabel finds its merchandisers by interviewing potential sellers, and only selects 10 percent of the people who apply. The company gets 70 percent of an item&#8217;s selling price, while the seller gets 30 percent cut.<br />
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/backed-by-general-catalyst-partners-first-round-capital-chloe-isabel-offers-a-modern-tech-savvy-take-on-direct-selling/screen-shot-2013-03-29-at-1-45-24-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-788066"></a><br />
Each seller gets access to a proprietary platform that helps them set up an online storefront, and leverage and monetize their online social capital with real-time data analytics that look at click-throughs from their blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest. Chloe &amp; Isabel&#8217;s strong emphasis on branding helps merchandisers attract buyers. The company is named after the two kinds of consumers the company wants to reach: &#8220;Chloe&#8221; is a fashion-forward trendsetter, while &#8220;Isabel&#8221; represents the brand&#8217;s more classic and timeless side.</p>
<p>Another way the company sets itself apart from traditional direct-selling models is by moving away from multi-level marketing.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a pyramid multi-level marketing compensation structure where you refer your friends, but then you no longer have a business because they&#8217;re also selling merchandise or getting it at a discount,&#8221; says Waterbury. &#8220;So that industry is plagued with incredibly high turnover in their sellers and it&#8217;s become a massive recruiting game.&#8221;</p>
<p>For consumers, the advantages of shopping with a Chloe &amp; Isabel merchandiser include getting exclusive designs (the company does not purchase &#8216;open-line&#8217; products from suppliers, meaning all jewelry is unique to the brand) and savings off retail prices because there is no middleman. Some sellers make almost all of their sales through their online boutiques, while others host Chloe &amp; Isabel events that they promote through their social networks. </p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, I see it as an omni-channel approach: offline, online, social retail,&#8221; says Waterbury. &#8220;However you want to sell it, it can happen in any channel.&#8221; </p>

Two years ago, if you'd have told me that an open-source, P2P currency would soon be a thriving, billion-dollar market, I would've told you that you were on a lonely bus headed to CrazyTown, U.S.A. But today, <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> officially became a crazy idea that's actually working.

Today, all the Bitcoin in circulation -- some 10.9 million of them -- have collectively crossed the billion-dollar mark. As it is wont to do, the value of Bitcoin (and its exchange rate) has fluctuated wildly today. At one point, it hit a dollar value around $78, then pushed into the mid-nineties. As of this minute, it's hovering around $90.

But today, <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a> officially became a crazy idea that&#8217;s actually working.</p>
<p>Today, all the Bitcoin in circulation &#8212; some 10.9 million of them &#8212; have collectively crossed the billion-dollar mark. As it is wont to do, the value of Bitcoin (and its exchange rate) has fluctuated wildly today. At one point, it hit a dollar value around $78, then pushed into the mid-nineties. As of this minute, it&#8217;s hovering around $90.</p>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s still a tiny fraction of Google&#8217;s market cap, but this is something &#8212; especially for a largely unregulated, decentralized virtual currency. (Say that three times fast.) The world&#8217;s most popular controversial crypto-currency, mind you.</p>
<p>Bitcoin supporters will scoff and tell you that this is no news, and that Bitcoin has been alive and thriving for years. In fact, it first appeared back in 2009, and has been slowly gaining steam since. But Bitcoin has largely remained outside the realm of mainstream media attention, because no one has been quite sure what to make of it. Is it a passing fad, a hilarious geek-driven phenomenon, or the real deal?</p>
<p>In fact, it has really been relegated to the realm of the super geeky, or seen as the currency of anarchists or crazy digital libertarians. The black market marketplace known as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">Silk Road</a>, which allows pretty much anyone to anonymously sell &#8220;alternative products&#8221; (i.e. large quantities of one&#8217;s drug of choice), uses Bitcoin for its currency. Something which hasn&#8217;t exactly helped Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;cross over&#8221; appeal.</p>
<p>And geeks have had a point: Eventually, with the increasing popularity of P2P networks, virtual currency and digital marketplaces, it was only a matter of time before these entities would collide and a virtual currency of record would emerge. No government control?! Even better!</p>
<p>Bitcoin crossing the $1 billion threshold may not seem like much, but if anything, it seems to be a sign to anyone listening that the crypto-currency is ready to be taken seriously. Of course, there are still a lot of concerns, as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/the-business-of-bitcoin-entrepreneurs-see-opportunities-in-alternative-currencies/">John Biggs laid out in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>But why has Bitcoin become a billion-dollar market?</p>
<p>First off, startups are beginning to carry the torch. As <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/expensify-now-offers-support-for-bitcoin-an-alternative-to-paypal-for-international-contractors/">Alex wrote yesterday</a>, Expensify announced that it is now supporting Bitcoin &#8220;to give international contractors an alternative to PayPal and the high fees associated with the service.&#8221; Reddit has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/14/reddit-starts-accepting-bitcoin-for-reddit-gold-purchases-thanks-to-partnership-with-coinbase/">jumped on the bandwagon</a>, too, along with WordPress and Namecheap, among others.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/tumblr_inline_mkeb25fa1h1qz4rgp.png"></a></p>
<p>Adam Draper, the founder of Menlo Park-based accelerator, Boost VC, recently announced that the team would be focusing on Bitcoin-focused startups for its summer class. As he <a target="_blank" href="http://adamdraper.com/post/46548165445/bitcoin-hits-one-thousand-million-why#_=_">laid out in a post today</a>, one of the other big reasons Bitcoin is beginning to take off &#8212; besides, of course, that it allows secure digital transactions without transmitting personal information &#8212; is that investor confidence is growing. Bitcoin startups are beginning to raise, and Draper claims that their fund is far from being the only one that&#8217;s interested.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the government has finally realized that it needs to start taking virtual currency seriously and develop a strategy for dealing with these types of currencies. FinCEN recently put out a series of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/pdf/FIN-2013-G001.pdf">&#8220;Guidelines,&#8221;</a> which will inform future regulation, but also works to establish trust and credibility for virtual currency, particularly Bitcoin.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the climate of the global financial markets, particularly the panic in Cyprus, after the government <a target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/25/news/economy/cyprus-bailout-banks/index.html">froze its citizens&#8217; bank accounts</a> following its bailout. Many believe that the tenuous financial markets in Europe and beyond create an atmosphere that&#8217;s ripe for a digital panacea like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Of course, the other side of the Bitcoin argument is that the perfect storm of unsteady financial markets, and skyrocketing growth of virtual currency (plus hype), is creating a perfect storm that equates to Bitcoin just being one giant bubble waiting to pop.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, as my colleague Greg Kumparak pointed out today, Bitcoin itself is still in a tenuous place, policy-wise. There&#8217;s a good chance that a decentralized, unregulated market is going to scare the pants off the government once it&#8217;s fully cognizant that Bitcoin is a billion-dollar market &#8212; and growing. &#8220;It&#8217;s the easiest &#8216;this funds terrorism&#8217; scare argument the government will ever try to make, so a big battle within the next year or two is pretty much guaranteed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Whether phenomenon or legitimate institution, Bitcoin is definitely making a bid for the latter &#8212; and one to be taken seriously. Either way, feel free to marvel at how a virtual currency that appeared practically out of thin air (created by some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/10/111010fa_fact_davis">phantom mathematician/economist</a>) just became a billion-dollar market.</p>
<p>See you on Silk Road?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/rocketspace.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Rocketspace" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Startups around the world are desperate for office space in the San Francisco Bay Area, so tomorrow <a target="_blank" href="http://rocket-space.com/">RocketSpace</a> will announce the lease of a new 50,000 sq. ft. office so it can house startups with up to 60 employees instead of capping them at 30. Along with this RocketSpace Suites project, the &#8220;office-as-a-service&#8221; plans to lock down another 100,000 sq. ft. spot and open a space in London this year.</p>
<p>RocketSpace currently provides plug-and-play office space for 130 startups and their 600 employees at a per-person, per-month rate. It lets founders concentrate on their businesses while RocketSpace handles leases, security, bandwidth, firewalls and other office hassles. Its relationships with venture capitalists and corporate accelerators have kept at least one of its residents securing funding every week, and it runs inspiring events featuring speakers like Peter Thiel and Vinod Khosla.</p>
<p>CEO Duncan Logan told me in a meeting today that one of RocketSpace&#8217;s biggest problems is that due to space contraints, &#8220;we kick out companies when they get to 3o employees.&#8221; Fast-rising startups like Uber, Spotify, Kabam, and Leap Motion have all gotten the boot. It&#8217;s also receiving far more qualified applicants than it has room for. RocketSpace needed more, well, space. Meanwhile, its current real estate is literally about to get steamrolled. Tomorrow, the city of San Francisco will announce RocketSpace&#8217;s current 181 Fremont location will be demolished to make way for a new <a target="_blank" href="http://transbaycenter.org/">Transbay Tower</a> transportation hub.</p>
<p>So after a year of searching, tomorrow RocketSpace will announce the lease of a 50,000 sq. ft. space just north of Market Street at 180 Sansome. Eventually it hopes to take over that whole tower. But RocketSpace Suites is just the start of its expansion. It&#8217;s currently looking at a 90,000 sq. ft. Bay Area space to replace the Fremont home it will have to vacate. Logan says it will be able to host 2,000 people in its combined 140,000 sq. ft. space. By the end of 2013 RocketSpace plans to have added a London space. And even though it&#8217;s completely bootstrapped, after that it&#8217;s eying Tel Aviv, Berlin, and Vancouver for additional locations.</p>
<p>Logan says RocketSpace aspires to become an &#8220;innovation campus&#8221; that he calls a &#8220;Stanford for startups.&#8221; He explains that &#8220;young companies are like young people. They&#8217;re a product of their environment. We can build the best possible environment for startups.&#8221; By surrounding themselves with similarly ambitious makers, Logan believes startups can be more creative and productive.</p>
<p>Just watch out for your neighbors poaching your engineers.</p>

The company is announcing that its $99 console will be available on June 4 (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/the-99-ouya-console-will-make-its-retail-debut-in-the-us-uk-and-canada-on-june-4/">the news leaked a little early</a>), and it's also holding a big unveiling party in San Francisco tonight.

We actually met with founder and CEO Julie Uhrman yesterday, where she gave us a quick peek at the final hardware and at the actual interface. My main impression of the (Yves Behar-designed) hardware: Despite the low price point, it looks great.

<p>Today is a big day for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ouya.com">OUYA</a>, the Kickstarter-backed, Android-based game console. The company is announcing that its $99 console will be available on June 4 (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/the-99-ouya-console-will-make-its-retail-debut-in-the-us-uk-and-canada-on-june-4/">the news leaked a little early</a>), and it&#8217;s also holding a big unveiling party in San Francisco tonight.</p>
<p>We actually met with founder and CEO Julie Uhrman yesterday, and she gave us a quick peek at the final hardware and at the actual interface. My main impression of the (Yves Behar-designed) hardware: Despite the low price point, it looks great. My main impression of the interface: OUYA really is trying to make it as easy-to-use as possible. That simplicity is important because OUYA isn&#8217;t just aiming for hardcore gamers. It&#8217;s also trying to create a console for a broader audience and to offer a more diverse set of games.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve really opened up the last closed platform, which is the television,&#8221; Uhrman said.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/ouyas-julie-uhrman-unveils-the-android-consoles-interface-and-games/rkgrgxvbgiczby-srnikpelzr2csan3baf554j5a2tu/" rel="attachment wp-att-788010"></a><br />
One of the most impressive things is the fact that OUYA was just an idea nine months ago. I asked Uhrman how close the product is to her initial idea, and she said, &#8220;Surprisingly, it&#8217;s very close. We knew what we wanted to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, the key to a great game platform is great games. There are more than 8,000 developers who have signed up to create OUYA games, including Square Enix, Inc., Double Fine Productions, Tripwire Interactive, Vlambeer, Phil Fish’s Polytron Corporation, and Kim Swift’s Airtight Games. You&#8217;ll get a few glimpses of the games in the video — Uhrman said the one she&#8217;s addicted to right now is Stalagfight, which is also showcasing a new monetization model, where gamers just donate however much they think the game is worth. (OUYA games have to have a free-to-play option, but other than that monetization is up to the publisher or developer.)</p>

<p>Uhrman also confirmed that the company plans to release an OUYA 2 next year. She said OUYA will follow a release cycle that&#8217;s closer to that of mobile phones than game consoles, but without adding a bunch of expensive hardware that isn&#8217;t necessary for the current set of games: &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a tempered, thoughtful release cycle.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/jonathan-fay-and-wwt.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Jonathan Fay and WWT" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>The Microsoft Research team is building an epic map of the universe using data and photographs collected from the many telescopes around the world, including NASA&#8217;s Hubble Space Telescope. They call it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/Home.aspx">The WorldWide Telescope</a>.</p>
<p>There are roughly 300 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, and about the same number of galaxies in our universe (give or take a couple). With the WorldWide Telescope, scientists and developers have pieced together a detailed 3D view of the universe that lets a user do a fly by of any planet, star or galaxy known to man. You can even view the entire universe in a single frame, which makes us all seem insanely insignificant.</p>
<p>But the WorldWide Telescope is more than just a neat exploration tool for astronomy and physics nerds. Program Director Dan Fay hopes NASA can use it as a research tool and that students from the elementary to graduate levels can use it as an educational resource. The Microsoft Research team has made it simple to manipulate data on a touch surface or desktop. With the touch of a couple of buttons and pinch to zoom, you&#8217;re off and flying through the universe. The team plans to bring this magic to mobile devices soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft has also released an API to allow developers to build custom tours and lessons. I was fortunate enough to be given a tour of the nebula of the Milky Way Galaxy, and admittedly it was beautiful. The lessons can be as simple as a fly by of every planet in our solar system, or as complicated as analyzing photographs of the deepest known space objects. The map also lets you look at any part of the sky in a number of light wavelengths, including infrared and X-ray.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After the demo, I took a tour of a scale model of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, which is due to launch in 2018. The telescope is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble and about seven times as big. It includes a 21-foot reflective mirror and a slew of instruments to study the sky.</p>
<p>NASA hopes to look through dust clouds surrounding the formation of stars using the onboard infrared instruments to finally see how stars are born and to look far enough through the universe that they will get a better sense of how all of this madness is shaped. It will also be able to detect water vapor in atmospheres outside our solar system, and where there is water, there&#8217;s a significant chance at life.</p>
<p>(mind = blown).</p>

They stayed pretty vague about the two things I was most curious about — how the deal came together, and the specifics of the planned Kindle/Goodreads integrations — but they did drop a few hints about future plans.

Chandler (pictured here with his co-founder and wife Elizabeth) said that Kindle integration has been a popular request among Goodreads users, and Grandinetti said he wants to make it "super easy" to have a social experience on the Kindle device and apps. As for what that will look like, he said, "We prefer to talk about features when we ship."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/1364500205-1364500205_goodreads_misc1.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="otis and elizabeth chandler" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Following this afternoon&#8217;s announcement that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/amazon-acquires-social-reading-site-goodreads/">Amazon has agreed to acquire Goodreads</a>, I had a few minutes to talk to the Goodreads CEO Otis Chandler and Amazon VP of Kindle Content Russ Grandinetti. They stayed pretty vague about the two things I was most curious about — how the deal came together, and the specifics of the planned Kindle/Goodreads integrations — but they did drop a few hints about future plans.</p>
<p>Chandler (pictured here with his co-founder and wife Elizabeth) said that Kindle integration has been a popular request among Goodreads users, and Grandinetti said he wants to make it &#8220;super easy&#8221; to have a social experience on the Kindle device and apps. As for what that will look like, he said, &#8220;We prefer to talk about features when we ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the points highlighted by TechCrunch&#8217;s Drew Olanoff when he covered the news was the fact that this gives Amazon a social advantage over its e-bookselling competitors, particularly Apple. When I asked if the Amazon acquisition precludes building Goodreads integrations with non-Kindle devices, Grandinetti said the Amazon team &#8220;worked hard at Kindle to make the app work on iOS and Android,&#8221; so you&#8217;ll be able to access Goodreads features on, for example, your iPad through the Kindle app. (That doesn&#8217;t take away from Drew&#8217;s point, which was more about the iBookstore. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Amazon has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/25/amazon-aquires-shelfari-moves-to-corner-social-book-space/">acquired a social reading startup before, Shelfari</a>, and that hasn&#8217;t led to big breakthroughs on the social front.)</p>
<p>I asked if Goodreads will continue to be closely integrated with Facebook, or if it&#8217;s going to be building more of a standalone social experience on Amazon. Chandler replied that Facebook &#8220;will continue to be an important part of Goodreads — our mission is to help people express themselves through what&#8217;s on their bookshelves,&#8221; and leveraging Facebook&#8217;s enormous user base makes it easier to do that.</p>
<p>Chandler also wrote in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family">his blog post about the acquisition</a> that Goodreads will &#8220;continue offering you everything that you love about the site.&#8221; For one thing, he told me that the entire Goodreads team will be staying on, and that it will remain in San Francisco. He said it will operate as an independent subsidiary similar to &#8220;how Zappos and IMDb are run.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to keep hiring and and growing the team,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Amazon and Goodreads have had some bumps in their relationship in the past — most notably, back in January of last year, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/338-goodreads-transitions-to-new-data-sources">Goodreads switched</a> from Amazon to Ingram as its primary source of book data, because Amazon&#8217;s data &#8220;came with many restrictions.&#8221; When I brought that up today, Grandinetti said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think any side took any pleasure at the point that [Goodreads] stopped using the API.&#8221; Now is the chance to bring Amazon data back to Goodreads and to &#8220;explore whole new areas of discovery and reading,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Chandler added that one of the downsides of moving away from Amazon was the loss of international data. With the acquisition, Goodreads will have access to that data again.</p>
<p>Speaking of APIs, <a target="_blank" href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/28/first-do-no-harm-my-interview-with-amazon-and-goodreads-on-the-future-of-goodreads/">Chandler said in another interview</a> that Goodreads will continue to offer its own public API and to continue offering a review feed to Kobo.</p>

Back then, the AVOS team said it was relaunching Delicious &#8220;back to beta,&#8221; but Delicious hasn&#8217;t made all that many waves since then, nor has it added all that many features to the relaunched service. But after four months of slumber, the Delicious blog sprung into action today and launched a few new features that could make the site a bit more interesting for those of us who long ago abandoned social bookmarking for social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Indeed, today&#8217;s update is all about Twitter and Facebook: Delicious added the ability to log in with your credentials for those two social networks and connect. It&#8217;s now easier to use Delicious to automatically save all those links you share on Facebook and shared and favorited on Twitter directly on Delicious, too. Delicious acquired the link-saving startup Trunk.ly to power this feature in November 2011 and turned it on for Twitter last March and for Facebook in July. Using Twitter and Facebook logins isn&#8217;t exactly innovative, but it does point toward a more social future for Delicious, especially in combination with the new &#8220;Friend Finder&#8221; tool that lets you friend and follow people you know on Twitter and Facebook. The team also made other small improvements &#8211; the bookmarklet and site now load faster, for example, but the main feature Delicious power users will surely appreciate is that every link now includes a &#8220;first saver&#8221; attribution. I&#8217;m not sure that any of this will really rescue Delicious from its current obscurity. Saving the links you share on social networks doesn&#8217;t exactly feel like the hot new thing, after all. It&#8217;s good to see a sign of life out of Delicious, however, and if Digg is still around and kicking, why shouldn&#8217;t del.icio.us be, too?]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/facebook-android-clean.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="facebook-android Clean" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Facebook just invited press to an event at its headquarters on April 4th to &#8220;Come See Our New Home On Android&#8221;. Sources tell us it will be a modified version of the Android operating system with deep native Facebook functionality on the homescreen that may live on an HTC handset. The evidence aligns to say this is the Facebook Phone announcement people have been speculating about for years.</p>
<p>One source recently told us to be on the look out for a Facebook mobile press event in early April where the social network would reveal an altered Android OS running on HTC. It&#8217;s said not to be a full-on rewrite of Android, but rather a &#8220;flavor&#8221; that will have all sorts of extra Facebook functionality built in. We&#8217;ve also heard it referred to as an &#8220;application layer&#8221;. Imagine Facebook&#8217;s integration with iOS 6, but on steroids, and built by Facebook itself. It could have a heavy reliance on Facebook&#8217;s native apps like Messenger, easy social sharing from anywhere on the phone, and more.</p>
<p>Rumors we&#8217;ve heard say that the project could actually be called &#8220;Facebook Home&#8221;, and it&#8217;s hallmark would be a heavily Facebook-ified mobile phone home screen. This could include Facebook news feed stories and data splayed out right on the home screen, along with easy access to Facebook apps.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve received the invite to this supposed event we were told to watch for, and other signs seem to verify what our sources are saying. The announcement would align with what <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/12/facebook-phone-yes-again/">MG Siegler reported</a> in January. It looks like MG might have been right about what was happening, but just with the wrong timing. It syncs up with <a target="_blank" href="http://9to5google.com/2013/03/28/facebook-smartphone-with-htc-launching-soon-ad-campaign-in-the-works/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9to5Google+%289to5+Google+-+Beyond+Good+and+Evil%29">9To5Google&#8217;s new report</a> that Facebook and HTC have been developing a joint ad campaign.</p>
<p>Finally, it meshes with <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20111121/the-facebook-phone-its-finally-real-and-its-name-is-buffy/">AllThingsD</a>&#8216;s 2011 report that Facebook was building a phone with HTC. However, one source says that several key members of the Facebook OS team have left the company including <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/dropbox-rasmus-andersson-designer/">Rasmus Andersson</a> who recently went to Dropbox. That may have prompted Facebook to scale back its ambitions from true fork of Android to this more subtle modification.</p>
<p>In addition to a modified OS, I think Facebook could launch a more basic homescreen replacement similar to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.androidcentral.com/soho-social-homescreen-launcher-hits-play-store-beta">SO.HO</a>, Nova, or Go launcher for Android that would be compatible with standard versions of Android. This would give users a Facebook-heavy homescreen experience with much of the features described above, but without deeper operating system hooks and data access. As a complement to its modified OS, this Facebook Home Launcher would let Facebook&#8217;s new mobile developments extend to a wider range of devices beyond HTC. If Facebook really wanted to play it safe it could reveal this launcher instead of an OS modification, but more likely I see it as way for its work to gain greater reach.</p>
<p>Some think Facebook may be too small and young of a company to manufacture its own devices without thoroughly distracting itself, but it&#8217;s already got many building blocks of a mobile operating system. Its recent <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/03/facebook-voice-messaging/">developments around VoIP</a> could let it develop a Phone app alternative. When possible, Facebook could route calls over its self-built open sourced Skype alternative, and use normal a cellular connection if a call&#8217;s recipient isn&#8217;t equipped with the right Facebook app.</p>
<p>With deeper control of a modified operating system would come huge opportunities to collect data on its users. Facebook knows that who you SMS and call are important indicators of who your closest friends are. Its own version of Android could give it that info, which could be used to refine everything from what content you&#8217;re shown in the news feed to which friends faces are used in ads you see.</p>
<p>This announcement might not be a Facebook Phone, but rather a Facebook phone &#8212; one where everything the user sees is social by design, even if the handset&#8217;s innards are made by someone else.</p>

This week a new unauthorized comic book about him was released, called &#8220;Jack Dorsey: Co-Founder of Twitter #1&#8243;. Check out these page scans posted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=15876">Comic Book Resources</a> that preview his quest to recover stolen quantum networking technology.</p>
<p>In the first issue from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluewaterprod.com/">BlueWater Productions</a> now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Jack-Dorsey-co-founder-Twitter-ebook/dp/B00C0K1PI4">available on Kindle</a>, Dorsey hunts for the kidnapped inventor of the futuristic computer chip that could power &#8220;the Internet&#8217;s next evolution.&#8221; Along the way are plenty of cheesy, dumbed-down references to how Twitter and Square are changing the world.</p>
<p>There are also some subtle references to Jack&#8217;s quirky personality, like his preference for taking the bus, plus a goofy scene where he mind-melds with a bison. Oh, and he battles a robot spider.</p>
<p>Dorsey isn&#8217;t the only tech superstar immortalized in a graphic novel. BlueWater has also made comic books about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluewaterprod.com/news/stevejobs_announce.php">Steve Jobs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=7340">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=12032">Bill Gates</a>, and Google co-founders <a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=15081">Larry and Sergey</a>. It all might seem ridiculous, but who would you rather have kids looking up to? Fictional caped crusaders? Or real inventors and entrepreneurs?</p>

<p>So TechCrunch TV headed there in person a little while back to see how things are going and tell a bit of the story in video form. The first part of this published last month in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/10/a-walk-through-downtown-las-vegas-where-a-new-generation-of-startups-is-taking-root-tctv/">our walking tour with Zach Ware</a>, one of the most prominent people in the Downtown Project movement. And now in the video embedded above, you can get a more comprehensive look at Downtown Vegas of yesteryear and today, and hear Hsieh and other people involved talk about their vision for the area&#8217;s future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/ouya.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="ouya" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Didn&#8217;t get a chance to back the ambitious <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ouya.tv/">OUYA Android game console</a> to lock in your pre-order? Considering how much press the thing has gotten, you don&#8217;t have much excuse for missing that particular window, but never fear &#8212; OUYA intends to sell the $99 pint-sized gaming gadget through retail partners like Amazon, Gamestop, and Best Buy starting on June 4.</p>
<p>The folks at<a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/05/ouya-retail-best-buy-amazon-gamestop-june-99/"> Engadget</a> obtained the full press release, which goes on to note that Android gamers in the U.K. and Canada would be able to pick up an OUYA that same day. Of course by then most (if not all) of the people who shelled out money when the project was in its early stages will have already received their devices. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4158156/ouya-will-be-available-in-retail-stores-on-june-4th-for-99-99">The Verge</a> points out that OUYA began passing shipping notifications to its users earlier today.</p>
<p>While the hardware inches ever closer to its mass-market release, there&#8217;s still a question of content to contend with. OUYA hasn&#8217;t provided much insight on how many game submissions it&#8217;s received since it began accepting them a few weeks back, though quite a few developers have already <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ouya_software">thrown their weight</a> behind the little console that could.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a tendency for some gamers to cling to proven hits from years gone by, which is why it comes as no surprise to see some developers taking up the task of making the OUYA a first-rate emulation device. It was revealed earlier this week that NES, SNES, and Nintendo 64 emulators would be available in OUYA&#8217;s storefront at launch. And emulator developer Robert Broglia <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/ouya-could-become-emulation-destination-with-new-projects-covering-game-boy-genesis-neogeo-and-more/">confirmed yesterday</a> that he plans to bring his existing Android emulators for consoles like the TurboGrafx-16 and Sega Saturn (!) to the OUYA before too long.</p>
<p>The OUYA&#8217;s journey from kooky idea to full-fledged product has been a long one, and it&#8217;s not over yet. Getting the device onto store shelves is certainly a milestone for the young company, but the true test lays in how run-of-the-mill consumers will react to it. Granted, its price point may give it a leg up on more prominent rivals like the Xbox 360, Wii U, or PlayStation 3, but we&#8217;ll soon see if the gamers of the world wind up warming to it.</p>

The new ads, which are being introduced through a partnership with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flurry.com">Flurry</a>, will appear in the Live Stream, offering a more "native" approach, Cook said: "This is the first time we are placing ads within the context of the application itself, where the user encounters advertising while scrolling.

<p>CEO Geoff Cook told me via email that the app was already running ads, for example at the top of the screen, but its mobile monetization efforts have been more focused on payments. The new ads, which are being introduced through a partnership with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flurry.com">Flurry</a>, will appear in the Live Stream, offering a more &#8220;native&#8221; approach, Cook said: &#8220;This is the first time we are placing ads within the context of the application itself, where the user encounters advertising while scrolling. The ads look and feel more like content with social cues like ratings and comments surfaced.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of companies are talking about native ads nowadays, and the format can be particularly important in a mobile context, where there&#8217;s not a lot of screen space for extra banners. For example, the screenshot below will probably remind you of the ads in Facebook&#8217;s mobile news feed. (I&#8217;ve also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/namo-media-seed-round/">written about a startup called Namo Media</a>, which is all about introducing native ads into news feeds.)</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/meetme-flurry-ads/iphone_feed_promo3-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-787838"></a></p>
<p>When I asked how MeetMe&#8217;s approach differs from Facebook&#8217;s, Cook said:</p>
<blockquote><p>While I think today our native feed advertising solution is inspired by Facebook&#8217;s in many ways, I expect it to evolve differently in 2 key ways. First, we will be launching incented app-install feed advertising units in the next few months, leveraging the strength of MeetMe credits. MeetMe credits have helped make MeetMe one of the top-grossing social apps on both iPhone and Android, and our users clearly demand them.</p>
<p>Also, we don&#8217;t view these native units as limited to being placed in the Feed. We view them as contextual units and may expand them, with some UI changes, to other popular areas of the app where the user scrolls the mobile screen like our Photoboard and Messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>MeetMe says its live feed is now seeing 2 million posts per day.</p>

MyTown and MyTown 2 attempted to evolve the location-based check-in model in gaming, allowing users not only check into locations within a city-building sim, but also scan and check into products in the real world.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/17/booyahs-mytown-hits-3-1-million-users/">early success of MyTown</a> and, to a lesser degree, its location-based riff on Second Life, InCrowd, Booyah has been able to raise nearly $30 million to date in three rounds, with the most recent being its $20 million Series C from Accel, Kleiner Perkins’ iFund and DAG Ventures &#8212; in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p>Since then, however, Booyah hasn&#8217;t been able to sustain the early success of MyTown, leading to some big changes this week. First, Booyah is getting a new CEO. Chief Creative Officer and co-founder Brian Morrisroe will be taking the reins this week, replacing Jason Willig, the former EA and Hasbro exec who had been acting as CEO since co-founder Keith Lee stepped down in 2011. </p>
<p>Morrisroe tells us that Willig will be stepping back into an advisory role and will no longer be involved in day-to-day operations, though he will continue to advise the company on game development and strategy.</p>
<p>The management shuffle comes as a result of a broader, more fundamental directional shift for Booyah. The startup likely raised too much money too early and had a difficult time deciding on which platforms to attack, without diluting efficacy or over-extending. Now, having seen the emergence of tablet gaming, the new CEO says, which is defined by longer sessions, takes place at home, and now that connected play is appealing to more traditional core and mid-core gamers, Booyah is &#8220;shifting focus to this huge opportunity,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue releasing our products on many mobile devices, but focusing efforts on tablets first gives us the best opportunity to deliver exceptional, original experiences to our users,&#8221; he continued. </p>
<p>Morrisroe is stepping into the CEO&#8217;s chair to lead the company in its new direction, and, although Willig will now only be advising the company, the rest of the leadership will remain intact, including co-founder and CTO Sam Christiansen.</p>
<p>In addition to its change in leadership and direction, Booyah has also made some significant reductions to its staff. We&#8217;ve been hearing from sources this week that Booyah had made as much as an 80 percent reduction in its staff as a result of these changes. After some digging, this estimate may be a bit high, but it&#8217;s fairly close. While the co-founders would not give specifics, Morrisroe did say that (as of today) the company does have about 20 employees. And <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/19/booyah-reinvents-itself-and-the-pets-genre-with-pet-town/">as of January of last year</a>, Booyah had about 50 employees, so it&#8217;s at least a 60 percent reduction of its staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;These moves are always difficult, but it&#8217;s about positioning the company for future success,&#8221; Morrisroe said via email, &#8220;and we believe moving aggressively toward the emerging tablet market provides the biggest opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>While layoffs, management changes and pivots don&#8217;t a success story make, the co-founders did say that they have some new, original games in development that will be tailored to the tablet gameplay experience and continue to push its evolution forward.</p>
<p>As of today, Booyah has a total install base of around 25 million users across its portfolio,  which includes the MyTown, Early Bird and No Zombies Allowed franchises. The company also saw strong revenue growth last year, Morrisroe says &#8212; about 5x from 2011 to 2012, although he wouldn&#8217;t say more. </p>

Specific terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed and it should close by the end of Q2. Goodreads had raised $2.75 million in funding from the likes of True Ventures since launching in January 2007. When we talked to them last August, the site had over 10 million members and had catalogued more than 360 million books, adding 22 million each month. Now, the site boasts over 16 million users. This type of social integration could give Amazon a major advantage over e-sellers like Apple, who have no social components to their product whatsoever. With people actually discussing and sharing the books that they&#8217;re into, having an Amazon direct connect makes complete sense. The site can offer special deals to Goodreads users, which in essence is now Amazon&#8217;s book-reading social network. Here&#8217;s a look at the spike in books added per month in a graph from last August. With a connection to Kindle, those numbers will skyrocket: Amazon VP of Kindle content, Russ Grandinetti discussed how important this integration could be for its e-book division: Amazon and Goodreads share a passion for reinventing reading. Goodreads has helped change how we discover and discuss books and, with Kindle, Amazon has helped expand reading around the world. In addition, both Amazon and Goodreads have helped thousands of authors reach a wider audience and make a better living at their craft.

Specific terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed and it should close by the end of Q2.</p>
<p>Goodreads had raised $2.75 million in funding from the likes of True Ventures since launching in January 2007. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/13/goodreads-10-million-members/">When we talked to them last August</a>, the site had over 10 million members and had catalogued more than 360 million books, adding 22 million each month. Now, the site boasts over 16 million users.</p>
<p>This type of social integration could give Amazon a major advantage over e-sellers like Apple, who have no social components to their product whatsoever. With people actually discussing and sharing the books that they&#8217;re into, having an Amazon direct connect makes complete sense. The site can offer special deals to Goodreads users, which in essence is now Amazon&#8217;s book-reading social network.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the spike in books added per month in a graph from last August. With a connection to Kindle, those numbers will skyrocket:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/books-added-by-month.png"></a></p>
<p>Amazon VP of Kindle content, Russ Grandinetti discussed how important this integration could be for its e-book division:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon and Goodreads share a passion for reinventing reading. Goodreads has helped change how we discover and discuss books and, with Kindle, Amazon has helped expand reading around the world. In addition, both Amazon and Goodreads have helped thousands of authors reach a wider audience and make a better living at their craft. Together we intend to build many new ways to delight readers and authors alike.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goodreads&#8217; CEO and co-founder Otis Chandler discussed the acquisition and the opportunity for the site to infuse some social elements into Amazon&#8217;s bookselling strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Books – and the stories and ideas captured inside them – are part of our social fabric. People love to talk about ideas and share their passion for the stories they read. I’m incredibly excited about the opportunity to partner with Amazon and Kindle. We’re now going to be able to move faster in bringing the Goodreads experience to millions of readers around the world. We’re looking forward to inspiring greater literary discussion and helping more readers find great books, whether they read in print or digitally.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goodreads has also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/413-exciting-news-about-goodreads-we-re-joining-the-amazon-family">posted its own note on its blog</a>, going a bit deeper into why the deal makes sense and making it clear that Kindle integration is a top priority, as it&#8217;s something that users had been asking for. Chandler said:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/1364500205-1364500205_goodreads_misc.png"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m excited about this for three reasons:</p>
<p>1. With the reach and resources of Amazon, Goodreads can introduce more readers to our vibrant community of book lovers and create an even better experience for our members.</p>
<p>2. Our members have been asking us to bring the Goodreads experience to an e-reader for a long time. Now we&#8217;re looking forward to bringing Goodreads to the most popular e-reader in the world, Kindle, and further reinventing what reading can be.</p>
<p>3. Amazon supports us continuing to grow our vision as an independent entity, under the Goodreads brand and with our unique culture.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to bringing more social to Amazon, Goodreads has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/28/goodreads-recommendation-engine-acquisition-gooses-the-publishing-game/">built some recommendation technology</a> over the years, which is something Amazon always froths at the mouth for.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screenshot_3_28_13_2_08_pm.png"></a></p>
<p>The closest that Apple has come to socializing the sale of digital goods was Ping, its music &#8220;social network&#8221; that never took off and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/so-long-to-apples-music-social-network-ping-we-hardly-knew-ye/">died last October</a>. If Amazon were to acquire sites like Goodreads for each massive vertical, the company could really ramp up reviews, suggestions and of course, sales. The amount of data that Goodreads has on its users alone makes the acquisition a slam dunk. People love to talk about books, people are creating groups on Goodreads to discuss the books they read, and that means everyone has to buy the book to participate.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/apple-highlights-self-published-authors-frames-ibooks-as-a-viable-kindle-direct-publishing-alternative/">recently got into promoting self-published authors</a>, which is another area where social can really kick up sales for Amazon.</p>
<p>The company also shared an interesting stat, which might have sealed the deal for Amazon:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last 90 days, Goodreads members have added more than four books per second to the “want to read” shelves on Goodreads.</p></blockquote>
<p>With over 16 million users? You do the math.</p>

The attack, which is still underway, began yesterday, resulting in either limited or no availability to the company&#8217;s website, Dwolla.com.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.dwolla.com/information-updates/">a brief message posted to Dwolla&#8217;s blog</a>, the company says that the event is still ongoing, and is preventing people from viewing the site and accessing Dwolla&#8217;s service. Also affected are third-party developers, who are using the company&#8217;s APIs to integrate Dwolla&#8217;s payment technologies into their own sites and services.</p>
<p>These developers were notified today, and Dwolla says that it&#8217;s working with service providers to resolve the issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/dwolla-latest-victim-of-ddos-attacks-started-yesterday-continue-today/dwolla-down/" rel="attachment wp-att-787782"></a></p>
<p>Responding in the comments section of the post, the company told concerned users and developers that the consumer-facing API is unavailable at present, but as far as the company knows right now, actual fraud is not involved &#8211; that is, there&#8217;s no risk to users&#8217; money, nor will this have affected transactions that took place before the attacks began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funds are fine, and we do have our fraud team actively monitoring the entire situation,&#8221; wrote a Dwolla company representative, addressing a commenter&#8217;s complaint.</p>
<p>The company says that the attack is actually affecting its hosting provider, and they&#8217;re unsure at this time if it&#8217;s related to <a target="_blank" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/when-spammers-go-to-war-behind-the-spamhaus-ddos/">the SpamHaus situation</a>.</p>
<p>One of the service providers that Dwolla is working with is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, the Internet security firm that&#8217;s stepped in to protect a number of companies in the wake of these recent attacks. (You can see a CloudFlare message appear upon visiting the Dwolla.com domain at present).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/technology/internet/online-dispute-becomes-internet-snarling-attack.html">The New York Times</a> quoted CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince this week, who equated the DDoS attacks to the Internet&#8217;s version of a &#8220;nuclear bomb.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5992652">Gizmodo later followed up</a> on this report and another from the BBC, downplaying the scale of the attacks &#8211; they&#8217;re not affecting the entire Internet, Gizmodo claims.</p>
<p>Full text of the Dwolla.com blog post below, in case you&#8217;re unable to pull it up yourself (or choose not to, out of kindness):</p>
<p><em><strong>Dwolla.com updates </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Yesterday afternoon, Dwolla’s service providers became the victim of a distributed denial of service event, resulting in limited or no availability to the website, Dwolla.com.</em></p>
<p><em>This advanced event, still persists today, and is preventing people from viewing the website and consequently accessing its services. We apologize for this inconvenience and are working hard with our service providers to resolve the issue.</em></p>
<p><em>In the meantime, we will continue to update this post with more details.</em></p>
<p><em>(UPDATE 1:50pm CT: Third-party developers have been formally notified of the service interruption. Our team continues to work closely with service providers.)</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

Unlike their brasher, Angry Birds-making brethren a 15-minute drive away in Espoo, they don&#8217;t like to talk much about anything beyond making games and about the company culture they&#8217;re deliberately cultivating. All of this belies what has become a phenomenal business over the last nine months &#8212; one that makes around $1.3 million per day off two iOS games called Clash of Clans and Hay Day. After about three months of considering whether to do a huge secondary round with the help of boutique investment bank Code Advisors, we&#8217;ve heard they sold somewhere between 16 and 20 percent of the company&#8217;s common shares in a deal that would value the company at around $800 million. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out the exact amount. It&#8217;s somewhere between $100 and 150 million, but closer to the lower end of the range. We heard they got close, but didn&#8217;t quite get to a $1 billion valuation, not that this should be the goal anyways. Supercell declined to comment on the financing round. &#8220;We simply will not comment on market rumours,&#8221; said spokesperson Heini Vesander. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never really done that and will not do that now.&#8221; We&#8217;ve heard that Institutional Venture Partners, Atomico and Index Ventures are the new investors. Tencent and DST had done some due diligence on the company in February, but didn&#8217;t end up going in for whatever reason. Index declined to comment, and Atomico and IVP did not reply for comment. It&#8217;s a bold, ballsy bet for what is basically a two-product company in a notoriously hits-driven business. While the macro trends behind mobile gaming are hard to argue with, the business is unpredictable. Several of the companies that were leading the charts two years ago are now much farther down, even if their businesses are still profitable. Last year, the whisper numbers for top grossing titles ranged in the $40-80 million range annually. At around $1 million a day, the industry is looking at mobile gaming franchises that could gross between $200 and 400 million in 2013.  A few days ago, Japanese carrier Softbank increased its stake in Gung Ho Entertainment, the maker of what is probably the most valuable iOS game in the world today &#8212; Japan&#8217;s Puzzles and Dragons.

Several of the companies that were leading the charts two years ago are now much farther down, even if their businesses are still profitable. Last year, the whisper numbers for top grossing titles ranged in the $40-80 million range annually. At around $1 million a day, the industry is looking at mobile gaming franchises that could gross between $200 and 400 million in 2013. </p>
<p>A few days ago, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.softbank.co.jp/en/news/press/2013/20130325_01/">Japanese carrier Softbank increased its stake in Gung Ho Entertainment</a>, the maker of what is probably the most valuable iOS game in the world today &#8212; Japan&#8217;s Puzzles and Dragons. That deal valued that company at $4.1 billion, and Gung Ho&#8217;s financials <a target="_blank" href="http://www.serkantoto.com/2013/03/27/gungho-puzzle-dragons-february-sales/">suggested that that single mobile game made between $62 and 86 million in a mere 28 days last month</a>. </p>
<p>So when you have a hit, it&#8217;s insane. But how many businesses can keep it up?</p>
<h3>A Tight Culture</h3>
<p>Supercell didn&#8217;t find its hits until two years after it was founded. Before it unveiled Clash of Clans in the middle of last year, it had to kill several early projects like Gunshine and Battle Buddies that weren&#8217;t testing well.</p>
<p>That said, the company has a very seasoned team. The company&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ilkkapaananen">CEO Ilkka Paananen</a> built early feature-phone gaming company Sumea and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalchocolate.com/digital-chocolate-acquires-sumea-interactive-leading-european-mobile-content-publisher/">sold it to Digital Chocolate back in the early 2000s</a>, and went on to create and lead Digital Chocolate&#8217;s Finland studio for several years. Because of his reputation in the local Scandinavian gaming community, Accel Partners took a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/26/supercell-raises-12m-from-accel-partners-to-power-social-web-games/">21.6 percent stake in the company in a $12 million round back</a> in 2011. This was well before Supercell had even launched its first game, which is a big sign of faith from a top-tier fund in the team.</p>
<p>So far, he&#8217;s built the company carefully. Even though the company raked in somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million per day this past fall and winter, Supercell only grew its headcount by slightly over 20 people in the last four months. In contrast, Zynga was adding at least a person a day through its heady growth period in 2010 and 2011 &#8212; which made it harder to manage and preserve the company&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>Supercell looks for self-directed people who have long histories in game design and development. Basically, people who are genuinely into the craft. Each team or &#8220;cell&#8221; in the company is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/21/supercell/">small by design and operates mostly autonomously</a>. Their monster hit Clash of Clans was built by five people and is now supported by a roughly 10-person team.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s roughly 90 employees are intensely loyal to Paananen. They crack open the champagne bottles for all the games that they kill, just the way they do for the ones that succeed. In a recent company party, Paananen was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.539564182755579.1073741825.126192814092720&amp;type=3">giving a boring all-hands talk when the office lights suddenly shut down</a> and a bunch of paid actors staged a fake zombie invasion to chase everyone out of the office. (Really. See below.)</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/supercell-2/supercell-zombies/" rel="attachment wp-att-787678"></a></p>
<h3>To Secondary Or Not To Secondary?</h3>
<p>The other thing to note is that this is yet another big round where founders and early stakeholders are likely taking cash off the table. Rovio had a similar deal back in 2011 <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/10/angry-birds-maker-rovio-raises-42-million-from-accel-atomico-and-felicis/">when it raised $42 million from Atomico, Accel Partners and Felicis Ventures</a>. But that was mainly a liquidity round for Kaj Hed, the father of CEO Mikael Hed. (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.arcticstartup.com/2012/02/23/rovio-ownership-structure">Long story. He owns about 70 percent of the company.</a>)</p>
<p>Supercell <a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=787670">has a much more normal-looking cap table</a>, with Paananen owning just under 20 percent of the company before this round. (Finnish companies are obliged to make filings about their ownership and financials every year, even if they&#8217;re privately held. Expect to see some kind of release around earnings from Rovio and Supercell in the next month or so, which is why there might have been some pressure to close a deal now.)</p>
<p>Secondary rounds are a complicated and controversial issue in growth-stage financing rounds. Supercell clearly didn&#8217;t need the cash. They&#8217;re extremely profitable right now and only have about 90 employees. Secondary rounds, which let early employees and founders take cash off the table, can relieve pressure for a short-term exit. But the criticism is that they can take some fire out of the belly, and make teams less hungry.</p>
<p>Yet exit opportunities in gaming are arguably not that appealing right now. The IPO door is closed because of Zynga&#8217;s performance last year, plus you&#8217;d need a much longer track record beyond two games to prove long-term value to public shareholders.</p>
<p>At the same time, it&#8217;s easy to see why an acquisition wouldn&#8217;t be attractive. The big buyers are either still digesting their last deals or are in the midst of politically complicated changes. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/ea-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-larry-probst-becomes-executive-chairman/">EA just had its CEO step down</a>. Even though Hay Day is basically the Farmville of mobile, Zynga&#8217;s culture isn&#8217;t really that compatible with Supercell&#8217;s. The Japanese gaming giants are still figuring out their Western strategy while facing threats at home from emerging mobile gaming platforms like Line and monster games like Gung Ho&#8217;s Puzzles and Dragons.</p>
<p>Given how quickly the iOS ecosystem is growing, the better mobile game developers can control their own destinies. Supercell is choosing this way.</p>
