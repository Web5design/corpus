<p>San Francisco-based Boreas Gear, Inc. is funding its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/179527514/bootlegger-modular-pack-system?ref=category">latest product through Kickstarter</a>, in an attempt to build a modular pack system that provides three bags in one. If you&#8217;re a bag enthusiast like myself (that might not be a real thing but I still have tons of them) then you&#8217;ll appreciate the idea of a simple system that makes it easy to covert a single frame into a daypack, waterproof bag and simple hydration/light carry bag quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The SF-based team founded Boreas Gear in 2010, with the intent of designing packs centered around versatility and good design. Founder and Creative Director Tae Kim has a design background and grew up in Alaska, where he spent plenty of time in the great outdoors. The bootlegger is designed to be the perfect companion for a whole host of outdoor activities.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/34835fcd8d89f3a1ad670cee518da473_large.jpg"></a>Besides offering the three different pack configurations, it also boasts something called &#8220;Super-Tramp Suspension&#8221; which uses pull-straps to shift the weight carried in the pack either closer to or farther away from the back, making it possible to adjust it perfectly for either hiking or biking on the fly. If you&#8217;ve owned a specialized biking pack, then you know that the added breathing room can really come in handy, especially on longer rides.</p>
<p>The Super-Tramp Suspension system can then be used interchangeably with three pack tops, including the Torpedo, the Hopper and the Scrimshaw. The Torpedo is a lightweight hydration pack, which can be outfitted with a water bladder to keep you from getting thirsty on long rides or trail runs without adding too much weight. The Hopper is a daypack that has plenty of room for a lunch and gear for a full day on the mountain and the Scrimshaw is a completely submersible waterproof bag, perfect for rain, snow, or use in watersports like canoeing or kayaking.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/2c76555353946b95fcb83c9dd9f64d8d_large.jpg"></a>The system is designed to be used either with any individual bag or with all three, and the project has already blown past its $10,000 funding goal. Boreas Gear has been designing and manufacturing packs for years now, so there&#8217;s relatively little risk in terms of the company delivering on its planned July ship date. Pledges for bags start at $65 for the frame + a single pack and range up depending on what options you&#8217;re interested in.</p>

Instead of users having to post what is essentially a classified ad for each job they want done, and then wait for a response, the new site turns the user-path on its head by having the task-doers (or "Sorters", of which there are already 12,000 signed up) do the upfront work by creating a detailed and structured profile which forms the basis for matching the task-doers with those searching for a specific task to be carried out.

<p>Instead of users having to post what is essentially a classified ad for each job they want done, and then wait for a response, the new site turns the user-path on its head by having the task-doers (or &#8220;Sorters&#8221;, of which there are already 12,000 signed up) do the upfront work by creating a detailed and structured profile which forms the basis for matching the task-doers with those searching for a specific task to be carried out.</p>
<p>There are 9 categories of task: &#8220;Admin&#8221;, &#8220;Cleaning&#8221;, &#8220;Cooking&#8221;, &#8220;Delivery&#8221;, &#8220;DIY&#8221;, &#8220;Dog Walking&#8221;, &#8220;Driving&#8221;, &#8220;Gardening&#8221;, &#8220;Manual Labour&#8221;, and &#8220;Other&#8221;. The latter will work like the original model, enabling users to post bespoke tasks that they want carrying out, which are then seen by Sorters who have specified that they are willing to go off the beaten track, such as &#8220;dress up as a gorilla and terrify my friends&#8221;. Or presumably anything legal and safe.</p>
<p>The end result is a service that solves the original problem &#8212; finding local, casual labour &#8212; but with a very different user experience, and one that doesn&#8217;t have the customer re-invent the wheel every time they want to commission a task to be carried out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically realised that a reverse marketplace model won&#8217;t work in the UK,&#8221; says James Pursey. &#8220;The British public have so many trust issues and putting them in a scenario of having to be pitched by Sorters is counter intuitive. When somebody is looking for a supplier they typically ask their networks, and failing that they turn to Google, call up a supplier and see if they&#8217;re available. They don&#8217;t say &#8216;hey, why should I trust you&#8217;, and they definitely don&#8217;t send a message through a contact form, like creating a task, and wait for someone to get back to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, Pursey thinks a user interface more akin to Airbnb, which emphasises search and large profiles, will work better. &#8220;You land on a beautifully designed page with a search box in the middle asking you to detail your task. Sorted then applies your task needs as filters to its Sorter database and returns the best people for your needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>What you end up seeing is a detailed profile page for each result, which includes links to a Sorter&#8217;s presence on social networks, and a list of their rates and tasks. You then book and/or correspond with your chosen Sorter. And, as before, Sorted holds the payment until you confirm that the job is completed.</p>

If successful, the deal would effectively snatch Sprint out of the hands of Japanese carrier <a target="_blank" href="http://www.softbank.co.jp">Softbank</a>, which <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/15/softbank-confirms-it-is-buying-70-sprint-for-20-1b/">in October announced</a> that it would pay $20.5 billion for a 70% stake in Sprint. </p>
<p>The deal would see pay-TV giant Dish pay $4.76 per share for Sprint; the carrier closed trading at $6.22 on Friday, April 12, but the news is sending Sprint stock up. In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=sprint&amp;ei=h9hrUdD5MIGLwAP7WA">pre-market trading it&#8217;s up by over 15% after slumping last week</a>. </p>
<p>The deal, as Dish notes in an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/101830/000110465913029132/a13-10109_1425.htm">SEC filing made this morning</a>, will give Dish a much larger user base and revenue profile (if more burden in the form of a capital-intensive network). Sprint currently has 47.5 million subscribers, compared to 14.2 million for Dish. The idea will be that Dish will cross-market its pay-TV services to Sprint&#8217;s wireless subscribers, and market wireless services to its pay-TV subscribers. Quad-play is alive and well!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aggressive move by the pay-TV provider to get its hand deeper into the wireless game as smartphones and tablets become ever-more popular, and mobile data becomes many users&#8217; default channel for browsing online, accessing apps, watching video and more. </p>
<p>&#8220;The DISH proposal clearly represents superior value to Sprint shareholders, including greater ownership in a combined company that is better positioned for the future with more spectrum, products, subscribers, financial scale and new opportunities,&#8221; chairman Charles Ergen said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Softbank bid has had the mark of approval from Sprint. The announcement in October was made with significant pomp and circumstance with an event in Japan at which Softbank’s CEO Masayoshi Son extolled the virtues of synergies and economies of scale between the two companies, specifically around LTE and the fact that both are developing services on the same frequency. At the same event, Dan Hesse, Sprint’s CEO, was also very supportive:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This is pro-competitive and pro-consumer,&#8221; he said at the time, because it helps fight the &#8220;AT&amp;T and Verizon duopoly.&#8221; There is also strength in being number-three together: &#8220;When we look at what Softbank has accomplished as the number-three carrier in Japan, we can learn something from that,&#8221; he added.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast, Dish&#8217;s offer has a decidedly more unsolicited look about it: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We would be pleased to discuss our plans for the combined company and we are available at any time to meet with the Sprint Board, management and advisors to answer any questions about our proposed merger,&#8221; Charles Ergen writes. &#8220;We are confident that the Sprint Board will share our view that this proposed merger offers an excellent opportunity for the equity holders of Sprint to realize a superior value for their shares that is unavailable to them under the SoftBank proposal.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sprint would need to pay a $600 break fee if it backed out of the Softbank merger. Ergen told the WSJ, <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324030704578424200831745578.html">whih first reported the news today</a>, that Dish would cover that cost in its offer.</p>
<p>Dish has been circling around different wireless assets for some time now. Just last week, it was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/dish-network-chairman-said-to-be-seeking-a-merger-with-t-mobile-usa/">reported</a> that Dish wanted to merge with T-Mobile USA, which itself is merging with MetroPCS. Dish is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/27/us-clearwire-sprintnextel-idUSBRE91Q0M620130227">also eyeing up Clearwire</a>, the wireless carrier in which Sprint has also been an investor. </p>
<p>But in the WSJ, Ergen noted that the Sprint deal appeared more likely than the Clearwire bid. Speaking in the past tense (an implication that the door is now closed on Clearwire?) he said that the &#8220;deck was stacked against us&#8221; when it came to Clearwire because of what WSJ refers to as &#8220;contractual obligations.&#8221; This has partly to do with Clearwire shareholders that are trying to force Sprint to increase its own buyout offer of Clearwire, which is tied up with debt financing. All the same, Dish notes in one of its SEC filings today that were both deals to go through, it would create a business that generated in 2012 (on a pro-forma basis) some $50 billion in revenues and $9.4 billion in EBITDA.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important for Dish to make a move one way or the other: it owns wireless spectrum &#8212; 40 MHz in the 2 GHz band &#8212; but no network on which to run services. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if all of these attempts fall through, it remains a takeover candidate itself, partly because of the spectrum shortage among bigger carriers looking for more airwaves for their own fast-growing mobile data services. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/18/att-eyeing-up-dish-network-for-potential-acquisition/">AT&amp;T earlier this year</a> was mentioned as one possible Dish acquirer.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>DISH Network Proposes Merger with Sprint Nextel Corporation for $25.5 Billion<br />
</strong><br />
U.S. technology leader with track record of disrupting entrenched incumbents presents superior alternative to pending SoftBank proposal – DISH offers more cash and a greater ownership stake<br />
Sprint shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, consisting of $4.76 in cash and stock representing approximately 32% in a company with a significantly enhanced strategic position<br />
Creates an industry-leading spectrum portfolio and the only company that can offer customers a fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services<br />
Delivers substantial synergies and growth opportunities estimated at $37 billion in net present value, including an estimated $11 billion in cost savings</p>
<p>ENGLEWOOD, Colo.&#8211;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#8211;DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ: DISH) today announced that it has submitted a merger proposal to the Board of Directors of Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE: S) for a total cash and stock consideration of $25.5 billion. The DISH proposal clearly represents superior value to Sprint shareholders, including greater ownership in a combined company that is better positioned for the future with more spectrum, products, subscribers, financial scale and new opportunities.</p>
<p>DISH is offering Sprint shareholders a total consideration of $25.5 billion, consisting of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. Sprint shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, based upon DISH’s closing price on Friday, April 12, 2013. This consists of $4.76 per share in cash and 0.05953 DISH shares per Sprint share. The cash portion of DISH’s proposal represents an 18% premium over the $4.03 per share implied by the SoftBank proposal, and the equity portion represents approximately 32% ownership in the combined DISH/Sprint versus SoftBank’s proposal of a 30% interest in Sprint alone. Together this represents a 13% premium to the value of the existing SoftBank proposal.</p>
<p>“The DISH proposal clearly presents Sprint shareholders with a superior alternative to the pending SoftBank proposal,” said Charlie Ergen, Chairman of DISH Network. “Sprint shareholders will benefit from a higher price with more cash while also creating the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in a combined DISH/Sprint with a significantly-enhanced strategic position and substantial synergies that are not attainable through the pending SoftBank proposal.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ergen continued, “A transformative DISH/Sprint merger will create the only company that can offer customers a convenient, fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services. Additionally, the combined national footprints and scale will allow DISH/Sprint to bring improved broadband services to millions of homes with inferior or no access to competitive broadband services. This unique, combined company will have a leadership position in video, data and voice and the necessary broadband spectrum to provide customers with rich content everywhere, all the time.”</p>
<p>The proposed combination will result in synergies and growth opportunities estimated at $37 billion in net present value, including an estimated $11 billion in cost savings.</p>
<p>DISH has provided additional information regarding the proposed merger via a dedicated transaction microsite that can be accessed at <a href="http://www.CompleteDishSolution.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.CompleteDishSolution.com</a>.</p>
<p>Barclays is acting as financial advisor to DISH.</p>
<p>Following is text of the letter that DISH sent to Sprint Nextel Corp. Board of Directors on April 15, 2013.</p>
<p>Board of Directors<br />
Sprint Nextel Corporation<br />
6200 Sprint Parkway<br />
Overland Park, KS 66251<br />
Attn: James H. Hance, Jr., Chairman of the Board </p>
<p>Dear Jim:</p>
<p>On behalf of DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”), I am submitting this proposal for a merger between DISH and Sprint Nextel Corporation (“Sprint”). Our proposal provides Sprint shareholders with a superior alternative to the pending SoftBank Corporation (“SoftBank”) proposal. It provides more cash and affords your shareholders the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in a combined DISH/Sprint, which will benefit from a significantly enhanced strategic position and substantial synergies that are not attainable through the pending SoftBank proposal.</p>
<p>We are offering Sprint shareholders a total consideration of $25.5 billion, consisting of $17.3 billion in cash and $8.2 billion in stock. Sprint shareholders would receive $7.00 per share, based upon DISH’s closing price on Friday, April 12, 2013. This consists of $4.76 per share in cash and 0.05953 DISH shares per Sprint share. The cash portion of our proposal represents an 18% premium over the $4.03 per share implied by the SoftBank proposal, and the equity portion represents approximately 32% ownership in the combined DISH/Sprint versus SoftBank’s proposal of a 30% interest in Sprint alone. Together this represents a 13% premium to the value of the existing SoftBank proposal.</p>
<p>Our proposal provides a highly-compelling and unique opportunity for Sprint shareholders. We are offering an ownership interest in a combined company with a comprehensive product and services suite, a significantly enhanced subscriber base, considerable financial and operating scale, as well as a spectrum portfolio that would lead the industry. As a result, this merger creates sizable cost and CAPEX savings and promises extensive new revenue opportunities.</p>
<p>Leveraging both companies’ existing assets and expertise, we will be the only company able to offer a fully-integrated, nationwide bundle of in- and out-of-home video, broadband and voice services to meet rapidly evolving customer preferences. The new company’s assets will immediately establish national cross-platform leadership and will position the company to deliver innovative services while expanding our collective subscriber base.</p>
<p>The proposed combination will result in synergies and growth opportunities estimated at $37 billion in net present value. This includes an estimated $11 billion in cost savings, representing approximately $1.8 billion in annual run-rate cost synergies by the third year after closing.</p>
<p>Further, our combined national footprints and scale will allow us to efficiently develop our joint spectrum assets to provide advanced services to the millions of homes with inferior or no access to competitive broadband services.</p>
<p>I am proud of the company we have built and believe we will be an excellent partner to Sprint. Like Sprint, DISH possesses a strong tradition of innovation and industry leadership. We created the third largest pay-TV provider while competing with incumbent cable monopolies and other entrenched operators. DISH has consistently led our industry in service and technology delivery with award-winning innovations like Hopper® with Sling®. Our history of value creation is outstanding. Investors in our 1995 initial public offering have enjoyed a total return of 27 times their original investment, significantly outperforming the broader markets and our peers. We also have a proven track record of responsible capital management.</p>
<p>DISH has significant experience structuring and consummating strategic transactions and only needs to complete confirmatory due diligence, which we believe can be done quickly with your cooperation. We have examined your merger agreement with SoftBank and we would be prepared to execute a definitive merger agreement on substantially similar terms and conditions. Though not a condition of our proposal, we anticipate that the pending transaction with Clearwire would be completed. We are confident that we can obtain all necessary approvals within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>We intend to fund the $17.3 billion cash portion of the transaction using $8.2 billion of our balance sheet cash and additional debt financing. We have a proven track record in raising capital to fund strategic initiatives and have received a Highly Confident Letter from our financial advisor, Barclays, confirming our ability to raise the required financing.</p>
<p>We would be pleased to discuss our plans for the combined company and we are available at any time to meet with the Sprint Board, management and advisors to answer any questions about our proposed merger. We are confident that the Sprint Board will share our view that this proposed merger offers an excellent opportunity for the equity holders of Sprint to realize a superior value for their shares that is unavailable to them under the SoftBank proposal.</p>
<p>While it would have been our preference to have confidential discussions regarding this proposed merger, your existing agreement with SoftBank and the impending deadlines associated with your shareholder vote, will compel us to confirm our intentions publicly. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours,</p>
<p>DISH Network Corporation</p>
<p>Charlie Ergen<br />
Chairman

<p>In addition, the Springboard alumni has managed to persuade Hailo founder and chairman Ron Zeghibe to join as non-executive chairman, although I&#8217;m told he hasn&#8217;t invested, but (as we&#8217;d expect) is taking a small amount of equity.</p>
<p>Founded by friends Jules Coleman, Alex Depledge and Tom Nimmo in March 2012 shortly before entering the Springboard accelerator program, Teddle represents a fairly typical &#8220;fail fast&#8221; startup story. It originally positioned itself as a platform for booking local services, and 8 weeks into Springboard, where it received £15k of funding, Teddle launched an MVP targeting West London. After graduation, the startup then set about fundraising while simultaneously trying to build out the product and grow its user base. But something didn&#8217;t click. By November 2012, Teddle was almost out of money and the team knew it needed to pivot. And to pivot fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were down to our last £100 and it was obvious that our product was too generic and broad,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Depledge. &#8220;You could browse around and maybe book a service if you liked the look of someone but the conversion funnel just wasn’t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It became clear to Depledge and her co-founders that they were left with two options. Become an enterprise business and &#8220;flog the scheduling, CRM software we had built,&#8221; she says, or focus &#8220;exclusively&#8221; on the consumer. They chose the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to take one thing and do it really well so we looked at all our services and picked domestic cleaning because it was the most popular on our site and had very little competition other than Gumtree and agencies,&#8221; says Depledge. &#8220;In 4 weeks we conducted focus groups and customer surveys and then built the product we felt gave the best possible customer discovery and booking experience. The new product went live on January 2nd and we haven’t looked back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar to a number of U.S. offerings, such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/05/homejoy-seed-funding/">Homejoy</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/16/handybook-secures-2m-from-highland-capital-partners-and-general-catalyst-for-its-uber-for-the-home/">Handybook</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/exec">Exec</a>, the resulting site allows users to find, compare and book a cleaner, before paying online once they are happy with the work carried out. Cleaning is charged at a fixed price of £10 per-hour, and bookings can be made as a one-off or regular schedule. When searching, you&#8217;re presented with 6 potential cleaners matched to your request. Profiles include user-submitted reviews and ratings, while the first cleaner to accept the booking, usually in a matter of minutes, wins the job. In addition, Teddle interviews and vets all cleaners on its platform, so there&#8217;s a trust element, too.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the company is already generating revenue, such is the advantage of actually having a business model from the get-go. It charges a small commission on one-off bookings and a finder&#8217;s fee for securing regular work for the freelance cleaners signed up. However, a model like Teddle&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t scale as gracefully as a pure online play &#8212; there&#8217;s quite a lot of up front labour involved to increase capacity &#8212; so today&#8217;s funding will come in handy. Its longer term plan is to expand into other services, such as personal trainers, tutors and gardeners, as well as take its offering beyond the London area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the appointment of Zeghibe does seem like a potential coup, and it&#8217;s easy to see synergies between the models operated by Hailo and Teddle. Both share a similar consumer proposition by making it easy to find and book a cab and cleaner respectively, coupled with a largely hidden B2B element in terms of recruiting, vetting and supporting the cab drivers and cleaners who provide the resulting services.</p>
<p>Alongside Open Table&#8217;s Pritchard, some of the other investors participating in today&#8217;s round are Chris Ash (Ash Gaming), Jonathan Quinn (World First Foreign Exchange), Ray Kelly (Chairman/CEO Aegis Media), Sarah du Heaume (Just Media), Chris Mairs (Metaswitch), and Neil Davidson (Red Gate).</p>

<p>The new system was launched in two stations on Line 4 of the Beijing subway last week and will expand to the rest of the line soon. To use the sound wave payment system, customers open the Alipay Wallet app on their handset while holding it close to a sensor on the ticketing machine, and wait for it to make a &#8220;shoo-shoo-shoo&#8221; noise. Wang Yu-ming, Alipay&#8217;s business development director, told Xinhua that each sound transmission is unique to the transaction and is only valid for five minutes because of security reasons (each transaction takes less than a minute). If the sound payment&#8217;s Beijing subway launch proves successful, the system could potentially be implemented in convenience stores, supermarkets, and department stores.</p>
<p>Though Alipay&#8217;s system is a novelty for consumers, it is not the first company that has used sound waves to transmit information. First launched in 2011, startup <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-19882_3-20072295-250/naratte-mobile-payments-using-sound-waves/">Naratte&#8217;s Zoosh tech enables mobile payments</a> over ultrasonic sound waves.</p>

If a new report from the <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324485004578423522275087936.html">Wall Street Journal</a> is to be believed, Microsoft has been in touch with an undisclosed number of suppliers who have apparently been tasked with delivering components for a smartwatch-like device that supports touch input.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s not to say that such a Microsoft smartwatch is a done deal just yet. The Journal&#8217;s sources couldn&#8217;t confirm that it would ever actually see the light of day, and I&#8217;d wager that&#8217;s because the folks in Redmond aren&#8217;t exactly sure themselves. After all, some of the company&#8217;s most intriguing potential products died ignominious deaths after being stuck in the research and production pipeline. Remember the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/05/microsofts-courier-digital-journal-exclusive-pictures-and-de/">Courier</a>? The curious dual-screen tablet was apparently very far along (according to <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20128013-75/the-inside-story-of-how-microsoft-killed-its-courier-tablet/">CNET</a>, an employee who worked on Courier said it could&#8217;ve been completed in &#8220;months&#8221;) before Microsoft announced its demise in 2010.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that the nascent smartwatch market has proven to be a tough one to crack. After all, the prospect of delivering a compelling user experience on a wrist-worn gadget isn&#8217;t a new one, and only a few of those devices (like the Pebble) could be considered anything close to successful.</p>
<p>Microsoft knows this all too well &#8212; the Redmond-based company debuted its SPOT (&#8220;Smart Personal Objects Technology&#8221;) data delivery service back at CES 2003, and it wasn&#8217;t long before watchmakers like Fossil, Suunto, and Tissot began folding SPOT into their own timepieces. Microsoft toyed around with at least <a target="_blank" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/bibuxton/buxtoncollection/detail.aspx?id=234">one SPOT watch concept</a> of its own, but as a company that was devoted largely to its software endeavors, it seemed more than happy to leave the finicky business of building watches to others before ultimately killing SPOT in 2008.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not exactly the Microsoft we know today though. Early, fruitful hardware projects like the XBox and its successful successor have paved the way for a Microsoft that&#8217;s much more willing to take calculated chances on hardware. One could argue that devices like the Zune and Surface/Surface Pro tablets are more reactions to shifts in the consumer tech industry rather than game-changing innovations in their own right, but that&#8217;s not necessarily a problem when it comes to mass market gadgetry. The winner isn&#8217;t usually the company that does things first, it&#8217;s the company that does things best. For all we know, Microsoft could be the company best equipped to take the smartwatch concept and bring it to the masses, but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see if Redmond actually rises to that particular challenge first.</p>

Rackspace will provide an end-to-end program that will include the hardware and the OpenStack cloud operating system software for the build out. The company will provide continuous automated testing and delivery of updates from the Rackspace engineering teams.

The news comes as Qunar weathers a boycott by third-party service providers triggered by a change in its operational and pricing policies. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1211407/baidus-qunar-hit-merchant-revolt">South China Morning Post writer Doug Young speculates</a> that Qunar might have hiked its prices in a bid to increase revenue and profits before making its first public filing for an offering.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Baidu said that the company is not currently commenting on the First Financial Daily report.</p>
<p>The $57 million round was reportedly closed in March, but the current valuation of Qunar is not clear yet. Both Baidu and GGV Capital are already investors in Qunar. Back in November 2009, GGV Capital led an investment round of $15 million that included Mayfield Ventures, GSR Ventures and Tenaya Capital. In July 2011, Baidu <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304569504576405453510557290.html">became a majority shareholder </a>in Qunar when it invested $306 million. The round valued Qunar at about $483 million, according to First Financial Daily.</p>
<p>For Baidu, investing in Qunar allows it to expand its offerings beyond its core search business and better compete with rivals Alibaba Group and Tencent (which made an investment in online travel company eLong before the Baidu-Qunar tie-up). After its July 2011 investment, Baidu also integrated Qunar&#8217;s search results into Baidu&#8217;s travel vertical. The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/22/qunar-baidu-deal-closes-how-this-could-ripple-through-chinese-startups/">deal was seen as important</a> not just for the two companies, but because it also marked a turning point for Chinese startups, which had previously focused more on IPOs instead of acquisitions. At that time, Qunar CEO Zhuang Chenchao said that the cash would be spent developing new services like a hotel search and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The newest reported investment&#8211;and current boycott&#8211;means that investors will probably have to wait for Qunar&#8217;s initial public offering. First Financial Daily reports that rumors had previously placed the timing of the IPO at the end of next year, but other factors contributing to a delay could include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23016467/venture-capitalists-rethink-big-bets-china-amid-dismal">a tougher market for Chinese IPOs</a> and an <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323864304578318101227205828.html">increase in scrutiny</a> by Chinese regulators for companies seeking to list on the country&#8217;s two stock exchanges.</p>

<p>No, the crew at San Diego-based <a target="_blank" href="http://thoughtstem.com/">ThoughtSTEM</a> wanted to whip up a (slightly) more subtle laser tag system of their own, and they&#8217;re just about there &#8212; now they&#8217;ve kicked off a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1143143303/laser-tag-for-james-bond-not-robocop">Kickstarter campaign</a> to help bring it to market.</p>
<p>The wearable sensor the team has cobbled together is rather neat if only because of how unobtrusive it&#8217;s meant to be. Rather than go with a traditional (and bulky) vest, ThoughtSTEM has instead put together a small PCB that&#8217;s meant to be worn under a layer of clothing so all that&#8217;s visible are the six LEDs that change colors to display your remaining hit points. </p>
<p>For better or worse, you won&#8217;t have to lug around any plastic guns either. The sensors on the wearable unit can be triggered by any gadget that can emit infrared pulses at 38kHz, which means most of the remote controls currently cluttering up your living room will probably do the trick. That also means that with a little hackery, you could probably rig up a more traditional IR gun without too much trouble (there seems to be more than a few people who&#8217;ve already tried<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nes+blaster&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=nes+blaster&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0l3j62l2.1063j0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=38khz+infrared+gun&amp;oq=38kh&amp;gs_l=serp.3.0.35i39j0j0i20j0.733322.734266.0.738088.4.4.0.0.0.0.273.549.2j1j1.4.0...0.0...1c.1.9.psy-ab.PW78NWoBsMg&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45175338,d.dmg&amp;fp=720839aef4a154b5&amp;biw=1210&amp;bih=618"> doing just that</a>). </p>
<p>Alright fine, it may lack the panache that come with some more expensive, elaborate setups, but it&#8217;s a very neat first project for a crew of savvy young students and their college-age mentors. All told, the ThoughtSTEM team is looking for $10,000 in funding to improve the design of the wearable PCBs and produce them on a larger scale, as well as put together an online storefront to sell them from. $75 will net you a fully assembled target unit, but if you&#8217;re willing to apply some of your own elbow grease you can pick up the schematics and a pre-programmed processor for $25, or a bag full of parts for $49. While the proceeds of the Kickstarter campaign will help lock down the particulars of production, ThoughtSTEM aims to funnel whatever future money they make into the program&#8217;s coffers so those SoCal mentors continue to run workshops and summer camp programs for tech-savvy middle school and high school kids. </p>

<h1>A Turning Point</h1>
<p>The public cloud reached a turning point last year. As Baird states in its report, the top 10 cloud providers grew 37 percent while more traditional technology companies grew by 2 percent. AWS does not break out its revenues. Bernstein, based on its own research, estimates that AWS grew 100 percent year-over-year. Bernstein estimates AWS is worth $24 billion, 13 times its approximate $1.8 billion in revenue (Amazon does not break out revenues for AWS).  In contrast, Bernstein reports that Rackspace, as of April 1, trades at about 5.3 times 2012 revenue. Its revenue grew 28 percent compared year-over-year. Its public cloud service revenues of $309 million account for 23 percent of total revenues. Rackspace, it should be noted, has aggressive expansion plans of its own and has been one of the founders of OpenStack, the open cloud effort. Developer interest has grown consistently in OpenStack since its unveiling. Google is a more concerning foe with Google Compute Engine and Google Apps. And Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Azure puts the company in position to compete in the cloud space.</p>
<h1>How The Market Breaks Down</h1>
<p><strong>Enterprise Software</strong>: Baird Analyst Steve Ashley, quoted in the AWS report, &#8220;views client/server vendors like&#8230; SAP and BMC as most likely disintermediated, and SaaS companies like Salesforce, Concur, and cloud infrastructure vendors like Citrix and Red Hat as beneficiaries of the shift towards cloud computing.&#8221;  The former are large, powerful companies that have built core businesses critical to IT. How these companies adapt is still a big question.</p>
<p>Customers will continue to invest in these providers  to keep their businesses running. The time is now to ramp up and offer SaaS options, embrace mobile  and offer friendly developer environments.  &#8221;Over time traditional IT will be forced to go to SaaS. The first choice will be mobile,&#8221; said Forrester Research Analyst Lauren E. Nelson to me in a recent interview.</p>
<p><strong>IT Systems and Networking</strong>: According to Baird, HP and Dell have the potential to be most disrupted. EMC, VMware and NetApp also face exposure. When customers start using AWS, they stop buying storage and networking equipment. That certainly is a factor but data is so deeply embedded into these systems that analytics will give these players value over time. They also have deep histories with enterprise shops, and that dominance is not going to pass anytime soon. Realistically, AWS does have its own weaknesses in both storage and networking. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.profitbricks.com/us/en/">ProfitBricks</a>, for example, is leveraging its InfiniBand network and instance sizes that can scale to 62 cores and 240GB of RAM. HP is making its own play with OpenStack, as is Dell, which is also putting a deeper focus on next-generation storage and networking technology. Here&#8217;s Baird&#8217;s &#8220;competitive heat map&#8221; that shows how AWS stacks up compared to the rest of the market.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/investment-firms-predict-aws-will-do-as-much-as-20-billion-in-revenues-by-2020-draining-it/bairdheatmap/" rel="attachment wp-att-798393"></a></p>
<p>The greater danger stems from the AWS infrastructure and the breadth of what the cloud service offers. Developers get choice when they use AWS. It&#8217;s useful for test and development, as an extended network for media companies to offload peak demand. Pharmaceutical companies use AWS for its computational power and storage. According to the Bernstein report, customers that use AWS face high switching costs, because they use more services and customize their applications. And so even if there is more competition, AWS will most likely be able to protect its high margins, which Bernstein estimate at 25 percent. Amazon weathers pricing wars with the rapid addition of new features.</p>
<blockquote><p>Importantly, the vast majority of the customers we interviewed stated that they would not change IaaS providers even for a 20% or so price discount, as switching would bring risks and, importantly, require them to invest scarce development resources, for example, to redevelop monitoring and management tools on the new provider&#8217;s application programming interface (API). While customers running relatively simple applications (e.g., the front end of a website) did not see material switching barriers, most users we interviewed have more complex, and hence &#8220;stickier&#8221; use cases.</p></blockquote>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>AWS benefits from the steep demand in the market for computational, storage and networking power. It is built on a distributed infrastructure. At its core, AWS is complex due to the additional technologies needed to make an app or service truly robust. But still, customers start with AWS and often remain loyal. In turn, AWS has become an ecosystem for developers. Ask about a startup&#8217;s infrastructure and the founder will often say they run it on AWS. But AWS is not the only game in town and it still has not proven that it can provide the deep infrastructure that the enterprise requires. It&#8217;s a 10-year cycle that is underway that will keep a lot of infrastructure intact, on-premise. That gives the enterprise giants some time, but to this date they have not shown a deep willingness to embrace the hyper-scale infrastructures that customers demand.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that Lester has brought back some of the old Napster features like &#8220;Hot List,&#8221; which lets you browse your friends&#8217; libraries, as well as the chat and transferring songs to friends. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that it&#8217;s free and has no playback limit. Will it stay around? It&#8217;s hard to say, especially if it completely relies on a YouTube hole, but if the site itself were to get shut down, Lester has put all of his work on GitHub so that anyone can get another version going immediately.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any doubt as to whether Lester is having fun with the project, all you have to do is read this FAQ entry:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Will I be sued for using this?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Holy shit, seriously?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p></blockquote>

Estonian startup <a target="_blank" href="http://jomiinteractive.com/">Jomi Interactive</a> is cooking up a pair of smart devices that will remind people to drink <em>more</em> water. Or at least whatever liquid/poison of choice you put in your water bottle. The aim, says the startup, is to encourage healthy behaviour and counteract the mild dehydration we are all apparently afflicted with. No, not just hungover folk; everyone who fails to glug down the requisite 2.5-3 litres of water per day.</p>
<p>Jomi is prototyping a device &#8212; or rather two devices &#8212; that aim to fix the problem of having plentiful water on tap but never remembering to drink enough of it (perhaps the ultimate #firstworldproblem). So far, Jomi has created design prototypes and 10 milled PCBs for developers to play around with but no final product. It&#8217;s bootstrapping development but will be launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund a production run once it has finalised hardware design and testing.</p>
<p>The two devices it&#8217;s planning are the Jomi Band, which will be the more basic of the pair (pictured above in an early design concept render, and below right in prototype form). This will attach around a water bottle and remind the user at pre-set intervals to take a sip (presumably by flashing/beeping). The second more pro product &#8212; the Jomi Sleeve &#8212; will attach to the bottom of the bottle and, in addition to reminders, will periodically weigh the bottle, to figure out how much water is being consumed. The data will then be sent via Bluetooth to a mobile/tablet app so that pro users can geek out over graphs and charts showing their beverage consumption data (and share their relative &#8216;liquidity&#8217; with friends).</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/jomi-drink-tracker/jomi-band-proto1/" rel="attachment wp-att-797705"></a></p>
<p>What specifically does the device hardware consist of? &#8220;PCB is custom built, it features an accelerometer, MCU, LEDs, and a few other bits and pieces,&#8221;  Jomi founder and CEO Andre Eistre tells TechCrunch. Although he stresses they are still at an early stage, with the hardware set to shrink &#8212; and the design to be reworked. The software will be open to other developers to hack around with it &#8212; so perhaps another app could be made to warn alcoholic beverage drinkers when they have reached a daily safe unit intake level. (Or track soft drink guzzlers&#8217; sugar intake and chart their rising risk of Type 2 diabetes.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Designers (from Estonian Arts Academy) are working on the next version of the design model and the design is expected to change drastically over the next few weeks,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Right now we are focusing on hardware (revision 3) and embedded software of the device&#8230; The hardware isn&#8217;t final either &#8212; it will be a lot smaller than that. Software will be open source &#8212; we want people to have fun with the device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eistre says Jomi will <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/29/enterprise-class-3d-printers-to-drop-under-2000-by-2016-says-report/">3D-print</a> new silicone molds for the first test batch &#8212; due to be handed out to a test group by the end of this month. After that it will be turning to Kickstarter to get the funding ball rolling for a first production run, as it continues product development. It will be aiming to raise $50,000 to start production.</p>
<p>The target market for the devices are 20- to 40-year-old health conscious U.S. consumers who have  a penchant for gadgets &#8212; the sort of folk who likely own a Fitbit or Fuelband.</p>
<p>Jomi is partnering for testing the market in Europe with bottle maker <a target="_blank" href="http://www.korwater.com/">KOR water</a>, and is hoping to get similar companies in the U.S. interested. &#8221;Our intended target market is the U.S., where we would like to secure deals with a few larger water vessel producers, like Sigg, Gobble, CleanKanteen, CamelBak, etc,&#8221; Eistre says.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also making the most of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zdnet.com/is-estonia-the-best-place-to-start-your-start-up-7000007608/">Estonia&#8217;s startup-friendly environment</a>, securing help and small bits of funding (totalling around €8,000/$10,500 to date) from a variety of domestic companies to keep development costs down.</p>
<p>For instance, Eistre says the hardware development costs have been completely funded by local electronic design firm <a target="_blank" href="http://hedgehog.ee/en/">Hedgehog</a>. Other Estonian companies and organisations that have kicked in free services/grants include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.trinidad.ee/">Trinidad Consulting</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.7blaze.com/">7Blaze</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.velvet.ee/eng/">Velvet Creative Alliance</a> and &#8212; quelle surprise &#8212; local water company Tallinna Vesi.</p>
<p>Jomi is also down to the last eight (out of a starter pool of 100 original &#8220;best business ideas&#8221;) in Estonia&#8217;s &#8220;largest entrepreneurial competition&#8221; &#8212; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ajujaht.ee/">Ajujaht</a> (aka &#8220;brain hunt&#8221;) &#8211; which has a €50,000 prize for the winner.</p>
<p>Jomi&#8217;s water-measuring gizmos can be put into a category (connected objects/the Internet of things) that looks set to explode over the coming years, as more everyday objects are augmented with data-generating sensors, and that data is in turn funnelled into the Internet&#8217;s matrix via smartphones and home routers.</p>

<p>After launching in Washington, D.C., in 2011, the program has now launched in New York City and is currently holding training sessions with its first NYC group. In a few months, it&#8217;s going to select participants in its first fellowship program, which will take place over the summer. And later this year it plans to launch in San Francisco.</p>
<p>CodeNow&#8217;s curriculum uses tools like <a target="_blank" href="http://hackety.com">Hackety Hack</a> (for programming basics) and <a target="_blank" href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/default.aspx">Lego MindStorms</a> (for robotics). It involves a combination of weekend sessions and online coursework, as well as a boot camp (held over the longer school breaks or on consecutive weekends) with &#8220;intensive training&#8221; in Ruby.</p>
<p>One goal of the program is to turn students into programmers. Founder and executive director Ryan Seashore said that of the 10 alumni who have now graduated from high school, three have gone on to study computer science. At the same time, he said that the program has benefits &#8220;even if a kid never writes a line of code after our program.&#8221; That&#8217;s because they&#8217;ll have training in how to &#8220;think logically&#8221; and are &#8220;no longer fearful of technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though the program started (and will continue) in D.C., Seashore has moved to New York, and it sounds like he can be more ambitious with the NYC program, admitting more students, holding more classes, and launching the fellowship program.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a real need and desire for a program in D.C. — the financial support was just harder to come by,&#8221; Seashore said.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=798395" rel="attachment wp-att-798395"></a></p>
<p>Speaking of CodeNow&#8217;s fellowships, they will be awarded to the best students in the first two NYC cohorts, and they&#8217;ll include a full-time stipend for six weeks of software development training and work. Between their initial CodeNow training and the fellowship, Seashore said participants will receive &#8220;300 hours of in-person training,&#8221; and CodeNow will also try to connect them with internships at &#8220;awesome tech companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t attended any of the sessions, but Seashore sent me a few of testimonials, just to give me a taste of the students&#8217; enthusiasm. An 11th grader named Tahara said her &#8220;favorite part of the weekend was waking up for CodeNow.&#8221; Mamadou, a ninth grader, said, &#8220;My favorite part was attempting and writing codes to get the lights to turn on and off for the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">arduinos</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>When launching in NYC, Seashore said CodeNow received more than 250 applications, from which the team selected 13 girls and 12 boys. Seashore said CodeNow accepts applicants from all five boroughs of New York, and it provides subway cards to help the kids get to the training sessions in downtown Manhattan.</p>
<p>Interested NYC students can <a target="_blank" href="http://codenow.org/apply/">apply here</a>. The deadline is Wednesday, April 17. Adults, meanwhile, can <a target="_blank" href="http://codenow.org/apply/volunteer/">sign up to volunteer</a>.</p>

After a three-year investigation into its potentially anti-competitive practices, Google submitted its proposal for an agreement with the EU last week, but the details remained under wraps. According to reports from the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, however, Google&#8217;s proposal includes a number of changes to how it will do business (at least in the EU). According to these reports, Google has offered to &#8220;make users clearly aware&#8221; when it is linking to its own specialized services and vertical search engines. Every time Google promotes one of its own links, it will also show &#8220;at least three links to rival, non-Google sites that have information relevant to a user&#8217;s query,&#8221; the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Amir Efrati reports. So whenever a search on Google would naturally highlight a result from Google+ Local, Google would also add links to sites like Yelp, UrbanSpoon, TripAdvisor or other relevant sites.

If the EU agrees to these terms, Google will avoid the large financial penalties that the EU could have levied against the search company. The proposal, if the reports are correct, would be binding for five years, and a neutral third party would ensure that Google doesn&#8217;t stray from the agreement.

Twenty years ago, the typical VC looked like a traditional banker, complete with an MBA and a background in finance. But a Wall Street background is becoming increasingly rare on Sand Hill Rd. The most coveted VCs are people who have built and scaled businesses, and who are deep in a particular domain. Why the shift?

<p>Twenty years ago, the typical VC looked like a traditional banker, complete with an MBA and a background in finance. But a Wall Street background is becoming increasingly rare on Sand Hill Rd. The most coveted VCs are people who have built and scaled businesses, and who are deep in a particular domain. Why the shift?</p>
<p>Gang references aside, Horowitz explains that you can’t give founders great advice unless you’ve actually been down that path yourself &#8212; a path that is often filled with hardship and struggle.</p>
<p>Horowitz speaks from both sides of the coin. He advises his portfolio with the same teeth that were cut through co-founding enterprise company Opsware, and later selling the business to HP for $1.6 billion. One of his board members, Bill Campbell, brought the same level of operational experience from Intuit, Kodak, and Apple that Horowitz now brings to his companies. Horowitz describes Campbell’s experience-backed advice as “incredibly powerful”.</p>
<p>The advisors and investors you surround yourself with will be the people you rely on when times get tough, he says. When Horowitz had to do his first round of layoffs at Opsware, he turned to Bill for advice. “Being able to talk to him and understand how to do these layoffs in the right way, I didn&#8217;t kill my company and people felt like they were treated fairly.&#8221; In fact, some of the staffers Horowitz laid off at Opsware now work with him at Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having that kind of advice and support system built into the agreement when being funded is a great opportunity for any entrepreneur,&#8221; says Horowitz, whose co-founder at the firm is Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and Opsware. The firm&#8217;s other partners include John O&#8217;Farrell (exec at Opsware and Silver Spring Networks), Scott Weiss (co-founder of IronPort), Jeff Jordan (CEO of OpenTable, eBay/PayPal exec), Peter Levine (CEO at XenSource) and Chris Dixon (co-founder of Hunch and SiteAdvisor).</p>
<p>Other firms are also shoring up their operational talent. Peter Barris, managing director of venture firm New Enterprise Associates, entered the VC space in 1992 after leading two companies to massive acquisitions. “I came out of the operating world, and I was the exception not the rule. Now I&#8217;m the rule not the exception.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barris adds that in the 1990s the typical VC was a generalist in the largest sense, and now VCs are more focused on certain areas of technology. He attributes the current oversupply of VC dollars as one of the reasons why operating expertise is so much in demand right now. &#8220;In 1992, dollars were scarce and VCs were distributing to a big demand set. Now there is an oversupply of investment money, and the way VCs are competing is based on value. The operators and VCs who have domain expertise can help startups grow much more than generalists,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Foundational Capital’s Paul Holland says that in this era of the discriminating entrepreneur, the founder “doesn’t just want to get money from an investor; he or she wants the investor to be a successful entrepreneur, who&#8217;s seen the movie, and will help guide them down that path.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just presence of experience, but the content of that experience. Steve Herrod, the former CTO of enterprise and virtualization giant VMware who <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/16/vmware-cto-steve-harrod-joins-general-catalyst-to-boost-enterprise-investments/">just joined General Catalyst</a> says that in his limited experience in the VC world, he&#8217;s observed that entrepreneurs are judging investors based on what specific domain expertise they can provide.</p>
<p>Greylock’s John Lilly is a strong example of an operator with domain expertise. Prior to joining the firm in 2011, Lilly served as CEO of Mozilla, founded and ran Reactivity, and was a senior scientist at Apple. &#8220;We&#8217;re a big believer in operators at VCs, and because we are all product folks by nature, we obsess about how you build big companies,&#8221; Lilly tells me. He also predicts that there will be certain VCs you go to for design, certain VCs who attract cloud-based enterprise investments, and specific VCs who are known for products dealing with networking.</p>
<p>Every investor I spoke to believes that we’re headed towards a world where nearly all VCs will have built companies. If that’s true, then can we expect the entire ecosystem to reach a higher level of empathy? Reflecting on his own days as an operator, Horowitz tells me that when entrepreneurs “get one out of five things right in a given day”, it&#8217;s hard to talk to an investor who simply doesn’t empathize with the complexities of the role.</p>
<p>In a way, Horowitz explains, the VC world is going back to its roots in the seventies. Sequoia Capital founder Don Valentine previously founded National Semiconductor, and was an executive at Fairchild Semiconductor. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers’ founder Eugene Kleiner was a founder of Fairchild, while Tom Perkins was an early HP executive.</p>
<p>They drew on their operating experience to cultivate and invest in a new generation of entrepreneurs, and now Horowitz, Lilly and others are paying that expertise forward. In a noisy and highly competitive ecosystem, there’s something pure about operators helping operators.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t just a bubble in the Bitcoin economy, there&#8217;s a bubble in the number of posts about Bitcoin. I&#8217;ll pile on, even after this week&#8217;s mini-crash, but with a twist. A few weeks ago, I <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.semilshah.com/2013/04/03/the-theatricality-and-deception-of-bitcoin/"><strong>wrote some brief notes</strong></a> on what I thought about Bitcoin, but the over-arching feeling I had was that I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on what could become of this currency in the future. Perhaps that&#8217;s part of the reason this phenomenon is so fascinating to us all. So, instead of trying to determine future scenarios in a world I don&#8217;t <a target="_blank" href="http://pandodaily.com/2013/04/10/great-now-engineers-think-that-they-are-economists-too-2/">understand</a> and because Twitter has turned everyone into armchair professors, I reached out to a number of practicing economists who were either former professors or classmates, or had friends make introductions, and asked them to chime in briefly on a future with Bitcoin. Please note I requested a rather informal, fun submission from them &#8212; nothing too serious. Interestingly, most of my former professors hadn&#8217;t yet heard of Bitcoin and subsequently elected to pass on this opportunity &#8212; perhaps I&#8217;ll follow up with them later in the year. Luckily, I was able to corral a few economists to participate, and I&#8217;ve reposted their thoughts below:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Chris Robert,</strong> <a target="_blank" href="www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-robert/1/18a/6a">currently</a> a Professor of public policy and economic development at Harvard:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">It would really be something if intelligent people chose to invest more trust in a currency system built and managed, in large part, by anonymous computer hackers than they did in currency systems built and managed by governments of the people, by the people. Fortunately, we are not there yet. Today, Bitcoin is mostly just a matter of media speculation arising from the continuing financial turmoil and growing distrust in the global financial system. This media speculation may well lead to a protracted period of financial speculation, however, during which techies are joined by increasing numbers of financial sophisticates seeking a new bubble to exploit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Compared with corporate securities, futures, or even derivatives, Bitcoin is even less inhibited by any underlying sense of value. The bubble can just grow and grow, so long as demand increases faster than supply &#8212; and so long as the network doesn&#8217;t crash, a new cryptographic exploit doesn&#8217;t unravel everything, the fundamental lack of anonymity doesn&#8217;t bother anyone, those who lose private keys and thus potentially small fortunes don&#8217;t complain too loudly, improvements (or hacks) to &#8220;mining&#8221; don&#8217;t lead to sudden shocks to supply, etc. Profiting from a bubble of any sort can be a risky business, but our global economy is not at all lacking in people willing to give it a go. Thus, as a potentially exciting new vehicle for financial speculation, Bitcoin may be with us for some time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Robert McMillan,</strong> a former economist with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Stanford economist, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=11548561&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah">currently</a> Head of Portfolio Management and Director of Quantitative Research at HNC Advisors AG:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin. The value of having an easy-to-store, hard-to-steal, and hard-to-counterfeit medium of exchange is substantial. Especially one which doesn&#8217;t lead to the extermination of species (e.g. cowry shells, ivory) or direct environmental degradation (e.g. gold). Unfortunately, as those familiar with Paul Krugman&#8217;s writings on liquidity traps know, Bitcoin&#8217;s known and finite supply dooms it as a workable replacement currency. Furthermore, as it has no apparent use-value (unlike, say, Platinum), this kills it entirely. Nevertheless, the flaw lies with the implementation, rather than the idea itself. I expect Bitcoin (&#8220;BC&#8221;) will soon see competition in this space from &#8220;Currency 3.0&#8243; entrants that fix the flaws in Bitcoin and thus have a better (i.e. nonzero) chance of achieving the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; of currency acceptance, namely a liquid market in Forex forwards with another major currency. At any rate, be on the lookout for Awesome Drachmas (&#8220;AD&#8221;) using newly-discovered prime numbers as units of exchange. They&#8217;re costly to &#8220;mine&#8221;, in infinite supply, and even have use-value (e.g. cryptography). Coming soon to a money-changer near you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Matthew Bishop,</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/mediadirectory/matthew-bishop">currently</a> the U.S. Editor for <em>The Economist,</em> where he&#8217;s been for 22 years:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">As I wrote in my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Uncertainty-Kindle-Single-ebook/dp/B007GE9KPO">recent ebook</a> on the future of money, &#8220;<em>In Gold We Trust?</em>&#8220;, the resurrection of gold and the emergence of Bitcoin are two sides of the same, er, coin. Both are a response to falling confidence in the soundness of government-backed &#8216;fiat&#8217; money in an era of quantitative easing. I think the algorithmic approach to controlling the money supply used by Bitcoin and other digital currencies being developed in Silicon Valley could go a long way to creating a sound store of value. The biggest risk to these currencies may turn out to be government action to destroy an alternative to fiat money. But what if a sovereign state was to issue an algorithm-based currency? Would that drive fiat money out of business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Brett Gordon,</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~brg2114/cv.html">currently</a> a Professor at Columbia&#8217;s Graduate School of Business:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">There are two scopes for discussion about the future of bitcoin. First, the short-term: if this is a bubble, when will it burst? It&#8217;s notoriously difficult to predict the end of a speculative <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-is-the-perfect-bubble-2013-4">bubble</a>. Those lucky enough to time it correctly can make a lot of money, but that won&#8217;t be true for the rest of us mere mortals. The price chart for <a target="_blank" href="http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg180ztgSzm1g10zm2g25">bitcoins</a> reminds me of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=956260800000&amp;chddm=540852&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=INDEXNASDAQ:.IXIC&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=HQVmUaChKYW6qgGNLA">Nasdaq </a>from 1995 to early 2000. Clearly, these are vastly different, but I think the Nasdaq plot is representative of many yet-to-burst bubble prices. The Google Trends <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=bitcoin&amp;date=today%2012-m&amp;cmpt=q">chart</a> for bitcoins is similarly shaped, which suggests that when the media frenzy over the digital currency subsides, so too may much of investors&#8217; interest. Second, the long-term: what will the bitcoin market look like in 5-10 years? That&#8217;s even harder than calling the peak of a bubble. I think a significant contribution of the bitcoin market is that it serves as a proof-of-concept for a decentralized crypto-currency. Two benefits are that bitcoins are inherently deflationary and transactions are anonymous. Given the recent slew of fiscal crises and increasing concerns about online privacy, these are two strong points in bitcoin&#8217;s favor&#8212;or whatever future crypto-currency arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Peter Rodriguez,</strong> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darden.virginia.edu/web/Faculty-Research/Directory/Full-time/Peter-L-Rodriguez/">currently</a> a Professor at Virginia&#8217;s Darden School of Business:</p>
<blockquote><p dir="ltr">At first blush Bitcoin is nothing special. Virtually anything can be used as a pseudo-currency. And, there is nothing new about a profound fear of fiat currencies and all manner of efforts to avoid the risk of relying on central bankers. Indeed, the prevalence of fiat (paper) currencies in a post gold-standard world is flat-out amazing. But, when the confidence underlying fiat currencies falters folks resort to recognizable and reliable stores of value and it&#8217;s not that hard to manage in such a world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russians and others in FSU states resorted to a highly functional trinity of currency substitutes: cigarettes for the small stuff, Vodka for the medium and Cognac for big ticket items.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In some ways, Bitcoin is just a virtual pack of smokes. But in other ways, it&#8217;s revolutionary. Cigarettes have inherent value and alternative uses, like cotton and even gold. Bitcoins are valued in and of themselves. They have even less alternative uses than paper currency or baseball cards. So, if they can establish their worth and hold the confidence of investors long enough, the institutions that can eventually convert Bitcoins from a fad-like store of value to a real currency might just begin to develop. And then, Bitcoins could become a reliable medium of exchange and index value that has some real place in the world. Even it they just serve to measure the value of goods ultimately transacted in &#8216;real&#8217; currencies, Bitcoins will have become something entirely new: a true, stateless, virtual currency rooted in nothing other than confidence in the set of rules that surround them. It could all implode, of course, and that&#8217;s not unlikely. But, currencies are always tested and all of them have gone through existential crises. The real question isn&#8217;t whether Bitcoin will falter, plummet or take us all on a crazy ride, it&#8217;s whether it will actually survive its inevitable test. If it does, even at very low values, it will change the way we think about stores of value, finance and the independence of the virtual economy.</p>

For now, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/facebook-home-now-live-on-google-play-a-free-app-for-htc-one-x-and-x-samsung-galaxy-s-iii-and-note-ii/">only a handful of select devices</a> can even run Home (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/12/heres-how-to-get-facebook-home-running-on-nearly-any-android-device/">officially</a>) &#8212; notably missing from the lineup is Google&#8217;s Nexus 4, the latest in the lineup of Nexus-branded flagship Android phones &#8212; devices that users adopt in particular to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to new app releases.</p>
<p>But Facebook promised that more handsets will be supported in time, as will tablets. Well, only Android ones, that is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too soon to say whether Facebook Home will live up to the company&#8217;s claims and expectations of becoming the new way people interact with the social network, or whether it will go down only as a notable experiment on the social network&#8217;s part. If the latter, it won&#8217;t be a major loss to the company, as Facebook will continue to have access to data from a core group of heavy Facebook enthusiasts. It will learn what keeps users engaged, what posts and images catch their eye and their clicks, and, eventually, which advertisements do, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/facebook-home-and-the-promise-of-android/facebook-home4/" rel="attachment wp-att-798029"></a>But to those who can&#8217;t download Facebook Home today because they&#8217;re using the &#8220;wrong&#8221; smartphone, it&#8217;s of small comfort to think that perhaps the product won&#8217;t ever really be as successful as Facebook promises. Because for users, what matters is not whether this grand roll of the dice pays off for Facebook itself &#8211; it&#8217;s whether you have the ability to participate in the game in the first place.</p>
<p>This is the challenge of the new mobile landscape.</p>
<p>Unlike the web, where the worst thing developers encountered was IE compatibility &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://buzzfeed.tumblr.com/post/47704736072/yeah-this-checks-out">and yes, that was bad</a> &#8211; it was only a matter of time (and hair pulling and screaming) and energy to bring a new idea to everyone who had Internet access and a web browser. Because the web is built on open standards, this sort of thing is possible.</p>
<p>Facebook wouldn&#8217;t even be Facebook had this not been the case.</p>
<p>But mobile is a different story, and a potentially dangerous one in terms of progress and innovation, as Facebook Home today proves.</p>
<p>On the one side, you have an Android ecosystem that&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/11/this-is-what-developing-for-android-looks-like/">fragmented</a> by operating system version. In fact, <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">Google quietly changed</a> the way it discloses that fragmentation. Now, instead of telling the developer community how many phones run Jelly Bean or Gingerbread, for instance, it tells them how many of those devices are used by people who download apps. It&#8217;s an attempt to paint a rosier picture of OS distribution patterns by focusing on the app-haves instead of the app have-nots. (Spoiler: there are a lot of people running old versions of Android out there.)</p>
<p>Then on the other side, there&#8217;s Apple. Because of its restrictions, Facebook Home will never be able to run as intended on iOS operating systems. That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing, to be clear. It&#8217;s just a statement. Apple deserves plenty of credit for helping technology become an interest of the mainstream &#8211; a group that felt its former interfaces, configurations, and command lines too complicated and confusing. Or worse, simply not fun. The iPhone wasn&#8217;t the first smartphone, but it radically altered the way that people interact with &#8211; and learned to love and care about &#8211; technology.</p>
<p>But if we&#8217;re giving Apple credit for sparking this trend, lets give them credit for potentially stalling progress here, too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a few years into this new paradigm of computing, and things are already starting to feel a little dated. We&#8217;ve become accustomed to, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/11/start-making-sense/">bored with</a>, and finally <a target="_blank" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/digital-diary-are-we-suffering-from-mobile-app-burnout/">overrun by mobile applications</a>. So the shift ahead of us is enabling new experiences &#8211; possibly those that put an app-centric interface secondary. Android is well on its way to enabling this, with its potential for customizations and widgets, as well as the deep hooks that apps can sink into the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Apps like Facebook Home.</p>
<p>Facebook Home, however, is but the first high-profile example. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/android-launchers-are-a-small-market-can-facebook-home-change-that/">A niche group Android users have been doing this for years</a> on their own with third-party widgets, launchers, and replacements for core applications.</p>
<p>Android is not an ideal landscape overall. (See: fragmentation issues above. See also: app quality, developer revenue potential, etc.) In other words, this is a not a statement about who wins the larger war, it&#8217;s about who wins on this particular battlefront. That said, <em>in terms of enabling a new mobile experience</em>, Android is now more promising than iOS.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/facebook-home-and-the-promise-of-android/facebook-home2/" rel="attachment wp-att-798031"></a>Of course, you may think that Facebook Home itself is a terrible, horrible thing that you would never consider installing on your own phone, and that&#8217;s just fine.</p>
<p>The point is, it&#8217;s a different idea. It&#8217;s not <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/04/android-launchers-are-a-small-market-can-facebook-home-change-that/">really an Android launcher</a>, it&#8217;s only inspired by them. And even if you have no particular affinity for Facebook itself, you might for the next company that follows it. Because someone will. In fact, one already has: Korean messaging giant <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2013/04/11/messaging-giant-kakaotalk-plans-its-own-android-launcher-to-rival-facebook-home/">KakaoTalk just announced</a> plans for a Facebook Home competitor of its own.</p>
<p>More will come.</p>
<p>And later, it won&#8217;t be just about direct copycats like KakaoTalk, or the third-party developers promising DIY &#8220;Home-like&#8221; experiences, either. Facebook Home&#8217;s existence speaks to a world where developers will be prompted to think beyond applications and the isolated experiences they deliver. With the layering, and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/chat-multi-tasking/">overall well-designed nature of the Facebook Home feature called &#8220;Chat Heads</a>,&#8221; we&#8217;ve been shown the potential to build entirely different ways of interacting with our devices. Period.</p>
<p>This is the path of innovation. Someone takes a bold step forward with a new idea. Eyebrows are raised, pundits opine, testers review, but ultimately a thing dies or lives in the hands of the everyday users. You.</p>
<p>Facebook Home itself might not make it. It challenges the status quo by making other applications less important than Facebook. That&#8217;s a radical enough idea that it could <em>easily</em> fail.</p>
<p>But the damage &#8211; whether Facebook Home succeeds or not &#8211; is already done. Facebook Home is something else. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/rise-of-apperating-systems/">Wired called it an apperating system</a>. That&#8217;s perfect. It exists somewhere between apps and phones. It dug out a whole new space, now begging to be exploited, experimented upon, and filled with new ideas.</p>
<p>And it did this on Android.</p>
<p>Asked if Facebook Home could ever come to iOS, Zuckerberg <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-57577979-235/facebook-home-faces-hurdles-getting-on-ios/">said</a>, &#8220;anything that happens with Apple is going to happen with partnership. Google&#8217;s Android is open so we don&#8217;t have to work with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one had to &#8220;work with&#8221; the web, either.</p>

As many of my contacts said to me on a recent visit: what we need in Berlin for all this hype to be real is a big exit. The most recent evidence that Berlin is capable of producing a decent startup exit is the sale of streaming music tech company <a target="_blank" href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/08/panasonic-automotive-buys-streaming-radio-firm-aupeo/">Aupeo to Panasonic Automotive</a>, although the financial terms remain a mystery.</p>
<p>And German media giant Axel Springer recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/26/tunedin/">acquired</a> Berlin social TV startup TunedIn, originally founded in New York. No price was released.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a target="_blank" href="http://Senzari.com">Senzari</a>, the Miami-based streaming music startup offering an alternative to Pandora, acquired the tiny Berlin-based startup wahwah.fm. Again the terms <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/30/pandora-competitor-senzari-acquires-berlin-based-music-startup-wahwah-fm/">were undisclosed</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, London and the UK, where the tech hype has been in full flow for a while, has been coming out with some daily impressive results of late.</p>
<p>London-based <a target="_blank" href="http://Summly.com">Summly</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/yahoo-acquires-information-gathering-startup-summly/">famously</a> went to Yahoo! for $30 million while <a target="_blank" href="http://Mendeley.com">Mendeley</a> has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/confirmed-elsevier-has-bought-mendeley-for-69m-100m-to-expand-open-social-education-data-efforts/">exited</a> for as much as $100 million.</p>
<p>Then there is Cisco <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/03/cisco-is-buying-ubiquisys-for-310m-for-a-big-move-into-femtocells/">buying</a> Ubiquisys for $310 million.</p>
<p>But of course we are forgetting the Berlin-based Samwer Brother phenomenon, where waves of MBAs are sent into battle to clone the latest thing out of the Valley for a simple exit, as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/16/breaking-groupon-acquires-german-clone-citydeal/">happened with CityDeal and Groupon</a>.</p>
<p>Can we really say that e-commerce deals, such as Fab.com <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/02/20/fab-com-makes-first-overseas-acquisition-in-germany/">acquiring</a> its German competitor Casacanda last year, count in real tech startup terms?</p>
<p>They certainly do if you are thinking about sheer value creation. But purists would argue that e-commerce-oriented companies and technology platform companies are quite different beasts.</p>
<p>Whatever the philosophical arguments, what Berliners are really looking for are exits from some home-grown innovators and some bigs ones.</p>
<p>And while some of the biggest Berlin tech companies, such as Soundcloud and Wooga, appear to be shooting for a major home run, here doesn&#8217;t appear to be an exit or IPO on the cards this year for either.</p>
<p>What is to be done? Sit and wait? Many would say, let&#8217;s just cut the hype and get back to work. No one likes the boy who cried wolf one too many times&#8230;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to keep you occupied, we present for you a selection from the hottest startup we found in Berlin lately: a Tumblr blog called <a target="_blank" href="http://whenyoureallyliveinberlin.tumblr.com">WhenYouReallyLiveInBerlin</a>, (for those of you who have tired of <a target="_blank" href="http://whenyouliveinberlin.tumblr.com">WhenYouLiveInBerlin</a>).</p>
<p>At least we&#8217;ll have something to keep us occupied while we wait for Berlin to have its <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia">PayPal Mafia moment</a>.</p>

We present for you a lighting fast &#8216;exit Q&amp;A&#8217; with founder and former CEO <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/munthe">Turi Munthe</a>, who has since left to pursue new projects.</em></p>
<p>Demotix <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/14/corbis-acquires-crowd-sourced-photo-agency-demotix-after-its-move-into-apps/">sold</a> to Bill Gates&#8217; Corbis, the second biggest picture library in the world, in November 2012. On the way, since their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/12/30/direct-from-the-streets-of-gazza-demotix-is-the-ugc-picture-agency/">launch</a> in January 2009, they built a community of  about 40,000 people in every corner of the globe, providing them with a platform to tell stories that nobody else could &#8211; or often would &#8211; cover. They broke over 1 million news images, reported 100,000+ news stories, published scoops from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEmAiSCi_ho">Iran</a> to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.demotix.com/news/763015/explosion-oslo-government-building-norway-pt-i#media-763022">Oslo</a> and sold their community&#8217;s work all over the world, shipping hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to a network of freelancers from Haiti to Zimbabwe. Not bad for a start-up in news industry which is haemorrhageing money daily.</p>
<p>I caught up with Turi Munthe the week after he finally stepped down as CEO to ask what advise he would give to other entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>MB</strong>: What did you get right?</p>
<p><strong>TM</strong>: Our advisors: we (Jonathan Tepper and I) built a team of exceptional people who, despite our thick-skulledness, helped us avoid some of the biggest potholes. The ones we hit were ALL because we didn’t know how to listen to them.</p>
<p>In terms of office culture neither Jonathan nor I have ever had as much fun professionally as starting Demotix. Everyone we hired and kept had the same vision of, commitment to and passion for what we wanted to achieve, and everyone had options (including many of the early interns). We had problems, but we also had a ball and made some great friends in the process.</p>
<p>We were cheap because we never raised the squillions of our competitors in the US, so we had to be. Short, cheap leases; no marketing spend (as Founder, you <strong>are</strong> the marketing); no headhunters, no consultants, and as few hires as possible. Don’t try to outsource your risk: do it yourself. Oh, and conferences? Only go to the ones you’re speaking at…</p>
<p>We also set out to win prizes. Before you make sales, raise big bucks, and become insufferable, start by winning prizes. When there’s nothing else out there, they validate your story. Plus they dazzle investors and boost the team.</p>
<p><strong>MB</strong>: What did you get wrong?</p>
<p>We weren’t geeks, and didn’t bring one in as co-founder. I still can’t quite believe some of the crap we wasted time and money on as a result. <a target="_blank" href="http://xkcd.com/309/">Here’s a rule to follow</a>.</p>
<p>Hiring: I’m sentimental, and Jonathan is even worse. When everyone fits, the team fizzes. It takes just one person to skew the dynamic, and I let that happen too often.</p>
<p>Spending equity. When you start, equity is your only currency. You will regret how you spent it whatever happens. So try to spend it measurably (ie. options not shares).</p>
<p><strong>MB</strong>: What have you learnt?</p>
<p>The defining feature of a company&#8217;s success is the market it&#8217;s entering: a rising tide raises all ships and all that&#8230; A free-speech news platform? Are you kidding?</p>
<p>Understand your market, even if you’re planning on inventing a new one. Do everything you can to speak to future clients, and then when you’re up and running, to talk to existing clients. If you don’t believe they’re your number one mentor, you’re in trouble.</p>
<p>Moats matter: the news photo business is really an oligopoly (AP, Getty, and Reuters). Oligopolies exist because there are high barriers to entry: your business is figuring out quite how much it’s going to take you to breach those.</p>
<p>Have fun: start-ups are risky as hell and, in almost all certainty, a terrible investment of your time. So really care about what you’re doing and really enjoy doing it: the experience, most likely, will be what’s of most value.</p>
