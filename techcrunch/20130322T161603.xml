<p><a target="_blank" href="http://rsms.me">Rasmus Andersson</a>, the Swedish designer and technologist who for the past two years has worked at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> leading the design of mobile products and working on product infrastructure, is leaving the social networking giant to join <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. He&#8217;ll be working on both the design and engineering teams at the cloud storage and sharing company. We&#8217;re hearing that his last day at Facebook was this week, and Dropbox is set to announce his hiring later today.</p>
<p>Prior to working at Facebook, Andersson <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmusandersson">spent four years</a> as the chief designer at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>. There he essentially steered all aspects of Spotify&#8217;s creative direction at a formative time for the music streaming service, developing its logo and branding and designing the interface of its flagship Mac app.</p>
<p>This is just latest in a series of recent coups Dropbox has made on the tech staffing side. Last week, the company beat out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/mailbox-cost-dropbox-around-100-million/">several established bidders</a> to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-mailbox-all-13-employees-joining-and-app-will-remain-separate/">acquire Orchestra</a>, the 13-person startup behind the much <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/omg-mailbox-is-amazeballs/">buzzed-about</a> email organization app <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a>. In December, the famed creator of the Python programming language <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/07/dropbox-guido-van-rossum-python/">Guido Van Rossum joined Dropbox</a> as a software engineer after a seven year career at Google; also that month Dropbox <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/06/soleio-dropbox/">snapped up Soleio Cuervo</a>, the designer responsible for Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;Like&#8221; button, and acqui-hired <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/dropbox-acquires-snapjoy-and-puts-photos-into-its-focus/">photo-sharing startup Snapjoy</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/13/with-audiogalaxy-acquisition-dropbox-signals-its-cloud-music-ambitions/">cloud music startup Audiogalaxy</a>, bringing on solid new engineering talent. Meanwhile on the sales and marketing sides, Dropbox in December added <a target="_blank" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121221/dropbox-poaches-top-sales-execs-from-salesforce-apple-and-google/">a slate of big-name execs</a> from Apple, Salesforce, and Google.</p>
<p>With a total employee count of 250 and more than <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/dropbox">$250 million in venture capital</a>, the six-year-old Dropbox is firmly out of the &#8220;startup&#8221; realm. But the company seems to have found a sweet spot that attracts people looking to bring their fledgling startup skills to the next level, as well as folks from bigger more established tech corporations craving more adventure and possibility. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what comes out of that mix of talent in the coming months.</p>

Linking in to a wide range of cloud storage devices, and with a ready stable of mobile apps, the company hopes to make users&#8217; personal video assets easily accessible wherever they are. That now extends into the living room, thanks to the company&#8217;s first launch of an app for connected TV devices. </p>
<p>Today, Vilynx is making its video sharing platform available on Google TV, allowing families to watch and share all their favorite videos from the largest screen in the house. The new app for TV screens makes it one of the first personal video apps to show up on the platform, and extends its reach beyond just being available on the web and on a bunch of mobile devices. </p>
<p>Vilynx had previously <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/vilynx-android-kindle-fire-web-app/">released apps for all the major mobile platforms</a>, including iOS, Android, and the Kindle Fire, as well as a web presence. And it&#8217;s connected to a bunch of cloud storage providers, including Dropbox, Box, and Google Drive, to enable users to manage their videos and access them no matter which service they use.</p>
<p>More than that, the company seeks to make videos easy to find and watch and share, by automatically creating smart thumbnails that contain four screenshots, instead of just one. The idea is that it will enable users to quickly identify which videos they want to watch, even in a series that are shot near one another or share the same background. </p>
<p>It also provides a way for users to share videos with one another, via email, SMS, and social networks. But the idea is that it they can do so privately, so that only family and friends that they want to see their videos, not the whole wide world as in some video sharing apps.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the idea, at least. Thanks to some data mined out of a third-party app, we&#8217;ve got a pretty good idea where T-Mobile is starting to fire things up.</p>
<p>When the guys over at <a target="_blank" href="http://opensignal.com/">OpenSignal</a> noticed what seemed to be a bunch of engineers using OpenSignal&#8217;s signal analysis/mapping app to test a network they&#8217;d never seen before, they followed the data on down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>As of this morning, they&#8217;ve found T-Mobile&#8217;s LTE network being tested in 8 major cities:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Jose (and a few other nearby Bay Area regions)</li>
<li>Seattle</li>
<li>Denver</li>
<li>Las Vegas</li>
<li>New Orleans</li>
<li>New York</li>
<li>San Diego</li>
<li>Kansas City</li>
</ul>
<p>The list isn&#8217;t perfect, of course. Some cities may not be ready to go live on launch day, and engineers in other cities might have picked other testing tools. With that said, it&#8217;s probably a safe bet that the above make up a good chunk of T-Mobile&#8217;s main launch targets.</p>
<p>As OpenSignal&#8217;s testing tool sends them details about network speed, they also dug out a rough idea of the average performance on T-Mobile&#8217;s shiny new network: 25 Mb/s download and 8 Mb/s upload, with about 40ms of latency. That&#8217;s not too shabby — but that&#8217;s also with&#8230; you know, pretty much no one on the network. </p>

The sharing platform can serve as a complement to Facebook, where most families network today, though in a more restrained fashion. Or for those family members who aren&#8217;t even active on Facebook, Famil.io can, to some extent, serve as a replacement.</p>
<p>The service works online, or as a web browser extension (initially for Chrome), and on iOS or Android. This cross-platform support was critical for Famil.io, CEO Iftach Yair explains.</p>
<p>Yair joined Famil.io, which is being incubated within Israel&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://lool.vc/">lool.vc</a>, around six months ago to help co-founder Iftach (yes, also!) Orr bring the product to the market. Lool.vc operates in a similar manner to Betaworks here in the U.S., in that it funds and incubates startups, providing them with office space, resources and support.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/private-photo-and-video-sharing-service-for-families-famil-io-is-like-a-dropbox-for-memories/screen-shot-2013-03-18-at-11-21-18-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-783383"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I took the basic project that was running and made a lot of changes in it,&#8221; explains Yair.  &#8221;The major one was to take Famil.io from a destination site and an app, into a cross-platform, cross-generation product,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In order to make this product work, you have to make it agnostic of the platform or devices that your family is using. If you&#8217;re going to build a product for iPhones or Android, and look away from the desktop, then you&#8217;ll be leaving a good chunk of your family aside, and that will make your product unsuccessful,&#8221; Yair adds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument, and one that&#8217;s especially applicable to my personal situation, because my own parents are Facebook holdouts. (My father is a state Court of Appeals judge, and it&#8217;s discouraged.) But in every family, there are those &#8211; often older members &#8211; who aren&#8217;t as active on Facebook than others. Famil.io finally includes them.</p>
<p>The website and Chrome extension are very simple to use, though someone might have to help the grandparents with the latter. During the private beta with some 7,000 users, the thing the non-technical users said they liked about the Chrome add-on is that it takes over Chrome&#8217;s &#8220;new tab&#8221; page, putting photos and updates from family directly in their browser. (For those like me who actually <em>use</em> the new tab page, not to worry &#8211; you can disable this in the Settings.)</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/private-photo-and-video-sharing-service-for-families-famil-io-is-like-a-dropbox-for-memories/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-1-50-29-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-783386"></a></p>
<p>Famil.io reminds me a lot of <a target="_blank" href="http://familiar.com/blog/2012/12/200m-photos-displayed.html">Familiar</a>, which offers a strikingly similar service for photo-sharing, but one which revolves around screensavers, as opposed to an online application. As of year-end 2012, following its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/18/with-1-3m-in-funding-private-photo-sharing-service-familiar-replaces-screensavers-digital-picture-frames/">$1.3 million seed round</a> from Greylock, Indx, Redpoint, Allen &amp; Company, and others, Familiar said it had displayed over 200 million photos, and was seeing 135 percent month-over-month growth in November.</p>
<p>Sometimes the industry has trouble parsing services like this, which eschew chasing the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; to focus instead on the second wave of technology adopters. But these services can find their niche among those families looking for simpler solutions. When I stopped updating my Familiar briefly, for instance, my sister even called me to complain that she had no new photos of her niece.</p>
<p>Of course, going after the long tail isn&#8217;t a future-proof strategy for obvious reasons, but Famil.io has plans to offer a differentiated feature set in the future, which should have broader appeal.</p>
<p>Currrently, with <a target="_blank" href="http://familio.com/">Famil.io</a>, the idea is that instead of screensavers, users can receive push notifications, not entirely different from Facebook&#8217;s own notifications, right in their web browser via the browser extension. This is helpful because on Facebook, users tend to miss a lot of their family photos because of the noise and the way Facebook&#8217;s News Feed works, Yair says. &#8220;Some people think that by sharing on Facebook, everyone sees the photos, but the reality is that because of the Facebook Graph, only around 15 percent of photos are viewed at any time,&#8221; Yair claims. (Facebook&#8217;s News Feed algorithms are always in flux, we should note, so these numbers tend to change. Still, the overall point &#8211; that things get missed &#8211; is accurate.)</p>
<p>He also adds that as people&#8217;s networks have expanded, they&#8217;ve grown less comfortable with sharing all their family photos on Facebook. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to spam everyone with photos of my son,&#8221; Yair explains, giving a personal example. &#8220;This is an issue&#8230;most people don&#8217;t really care about other people&#8217;s kids that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/unbaby-this/">Remember</a> the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/04/unbaby-me-yes-please/">UnbabyMe movement</a>? This kind of takes care of that problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/private-photo-and-video-sharing-service-for-families-famil-io-is-like-a-dropbox-for-memories/screen-shot-2013-03-18-at-11-42-20-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-783385"></a></p>
<p>Currently, Famil.io&#8217;s platform supports high-res photo uploads from your computer or phone, plus support for photo imports from Facebook (for those that may have been missed). Videos are supported as well, and in the future, the company will add the option for sharing posts, also like Facebook. Users can comment on and like the shared photos and videos, too.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things about the service is that everyone builds their own Famil.io groups &#8211; just because you&#8217;re invited to join a group with Aunt Sally in it, doesn&#8217;t mean that your spouse (who can&#8217;t stand the woman), has to have her in his group in order to see your shares. That&#8217;s different from how most group-based service work today &#8211; it&#8217;s more flexible.</p>
<p>The long term goal is not just to mimic Facebook&#8217;s feature set, while serving a private audience &#8211; but to offer something tangible to its users. Famil.io plans to monetize by offering built-in print-on-demand services for photo prints and photobooks, among other things, as well as a way to pay for &#8220;lifetime storage,&#8221; meaning secure, online hosting and easy-to-export data.</p>
<p>Pricing for these things have not yet been worked out. The service itself is free to use &#8211; <a target="_blank" href="http://familio.com/">sign up is here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/weevilicious.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Weevilicious" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>According to his brand new lawyer, Andrew <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/weev/">&#8220;weev&#8221;</a> Auernheimer, otherwise known as the AT&amp;T hacker, will appeal his sentence of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/andrew-auernheimer-aka-the-att-hacker-sentenced-to-41-months-in-prison-3-years-probation-and-restitution-of-73k/">41 months in prison, three years probation, and restitution of $73,000 owed to AT&amp;T</a>. Orin Kerr, a civil rights lawyer who is now on the faculty of the George Washington University Law School, has stated on a blog that he will be representing Auernheimer in his appeal pro-bono.</p>
<p>For a little background, Auernheimer was recently convicted on two charges, conspiracy to access a computer without authorization and fraud in connection with personal information. After accessing a publicly available (and unprotected) AT&amp;T website, Auernheimer realized he could run a script that would reveal the email addresses of AT&amp;T&#8217;s iPad 3G owners. He sent 114,000 email addresses to a Gawker journalist and has now been charged with felony crimes for these actions.</p>
<p>Many see Auernheimer&#8217;s hack as a public service <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/14/were-awarding-goatse-security-a-crunchie-award-for-public-service/">(thus, the Crunchie)</a>, considering AT&amp;T was letting users&#8217; email addresses hang out in the open. However, AT&amp;T and the District Court of New Jersey seem to disagree.</p>
<p>Kerr lists <a target="_blank" href="http://www.volokh.com/2013/03/21/united-states-v-auernheimer-and-why-i-am-representing-auernheimer-pro-bono-on-appeal-before-the-third-circuit/">in his blog</a> four main reasons for taking the case pro-bono, and working to appeal weev&#8217;s sentence.</p>
<p>The first reason is that he&#8217;s concerned Auernheimer&#8217;s sentence and conviction may set a bad precedent for the meaning of unauthorized access under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Technically, says Kerr, the email addresses obtained by Auernheimer were published publicly on an AT&amp;T website, albeit unprotected but not necessarily meant for prodding eyes. Still, Auernheimer didn&#8217;t actually hack past any security measures or a firewall; he simply changed a number in the URL.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Orin Kerr had to say about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the government’s view, visiting the URLs was an unauthorized access of AT&amp;T’s website. But I think that’s wrong. At bottom, the conduct here was visiting a public website. As the Sixth Circuit stated in Pulte Homes, Inc. v. Laborers’ International Union Of North America, 648 F.3d 295 (6th Cir. 2011), everyone is authorized to visit an “unprotected website” that is “open to the public.” The fact that AT&amp;T would not have wanted Spitler to visit those particular URLs doesn’t make visiting the public website and collecting the information a criminal unauthorized access. If you make information available to the public with the hope that only some people would bother to look, it’s not a crime for other people to see what you make available to them.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only reason Kerr is taking over.</p>
<p>Kerr is also concerned with the fact that Auernheimer is being charged with a felony rather than a misdemeanor, since the &#8220;unauthorized access&#8221; charge is normally a misdemeanor offense. According to Kerr, the government feels that the overlap between the 50 <em>states&#8217;</em> unauthorized access computer crime statutes and the very similar <em>federal</em> unauthorized access statute automatically transforms this crime into a federal matter, based on 18 U.S.C. 1030(C)(2)(B)(ii).</p>
<p>This section states that a misdemeanor unauthorized access becomes a felony when it is “in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.” Kerr calls this &#8220;double-counting&#8221; and thinks it&#8217;s unfair and unreasonable.</p>
<p>Finally, Kerr has taken over because of the outrageous sentence weev has been given, as well as the discrepancy between the location of crimes committed and the jurisdiction. Though Auernheimer never accessed any AT&amp;T websites in Jersey, the government is still charging him in New Jersey based on the fact that some of the email addresses obtained came from NJ.</p>
<p>Plus, his sentence is clearly heavy-handed compared to the &#8220;crimes&#8221; he committed. Kerr explains that Auernheimer&#8217;s 41 month sentence was based around the $73,000 figure AT&amp;T said it was owed in damages. However, Kerr states that, while Auernheimer is responsible for reparations based on the law, the figure is pretty bogus.</p>
<p>The dollar loss is calculated based on “[a]ny reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other damages incurred because of interruption of service.”</p>
<p>However, AT&amp;T&#8217;s only costs from this hack come by way of notifying its customers of the breech. It started with an email, which cost the firm nothing. Then, AT&amp;T sent out a notification by snail mail, which apparently cost them $73,000.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I don’t think that cost of paper and mailing counts as loss that can be attributed to Auernheimer and Spitler. That’s true for two reasons. First, existing caselaw indicates that the costs only count if they are “directly attributable to the defendants’ alleged access of [the] computer” Shirokov v. Dunlap, Grubb &amp; Weaver, 2012 WL 1065578, at *24 (D. Mass. 2012) (concluding that legal fees cannot constitute “loss” under the CFAA). A decision to notify users of a breach, like a decision to hire lawyers, is not part of an effort to fix the computer and therefore not directly attributable to the access. Second, it is not a “reasonable” cost here in light of the successful electronic notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>For these reasons, Kerr will be representing weev from here on out with the goal to reduce his sentence or perhaps even overturn it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the appeal filing in full:</p>

Trading under the symbol MRIN, the stock saw a small pop in its opening hour, rising by some 40% before going down again and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AMRIN&amp;ei=LQdMUdiLOM3FwAOyRw">currently trading just under $18</a>, a rise of some 28% on the IPO price.</p>
<p>Marin had originally priced the IPO at $11-$13 for 7 million shares but expanded the offering ahead of today to reflect stronger demand.</p>
<p>Marin&#8217;s core product is a platform that advertisers can use to run campaigns across different online properties, including the biggies Google, Bing and Facebook, and different platforms, including mobile, online search, online display and social, with its reputation for search marketing particularly strong. Part of its offering is a big data play, in which it uses the mass of advertising traffic that it tracks to figure out for its clients which formats, and which placements, are giving them their best return on investment for future campaigns.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenues have tripled in the last three years, a reflection of the bigger shift to online advertising from more traditional forms of media. Marin, in its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1389002/000119312513055807/d450382ds1.htm">S-1</a>, cites projections from Magna Global that expect global spend will be $619 billion in 2017, up from $480 billion in 2012. Within that, digital ad spend will be $174 billion in 2017, up from $98 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>Marin is on that wave, with customers including ModCloth, PriceGrabber and Symantec, according to its SEC filing. But Marin but also has a road ahead of it to turn that into a profitable ride.</p>
<p>According to Marin&#8217;s S-1 that it filed in February when first announcing the IPO, the company in the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 made $42.5 million in revenues. That is nearly double the $24.7 million it made in the nine months a year before, but still has not been enough to push the company out of loss-making territory: it also reported a net loss of just over $19.2 million for the period, compared to $13 million a year before.</p>
<p>Prior to the IPO, Marin had raised <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/marin-software">$79.5 million</a> in a series of six venture rounds, with backers including Benchmark, DAG, Focus Ventures and Triangle Peak.</p>
<p>Marin says in its S-1 that it might use use some of the proceeds for acquisitions. &#8220;We may choose to expand our current business through acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses or technologies, using cash or shares of our common stock. However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments at this time,&#8221; the company writes. For the moment Marin writes that the main purpose will be to raise capital, raise awareness and generally improve its competitive position.</p>
<p>Some <a target="_blank" href="http://www.admonsters.com/article/which-ad-tech-companies-could-go-public-2013">predict</a> that other ad-tech startups likely to go public this year include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.criteo.com">Criteo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rubicon.com">Rubicon</a>. Rubicon has been rumored as a Yahoo acquisition target (although that now seems to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/yahoo-merger-off-the-table-rubicon-ceo-addante-tells-us-ma-plans-2013-1">off the cards</a>), while Criteo currently works with Yahoo in Japan on performance-based inventory and is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/criteo-to-run-yahoo-japans-performance-based-inventory-entry-to-china-is-next/">planning a move into China</a>.</p>

"I'll be stepping down as chairman of the FCC in the next couple weeks," he said, before thanking members of the FCC for helping to build a country where "innovation and investment are flourishing."

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be stepping down as chairman of the FCC in the next couple weeks,&#8221; he said, before thanking members of the FCC for helping to build a country where &#8220;innovation and investment are flourishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his lively address to FCC staffers, Genachowski (who was nominated and confirmed for the position in 2009) noted that his time with the organization would soon be over, but lauded the FCC&#8217;s accomplishments and pointed to even greater importance for the agency in the months and years to come. Among other priorities left for the FCC to tackle, Genachowski pointed to freeing up &#8220;even more spectrum for mobile broadband&#8221; and &#8220;driving increased broadband speed and capacity to every school and every business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do our job right,&#8221; he noted, &#8220;we can make a meaningful, positive difference in the lives of the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you&#8217;d expect, Genachowski used his time at the podium to paint an uplifting portrait of what the FCC has been do, but not everyone would agree with his view of his tenure. In a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freepress.net/press-release/103103/fcc-chairman-genachowski-step-down">statement</a> released yesterday, CEO Craig Aron of the media reform group <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freepress.net/">Free Press</a> took Genachowski to task for putting corporate interests ahead of public ones and steadfastly sticking to his policy guns when others called for him to compromise:</p>
<p>“Though President Obama promised his FCC chairman would not continue the Bush administration’s failed media ownership policies, Genachowski offered the exact same broken ideas that Bush’s two chairmen pushed,&#8221; Aron alleged. &#8220;He never faced the public and ignored the overwhelming opposition to his plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the news came as something of a surprise last night, Genachowski has been mulling his departure for some time now &#8212; earlier this month the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/new-washington-parlor-game-who-will-replace-julius/2013/03/08/902e007a-882d-11e2-999e-5f8e0410cb9d_story.html">Washington Post</a> reported that he was expected to officially relinquish his post at some point in April, and opined on who would eventually come to take Genachowski&#8217;s place. </p>

A new report pegs LG as developing its own take on the new category, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2013/03/419_132568.html">The Korea Times </a>on Friday. LG is supposedly working on a smartwatch as well as a product &#8220;similar to Internet giant&#8217;s Google Glass,&#8221; according to the paper&#8217;s sources, as part of a strategy to remain competitive long-term.</p>
<p>The LG smartwatch is in development alongside the Glass-like product as a &#8220;non-commercialized&#8221; R&amp;D project, which essentially means it isn&#8217;t ready to ship. LG, like Samsung and a number of other handset makers, is no stranger to combining mobile phone technology with watch-based designs. The LG-GD910, for instance, was demoed at CES 2009 and featured a touchscreen and built-in 3G.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='360' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QR50ZcHrmC0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>LG joins Samsung (which <a title="Samsung Confirms It Will Build A Smart Watch As Speculation About Apple’s iWatch Continues" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/samsung-confirms-it-will-build-a-smart-watch-as-speculation-about-apples-iwatch-continues/">confirmed earlier this week that it was working on a smartwatch</a>), Apple (which hasn&#8217;t confirmed anything, but which is <a title="Apple’s iWatch Could Arrive By The End Of 2013, Says Bloomberg" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/apples-iwatch-could-arrive-by-the-end-of-2013-says-bloomberg/">reported to be working on it from various sources</a>), and now Google (a new <a title="Google Rumored To Be Making A Smartwatch, Too" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/google-rumored-to-be-making-a-smartwatch-too/">FT report claims it&#8217;s in on the action</a> just this morning) as companies reportedly developing smartwatches. And of course <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/sonys-149-smartwatch-finally-lands-in-the-u-s/">Sony already actually shipped one</a>, plus there are offerings available <a title="Pebble Firmware Update 1.9 Delivers A Non-Watchface App – The Classic Game Of Snake" href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/pebble-firmware-update-1-9-delivers-a-non-watchface-app-the-classic-game-of-snake/">from Pebble</a> and <a title="Kickstarter Darling MetaWatch Shows Off New Features" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/01/kickstarter-darling-metawatch-shows-off-new-features/">MetaWatch</a>, among others.</p>
<p>In short, everyone has or is working on a smartwatch. And while the list is shorter for Google Glass, at this &#8220;non-commercialized&#8221; stage described in the Korea Times report today, you can bet your britches everyone else is working on that, too. We&#8217;ve already seen <a title="Microsoft Patent Shows It’s Working On A Google Glass Type Device Of Its Own" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/22/microsoft-patent-shows-its-working-on-a-google-glass-type-device-of-its-own/">rumors about Microsoft</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/phone-and-communications/sony-working-on-ar-specs-to-rival-googles-project-glass-1086812">Sony</a> and <a title="Apple Patent A Reminder That It’s Working On Google Glass-Style Wearable Tech, Too" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/07/apple-patent-a-reminder-that-its-working-on-google-glass-style-wearable-tech-too/">Apple</a> developing Glass-type devices too, and now LG adds to that list.</p>
<p>The thing is this: if you&#8217;re a major electronics manufacturer, and at this point you haven&#8217;t assigned at least one guy with a lab coat or an engineering degree to look into both wrist- and head-mounted wearable tech, you&#8217;re already out of touch. For better or for worse, these wearables are happening, and at this point I&#8217;m more surprised not to hear that a company is working on those areas. I&#8217;m looking at you HTC and BlackBerry: where are your reports of clandestine research projects? This doesn&#8217;t count:</p>

<p>The company told TechCrunch earlier this month that the South American market is a priority for it, along with the U.S.</p>
<p>Line, which is made by software and gaming company <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nhncorp.jp/">NHN Japan Corporation</a>, offers free messaging and communications services as its hook to get users on board but sells other content such as stickers to monetize the service.</p>
<p>Line is hugely popular in its initial Japanese market, with close to 50 million users there. But late last year it launched Spanish versions of its apps, and is currently running a marketing campaign in Spain. Uptake in Spain (now its next largest market after Asia) has convinced it that it has a good chance of building a user base in Latin America, according to Line&#8217;s U.S. CEO Jeanie Han, speaking to TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/17/line-the-social-entertainment-platform/">earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>She argued that Line appeals to Latin cultures owing to its &#8220;fun&#8221; and visual approach to messaging with elements like its stickers. As well as South American, the U.S.&#8217;s large Hispanic population is another group Han expects to be able to win Line fans from.</p>
<p>The Spanish language version of Line launched for Android in November 2012 and for iPhone in December 2012. The company has not yet announced user numbers for Spain.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/04/global-messaging-market/">South America</a>, Line will be competing with the likes of Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger and Voxer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/decidelogo.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="decideLogo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Shopping and comparison engine <a target="_blank" href="http://www.decide.com/">Decide.com</a>, which offers suggestions as to not just what to buy but also <em>when</em>, is announcing today that it has raised $8 million in Series C funding, in a round led by Vulcan Capital. Also participating were existing investors, Maveron and Madrona Venture Group.</p>
<p>As a part of the new funding, Steve Hall from Vulcan Capital is joining Decide.com&#8217;s board. The company also recently added another board member as well: Dawn Lepore, former CEO of Drugstore.com.</p>
<p>With the additional financing, Decide.com has raised $17 million in total outside funding to date.</p>
<p>The company <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/decide-launches-an-electronics-shopping-service-that-tells-you-when-to-buy-and-wait/">first emerged back in June 2011</a>, after operating for two years in stealth, while raising $8.5 million from Maveron, Madrona, and other angel investors.</p>
<p>Unlike other shopping search or comparison sites, what made Decide.com unique was its proprietary technology for tracking when an item&#8217;s price has dropped to the point that it&#8217;s worth buying. The technology is similar to what the founding team (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/oren-etzioni">Oren Etzioni</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mike-fridgen">Mike Fridgen</a>) had done with Farecast, the airline ticket price predictions engine later <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/04/17/microsoft-acquires-farecast-for-115m/">acquired</a> by Microsoft for $115 million. As with Farecast, Decide.com&#8217;s algorithms accounted for a number of signals &#8211; including product release cycles, historical trends, company announcements, news and rumors published by the media, and more &#8211; in order to make its price predictions.</p>
<p>Decide.com <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/decide-launches-an-electronics-shopping-service-that-tells-you-when-to-buy-and-wait/">initially began by targeting consumer electronics</a>, but later expanded into other product categories. Today the company covers 150 product categories across Electronics, Appliances, and Home &amp; Garden. CEO Mike Fridgen says that the plan is to increase product coverage by 10 times in the weeks ahead, including moves into Baby &amp; Kids, Jewelry, and Toys.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/decide-coms-shopping-engine-now-tells-you-what-to-buy-not-just-when-to-buy-it/decide-scores/" rel="attachment wp-att-619294"></a></p>
<p>In addition to its predictions, Decide.com also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/decide-com-launches-daily-deals-offers-price-guarantees-on-select-ce-home-appliance-purchases/">added price guarantees for select items</a>, as a way for the company to stand behind its predictive algorithms&#8217; accuracy &#8211; if the price drops, Decide pays consumers. When <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/decide-com-launches-daily-deals-offers-price-guarantees-on-select-ce-home-appliance-purchases/">this service launched in April of last year</a>, only a handful of price guarantees were offered, but Fridgen says this has now been scaled to &#8220;hundreds of thousands of products daily.&#8221;</p>
<p>The service also <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/decide-coms-shopping-engine-now-tells-you-what-to-buy-not-just-when-to-buy-it/">expanded further into the &#8220;what to buy&#8221; part of the equation</a> last summer, to provide product ratings based on millions of user and expert reviews using technology that normalizes across sources and removes bias from reviews.</p>
<p>At present, Decide.com&#8217;s database is filled with 230 terabytes of data, including 25 billion price predictions. Though Decide.com is more useful for doing serious research from the desktop, its complementary mobile apps have been downloaded over 250,000 times.</p>
<p>In October, the company said it had provided over 10 million users with &#8220;when to buy&#8221; predictions since its public debut, which it calculated to be around $127 million in savings. Today, that number has grown to $200 million.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t discussing revenue, but Fridgen would say that, thanks to the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/24/shopping-engine-decide-com-rolls-out-premium-pricing-when-to-buy-recommendations-now-5-per-month/">launch of its subscription deals service last fall</a> ($5/month for the &#8220;when to buy&#8221; recommendations), it has beat its internal forecast for paid members for Q4 2012.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, the plan is to grow the current team of 30 by 10 over the course of the year, and expand further into data mining and mobile in particular, on the product side.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-9-20-39-am.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-22 at 9.20.39 AM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />Amidst Apple iWatch rumors and Google Glass sightings, it would appear that Google is actually working on its own smartwatch to be paired alongside connected Android devices. According to the Financial Times, Google&#8217;s Android arm will be the team working on the device, as opposed to the X Lab division, which handled Google Glass development. The wearable computer market is heating up quite rapidly. Alongside Google&#8217;s Glass project, a number of smaller OEMs have launched Bluetooth-connected smart watches to work as a companion to the smartphone. Fossil has a well-crafted MetaWatch, InPulse has the hot-selling Pebble smartwatch, and there are even a handful of quantified self devices that measure your daily activity. There&#8217;s the Nike FuelBand, the Jawbone UP, and the Basis to name a few. Add to that an Apple competitor in the iWatch, and a Samsung smartwatch to boot, and it only makes sense that Google has a watch in the works. Google Glass takes wearable computing a step beyond the basic wrist watch. However, the rate of adoption will almost certainly be lower than that of a watch or a smartphone since the experience is such a huge change in the way we interact with digital content and our world. A smart watch, on the other hand, would feel a lot more like using a really small smartphone, and that familiarity makes the watch a great bridge between smartphones and computational headsets. Google didn&#8217;t comment on the speculation. However, there&#8217;s a patent owned by Google and filed in 2011 for a &#8220;smart watch&#8221; with a &#8220;flip-up display.&#8221; It would appear that the patent also provides for a touchscreen experience. The question isn&#8217;t really if Google will build a smart watch. As small OEMs and big competitors around it flood the market with wearable smartwatches, Google will likely need to join the fight. However, it&#8217;s unclear what exactly that will look like? Does a flip-up display look like a flip phone? From the patent filing, the &#8220;flip-up display&#8221; seems to work like a digital pocket watch, showing two displays when open and a single display on top when closed. However, just because Google filed this patent, it doesn&#8217;t mean that Google&#8217;s Android smartwatch will look anything like it. On the software side, Google has already proven that it can develop for new forms of computing, such as Google Glass. Even some of its already-released apps like Google Now]]></description>

A smart watch, on the other hand, would feel a lot more like using a really small smartphone, and that familiarity makes the watch a great bridge between smartphones and computational headsets.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t comment on the speculation.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s a patent owned by Google and filed in 2011 for a &#8220;smart watch&#8221; with a &#8220;flip-up display.&#8221; It would appear that the patent also provides for a touchscreen experience.</p>
<p>The question isn&#8217;t really if Google will build a smart watch. As small OEMs and big competitors around it flood the market with wearable smartwatches, Google will likely need to join the fight. However, it&#8217;s unclear what exactly that will look like? Does a flip-up display look like a flip phone?</p>
<p>From the <a target="_blank" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=23&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=%2820121002.PD.%20AND%20Google.ASNM.%29&amp;OS=ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google&amp;RS=%28ISD/20121002%20AND%20AN/Google%29">patent filing</a>, the &#8220;flip-up display&#8221; seems to work like a digital pocket watch, showing two displays when open and a single display on top when closed.</p>
<p>However, just because Google filed this patent, it doesn&#8217;t mean that Google&#8217;s Android smartwatch will look anything like it.</p>
<p>On the software side, Google has already proven that it can develop for new forms of computing, such as Google Glass. Even some of its already-released apps like Google Now and Field Trip seem like they would fit in swimmingly with a smart watch. Plus, we can&#8217;t forget that the acquisition of Motorola has left Google with a rather sizable hardware team.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-4-10-07-am.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-22 at 4.10.07 AM" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>After graduating from Y Combinator, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/10/y-combinator-backed-crowdtilt-launches-to-become-the-kickstarter-for-any-group/">Crowdtilt launched in February of last year</a> to become &#8220;the Kickstarter for any group.&#8221; More specifically, the startup has been on a mission to become the platform of record for all manners of group fundraising &#8212; anything that isn&#8217;t a good fit for crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, for example.</p>
<p>Today, TechCrunch has learned from sources that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crowdtilt.com/">Crowdtilt</a> has raised $12 million in Series A financing. It&#8217;s the startup&#8217;s second round of funding, following its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/17/kickstarter-for-groups-and-events-yc-alum-crowdtilt-picks-up-2-1m-from-sv-angel-yc-partners-and-more/">$2.1 million seed round back in May</a>, which it raised from SV Angel, Crunch Fund, Y Combinator partners Paul Buchheit, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar and Garry Tan, and DCM and Felicis Ventures.  </p>
<p>It was an impressive roster of investors for being a few months removed from its graduation from Y Combinator, and we&#8217;re hearing that the interest has continued, with the startup closing its series A in four days. According to our sources, investors in its Series A include Napster, Plaxo, Causes and Airtime founder Sean Parker, Andreessen Horowitz (rumored to be through General Partner Chris Dixon), as well as existing investors like YC&#8217;s partners, CrunchFund, DCM and Felicis. </p>
<p>Our sources also tell us that, with its new funding in tow, Crowdtilt is also now in the process of making an acquisition that will help bring its group fundraising platform to mobile. Although Crowdtilt declined to comment on both its funding and acquisition, we do know that, at this point, mobile is really the biggest missing piece for Crowdtilt. A mobile-focused acquisition would allow the startup to add complementary features to its group funding platform, like bill splitting or gift purchasing and sharing, for example, increasing the platform&#8217;s range of functionality and improving the overall user experience. </p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not yet clear who the acquisition target is, strategically, a product acquisition would make sense for startups/apps like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fiestah.com/">Fiestah</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://d.tixelated.com/">Tixelated</a>. Both would allow Crowdtilt to add further mobile event planning capabilities to its platform, which itself sees a fair share of fundraising campaigns around events and parties. This would be especially true for Fiestah, <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.fiestah.com/2013/02/26/crowdtilt-is-the-ying-to-fiestahs-yang/">considering the two startups</a> have already entered into a partnership to do just that. </p>
<p>Our sources indicate that, rather than an acquisition to add single new features like bill splitting, Crowdtilt is interested in picking up mobile talent to make the larger push into developing a Crowdtilt mobile platform. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-4-06-07-am.png"></a></p>
<p>To that end, there are other, more fundamental ways that Crowdtilt could make its business mobile. In January, it <a target="_blank" href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/01/30/crowdtilts-latest-product-helps-those-who-cant-code-crowdfund/">released a desktop product</a> called a  href=&#8221;<a href="http://www.crowdhoster.com/&#8221;&gt;CrowdHoster" rel="nofollow">http://www.crowdhoster.com/&#8221;&gt;CrowdHoster</a> to help anyone launch their own custom crowdfunding site “without having to touch a line of code.” The team based the backbone of its code on <a target="_blank" href="http://selfstarter.us/">SelfStarter</a>, an open source project developed by fellow YC alum, <a target="_blank" href="https://lockitron.com//">Lockitron</a>, to help people build their own ad-hoc crowdfunding site. </p>
<p>It seems logical that CrowdHoster should also eventually go mobile. Lockitron could be interesting to Crowdtilt for other reasons, too: SelfStarter is not Lockitron&#8217;s core business. It built the platform to help launch and own mobile hardware project for a smartphone-operated lock, after it was rejected from Kickstarter. But Lockitron&#8217;s mobile knowledge combined with clear expertise in building crowdfunding platforms seems like the kind of mobile talent that Crowdtilt might also be eyeing up. </p>
<p>Crowdtilt API evangelist Marc St. Raymond <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5141995">said on Hacker News</a> that the startup was looking to experiment with payment flow and “different shipping scenarios.&#8221; Lockitron could hold the key to that.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-22-at-4-06-40-am.png"></a> In the big picture, this is all a demonstration of how quickly Crowdtilt has grown. In just under a year, its spin on group-fundraising has found steady adoption. Although Crowdtilt has yet to share statistics in 2013, users raised $1 million across campaigns in its first three months, with the average campaign raising 188 percent of its proposed goal, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/crowdtilt-api/">according to our numbers from December</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Crowdtilt has opened <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/21/group-funding-platform-crowdtilt-opens-to-non-profits-now-offers-tax-deductible-donations-receipts/">its doors to non-profits</a> and launched an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/12/crowdtilt-api/">API to give developers access</a> to its group payments and social fundraising. </p>
<p>The next step is mobile, and investors like Sean Parker &#8212; no stranger to crowdfunding, having co-founded online fundraising platform, Causes.com &#8212; could help give Crowdtilt a leg up in an increasingly crowded market.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0766005/">Sasso</a>, who appeared regularly on MADtv when that was a thing, is now doing great 6 second videos including this charming rendition of Robert DeNiro ordering Chinese food.</p>
<iframe src="http://seevine.com/v/922341760590548992/embed" height="480" width="480" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>However, the most important part of his oeuvre are his excellent lemon skits, reproduced below.</p>

<p>Seriously: these are some of the funniest <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Vine">Vines</a> you&#8217;ll see today and they prove that maybe this goofy little service has legs as long as someone with Sasso&#8217;s genius can produce wild stuff like this. Two thumbs up. Thank me for sharing this next time you see me.</p>

Now you can do a lot more than simply rave about your favorite local business to a friend: microloan giant, Kiva, is bringing crowdfunding to U.S. businesses. Normally reserved for struggling, developing-world entrepreneurs, Kiva is piloting a new project, called Zip, to allow small business owners to solicit micro-investments from their neighbors. &#8220;This is a very big deal,&#8221; said President Bill Clinton, announcing the Zip pilot project in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. &#8220;We have gotten ourselves in a situation now where the only people who can get real money are the people who don&#8217;t need to borrow it.&#8221; Mass online investing has been an entrepreneurial dream for years, but political hangups at the Securities and Exchange Commission have delayed progress on so-called &#8220;crowdfunding&#8221;. To this day, there are still regulations about the number of investors a business can have and their minimum personal wealth. Zip cleverly skirts regulation: &#8220;Kiva is a nonprofit and makes no money from the loans we facilitate, instead we depend upon optional donations,&#8221; explains co-founder Premal Shah. &#8220;Kiva lenders make no money from the money they lend, they only expect the money they put in as a loan to be paid back. Because of this model Kiva’s crowdfunding platform falls outside of SEC rules.&#8221; Lending money, regardless of regulation, so Kiva requires that small businesses have the confidence of a &#8220;Trustee,&#8221; on organizations or individuals who vouch for the credibility of the borrowers. Trustees function like any other noteworthy investor in a startup, but in a more public way that permits the masses to invest confidently without an elite network of established investors. To give microlending some viral flare, &#8220;When borrowers successfully repay their loan, they too can become Trustees and endorse other small business owners in their community.&#8221; Ideally, success begets more success, facilitating a cascade of local consumption and investing. Zip caters especially to local businesses with a social good edge. At Old Skool Cafe, at-risk youth serve piping hot Java, to give them a better future outside the prison system. Mandela Foods Cooperative specializes in cooking up healthy desserts. Loans start out as low as $25. You can check out Kiva&#8217;s pilot project here.]]></description>

A nice Casio can be had for about $200. But if you&#8217;re one of those high-tech, post-IPO types that wants to feel like Phileas Fogg for a minute or two each day, you can shell out $150,000 for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ablogtowatch.com/breva-genie-01-is-first-ever-mechanical-weather-station-watch/">Breva Génie 01</a>, a mechanical watch that measures altitude, temperature, and predicts the weather using tiny moving parts.</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Because they can. And because you can afford it.</p>
<p>The Génie 01 looks like any other high-end watch that costs more than our cars combined. It is clad in white or rose gold and includes a small chamber that expands or contracts depending on barometric pressure, thereby allowing you to predict rain. It also has a power reserve indicator that shows the energy left in the mainspring. As befitting a timepiece, they&#8217;ve been kind enough to add a small hours, minutes, and seconds indicator.</p>
<p>Why is it so expensive? Probably because each of the 405 pieces is handmade and it is literally a unique work of art, made in limited series and available only to the creme of the watch-buying oligarchs. While it won&#8217;t survive a fall quite like a Casio, you&#8217;ll at least be able to stop your entourage of lantern-jawed men and beautiful women, consult your watch, and say, in your captain of industry voice, &#8220;Y&#8217;all going to need umbrellas.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can check out more on the watch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.breva-watch.com">here</a> or pick up one of the 110 made at your local watch shop (not really.)</p>

<p>Google co-founder Sergey Brin took the stage at the TED Conference late in February, delivering a talk about Google Glass in which he dropped his now <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/02/google-glass-at-ted/">infamous quote about smartphones being &#8220;emasculating.</a>&#8221; Now the video is available in full for all to see (via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sergey-brin-using-a-smartphone-is-emasculating-2013-3">Business Insider</a>), so you can see not only the money moment at around 4:26, but also hear Brin&#8217;s thoughts on Glass and its origins.</p>
<p>The talk is relatively brief, at around 10 minutes long when you take away the Google Glass promo video, but it&#8217;s interesting nonetheless. Especially when Brin gets into how much time Google Glass frees up for your standard skydiving outings, and when he channels Socially Awkward Penguin during the Q&amp;A talking about the fake Glass auction that went up on eBay.</p>

<p>LIFX&#8217;s original ship date was slated for March of 2013, but as of today co-founder Andrew Birt says the first 500 units should be rolling off the line in about four weeks time with a May/June Kickstarter shipping timeframe in mind, which isn&#8217;t that much of a delay in Kickstarter time. That&#8217;s why the company has now released the video above, which shows the production prototype in action, connecting to Wi-Fi, being controlled by the remote app with light color changing features and a demo of gesture-based dimming in action.</p>
<p>The new second batch of LIFX bulbs is set for a September 2013 delivery date, so they&#8217;ll come after the startup fulfills its Kickstarter pledge pre-orders. All bulb types, including Edison screw, Bayonet and Downlight mounts, start at $79 (just $10 more than the original Kickstarter single-bulb price), and all have price breaks for bulk orders.</p>
<p>Unlike Philips Hue, LIFX bulbs don&#8217;t require a base to connect to your network, and the Edison screw and Bayonet types are rated at 900 lumens on the LIFX (around 80w), while max brightness on the Hue is just 600 lumens (roughly 50w). Philips Hue bulbs cost $20 less per unit, but you also have to buy the starter kit which includes the base to get up and running, a $199 initial investment. Of course, the ultimate test will be in performance, so we&#8217;ll have to see how LIFX compares to the generally very positive reviews the Philips Hue is garnering.</p>

<p>The newly licensed content from BBC Worldwide, available to stream immediately, includes <i>The Story of Trac</i><i>y Beaker</i>, pre-school show <i>Teletubbies</i><i>,</i> family drama <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i> and the interactive live-action show <i>Balamory</i>. Details of the number of shows licensed have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>The content deal is just the latest between LOVEFiLM and BBC Worldwide. Last month the pair beefed up their content partnership, adding a variety of drama series and factual programming including Top Gear. Announcing that agreement with the BBC&#8217;s commercial arm, Jim Buckle, MD at LOVEFiLM, said in a statement: “We kicked off 2012 by announcing a new deal with BBC Worldwide and it is great to see-in 2013 by adding to that agreement.”</p>
<p>LOVEFiLM Instant has previously licensed children&#8217;s content from the likes of Aardman, eOne, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/21/go-go-content-amazons-lovefilm-adds-2000-childrens-shows-including-inspector-gadget-in-new-dhx-cookie-jar-deal/">DHX Media</a>, Disney and Saban Brands. The deal with DHX Media added 2,000 children&#8217;s shows to its UK catalog.</p>
<p>Building out rich kids&#8217; offerings is a key strategy for on-demand streaming services, as they seek to make themselves indispensable to the parents who pay for the service.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tiny-postlg.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Tiny Post" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvisor</a>, the travel site built around destination guides and user reviews, today made another acquisition: it has bought <a target="_blank" href="http://tinypost.co/">Tiny Post</a>, an iOS app that lets users take pictures, write captions over them, and then share them with people on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it looks like this was both an acqui-hire as well as a product acquisition. The team behind Tiny Post, including founders Dick Brouwer and Melissa Miranda, will join TripAdvisor&#8217;s Palo Alto office; and TripAdvisor&#8217;s CEO Steve Kaufer is describing Tiny Post itself as a &#8220;great fit&#8221; with the rest of TripAdvisor&#8217;s business.</p>
<p>From a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tripadvisor-acquires-tiny-post-199507931.html">statement</a> issued by TripAdvisor:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Tiny Post team have created a wonderful app that shows the possibilities of combining travel photos with social and mobile. We think Tiny Post is a great fit with our continued drive to provide engaging and sharable content and I am happy to welcome this strong team to TripAdvisor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not TripAdvisor&#8217;s first acquisition by a long shot &#8212; it&#8217;s bought at least 11 companies since we started <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/tripadvisor">tracking them in 2007</a>. But it is the first since December 2012, when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20121211005961/en/Liberty-Interactive-Corporation-Acquires-Voting-Control-TripAdvisor">Liberty Interactive took a majority stake in the company for $300 million</a>. Today, TripAdvisor says that it gets 200 million unique monthly visitors and features over 100 million reviews and opinions across 30 countries, with its service in China branded daodao.com. TripAdvisor tells me that about 75% of its monthly traffic comes from outside the U.S.</p>
<p>This will give Tiny Post potentially a much, much bigger audience for its service. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/tiny-post/">Rebranded to Tiny Post</a> in August 2012 from its original name of Tiny Review, it started life incubated in the 500 Startups program in February 2012, where it was praised for being an &#8220;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/02/the-seven-most-interesting-startups-at-500-startups-demo-day-2/">Instagram for reviews</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Reviews, of course, are a core element of what TripAdvisor also offers. It uses them to help rate hotels, restaurants and other services. In this sense it competes against companies like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foursquare.com">Foursquare</a>, big players in mobile-based search for local venues with a heavy emphasis on user reviews.</p>
<p>This provides a key to how TripAdvisor may end up using Tiny Post, or a variation of its service: users are already uploading hundreds of their own images to TripAdvisor to fill out data about locations and specific venues; this will give users another way of presenting that data, specifically from a mobile platform. Right now, Trip Advisor&#8217;s iPhone apps (a <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tripadvisor-hotels-flights/id284876795?mt=8">general one</a> for accessing the overall site; and another focused on <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tripadvisor-offline-city-guides/id480066121?mt=8">city guides</a>) are more geared at accessing data already on the site than they are about uploading new data.</p>
<p>Playing on the Lolcats-inspired concept of photos with messages across them, this could also prove to be a way of jumping up the number of users engaging with TripAdvisor &#8212; particularly on mobile &#8212; and could help it better target the younger demographics that so love to create and ride on memes.</p>
<p>While this is one of TripAdvisor&#8217;s first big mobile moves, it has been making other acquisitions to fill out its social ambitions. They include <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/02/tripadvisor-acquires-wanderfly-to-continue-social-travel-push/">WanderFly</a>, which was bought in October 2012. Wanderfly offers online travel bookers the option of doing so in a social way &#8212; using other users&#8217; reviews throughout the process to help made decisions. This exists in addition to TripAdvisor&#8217;s integration with Facebook&#8217;s social graph &#8212; which has largely become table stakes for any online business that wants to expand the social dimensions of its service.</p>
<p>The Wanderfly deal is perhaps a sign of how TripAdvisor may use its Tiny Post acquisition going forward: while Wanderfly&#8217;s people may be feeding products and ideas into the larger TripAdvisor experience, the standalone service also remains active today.</p>

<p>&#8211; Europe&#8217;s 408 million users is impressive, but it&#8217;s not the largest region worldwide, and it doesn&#8217;t have the most engaged users. Asia Pacific continues to retain its crown as the single-biggest region for online consumers with 637 million users &#8212; a natural consequence, perhaps, of the fact that it also has the biggest population. As with Europe, it&#8217;s slightly misleading to think in terms of regions in the sense that we are talking about different language groups and different cultures of usage, but it still gives an idea of what the centers of gravity are in the tech world. Overall, growth of online consumers is not huge at the moment, with Europe and Asia Pacific&#8217;s rate of 7% for the year topping the chart.</p>
<p>When it comes to usage, although North America is not the biggest in terms of online population &#8212; its online consumers are now at 215 million, or 16% of the world&#8217;s online population, compared to 66% in 1996 &#8212; its audience remains the most digital-friendly, with the average consumer spending 42.8 hours per month online. The fact that it&#8217;s a more mature and more receptive market are the main reasons why consumers in countries like the U.S. continue to be disproportionately influential.</p>

<p>&#8211; In mobile, comScore focused only on the top 5 markets in the region, and in there the tipping point towards smartphones has well and truly been reached. Each of the five markets of UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain now have more than 50% of consumers using smartphones, with Spain in the lead at 66% &#8212; for a combined regional penetration of 57%. These numbers, again, cover 2012, and I expect the figure to go up by a little jump again next year &#8212; and even more if comScore begins to widen the net to include other markets that are at earlier stages of development. It notes at in December 2012, 75% of the devices purchased by consumers in the EU5 were smartphones, versus 66% a year ago.</p>
<p>Samsung and Google&#8217;s Android, as before, continue to win the spoils in smartphones, with Samsung accounting for nearly one-third of all smartphones, and Android as the OS on half of all devices in use. Worth noting that Nokia base of existing Symbian users is still bigger than the base of users on Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone OS, with Symbian covering 12% of the market and all of Microsoft&#8217;s operating systems (which also include legacy Windows Mobile users) at 5%.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211; In online video, YouTube continues to be the leader by a very wide margin in Europe, with minutes per viewer in seven markets &#8212; Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Turkey, UK &#8212; in the multiple hundreds, compared to double-digits for other providers (Turkey being an exception, where Facebook.com is making slightly more headway). While this week we saw reports, unconfirmed, that Yahoo wants to take a stake in YouTube competitor Dailymotion, judging by comScore&#8217;s numbers, it would be buying into a diamond in the rough: the only market where Dailymotion makes a showing is in its home country of France.</p>
