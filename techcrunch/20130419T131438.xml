				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/htc-one-review01.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="htc-one-review01" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>The <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/19/hands-on-with-htcs-would-be-savior-the-htc-one/">HTC One</a>, the Taiwanese company&#8217;s flagship smartphone device, goes on sale today across the U.S. at retail stores including AT&amp;T, Sprint, Best Buy, Walmart Target and more, as well as online via those retailers, HTC itself, Amazon and beyond. The phone has already been highly praised by early reviews and anyone who seems to have gotten their lucky mitts on one, but will that be enough to sway consumers?</p>
<p>HTC has arguably not made a truly bad phone in at least the past two years, and last year the HTC One X truly excelled. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped HTC&#8217;s earnings from sliding for five consecutive quarters now. The One, which is as significant a break from tradition in terms of how Android smartphones are designed as any we&#8217;ve yet seen, is the company&#8217;s big bet to turn things around, and they appear to have spared no effort.</p>
<p>The One has a unibody full metal body design, a first for a smartphone, as well as speakers that don&#8217;t suck, itself an achievement for any kind of phone. Reviews of the UltraPixel camera have been good, too, with <a target="_blank" href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2013/04/17/htc-one-review-video/">Mobile Syrup</a> calling it &#8220;the best low-light camera you can buy.&#8221; And the HTC software features, including BlinkFeed and HTC Zoe, are also drawing praise from press and reviewers.</p>
<p>HTC has a big mountain to climb in terms of coming anywhere close to competing with Android juggernaut Samsung, or Apple and its iPhone in terms of market share. But the HTC One is the best chances anyone has had of doing so in a long time. If only they&#8217;d left Van Der Beek out of this.</p>
<p>For those looking to pick one up today, here&#8217;s a full list of its current U.S. availability direct from HTC:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The new HTC One in silver is available nationwide at:</strong></p>

The app, now <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.doo">live on Google Play</a>, supplements its existing Mac OS X and Windows 8 desktop apps. An iOS app is also in the works (due &#8220;shortly&#8221;, says doo).</p>
<p>The Android app lets doo users view and search documents stored elsewhere which they have linked to their doo account. Documents can also be downloaded locally to their Android device.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/doo-android-app/1-doo-playstore-en/" rel="attachment wp-att-802138"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=802153" rel="attachment wp-att-802153"></a></p>
<p>Doo&#8217;s document management software works by getting users to point it to the digital folders and accounts (such as email accounts) where documents are stored. The app then creates &#8220;smart tags&#8221; for documents, based on their content, document type, creation date and so on, to make it easier for the user to search for and locate the right one.</p>
<p>Doo&#8217;s software can grab document data via optical character recognition if required (enabling it to support paper document management, as well as PDFs). Its cloud can also be used for document back-up, as well as syncing access across devices.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how doo describes the new Android app:</p>
<blockquote><p>People want to take their documents wherever they go, regardless of where they were initially created and stored. doo for Android augments doo for OS X and Windows 8 by giving our users a way to do so. Our first mobile app is currently a document reader that, when linked with a doo account, allows users to access documents from all their sources: their local hard drive, a second internal drive, an external drive, Google Drive, Dropbox and email accounts.</p>
<p>With on-the-go access, users nonetheless benefit from the ease and power of doo’s tag-based search. All tags applied to their documents by doo’s intelligent algorithms are automatically transferred to their Android devices. Selective download lets users individually decide, which documents to download to their Android device.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doo landed a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/16/doo-net-lands-series-a-funding-to-organise-documents-automatically-for-the-people/">Series A round last June</a>, when it launched its public beta, which took its total funding to $10m.</p>

Ted Schlein, general partner at KPCB, will be joining Ionic Security&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>The company originally <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/social-fortress-is-a-simple-but-powerful-skeleton-keydata-security-service-for-your-digital-life/">launched last Fall as Social Fortress</a>, as a way for both consumers and enterprise users to simplify how they access and secure their important data, including emails, Yammer messages, photos, tweets, or status updates. The startup also allowed users to manage who gets to access to this data by encrypting everything.</p>
<p>Since last year, the startup shifted focus to the enterprise, and now, under the name Ionic Security, offers an end-to-end security, identity and access management platform for encrypted data in the cloud. And Ionic provides this without the need for, or use of, gateways. Users can centrally manage all employee login credentials for software apps plus internal applications.</p>
<p>As Kleiner Perkins partner Ted Schlein explains, there are a lot of companies working on access to cloud but no one ever put it together into a seamless system that addresses all aspects of cloud security and is endpoint agnostic.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s software has seen interest from the defense industrial base and the healthcare and financial services industries in both North America and Europe.</p>
<p>“Security needs to change with the times,” says Schlein. “Enterprises have historically secured their data through network security, endpoint protections and central identity management offerings that are no match for the complex security challenges inherent in the combination of cloud services and the rise of bring-your-own-device policies. Ionic Security addresses this challenge head-on by providing enablement, not restriction and is poised to become standard in next-generation enterprise IT infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand Ionic’s engineering team, accelerate enterprise sales and for sales and marketing.</p>

<p>With the plethora of different cloud services consumers can now tap into to store stuff getting visibility on all that disparate content via a single dashboard with the ability to search across multiple services makes plenty of sense. The new search function can also be used to throw the net wider, and hunt down new content on social services, be it on YouTube or Instagram or Vimeo &#8212; so it&#8217;s designed to facilitate cloud content discovery too.</p>
<p>In an email notification sent to subscribers (a part of which is shown below), Jolicloud said search has been one of the &#8220;most requested features&#8221; for its new offering.</p>

According to this article in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.ru/kompanii/potrebitelskii-rynok/237640-amazon-prishel-v-rossiyu">Forbes</a> (in Russian) the company has opened its first office in the country, headed by Arkady Vitrouk. Vitrouk is the former general director of ABC-Atticus, a publishing group owned by media baron Alexander Mamut. </p>
<p>Forbes cites unnamed sources but notes that the appointment, and the office opening, have not been confirmed by Amazon itself. However, we&#8217;ve discovered that Vitrouk&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/arkady-vitrouk/0/358/144">LinkedIn profile</a> does confirm him as director of Kindle Content for Amazon in Russia. </p>
<p>Looking a little closer, Amazon is hiring for at least three other positions for Russia specifically for its Kindle business and the sourcing of local content: a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&amp;jobId=5448652&amp;trk=vsrp_jobs_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9830241366362529029%2CVSRPtargetId%3A5448652%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary">senior product manager for Kindle content pricing</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&amp;jobId=5448573&amp;trk=vsrp_jobs_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A9830241366362641045%2CVSRPtargetId%3A5448573%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary">principal for content acquisition</a> for Kindle Russia, and another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/jobs/215319/ref=j_sr_3_t?ie=UTF8&amp;category=*&amp;jobSearchKeywords=russia&amp;location=*&amp;page=1">content acquisition manager</a>. </p>
<p>A visit to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.ru">amazon.ru</a> currently redirects to the company&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/gateway-eu">main page for Europe</a>, with links to other countries&#8217; local sites, including the UK, France, Spain, German and Italy. We have contacted Amazon and Vitrouk himself for more detail and will update this story as we learn more.</p>
<p>The news comes in the same week that Amazon <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/amazon-takes-its-android-appstore-global-adding-200-more-countries/">announced</a> that it would take its Appstore business international &#8212; extending it to nearly 200 countries, another sign of how the company is gearing up for more scale. It also follows <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/eu/2012/11/30/barnes-noble-is-gearing-up-to-enter-russian-market-with-nook-tablets/">reports</a> (again unconfirmed) that Barnes &amp; Noble is also preparing for more Nook activity in Russia.</p>
<p>Russia is currently Europe&#8217;s largest internet market, according to a recent study from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/comscore-russia-widens-online-lead-in-europe-with-61-3m-users-eu5-smartphone-penetration-now-57-samsung-android-leading/">comScore</a>, with an online audience of 61.3 million users. </p>
<p>That, combined with Russia&#8217;s rapidly rising middle class, has led to a boom in e-commerce. <a target="_blank" href="http://rt.com/business/russia-online-shopping-report-769/">Morgan Stanley</a> believes the Russian e-commerce market will be worth $36 billion by 2015, up from $12 billion in 2012.</p>
<p>Russia has been a noticeable hole in Amazon&#8217;s footprint, but that has spelled opportunity for local players, too. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ozon.ru">Ozon</a> &#8212; commonly called the &#8220;Amazon of Russia&#8221; &#8212; has raised <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ozon-ru">$121 million</a> in funding and has been building up a very Amazon-like business, complete with a logistics network. </p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve pointed out <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/21/from-russia-with-money-how-kupivip-is-riding-the-middle-class-wave-in-europes-most-connected-market/">before</a>, this is especially important in a country like Russia, which doesn&#8217;t have a solid, extenstive pre-existing delivery infrastructure that spans across the whole of the huge country. </p>
<p>That, and the lack of credit card penetration, has meant that companies like Ozon and fashion/home goods site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kupivip.ru">KupiVIP</a> (itself <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/kupivip">flush with $120 million of funding</a>) have built out fleets of their own delivery trucks, with drivers who take cash on delivery for goods (KupiVIP, focusing on clothes, will <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/21/from-russia-with-money-how-kupivip-is-riding-the-middle-class-wave-in-europes-most-connected-market/">even wait until the recipient tries something on</a>, so that the item can also get returned on the spot if it&#8217;s unsuitable). </p>
<p>Ozon&#8217;s business has been built on its extensive logistics network to deliver a soup-to-nuts range of goods, but it has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/ozon-russian-amazon-result/">not ruled out doing more in cloud services</a>. However it seems less interested in Kindle-style products like tablets, e-readers and digital content.</p>
<p>This is where Amazon could come in. In another BRIC market, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com.br">Brazil, Amazon</a> has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/06/amazon-finally-reclaims-its-namesake-launches-in-brazil-with-kindle-store/">building out a business based</a> on its non-physical goods &#8212; Kindle books and Kindle devices. </p>
<p>This could be one route to how Amazon decides to tackle Russia, at least in part. In that sense, it&#8217;s interesting that the Forbes report specifically names as the head of Amazon in Russia someone whose immediate experience lies precisely in publishing, rather than e-commerce or retail, and that he&#8217;s already heading up business for the company there in that vein.</p>
<p>P.S. I write &#8220;at least in part,&#8221; because it turns out that Amazon is also hiring for other Russia-related expansion plans. Fashion e-commerce site <a target="_blank" href="http://www.shopbop.com">Shopbop</a>, owned by Amazon, is seeking a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/jobs/207098/ref=j_sr_1_t?ie=UTF8&amp;category=*&amp;jobSearchKeywords=russia&amp;location=*&amp;page=1">marketing manager</a> for a new rollout in Russia. Amazon has also been <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/jobs/202238/ref=j_sr_2_t?ie=UTF8&amp;category=*&amp;jobSearchKeywords=russia&amp;location=*&amp;page=1">headhunting in Moscow for software engineers</a> &#8212; although these would be for relocation to Seattle.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/isenze_4.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="iSenze device" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />The white device here (pictured next to a phone for scale) is in the process of getting mounted on store walls in Singapore malls. When active, the device will emit an ultrasonic signal that an app can pick up, and will allow participating stores to broadcast deals and rewards to shoppers. The device is called the iSenze, and is made by a startup in Singapore called Rainmaker Labs. Rainmaker&#8217;s bigger plan is to roll out a service called ShopGuru to stores, which allows them to list deals on it. Users who have the ShopGuru app can browse for deals. How it all connects is that some deals require users to physically step into these stores, and the iSenze will ensure that their presence is logged. Alex Leong, co-founder at Rainmaker Labs, showed me the device recently. The service isn&#8217;t live yet, but will be in a month or two. The company intends to get its clients properly onboard before launching, he said. Rainmaker is first targeting fashion brands and will go to F&#38;B chains after that. It&#8217;s signed about 18-20 so far, and has been trialing the device in stores over the past six months. The company has a &#8220;six-digit&#8221; budget to push out its marketing campaign, so they&#8217;re taking their time to get it done right, he said. The way the app offers rewards is to award users points for browsing deals on it. You get more points for walking into the store, and should you buy anything, you can log your purchase with your user ID at check out for additional points. These points are redeemable for other goods from participating stores. On the retailer&#8217;s end, the ShopGuru service will provide a dashboard with some customer analytics in it, said Leong. This is derived from customer behavior in the app, as well as their physical movements, as tracked by the iSenze. This can provide more accurate feedback on what customers are interested in, and what deals don&#8217;t get picked up. It&#8217;s free for shops to sign up with the ShopGuru service, but Rainmaker takes a cut of the sales made through it.

When active, the device will emit an ultrasonic signal that an app can pick up, and will allow participating stores to broadcast deals and rewards to shoppers.</p>
<p>The device is called the iSenze, and is made by a startup in Singapore called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rainmaker-labs.com/">Rainmaker Labs</a>. Rainmaker&#8217;s bigger plan is to roll out a service called ShopGuru to stores, which allows them to list deals on it. Users who have the ShopGuru app can browse for deals. How it all connects is that some deals require users to physically step into these stores, and the iSenze will ensure that their presence is logged.</p>
<p>Alex Leong, co-founder at Rainmaker Labs, showed me the device recently. The service isn&#8217;t live yet, but will be in a month or two. The company intends to get its clients properly onboard before launching, he said. Rainmaker is first targeting fashion brands and will go to F&amp;B chains after that. It&#8217;s signed about 18-20 so far, and has been trialing the device in stores over the past six months.</p>
<p>The company has a &#8220;six-digit&#8221; budget to push out its marketing campaign, so they&#8217;re taking their time to get it done right, he said.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/isenze_2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The way the app offers rewards is to award users points for browsing deals on it. You get more points for walking into the store, and should you buy anything, you can log your purchase with your user ID at check out for additional points. These points are redeemable for other goods from participating stores.<br />
On the retailer&#8217;s end, the ShopGuru service will provide a dashboard with some customer analytics in it, said Leong. This is derived from customer behavior in the app, as well as their physical movements, as tracked by the iSenze. This can provide more accurate feedback on what customers are interested in, and what deals don&#8217;t get picked up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s free for shops to sign up with the ShopGuru service, but Rainmaker takes a cut of the sales made through it.</p>
<p>Rainmaker was founded in March 2011, and closed its first seed round of S$590,000 last November, led by Singaporean tech investor, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.incuvestasia.com/Team.html">Incuvest</a>. Together with some angel funding at the start, Rainmaker has hit $800,000 so far, said Leong.</p>
<p>Ronnie Wee, managing partner at Incuvest, said the team was picked for incubation because of the potential in solving a &#8220;real problem in the market today&#8221;. &#8220;Since our investment, they have started to show good progress and solid traction with customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rainmaker&#8217;s managed to pull along a few seasoned advisors in the country as well. Liew Woon Yin was the former CEO of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ipos.gov.sg/">IPOS</a>), and is a pro bono consultant for the startup. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sgtatler.com/300list/tay-liam-wee">Tay Liam Wee</a>, group managing director of Sincere Watches is also an advisor.</p>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s first for the ShopGuru service, but it intends to move into the Southeast Asian region soon after.</p>

Besides Qzone, the Chinese Internet giant is perhaps better known for its flagship QQ instant messenger and the exploding WeChat smartphone messaging app. I spoke to Peter Zheng, vice president of Tencent&#8217;s social network group. He&#8217;s been overseeing Qzone&#8217;s evolution for the past eight years. He told me that when Qzone was launched in 2005, it was initially planned as a Geocities-style blog community, before the company decided to add social aspects by linking blogs to users&#8217; QQ accounts. &#8220;Luckily, when we started, Facebook wasn&#8217;t common in China. There were some challenges from other platforms like microblogs such as Weibo, but these [Twitter-like channels] are quite public, and people saw QZone as a more private space,&#8221; he said. It wasn&#8217;t always supposed to be walled, but QZone inherited the company&#8217;s older QQ contact list that added people based on user IDs, not more universal identifiers like email addresses or phone numbers. And unlike what we&#8217;re used to on Facebook or LinkedIn for example, you can&#8217;t see who your friends&#8217; friends are because of the way those lists were architected, said Zheng. &#8220;For a while, we were concerned that that made it hard for people to expand their friends lists. Our legacy was closed, and we thought it hindered the expansion of the network,&#8221; he said. But it seemed to work out. &#8220;Over time, our users told us that they didn&#8217;t want to add contacts the way you do on Facebook. When everyone is added deliberately because you sought them out, you&#8217;re just adding buddies you want to share your updates with. Turns out that was a way to keep your friend circles tight, and our users are keener to share on Qzone because of that,&#8221; he said. This is the mantra of some of the &#8220;private&#8221; sharing platforms like Path—some with more success than others—but Tencent seems to have stumbled upon the working formula and had its popularity multiplied by the sheer volume of users coming onboard in its home country.

Turns out that was a way to keep your friend circles tight, and our users are keener to share on Qzone because of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is the mantra of some of the &#8220;private&#8221; sharing platforms like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/08/in-first-24- hours-of-3-0-launch-path-made-more-money-than-ever-and-sent- more-than-1m-messages/">Path</a>—some with more success than others—but Tencent seems to have stumbled upon the working formula and had its popularity multiplied by the sheer volume of users coming onboard in its home country.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/qzoneconcurrent.jpg"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><sup>Over 100 million users concurrently on Qzone, with most of them concentrated in China</sup></p>
<p>Another way it has fueled its user growth is an early emphasis on the mobile phone. The Qzone app was released in early 2010, and included features like photo filters and the option to record voice memos. While a typical Twitter or Tumblr user would take a photo, open it in a separate app to dress it up, then open the blogging app to post it, all of this can be done within Qzone&#8217;s app, reducing the friction to post. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram </a>was launched towards Fall 2010.)</p>
<p>The Qzone app has also added features that caught on with Asian users earlier than they did in the West, such as decorative water marks. &#8220;Asian users like to decorate their photos, not just filter them,&#8221; he said. Qzone&#8217;s app also allows users to add a voice clip as a status update, or tag it to a photo. &#8220;That makes it feel more personal. You can send a gift and attach a voice clip from the phone too,&#8221; Zheng said.</p>
<p>When he showed me a typical Qzone page, I was boggled by how busy the page was, with animations and audio. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost like MySpace,&#8221; I say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort of,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But it isn&#8217;t really the form factor that matters the most. Maintaining the relationship with your existing user base and keeping them happy goes a long way. You want to be on the social network that your friends are on, and always keeping it fresh means users stay happy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tapping the ideas of 22,000</strong></p>
<p><a title="building of Tencent by Leben Ⅰ, on Flickr" target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leben_bin/4713875293/"></a></p>
<p>It is here in Shenzhen&#8217;s hi-tech district that Zheng&#8217;s 2,000 or so engineers work on Qzone. The Tencent headquarters is a sprawling skyscraper, dwarfing its myriad grey-washed neighbors. While I had problems getting my cab driver to register exactly where I wanted to be in the already famous Hua Qiang Bei cluster, simply saying &#8220;Tencent&#8221; in English got him to immediately acknowledge, exclaiming &#8220;Teng Xun Da Sha&#8221;, which translates to Tencent Plaza in Mandarin.</p>
<p>Started in 1998, Tencent is China&#8217;s largest Internet company by revenue, and was the first Internet company in the country to break through the $1 billion revenue mark in 2009.</p>
<p>My arrival at the headquarters was kicked off with a tour of the impressive lobby showcase area. A big, gleaming board reflected how many users were concurrently on QQ—156 million that Wednesday afternoon, with a peak of 172 million. The company counts an active user as someone who logs in more than twice a month, and by that measure, has an impressively high retention rate of 700 million out of its 1 billion total users worldwide.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/qqconcurrent.jpg"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><sup>156 million users chatting on QQ instant messenger at the same time</sup></p>
<p>&#8220;This is the same tour that our CEO, Pony Ma, gave to (Chinese Communist Party general secretary) Xi Jinping when he visited,&#8221; informed my guide in impeccable English. I asked her how long she&#8217;s been working for Tencent, and she said she&#8217;s been with the company for the past two years since she graduated. &#8220;I do not consider myself young here,&#8221; she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>And perhaps she can&#8217;t. The average age of Tencent&#8217;s 22,000 employees is merely 26—a feat made possible by an aggressive, ongoing hiring campaign that takes Tencent to tertiary institutions in the country in order to sniff out their finest.</p>
<p>The constant influx of fresh blood could be one of the reasons why Tencent has kept up with China&#8217;s relatively young Internet population. China&#8217;s average age across its user base is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121002150727 -416648-the-chinese-user-is-more-like-you-than-you-think? trk=mp-details-rr-rmpost">just 25</a>, while in the US, that number is much higher at 42.</p>
<p>How do you juggle ideas coming in from thousands of young, enthusiastic minds? &#8220;Unfortunately, you have to cancel projects if they don&#8217;t work after a certain time, usually several weeks or months,&#8221; said Zheng.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no bad ideas, only bad execution. So we give all ideas a fair chance, but we look for teams with bad execution and we do kill their projects,&#8221; he said.</p>

Of course, a platform for live concerts isn&#8217;t exactly a new idea. In fact, it&#8217;s been floating around for years, but those entering the space have been hamstrung to an over-abundance of friction stemming from royalty and licensing issues and having to convince venues to install the technology and hardware &#8212; among other things. As a result, live online music has been slow to take off.</p>
<p>But the EvntLive founders see a new music industry beginning to emerge, in which the new scale of online consumption and distribution channels now allow artists to tap into much larger audiences. In turn, with digital music moving towards free, artists now make most of their money from touring, but because they can only tour so much and play so many venues, the access to new audiences and ticket sales afforded by a live, online platform is becoming more appealing.</p>
<p>EvntLive isn&#8217;t the only startup looking to capitalize on this shift. While it remains in private beta, services like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concertwindow.com/">Concert Window</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stageit.com/">StageIt</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://qello.com/">Qello</a> are live and finding traction. Concert Window co-founder Dan Gurney tells us that the startup is beginning to hit its stride, having quadrupled revenue over the last five months, added a handful of employees and is now broadcasting over 100 live shows each month. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/homepagescreenshot.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The startup has been able to do by broadcasting live concerts over the Web, allowing you to listen and watch as the concert happens from the comfort of your couch. To address the friction for venues mentioned above, Concert Window attempts to take the work out of the hands of venue managers &#8212; all the venue needs is an Internet connection. </p>
<p>The startup provides the equipment, camera and cables, and its system controls the broadcast remotely, so, after the initial setup, venues can just kick back and stream whenever they please. No production team required.</p>
<p>On the user experience end, Concert Window has done its best to keep online ticket prices low (under $10, depending on the concert), and distributes two-thirds of ticket sales to the venue and artist, making it a comparable revenue split to iTunes and app stores. Both the video and audio quality are high, which is a must for online concert services, and if you have a good sound system and are lazy like I am, it almost beats being there in person. By addressing these barriers, Concert Window has been able to stream 2,000 concerts with 1,500+ artists at 15 partner venues to date. To really make a dent, it will be key to offer more selection, but it&#8217;s a pretty good start.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Concert Window has dealt with licensing and rights hurdles by focusing exclusively on livestreaming, rather than offering both streaming and archiving. This leaves a gap in the experience, and down the road, the startup that takes the cake in this space is going to do both (and do both on mobile), but it will be a long, uphill battle to work out all the minutia with rights holders. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/showpagescreenshot.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Since launching last fall, Concert Window has been focused on building relationships with venues and artists, meaning that design and its UI have taken a backseat. But, today, the startup officially launched a platform-wide redesign and new branding. The startup now offers an HTML5-compatible site, allowing viewers to tap into what it claims is the largest concert volume of any live music platform from their computer, smartphone or tablet. </p>
<p>By offering a mobile experience, a relatively steady stream of concerts and allowing fans to chat with each other and leave feedback for artists, Concert Window hopes its v2.0 can give it a leg up on the competition.</p>

<p>Blackstone and activist investor Carl Icahn <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/24/michael-dell-may-lose-control-of-pc-maker-after-two-competing-buyout-bids-emerge/">put in bids </a>for Dell on March 22, the last day of the &#8220;go-shop&#8221; period to solicit competing offers for Dell after Michael Dell and Silver Lake made a $24.4 billion buyout offer for the PC maker that some investors complained undervalued the company. </p>
<p>The Reuters report said it&#8217;s still unclear why Blackstone decided to drop its offer, though sources <a target="_blank" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/blackstone-seen-abandoning-bid-for-dell">cited in the New York Times</a> said Blackstone decided to walk away from the deal after &#8220;discovering that Dell&#8217;s business was deteriorating faster than previously understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dell&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-04-18/blackstone-said-to-pull-out-of-dell-bid-on-plummeting-pc-sales">fourth-quarter operating margin </a>shrank to 4.88 percent from 5.81 percent a year earlier, while its cash flow from operations was reduced to $1.44 billion from $1.84 billion. Sales fell 11 percent to $14.3 billion. The company has been hurt as demand for PCs waver due to competition from mobile devices. According to IDC, global PC sales fell 14 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Icahn and Blackstone initially discussed working together on a rival bid. Blackstone offered to pay more than $14.25 per share for Dell. Icahn, who is being advised by investment bank Jefferies Group, offered $15 per share for 58 percent of Dell’s stock, and has yet to drop the proposal, which means there may still be a bidding war for the PC maker.</p>
<p>Michael Dell and Silver Lake’s offer was to take Dell private for $13.65 per share, with Silver Lake putting up $1.4 billion. That deal would allow Michael Dell to remain CEO of the company, and he’d also contribute his 16 percent stake in Dell’s equity to the deal along with cash from his investment firm MSD Capital. </p>
<p>Michael Dell has stated that he wants to shift Dell&#8217;s strategy to focus on tablets, data-center hardware, and software for corporations from manufacturing PCs. He returned as CEO of Dell in 2007 after originally resigning that position in 2004.</p>

The app is called One Today, and it&#8217;s currently invite only for Android users at this time. The aim is to get people to donate $1 to different organizations, while getting the complete information about how your donation will be used up front. This is a huge stumbling block for nonprofits usually, as people are afraid that their money won&#8217;t actually get spent on making a real difference. One Today aims to change that. Additionally, One Today has a social component to it, letting you set a cap to how much money you&#8217;ll match if your friends donate to a cause. By using Google Wallet, you can simply pay off your &#8220;donation balance&#8221; once all of your friends have used up your cap. It&#8217;s a pretty interesting way of crowdsourcing donations. When I talk to people about giving money to causes, the first problem they have is that they can&#8217;t find one that they&#8217;re passionate about. By allowing you to put the choice of who to donate in your friends&#8217; hands, this problem simply goes away and there&#8217;s no excuse not to give. You don&#8217;t have to involve others though, as you can participate by yourself or interact with the app&#8217;s community. Currently, the landing page allows you to request an invite, even though the app itself is available for download on Google Play. If you open the app, you&#8217;re shown the invite screen yet again and there&#8217;s no word on when One Today will start opening itself up to users and donations. Some other interesting aspects of the app are that it&#8217;s populated only with nonprofits that Google.org is currently working with, so you know that they&#8217;re pre-screened. Other sites, such as Causes, are filled up with organizations that have little or no information about itself or what is done with the money that they&#8217;re raising. That&#8217;s clearly not the case with this app, according to the programs that will be pre-populated: Organizations can also register to be included. From the looks of the app screenshots, One Today seems extremely polished and well thought out.

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/unnamed-2.png"></a></p>
<p>The reason for putting this together is addressed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/onetoday/faq.html">app&#8217;s FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google has a long-standing commitment to supporting nonprofits and to do doing good. One Today makes fundraising easy for nonprofits, it also makes giving simple and fun for users.</p></blockquote>
<p>But yes, Google does collect a 1.9 percent credit card fee, but that&#8217;s not much considering that it takes care of the processing and donation routing for you. These donations are also tax deductible, of course.</p>
<p>The idea of accepting one dollar at a time is easy enough for anyone to chew on, and get into the rhythm of daily giving, which could be a more rewarding experience than giving a lump sum to just one charity every year, for example. As you donate more, the app will start recommending other organizations that might interest you, which is a Google Play app-like purchasing experience. When you tap &#8220;give,&#8221; it&#8217;s actually a pledge, and you&#8217;ll be notified to settle your balance once you&#8217;ve pledged to a few organizations.</p>
<p>With this approach, micro-donations could actually catch on and raise more money for these nonprofits than ever. In many situations, it&#8217;s not the actual amount that you donate, it&#8217;s the awareness that your social actions bring. One Today is an amplification tool, and it will be interesting to see how the project evolves once it opens to the masses.</p>

<p>This has been a busy week for Twitter as it seeks to move beyond being a microblogging platform.In addition to the TV network tie-ups, the company also just <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/twitter-music-app-goes-live/">launched Twitter Music on Good Morning America</a>.</p>
<p>As Jordan Crook notes, the decision to debut the standalone app on network television is a sign that Twitter is aiming directly for a mainstream audience, instead of seeking to first build an audience of early-adopters.</p>
<p>The company has been building out its site as a multimedia platform with a series of acquisition: Twitter Music was built by startup <a target="_blank" href="http://wearehunted.com/?page=7">We Are Hunted</a>, while video-sharing service <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2013/01/vine-new-way-to-share-video.html">Vine was launched in January </a>after Twitter bought it in a low-profile buy out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/formation-8-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="FORMATION8 LOGO" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://formation8.com/">Formation 8</a> wants to bring venture capital back to its roots: investing in solutions to hard technology problems that could change the world. It <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543731/000154373113000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">just raised</a> its first fund of $448 million &#8212; but with a twist. Formation 8 plans to draw on its extensive network and local offices in Asia to win its portfolio of smart enterprise and energy technology companies&#8217; huge deals with conglomerates in the region.</p>
<p>Specifically, Formation 8 is looking for &#8220;smart enterprise&#8221; startups that can help enormous companies like those that define Asia to make sense of the vast seas of data now available. Government, finance, healthcare, and business services can all fall within this net. Formation 8 also seeks energy companies that can transform the global energy value chain. It hopes startups can become platforms to maximize scalability and take advantage of the nimbleness their small size affords.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Formation 8 co-founder and partner Joe Lonsdale tells me his fund isn&#8217;t thumbing its nose at consumer markets, saying &#8221;It&#8217;s not about what&#8217;s right or what&#8217;s wrong, but about what areas we&#8217;re the most passionate about and are the best at.&#8221; As for its focus overseas, Lonsdale riffs, &#8220;If you have a company that&#8217;s trying to transform a big industry, and you&#8217;re ignoring Asia, you&#8217;re making a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with Lonsdale who worked at PayPal and co-founded Palantir, <a target="_blank" href="http://formation8.com/team/">Formation 8&#8242;s founders include</a> Brian Koo of Harbor Pacific Capital and InnovationHub, James Zhang of Softbank China Venture Capital and BioDiscovery, Tom Baruch of CMEA Capital and Intermolecular, and Jim Kim of GE and Khosla Ventures. Lonsdale will be speaking at <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/18/announcing-the-agenda-for-techcrunch-disrupt-ny-2013/">TechCrunch Disrupt NY</a> in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Formation 8 originally closed the first $200 million of the fund last year, and some <a target="_blank" href="http://formation8.com/portfolio-companies/">strong early investments</a> and success had more limited partners lining up to fill up the full $448 million. Lonsdale tells me those include &#8220;founders of PayPal, Palantir, Yahoo, and Yammer, plus Asian conglomerates and some New York institutions. He&#8217;s already thinking about the firm&#8217;s next fund, which he says will probably be around the same size. Why raise $448 million instead of a nice round number like $450 million? Apparently, it&#8217;s a play on the firm&#8217;s name. Four hundred <strong>for</strong>ty <strong>8</strong>. Get it?</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://formation8.com/what-we-look-for/">investment philosophy</a> centers around &#8221;Large, growing and global markets with hard problems that can be solved through technology and partnership.&#8221; It wants companies with a strong technology culture that offer long-term equity incentives, make data-driven decisions, dream big, stress discipline, and have the humility to accept advice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While it invests in startups, Formation 8 recognizes that there are strengths to large corporations, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporations have scale, existing relationships, and distribution advantages in large, established industries such as energy, education, healthcare, logistics, financial services, and government services,&#8221; Lonsdale writes. &#8221;Many Smart Enterprise startups would do well to partner with large corporations that control the data, the knowledge workers, and the distribution channels.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in forging those partnerships that Formation 8 really differentiates itself. The firm&#8217;s local teams in Korea, China, and Singapore can help its portfolio with relationships, sales, deployment and market knowledge. When I asked if corruption would be an issue, Lonsdale admitted some concerns with how the Chinese army mixes with Chinese Internet industries, but says most of Formation 8&#8242;s markets like Korea are exceptionally honorable.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s been a recent increase in deals between Silicon Valley and Asia, Lonsdale says the connection will grow, as smart enterprise and energy businesses disrupt the antiquated big company infrastructures developed 20 to 30 years ago by the first enterprise wave. He concludes: &#8220;You need really talented engineers that are really good at big data to fix the infrastructure in big industry. Obviously there&#8217;s a market for that in the US, but Asia is an even bigger market.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/synergyse-logo.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="synergyse-logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Today, over five million businesses are now using Google Apps to help their employees collaborate and connect via the cloud. In just a few years, the adoption of Google&#8217;s productivity suite has skyrocketed and, while small businesses have long been its core customer, adoption up the chain is increasing as well. At the same time, as the Google Apps ecosystem continues to expand and evolve, with new services emerging around Chromebooks, Vault, Drive and Android, it can be tough for businesses to keep up with all the new tools, tweaks and iterations. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.synergyse.com/">Synergyse</a>, a Toronto-based startup, is launching today to help businesses keep up with changes to Google&#8217;s litany of web-based software services and provide an interactive training system to get employees up to speed. In principle, Synergyse has a similar goal to services like BetterCloud, which also aim to make it easy for businesses to move to and get the most out of Google Apps. However, while BetterCloud offers training videos to help employees learn how to use the productivity suite, the service caters more to Google Apps admins, allowing them to manage domains, reporting, security and compliance.</p>
<p>Synergyse, on the other hand, focuses purely on the educational element, offering an interactive and scalable training system for employees. The startup&#8217;s training platform covers Gmail, GCal and Drive at launch, with more to come soon, offering access to training directly inside each application. Other than a few players like BetterCloud and &#8220;how-to&#8221; videos littered across YouTube, Synergyse co-founder (and former Google engineer) Varun Malhotra tells us that he thinks training has been largely absent from the Google Apps ecosystem. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/screen-shot-2013-04-18-at-5-42-42-pm.png"></a>On Main Street, most businesses have no idea what the latest features are that Google does or doesn&#8217;t offer, so the team set out to develop a training system that is accessible to the Average Joe, regardless of technical proficiency. </p>
<p>Malhotra says that Synergyse works for each of the major versions of Google Apps, for Businesses, Schools and consumers and, because it&#8217;s a Chrome extension and built on top of Google&#8217;s Cloud Platform, Synergyse is able to integrate its training system more effectively throughout the Google ecosystem, while offering security and scalability. Or at least that&#8217;s the idea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Synergyse hopes to appeal to businesses by offering training from directly inside of Google Apps so that you don&#8217;t have to leave an application to learn how to use it and can take actions at the same time. The system is available to users at any time, so employees can learn at their own pace and roll through training sessions whenever they have time. For its tutorials, the startup actually doesn&#8217;t use video, the founder says, instead living inside your Google Apps account, overlaying instruction on your screen as you go, prompting people to click through Apps and input actual info from within their Gmail accounts.</p>
<p>Malhotra also tells us that the startup wants to make sure that users don&#8217;t have to deal with constant updates and downloads, so as new products and tools are added to Google&#8217;s productivity suite, the system updates alongside it, automatically adding new training materials to the apps. Once teams have started using the extension, execs and admins can also tap into reporting options to help track and measure the success of the training system for their employees.</p>
<p>The catalog of lessons were designed by Synergyse CTO Majid Manzarpour, who was &#8220;responsible for training Canada how to use Google Apps,&#8221; while working at Google as its &#8220;sole IT contact for the entire Canadian region&#8221; beginning in 2007, he says. In other words, he knows what he&#8217;s doing, <em>and</em>, because they&#8217;re Canadian, the tutorials are friendly. So there&#8217;s that, too.</p>
<p>Synergyse pricing starts at $10/year for individuals, is free for students and costs businesses $10/employee/year. It also offers an Enterprise option for companies with more than 5,000 employees, with price set on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve already told you about <a target="_blank" href="http://don.na">Donna</a>, the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/11/donna/">new mobile personal assistant app</a> from Incredible Labs. But if you haven&#8217;t actually had a chance to play with the app yourself, it&#8217;s difficult to explain how it&#8217;s different from the growing list of smart calendar and assistant apps now on the market.</p>
<p>The good news is I got a chance to sit down with Incredible Labs CEO Kevin Cheng, who gave us a demo of Donna. The goal is to provide users with help before they even know that they need it. It&#8217;s a novel concept, and Donna actually pulls it off pretty well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach is about bringing the information to you, as opposed to having you find the information,&#8221; Cheng said. &#8220;The purpose of an assistant is to make it so you have to worry less. We don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s a lack of information in our lives, there&#8217;s a lack of filters. What Donna does is bring you that information when you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wanna know how? Check out the video above to see how Donna works to simplify your life and get you where you need to be.</p>

<p>Fundawear represents the condom company&#8217;s first foray into the land of connected devices, and the name explains quite well how it works. You put on special (read: vibrating) underwear that connect to a smartphone app. You can control the vibrations yourself with a smartphone as a remote, or pair the panties with your partner&#8217;s smartphone, so they can control the fun.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t the first time that long-distance sexy time has been <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/20/soft-core-why-do-sex-toy-makers-have-such-horrible-videos/">explored by the tech community</a>. There are a whole host of startups, as well as established sex toy brands, that are working to connect people digitally and physically at the same time.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/24/long-distance-lovers-rejoice-lovepalz-wifi-sex-toys-let-you-get-nasty-in-real-time/">LovePalz</a> duo kit, which seems to be the most intense of all, with parts for both the male and female to simulate sex across long distances and still feel each other&#8217;s movements in real time. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/01/vibease-the-long-distance-relationship-you-always-wanted/">Vibease</a>, along with various offerings from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ohmibod.com/">Ohmibod</a>, come to mind, as well.</p>
<p>However, this is the first time we&#8217;ve seen a condom company throw their hat in the ring, which means that a lot of R&amp;D and resources went into the Fundawear. You know, along with careful consideration over the name.</p>
<p>Fundawear comes in both male and female versions, so you fellas don&#8217;t have to be worried about a one-size-fits-all kind of situation.</p>
<p>The Fundawear undies and app companion aren&#8217;t available just yet, but frisky explorers interested in joining the testing program can head over to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Durex.Australia/app_493857570680544">Durex&#8217;s Australian Facebook page</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/robinhood-feature.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Robinhood feature" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p style="text-align:left;">Most people are too scared to seriously play the stock market. Few amateurs know enough to confidently invest on their own. Luckily, <a target="_blank" href="http://robinhoodapp.com/">free iOS app Robinhood</a> launches today to put crowdsourced finance wisdom in your pocket. Track stocks, view advice on what to buy or sell from other users, share your predictions, and build a reputation. Robinhood could turn a new generation into investors.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just for novices. Robinhood was designed to be the best mobile stock-tracking tool in the world. Surprisingly enough, that&#8217;s not that difficult. When Robinhood&#8217;s founders asked focus groups and financial veterans what they use to research stocks on the web the resounding answer was &#8220;Yahoo Finance,&#8221; but when asked what they used on mobile, most replied &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Robinhood&#8217;s founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt set out to combine social investing with a sleek mobile design that&#8217;s heavy on gestures. They&#8217;re the right guys for the job, since this is their third finance company. Both Stanford grads, Baiju got a master&#8217;s in math there too, while Vlad dropped out of UCLA&#8217;s prestigious math PhD program so the two could found an algorithmic trading startup called Celeris. Then they built the financial software company Chronos Research, which worked with major investment banks.</p>
<p>These experiences revealed the senseless gap in mobile and the unaddressed consumer market.&#8221;Think about doing something intelligent with your money,&#8221; Bhatt tells me. &#8220;We find a lot of people, especially younger people, don&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s not that they have some disagreement with entering the stock market, but they don&#8217;t know how to do it.&#8221; And no one&#8217;s really helping. If you look at the top of the finance app charts, you just see things like PayPal, Mint, and various banks&#8217; apps.</p>
<p>So the goal of Robinhood? To put individual human investment advisors out of business and give their jobs to the crowd who can walk each other through smart bets. And that&#8217;s an approach increasingly supported by research. Robinhood is working with teams at Stanford and MIT to prove out theories and early data suggesting crowds perform better in the stock market than even the most skilled individual. That&#8217;s convenient for people who don&#8217;t have the spare change to hire an advisor.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size:1.17em;">Invest Like The Rich</span></h3>
<p>When you first join <a target="_blank" href="http://robinhoodapp.com/">Robinhood</a> and its merry band of investors (currently only on <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/analyst-stock-ratings-from/id560378992?mt=8">iOS</a>), you&#8217;ll get suggestions of local and popular stocks to add to your watch list and see friends you can follow. Once finished on-boarding you&#8217;ll see your watch list that tracks the performance of the stocks you follow. The News tab pulls in the popular finance articles, which are remarkably up to date and accurate, as well as a personalized stream of articles about your stocks.</p>
<p>Click into any of your stocks to get more info on their performance stats over time, related news, plus a crowdsourced buy/sell rating. For instance, 69 percent of the Robinhood community rates Google a buy right now.</p>
<p>If you want to lend your thoughts, the app takes advantage of the touch interface to let you drag your finger across a chart to show how much you think the stock&#8217;s price will rise or fall over the coming weeks and months. Then you can add a short comment to support your prediction. For example, you could swipe to say Google will go up 8 percent in the next three months, and explain &#8220;The market is realizing the importance of Glass and self-driving cars, and their synergies with Google&#8217;s other businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meat of Robinhood is the Feed, where these predictions show up. You can scroll through a global feed or just recommendations from your friends, and agree, disagree, or comment on them. Rather than a broadcast platform, Robinhood doubles as a social network around stocks, where you can ask people specifically why they made a rating. Overall the app feels slick and professional, which is critical to Robinhood as its success largely depends on trust. The style comes thanks to the design team at Google Ventures, the lead investor in Robinhood. Its seed round was also joined by strategic angels including several early members of the executive team from leading electronic market maker GETCO.</p>
<h3>Give Shame To Poor Predictors</h3>
<p>But how do you know which Robinhood users to believe? That&#8217;s where my favorite feature comes in. If you asked a traditional investment advisor what their track record over time is, Bhatt tells me they&#8217;d typically dodge, stating &#8220;past performance is not indicative of future results.&#8221; In other words, they get it wrong sometimes, but don&#8217;t want you to know.</p>
<p>Well, guess what, Wall Street? The Internet&#8217;s here and it brought its buddy, transparency. Robinhood tracks everyone&#8217;s stock price predictions against real-word performance and lays them out on each user&#8217;s profile. So you can see someone has rated 107 stocks with 70.42 percent accuracy, an extremely impressive record that earns them a score in the 99th percentile of all Robinhood users, aka, this is someone you might do well to trust.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Community tab even offers leaderboards of the best performing advisors, and suggestions of people to follow. Bhatt explains that along with fostering transparency and trust, the ratings are &#8220;a way for people to show they&#8217;re smart. That&#8217;s a very compelling driver of any action.&#8221; During beta tests, a whopping 25 percent of users were contributing predictions. So much participation is very uncommon for user-generated content apps. It seems there&#8217;s pent-up demand for a collaborative approach to stock research that a traditional website like Yahoo Finance just can&#8217;t provide.</p>
<h3>Democratizing Wall Street</h3>
<p>Robinhood is solid already and it&#8217;s just getting started. In the future the company hopes to let you actually buy the stocks you&#8217;re betting on. That would take it from its current place competing with Stocktwits&#8217; unstructured micro-advice to more directly battling E*Trade and other mass-market investment mediums. In the meantime, it needs to watch out for buy ratings going viral, which can produce big wins for those who jump on the bandwagon early, but excruciating losses for those who buy late only to see the price snap back down.</p>
<p>But what really excites me about Robinhood is how it shifts investing from a game of  access to a game of talent and cooperation. The stock market has long been the domain of suits who spend all day researching and the clients who can afford to pay them. With this app, finally anyone can get their hunches validated or invalidated by the knowledge of a crowd that&#8217;s held accountable to their predictions. While the stock market will always be risky, Robinhood lets you know you&#8217;re not alone in facing those risks.</p>
<p>Tenev explains his app&#8217;s name reflects that. &#8220;We understand the connotation of taking something from the rich and giving it to the poor. Robinhood is liberating information that&#8217;s locked up with professionals and giving it to the people.&#8221;</p>

Until now, Windows 8 was mostly geared toward desktops and larger tablets, including Microsoft&#8217;s own Surface and RT machines. With the forthcoming Windows 8 Blue, rumor had it that Microsoft would enable its OEMs to run Windows 8 on smaller devices, too. Klein confirmed this on today&#8217;s call, though he mostly talked about OEMs and did not mention whether Microsoft also plans to launch a smaller Surface tablet, though that&#8217;s probably a fair bet, too. Currently, there are no sub-10-inch Windows 8 tablets on the market, but according to Klein, we will hear more about these in the coming months. During the Q&#38;A phase, Klein also noted that Microsoft is working on &#8220;expanding and improving the experience, not just for Surface, but for Windows 8 devices at multiple price points, including lower price points going forward.&#8221; Earlier this week, Intel&#8217;s outgoing CEO Paul Otellini also noted that his company wants to ensure that OEMs can build Windows 8 machines for under $200 soon. In addition, Klein also acknowledged that the transition to Windows 8 isn&#8217;t easy, but the company remains &#8220;excited about the opportunities ahead of [it].&#8221; According to Klein, Windows 8 has prepared Microsoft well for the transition from desktops to touch devices. &#8220;We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we feel comfortable about where we are going.&#8221; He also expects to see more &#8211; and more attractive &#8211; Windows 8 touch-enabled devices to come on the market in the near future, too, and he thinks these will become more attractive.]]></description>

In response to a question about how much people can expect to see engagement increment with new products like Glass, he said that &#8220;obviously, Glass runs on Android, so [Android] has been pretty transportable across devices, and I think that will continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many have speculated that Google Glass would run on an Android-based OS, but to date, Google hasn&#8217;t come right out and said so. Recent reports suggested that it would be ore of a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quora.com/Google-Glass-4/Will-Google-Glass-be-running-Android-ChromeOS-or-something-else-entirely">proprietary system separate from Android</a>, but Page&#8217;s statement today seems to indicate that in fact it will at least be a version of Android.</p>
<p>And Android-based Glass, even if it&#8217;s a modified version of the original OS, is good news for developers, since it means they share at least a common language. That should make integration, at least between Glass and Android-powered smartphone apps easier. The comment about portability also strongly suggests that Android has the potential to power a range of devices in the future, including the <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2013/03/google-smart-watch/?">smart watch it reportedly has in development</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve contacted Google to find out more about the Glass OS and how closely related it is to Android for smartphones, and will update if we hear more.</p>

<p>CEO Larry Page responded that he &#8220;always&#8221; gets asked about how the popularity of mobile apps affects Google search, but he&#8217;s &#8220;not super-concerned&#8221; about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been dealing with that issue for a long time,&#8221; Page said. &#8220;Fundamentally search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and other apps. I think, in general, the information wants to be found.&#8221;</p>
<p>There will be challenges as more usage shifts to mobile, Page said, but Google will get through them. </p>
<p>As for the effect of mobile on the company&#8217;s bottom line, Chief Business Officer Nikesh Arora argued that focusing on details like Google&#8217;s current mobile CPC rates is &#8220;the wrong way&#8221; to look at these questions. (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/google-earnings-mobile-ads/">He has talked in a general way about those CPC rates before</a>.) &#8220;The right way&#8221; is to understand &#8220;the new reality where we have all these multiscreens.&#8221; In that new reality, Arora said Google has to deliver the right answer to users throughout the day, on any device. And if the company succeeds at that, &#8220;The pie will grow for everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to ABI Research’s Consumer Electronics Research Service, the consumer robotics market is currently at about $1.6 billion and growing. A slow economy and fairly expensive parts has stagnated things for the time being but improved devices and more interesting implementations &#8211; home helper robots, for example &#8211; could push the market up considerably.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/31/techcrunch-makers-bossa-nova-robotics-mobi/">visit with Bossa Nova Robotics</a>, devices like the Mobi ball bot can move through crowded spaces and help out in unique situations. While it&#8217;s still no Rosie the Robot, I could imagine a cleaning bot that could also help move heavy objects as a team effort and robots that can inspect chimneys and drains. Interestingly, the problem of safety begins to crop up when talking about consumer robotics.</p>
<div style="margin-left:30px;margin-right:30px;padding-left:15px;border-left:3px solid #ccc;font-style:italic;">“What happens if a robot falls down the stairs while someone is walking up, or gets caught on a lamp power cord and pulls the lamp down and starts a fire?” added Solis. “This is a gating factor to take-up of more complex personal robots – solvable but with additional cost.”</div>
<p>Obviously the question remains: did the robots start the fire on purpose?</p>
