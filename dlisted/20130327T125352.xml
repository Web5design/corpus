 <title>Phoebe Price Poses In Front Of A Car Crash </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/phoebe-price-poses-front-car-crash</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The job of an international supermodel and cultural icon of the ho stroll never stops, even when an 80-something woman&#039;s Mercedes flips on its side after hitting a parked Range Rover in West Hollywood. I know, I&#039;m trying to, but I can&#039;t either...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As firefighters pulled out the woman from her car, &lt;b&gt;Chicken Cutlets &lt;/b&gt;put her hand on hip and gave FACE!, BODY!, FACE!, BODY! and FACE!, because &lt;b&gt;RuPaul&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuBWHNsClP0&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Supermodel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot; always plays in her head and her body is a slave to the camera clicks. PP&#039;s pose game never takes a minute off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paparazzi say that while PP was coming out of Chin Chin after having lunch, she witnessed the car crash. (insert your car crash witnessing a car crash jokes here) PP temporarily put her supermodel pose show on pause to talk to the police about what she saw and to hypnotize a tall piece of sweaty hotness with her freckled beauty. Firefighters pulled the woman out of her car, put her on a stretcher and took her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after they left, PP winked and kept on posing, because she&#039;ll keep on posing till the world ends. This is what t&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2012/10/31/behold-brazilian-phoebe-price&quot;&gt;hat Nana GouvÃªa mess &lt;/a&gt;longs to be.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Cousin Dionne Is $10.7 Million In Debt </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/cousin-dionne-107-million-debt</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You might be seeing that leopard fannypack and that green sloth coat at a yard sale in front of &lt;b&gt;Dionne Warwick&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; house sometime soon, because the IRS has got her number, hussy, and that number is $10.7 million. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-dionne-warwick-bankrupt-taxes-new-jersey-20130326,0,4463875.story&quot;&gt;L.A. Times &lt;/a&gt;says that Cousin Dionne wishes she had Lindsay Lohan&#039;s tax problems and the only way to pull her 72-year-old ass out from under the mountain of late payment notices from the IRS is to file for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dionne&#039;s rep says that she owes the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board millions of dollars for taxes, late fees and interest, and she tried to work out some kind of payment plan with them, but they gave her a thumbs down and so she filed for bankruptcy in her home state of New Jersey. Dionne makes $20,950 a month and her expenses are $20,940 (including $4,000 to her assistant and $5,000 for housekeeping), so she&#039;s only got $10 leftover to pay the IRS. Dionne claims she only makes $1000 a month in in music royalties. Dionne&#039;s rep blamed her accountants for&lt;i&gt;  &quot;negligent and gross financial mismanagement.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why didn&#039;t one of Dionne&#039;s Psychic Friends tell her that her accountants were being gross and mismanaging her cash? That way she could&#039;ve went on over there, pulled off her house slipper and handled them? Second of all, why does she need to spend $5,000 a month on housekeeping? Dionne can buy a broom at the Dollar Tree and sweep her own damn carpet. (Side note: Even though we had a vacuum, my abuelita insisted on sweeping the carpet and she&#039;d never use a dustpan. She&#039;d sweep all the dirt out the front door. It was probably a Catholic thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Cousin Dionne. Now I can&#039;t talk shit about her for taking part in this fucked up foolery with&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/node/41202&quot;&gt; that low-rent Rebecca Black wannabe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A check is a check even if the check is signed by an auto-tuned fetus. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>QOTD: Jose Canseco&#039;s Thoughts On Gay Marriage </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/qotd-jose-cansecos-thoughts-gay-marriage</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/latest-updates-on-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-hearing/&quot;&gt;The Supreme Court Justices&lt;/a&gt; can all take tomorrow off and spend the day watching &lt;i&gt;Judge Judy&lt;/i&gt; reruns (you know they get tips from her), because&lt;b&gt; Jose Canseco&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; got this. I mean, he said UNGAY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if they need a second opinion. They can always ask&lt;b&gt; Sophia Petrillo&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt; (Note: I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve splattered this all over the site a million times before, but Sophia&#039;s opinion is always relevant and never gets old.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Justin Bieber Might Have Whooped His Neighbor&#039;s Ass This Morning </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/justin-bieber-might-have-whooped-his-neighbors-ass-morning</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Seen above walking through an airport in Lodz, Poland without a blouse on because toddlers get the coke sweats real bad, &lt;b&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/b&gt; is being investigated by the police in L.A. after he got into a messy screaming match with his neighbor outside of his mansion in Calabasas, CA at 9 this morning. The neighbor told the police that the thug chickenhawk got violent with him and threatened him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/26/justin-bieber-battery-accusation-calabasas-neighbor-police-threats/&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; says that The Lesbeater and his neighbor fought over one of his newest toys: a Ferrari. The Ferrari was delivered to Justin&#039;s house last night while he was traveling home from Europe and this morning he played with it by driving it up and down the street. The sound got on his neighbor&#039;s last nerve and he felt like Justin was endangering innocent lives by speeding down the street. The neighbor &amp;nbsp;went over to Justin&#039;s house, got in his face and they started yelling at each other. The neighbor told police that Justin physically attacked him, but the Biebs denies it. A source says that Justin went inside and his security guards escorted the neighbor off of his property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, some brat with too much money is annoying everybody around him by being all loud while playing with his fancy toys? I&#039;ve seen this movie before. It&#039;s called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_Check_(film)&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blank Check&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We need &lt;b&gt;Tone Loc &lt;/b&gt;to step in and stop the madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I got into a screaming fight of words with Justin Bieber&#039;s tiny ass and he slapped me around and I didn&#039;t slap back, the last thing I&#039;d do is tell the police. I wouldn&#039;t tell anyone. That&#039;s like admitting that a 3&#039;10&quot;, 50lb girl named Amber grabbed you by the hair and dragged you back and forth across the playground in the third grade. (By the way, I&#039;m not admitting that. Amber only dragged me by the hair across the playground once! Not back and forth!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus resurrected himself just so the stunning German oyster jewel that is &lt;b&gt;Micaela Schaefer&lt;/b&gt; could pose &amp;nbsp;almost-naked in public with a traumatized bunny rabbit.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;St. Angie Jo&lt;/b&gt; temporarily replaced her huge tacky diamond engagement ring that said &lt;i&gt;&quot;I&#039;M RICH, BITCH!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; with a demure gold band that says &quot;&lt;i&gt;I am a serious Goodwill Ambassador&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/Angelina-Jolie-visits-Congo-and-Rwanda-with-William-Hague-to-stop-rape-sexual-violence/26363&quot;&gt;Lainey Gossip&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Open Post: Hosted By Harvey Price And My Little Katie </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/open-post-hosted-harvey-price-and-my-little-katie</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Whatever ailments you have, lay them on the screen and you will be magically healed! Just ignore the fact that he&#039;s wearing a RiRi t-shirt (yes, I&#039;m side-eying RiRi&#039;s side-eye) and be thankful that we&#039;re finally getting a&lt;b&gt; Harvey Price&lt;/b&gt; sighting. This is more rare and magical than seeing a triple rainbow, a tub of Tagalongs ice cream in my grocer&#039;s freezer (I can&#039;t find that shit anywhere) or Beyonce without her wig on. Praise Katie Price&#039;s fame whoring ways!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking like a beaten down My Little Porny, Katie Price posed in another one of her signature photocalls of foolery to promote her line of horse products. Katie Price can do herself up like a Sweet Valley raver ballerina cuntaur on acid and Harvey Price still gets all the attention just by being Harvey Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these pictures would&#039;ve been so much better (and they would&#039;ve ended up in every museum) if Harvey Price rode side saddle.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Brit Brit&#039;s Tattered Weave And Rhinestone Belly Ring IS The Look </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/26/brit-brits-bikini-and-rhinestone-belly-ring-look</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;All the rhinestone belly rings that are collecting dust on the back wall of Claire&#039;s are about to be snatched up, because everyone will bedazzle their stomach knobs like it&#039;s 2001 after seeing style icon &lt;b&gt;Brit Brit &lt;/b&gt;wearing one. If your belly button doesn&#039;t look like it&#039;s barfing up rhinestones, then you&#039;re doing &quot;&lt;i&gt;beach time glamour&lt;/i&gt;&quot; wrong. With a weave that came from the sea sitting on top of her head and a cigarette in her hand, Brit Brit lounged on the balcony of a house in Malibu over the weekend. Who knew that USA Gold cigarettes, Diet RC Cola, Frapps and fried chicken grease did a body good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you replaced that cig with an exotic berry Bartles &amp;amp; Jaymes wine cooler, covered her in Hawaiian Tropic dark tanning oil and put her on an ALF towel, you&#039;d have everybody&#039;s mom circa 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since we&#039;re on the subject of refined southern belles, here&#039;s America&#039;s other favorite beauty queen of the south &lt;b&gt;Mama June&lt;/b&gt; drinking America&#039;s holy water in Georgia over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Duggars Will Adopt If God Wants Them To </title>

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michelle Duggar&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; overworked sweat shop uterus has been hyperventilating into a paper bag ever since she said that she&#039;s trying to have another baby, but now she&#039;s giving it some much-needed relief. The Duggars are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/11/world-getting-another-duggar&quot;&gt;expecting one new member this year&lt;/a&gt; and Michelle Duggar&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/13/michelle-duggar-wants-have-another-baby&quot;&gt; did say &lt;/a&gt;that her uterus is always open to carrying another fetus (&quot;&lt;i&gt;Speak for yourself, heffa&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Michelle Duggar&#039;s uterus), but she recently told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20685375,00.html&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; that they&#039;re also considering adoption. The Duggars will do whatever it takes to have a family that&#039;s bigger than the population of Guam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelle says that her brain opened up to the idea of adoption when her family visited an orphanage in Beijing. They are getting on their knees, closing their eyes and asking God about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;We are open to the idea of adoption. We are praying about it, and we will see what God has in store. Love for children has been placed on our hearts. The kids are definitely pushing towards wanting us to open our home up to another child or more. They see how much we have been blessed with and how little so many children have and they want to share. We tell our children that would have to be something that is God&#039;s will for our family, and we will see if it is. Our children love children, and we all do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are open to whatever is in store. It doesn&#039;t really matter whether I would have another child or we would adopt, but we want to approach it with an open heart. We have friends that have adopted children who are a great influence in our lives, and we have talked about their experiences. So it&#039;s something we&#039;ve considered. We have to know for sure that is what God wants for us to do. When he gives us a child [through pregnancy], there is no doubt in our minds that is what He wants, but when it comes to adoption, we would have to know for sure that was His will.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a God, God will drop two tubs of spermicide, fifty boxes of diaphragms, 900 birth control pills and a thousand condoms on the Duggars when they ask God what they should do. Or better yet, God should just drop all the OctoKids on them. Actually, I don&#039;t mean that. I&#039;d rather be raised by OctoCrazy than be raised by one of the Duggar daughters. I mean, at least Octo has good drugs and massive amounts of weed.&lt;/p&gt;
