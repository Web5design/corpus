 <title>Richard Griffiths Has Died </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/richard-griffiths-has-died</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harry Potter&#039;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Uncle Vernon floated up to the great big &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_in_the_Sky_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pie in the Sky&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;yesterday at the age of 65. &lt;b&gt;Richard Griffiths &lt;/b&gt;died at the University Hospital Coventry from complications after heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before playing Uncle Vernon in all the Harry Potter movies, Richard played the carrot-loving Uncle Monty in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Withnail and I &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and Dr. Meinheimer in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Naked Gun &amp;nbsp;2 1/2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (his greatest achievement, I know). Richard was also in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The History Boys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, one of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; movies, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hugo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sleepy Hollow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; Daniel Radcliffe&lt;/b&gt;, who was the Harry to his Uncle Vernon and who also worked with him in the stage revival of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, had a few words to say to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21973505#TWEET694121&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; about Richard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Richard was by my side during two of the most important moments of my career. I was proud to know him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Richard Griffiths was an award-winning, respected and seriously accomplished actor, but since I&#039;m trash, my first thought after hearing this news was, &quot;&lt;i&gt;He got to see&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/node/28327&quot;&gt; Harry Potter&#039;s peen&lt;/a&gt; up close and on stage&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, Richard Griffiths.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hot Slut Of The Day! </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/hot-slut-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just in time for Easter....&lt;b&gt;Bacon-Flavored Condoms&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easter, Christmas and all the other holidays have come early for you pork-loving whores, because you no longer have to get your dick and bacon fix by dipping your peen of choice into the glass jar of bacon grease you keep under the kitchen cabinet before you lick it. J &amp;amp; D Foods, the makers of the April Fool&#039;s joke-turned actual thing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://baconlube.com/&quot;&gt;Bacon Lube&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;have once again brought pork into porking by selling bacon-flavored condoms. This Sunday, skip the Honey Baked Ham and suck on some bacon-flavored wang instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Esch, one of the co-founders of J &amp;amp; D, tell &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/28/bacon-condoms-photos_n_2974081.html&quot;&gt;HuffPo&lt;/a&gt; that their condoms aren&#039;t made out of actual bacon (BOO!). They&#039;re made of latex and covered with bacon lube. They sell for $10 for 3 and orders will go out this June. Justin said he got the idea after he had sex with Rob Kardashian and wished that he could package and sell that salty and sour taste of fried pork, coagulated ball sweat and rancid goat cheese. No, Justin said that he got the idea after bacon lube became a huge hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve already got bacon lube and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/28/hot-slut-day&quot;&gt;omelet dildos&lt;/a&gt;, and now we&#039;ve got bacon condoms! Throw in some hollandaise sauce-flavored coochie cream and an English Muffin diaphragm and we&#039;ve got brunch! If you don&#039;t want to use this mess as a condom, just wad it up, stick it in your mouth and chew on it like a piece of bacon-flavored gum that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is probably the closest any of us will get to licking on Jon Hamm&#039;s Hammlog.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Callum Blue&#039;s Peen Leaks (Maybe) </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/28/callum-blues-peen-leaks-maybe</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;b&gt;Callum Blue &lt;/b&gt;best as Belle&#039;s hot doctor boyfriend (the one that dumps her ass after he finds out that she sells coochie) on&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; Secret Diary of a Call Girl,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; but he&#039;s also be in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Princess Diaries 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Tudors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dead Like Me &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smallville&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. And today, I best know him as the Brit whose maybe peen keeps dropping into my inbox. Callum has allegedly been hunting for dick on Adam4Adam and Grindr, and somebody posted his profile (complete with a picture from the red carpet, ha), half-naked and naked pics online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callum&#039;s mole and tattoo picture match up in the pictures with his chonies on, but who knows if it&#039;s him in the other pictures. If you have a free hand, pick up your magnifying glass and judge for yourself after (CAUTION: Peen Veins Ahead, NSFW) &lt;a href=&quot;http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/76511629.html&quot;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was Callum, I&#039;d deny, deny, deny, deny away, but only because I wouldn&#039;t want people to know I take selfies in the bathroom with my iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Well, Now We Know Who Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard&#039;s Favorite President Is</title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/28/well-now-we-know-who-kristen-bell-and-dax-shepards-favorite-president</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that headline should be: Well, Now We Know What Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard&#039;s Favorite Division Of Ford Motors Is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine months ago, &lt;b&gt;Kristen Bell &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Dax Shepard &lt;/b&gt;made a baby together while watching sloth porn (I&#039;m guessing) and now that baby is here. Both Kristen and Dax tweeted the news today and slipped out the name they wrote on their first daughter&#039;s birth certificate. Unfortunately, they didn&#039;t write the name Slotherina &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/13/veronica-mars-kickstarter-project-makes-2-million-less-10-hours&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/files/images/daxkristenbaby.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Bell Shepard. My brain has been sitting on that name for a good 40 minutes and I still don&#039;t know what to think about it. When I say the name &lt;i&gt;&quot;Lincoln Bell Shepard&quot;&lt;/i&gt; out loud, it feels like I&#039;m taking attendance. Those are three last names! They should&#039;ve named her Liberty Bell or Ringa Mai Bell. Missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dax and Kristen are kind of crazy, so I&#039;m guessing that they decided a long time ago to name their kid after the character the Oscar winner for Best Actor played. Lincoln should feel lucky, because if Hugh Jackman won, her name would&#039;ve been Jean Valjean Bell Shepard. &lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kiki Dunst&lt;/b&gt; is wearing a gummy worm leather fringe vest (because why not?) on BULLETT Magazine and I don&#039;t know if she&#039;s fingering a ghost or throwing gang signs, but I definitely feel threatened either way - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebitchy.com/288756/kirsten_dunst_stars_in_the_worst_shoot_ever_says_kissing_brad_pitt_was_disgusting/&quot;&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom has at least 5 boxes of mom clothes from the early 90s and I&#039;m sure she&#039;d love to sell them to &lt;b&gt;Vanessa Hudgens &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Little Sister Hudgens&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodtuna.com/?p=91560&quot;&gt;Hollywood Tuna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Open Post: Hosted By California&#039;s Greatest Criminal Mastermind </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/28/open-post-hosted-californias-greatest-criminal-mastermind</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;445&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Kvhxo0iBJck?feature=player_embedded&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If&lt;b&gt; Fatty Arbuckle&lt;/b&gt; was resurrected to star in a reboot of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ocean&#039;s 11&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, this is what it would look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The police in Redding, CA are asking the public to be on the lookout for a thieving buffoon with a gunt like no other. (Side note: Nothing will make you feel secure in the police like them asking you to help them catch a complete idiot.) The FUPA Bandit&#039;s streak of terror began earlier this month when he tried to rob Kent Market. After casing the joint (he probably saw that on a TruTV movie), he put on a masterful disguise (a pantyhose mask) and threw a rock at the glass door. The alarm went off and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=h9Lxm6Vo5w8&quot;&gt;Benny Hill &lt;/a&gt;music started playing. He ran off, tripped, got up, pulled up his pajama pants and kept on a running. When he pulled up his pajama pants, I fell in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the police really wanted to catch him, they&#039;d just set up a sting operation (a sub sandwich on a park bench). No, he&#039;d never fall for it. He&#039;s a professional criminal. Dude is such a master of disguise that I bet that&#039;s not even a home grown front butt. It&#039;s probably a pillow baby. Oh, shit. &lt;b&gt;Beyonce&lt;/b&gt; should check her closet right about now.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Even Famous Millionaires Leave Their Christmas Lights Up All Year Long</title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/28/even-famous-millionaires-leave-their-christmas-lights-all-year</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;445&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/QQIQ-BSFmW4?feature=player_embedded&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s usually one house in every neighborhood that celebrates Christmas times all year round and is never without lights on it. My house was that house for a while. One year, my uncle, who didn&#039;t live with us, suddenly decided that our house really needed some Christmas lights. He put them up and they never came down. You know my abuelita wasn&#039;t going to pull out a damn ladder and my mom worked all the time, so they stayed up for years. They became a part of the house. The house started to eat them. We never turned them on and they stopped working. I should&#039;ve told people that they weren&#039;t Christmas lights, they were siding studs. Very on trend. I don&#039;t think our neighbors ever gave a shit. Although, one smart ass whore neighbor wished me a Merry Christmas while I was on the driveway choreographing a dance number to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKE4tp6QW1Y&quot;&gt;a Jody Watley song&lt;/a&gt; for my own pleasure. It was July. Anyway, our neighbors didn&#039;t seem to care, but &lt;b&gt;Maria Shriver&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;rich ass neighbors do....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/28/maria-shriver-neighbors-christmas-lights/&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; has an EXCLUSIVO video they shot on Tuesday night of Christmas lights twinkling bright in front of Maria Shriver&#039;s Brentwood house. Maria turns on the lights nightly and she&#039;s had them up since December. Maria&#039;s neighbors aren&#039;t dazzled by them and want her to take them down. But instead of knocking on Maria&#039;s door and telling it to her face, they called TMZ. TMZ is the new passive aggressive note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maria&#039;s neighbors don&#039;t want to hurt her feelings, so they hope their note through TMZ gets to her and she takes them down. Those neighbors need to pull the platinum stick from out their asses and get over it. Those don&#039;t even look like Christmas lights to me. That looks like some Disney park shit to me. Don&#039;t some rich people always decorate their front yard trees with light-up diamond necklaces? I&#039;m sure Maria will take down her Christmas lights....but only so she can rearrange them into a message for all her neighbors. I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll see the lit-up words &quot;&lt;i&gt;F ALL U TWATS&quot;&lt;/i&gt; on Maria&#039;s front yard shrubs real soon. Don&#039;t mess with the Skeletor of the Kennedy family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of things that twinkle, here&#039;s Maria&#039;s hairless twink son &lt;b&gt;Patrick Schwarzenegger&lt;/b&gt; in Hawaii the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/28/more-words-wisdom-prolific-self-help-guru-amanda-bynes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In between threatening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmandaBynes/status/317294850468884480&quot;&gt;throw a lawsuit at Perez Hilton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/21/presented-without-comment&quot;&gt;wishing that her vagina and Drake&lt;/a&gt; will guest star on an all new episode of &lt;i&gt;Law &amp;amp; Order: SVU&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Amanda Bynes &lt;/b&gt;dropped this non-RuPaul approved affirmation into the eyes of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AmandaBynes/status/317197892341338112&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; followers this morning. So I guess what she&#039;s saying is that the only reason she dressed like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2300553/Amanda-Bynes-hides-face-emerges-fast-food-restaurant-aimless-amble-New-Yorks-Times-Square.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is because her lovah is really into her looking like a late 80s trailer park hooker who works part-time as a waitress at a German beer hall.&lt;/p&gt;
