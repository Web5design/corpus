 <title>Hot Slut Of The Day! </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/16/hot-slut-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Judy&#039;s Girl&lt;/b&gt;, the mascot of Judy&#039;s clothing boutique! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are making a &quot;&lt;i&gt;Harpo, who dis woman?&lt;/i&gt;&quot; face, Judy&#039;s was a clothing store chain for teen girls and grown girls who wanted to dress like teen girls, and there were stores all over California and as far as I know, there were also some stores scattered through the west. If Contempo Casuals was the Forever 21 of the 80s, then Judy&#039;s was an exclusive invitation-only couture boutique. It was some special shit. (Don&#039;t listen to that bitch&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hark.com/clueless/like-i-would-really-wear-something-from-judys&quot;&gt;Ambular from Clueless&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy&#039;s first opened in 1946 and all of its stores closed in the late 90s after the company that bought it went bankrupt. Besides a tiny blurb on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_retailers_of_the_United_States&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Judys/149007018463475&quot;&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, there&#039;s hardly any mention of Judy&#039;s on the internet (this should be a illegal!) and I could only find a few pictures of the Judy&#039;s Girl. The Judy&#039;s Girl was the store&#039;s mascot and there were huge ass pictures of her in front of every store. As a kid, she kind of scared me, because look at her, she looks crazy. She&#039;s got like 10 hairs on her head, she&#039;s got no fingers and she&#039;s dressed like a mime in a prison. But she raised the roof before raising the roof was a thing and she&#039;ll forever be a Southern California icon of the 80s and 90s!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Thing That Exists: The Condom Challenge </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/15/thing-exists-condom-challenge</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;445&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/4Aco2DSCzro?feature=player_embedded&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in the third grade, there was this girl in my class who grossed us out and entertained us at the same time by snorting a string of floss up her nostril before pulling it out of her mouth. We laughed, we cried and we heaved. I blame her for all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because teens of the internet have run out of weird shit to do, they&#039;re now challenging each other to the Condom Challenge. Unfortunately, the Condom Challenge isn&#039;t a game where teens put on condoms and keep them on as long as they can, forever and ever. I wish. This fucked up shit involves sticking a condom up your nostril and snorting it up until it comes out of your mouth. This is what happens when a school&#039;s sex education class loses its funding and the dudes from &lt;i&gt;Jackass&lt;/i&gt; are brought in to teach the kids how to use a condom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s dozens of Condom Challenge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?filters=week&amp;amp;search_query=condom+challenge&amp;amp;lclk=week&quot;&gt;videos like the messy one above on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really what it&#039;s come to? Snorting condoms for sport? Snorting a condom is only okay if you&#039;re about to get into nostril sex, but that&#039;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Justin Bieber Takes His Top Off For The Fans </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/15/justin-bieber-takes-his-top-fans</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;If a Tumblr called Fetuses with iPhones existed, these pictures would be its crown jewels. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/04/14/justin-bieber-hopes-anne-frank-wouldve-been-belieber&quot;&gt;Anne Frank&#039;s homeboy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Justin Bieber&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;slapped at the haters who are constantly yelling at him to put on a shirt (see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/04/olivia-wilde-justin-bieber_n_2805431.html&quot;&gt;Olivia Wilde&lt;/a&gt;) by posting a couple of shirtless selfies on Instagram with a couple of eye roll-inducing captions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Breaking news @justinbieber posts two shirtless pics in a day could he be anymore full of himself -silly people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking news worldwide @justinbieber just posted 2 shirtless pictures he must be going crazyâ€™ -funny people #forthefansanyways #dontbecreepin :p&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many things Justin Bieber should be doing besides taking pictures of his fetus abs and his chewed-up bubble gum belly button. The Biebs needs to pull up his pants (I mean, he IS a big kid now) and he needs to work on his smolder. He wants to look all mysterious and sexy in a butch way, but instead he looks sad and disappointed. Like he just failed potty training again after making a poopy in his Pampers. Work on your smolder, Biebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he really wanted to do something for the Beliebers, he&#039;d get Anne Frank&#039;s bio tattooed on his chest, take a picture of that and upload it to Instagram, because some of those children&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/the-internet-responds-to-justin-bieber-and-anne-frank&quot;&gt; don&#039;t even know who she is&lt;/a&gt;. I mean....&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Sharon And Ozzy Osbourne Broke Up </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/15/sharon-and-ozzy-osbourne-broke</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The next time &lt;b&gt;Ozzy Osbourne &lt;/b&gt;wakes up in the middle of the night and screams out, &quot;&lt;i&gt;SHARE-EEEEEEEEEEEEEN,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; the only sound he&#039;ll hear back is the sound of one of their ten million dogs shitting on the carpet (they&#039;re dogs are ALWAYS shitting on the carpet). Because &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/15/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-split/4/#comments-anchor&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; says that Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne&#039;s marriage is now lying in a ditch next to the dove head that he bit off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4886856/sharon-and-ozzy-osbourne-living-apart.html&quot;&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt; said that Ozzy and Sharon pressed paused on their marriage and are sleeping in different places. &lt;b&gt;Jack Osbourne&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MrJackO/status/323509090150125568&quot;&gt;shat on that rumor on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. But now TMZ is saying that The Sun was telling the truth, because&amp;nbsp;Sharon is apparently living full-time at The Beverly Hills Hotel and Ozzy is staying in a rented house a few miles away. Even though their marriage of 31 years is circling the drain, they don&#039;t have any plans to divorce yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m every layer of bitter and jaded and even I didn&#039;t think Ozzy and Sharon would ever break up. How is he going to function without her? Didn&#039;t Sharon do everything for Ozzy including bathe him, dress himp, feed him, brush his teeth, wipe his ass and shake his peen for him after he pees? Ozzy&#039;s going to be a mess! Without Sharon, he&#039;s probably going to waddle aimlessly through the streets with his panties down to his ankles, because he forgot how to wipe his own ass and needs some help. I&#039;d say that he could ask Siri, but I just asked Siri how to wipe my own ass and that bitch wasn&#039;t any help. And no, that wasn&#039;t the first time I asked Siri that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s Sharon at The Ivy with a dog friend and Kelly Osbourne last week.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carey Mulligan&lt;/b&gt; looks more like &lt;b&gt;Jack Lemmon&lt;/b&gt; in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Like It Hot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; than Daisy Buchanan to me and that is a compliment! -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://icydk.com/2013/04/15/the-gorgeous-carey-mulligan-poses-as-daisy-buchanan-on-the-may-cover-of-vogue/&quot;&gt;ICYDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many high hos do you think asked &lt;b&gt;Katy Perry &lt;/b&gt;if they could make out with the red lips on her crotch? - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/Katy-Perry-and-ex-Robert-Ackroyd-at-Coachella-2013/26535&quot;&gt;Lainey Gossip &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clint Eastwood &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Francesca Eastwood &lt;/b&gt;should&#039;ve switched Coachella outfits, because he would&#039;ve looked hotter in those coochie cutters -&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesuperficial.com/clint-eastwood-daughter-bikini-francesca-coachella-04-2013&quot;&gt; The Superficial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s a huge typo on&lt;b&gt; LeAnn Rimes&#039;&lt;/b&gt; t-shirt. It should read: POW! BAM! WHORINESS! - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebitchy.com/291853/leann_rimes_eddie_got_jake_cibrian_the_gift_of_paparazzi_for_his_birthday/&quot;&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tommy Girl&lt;/b&gt; is used to having slimy liquid drip down his face, so this is nothing for him - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.towleroad.com/2013/04/cruiseeggs.html&quot;&gt;Towleroad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice of the photo agency to Photoshop out the toxic warning signs on the beach - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodtuna.com/?p=92494&quot;&gt;Hollywood Tuna&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chrissy Teigen&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; evil lion eyebrow scares me - &lt;a href=&quot;http://drunkenstepfather.com/2013/04/12/chrissy-teigen-for-beach-bunny-of-the-day#.UWxkwr95iXI&quot;&gt;Drunken Stepfather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheerleaders of the 1980s really knew how to bring the sequined glamour in heavy doses - &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/lets-shop-for-cheerleading-and-band-uniforms-in-the-19-472957666&quot;&gt;Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straight vs. Curly (and I wish this was a post about different types of pubes) -&lt;a href=&quot;http://theberry.com/2013/04/15/celebs-straight-vs-curly-38-photos/&quot;&gt; The Berry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a second there, I thought that droopy poop bag was the &lt;b&gt;Hammaconda&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; condom -&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justjared.com/2013/04/15/jon-hamm-alan-arkin-joins-million-dollar-arm/&quot;&gt; Just Jared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FYI: &lt;b&gt;Lauryn Hill&lt;/b&gt; still isn&#039;t making sense - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/15/lauryn-hill-tax-evasion-reportedly-says-threats-were-the-cause-of-tax-evasion-charges_n_3085863.html?utm_hp_ref=celebrity&amp;amp;ir=Celebrity&quot;&gt;HuffPo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;b&gt;Alexis Bellino &lt;/b&gt;really meant is that she returned to &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Real Housewives of Orange County &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;because she&#039;s broke and needed a check - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realitytea.com/2013/04/15/alexis-bellino-returned-to-real-housewives-of-orange-county-so-the-bullies-wouldnt-win/&quot;&gt;Reality Tea &amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Look Or Not The Look: Brad Pitt&#039;s Greasy Mop At The MTV Movie Awards</title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/15/look-or-not-look-brad-pitts-greasy-mop-mtv-movie-awards</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;MTV got &lt;b&gt;Brad Pitt &lt;/b&gt;to the MTV Movie Awards last night by leaving a trail of weed buds from his front door to the Sony Pictures Studio in Los Angeles and they got him to present the last award by giving him a giant bowl of Taco Bell meat and Funyuns stew. Brad Pitt showed up to the MTV Movie Awards looking so damn stoned that I bet if you sucked his mouth while plugging his ear holes with your fingers, you&#039;d breathe in a huge cloud of weed smoke. Dude is a human bong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad pulled his greasy locks into a ponytail and I know I&#039;m supposed to hate it, but I don&#039;t. I can&#039;t hate it, because bitch has lunch lady hair. Lunch lady hair is the look. If you threw a hairnet over his head, he&#039;d look like he should be throwing down a greasy slice of square pizza on your pastel green lunch tray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Pitt also has the same hairstyle as this cholo grandpa who would ride around my cousin&#039;s neighborhood on a little boy&#039;s bicycle and he&#039;d sing oldies at the top of his lungs.&amp;nbsp;Brad Pitt&#039;s cholo grandpa look would be complete if he wore a clear shower cap, a gold cross necklace and had some kind of neck tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I&#039;m saying is that Brad Pitt&#039;s lunch lady/cholo grandpa hair IS the look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&#039;s also some pictures of &lt;b&gt;St. Angie&lt;/b&gt; and an emo-ized &lt;b&gt;Maddox&lt;/b&gt; at LAX.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Bunch Of Dirty Lady Pubes Can&#039;t Keep Hugh Jackman Down </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/15/hugh-jackman-dirty-lady-pubes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Just one day after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/04/14/stalker-throws-pubic-hair-at-hugh-jackman&quot;&gt;a crazy bitch threw a pubes-covered electric razor at him&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Hugh Jackman&lt;/b&gt; was back at the scene of the crime, Gotham Gym in NYC, yesterday. If Hugh stops putting muscles on top of his muscles while surrounded by a bunch of hot, sweaty dudes in wet tank tops, the pube-throwing stalkers have won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, for one, am glad that Hugh JackMeOff isn&#039;t going to let some crazy lady and her flying nether region fur keep him from the gym, because if he did stay away, we&#039;d never get these pictures of him looking like an angry bullfrog trying to keep his ass from exploding while getting DPed. And now I know how that crazy bitch feels, because looking at Hugh&#039;s veiny dick arms is making me want to throw pubes at the screen while declaring my love for him.&lt;/p&gt;
