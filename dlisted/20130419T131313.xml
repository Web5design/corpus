 <title>Janet Jackson Is Quitting Show Business To Be A Billionaire Housewife In The Middle East</title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/janet-jackson-quitting-show-business-be-billionaire-housewife-middle-east</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Janet Jackson&lt;/b&gt; figures that why spend hours upon hours in the studio making some album and why crack her rib (wait, does she still have those?) touring for months on end when she can just move to the Middle East, put on some couture gown, lay on a unicorn fur chaise and let her servants feed her canary diamonds. Janet Jackson&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/02/25/janet-jackson-got-secretly-married-again&quot;&gt; got married on the down low&lt;/a&gt; last year to Qatari billionaire &lt;b&gt;Wissam Al Mana &lt;/b&gt;and has moved to the Middle East to slather herself in pure luxury 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://celebrities.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=1105273&amp;amp;showcomments=true&quot;&gt;Showbiz 411&lt;/a&gt; that Janet is living in the Middle East now and has converted to Islam. The source said, &lt;i&gt;&quot;She&#039;s gone. She married a billionaire. They&#039;ve got houses in three countries. She&#039;s spending time in the Middle East. She&#039;s become a Muslim.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;She&#039;s gone. She married a billionaire.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Don&#039;t you just close your eyelids at night and wish that somebody would say that about your ass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t see the problem here. Janet&#039;s married to a billionaire with a big peen (his nose tells me so) and she&#039;s got a million servants who can answer the phone and say, &lt;i&gt;&quot;She&#039;s gone. She married a billionaire,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; when her family members call looking for a loan.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Who Will Play The Kelly LeBrock Role In The Weird Science Remake? </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/who-play-kelly-lebrock-role-weird-science-remake</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;And now the time has come for Hollywood to take whatever is left of our childhoods and finally push it into the meat grinder, because they&#039;re remaking &lt;b&gt;John Hughes&#039; &lt;/b&gt;movies now. &lt;b&gt;Weird Science &lt;/b&gt;was one of the first movies that my rich friend made me a copy of on his rich people dual VHS recorder and I wore that bitch out, and now Hollywood is butchering it up by remaking it. I can&#039;t even do the slow wall slide of sadness over this, because it&#039;s not surprising. Every time I hear that Hollywood is remaking a classic from my childhood, I just make the same face I make when a one night trick runs out the door as soon as I take my clothes off. I shrug and say, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Eh, lost another one&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/weird-science-remake-joel-silver-universal/&quot;&gt;Deadline&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;b&gt;Joel Silver,&lt;/b&gt; who produced the original with&lt;b&gt; John Hughes&lt;/b&gt;, is producing the remake and has hired the dude who wrote the new &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;21 Jump Street &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;script to write this shit. Joel&#039;s plan is to make &lt;i&gt;Weird Science&lt;/i&gt; raunchier and edgier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m into raunchier and I&#039;m into edgier, but I&#039;m not into them replacing &lt;b&gt;Kelly LeBrock&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108988/&quot;&gt;That shit show on the USA Network&lt;/a&gt; was bad enough. I just know they&#039;re going to get Kate Upton or Megan Fox or Rosie Huntington-Whateverly. The only way I&#039;ll be okay with this is if they cast one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Courtney Stodden&lt;/b&gt; - She&#039;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/02/18/open-post-hosted-courtney-stoddens-alter-ego&quot;&gt;master at accents&lt;/a&gt; and she&#039;s made of parts from old PCS and factory-defected animatronic Real Dolls.&lt;br /&gt;
2.&lt;b&gt; Shauna Sand &lt;/b&gt;- Needs no explanation.&lt;br /&gt;
3. &lt;b&gt;Tan Mom &lt;/b&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/18/tanning-mom-naked-bikini-photos-0127-480w.jpg&quot;&gt;The pictures&lt;/a&gt; speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
4. &lt;b&gt;Richard Simmons &lt;/b&gt;- Because he can deliver the hell out of the line, &quot;&lt;i&gt;You&#039;re out of shape, I&#039;ll kick your arse!&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they can totally get Donald Trump to play Chet the Shit!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>In Case You Really Want To See Tan Mom With Barely Any Clothes On </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/case-you-really-want-see-tan-mom-barely-any-clothes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s a blessing or a damn curse that I can&#039;t post the eyelash-singeing pictures from &lt;b&gt;Tan Mom&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; topless photo shoot on a beach in New Jersey yesterday. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/18/tanning-mom-bikini-meltdown-new-jersey/&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; has 100 stunning portraits of New Jersey&#039;s official state flower Tan Mom looking like a delicate and fresh Siren beckoning sailors to her bloated, tattooed loins. You won&#039;t know whether to stare deep into her exquisitely drawn upper chocha tattoo or immediately send those pictures to Sports Illustrated and beg them to put her on the cover of their next Swimsuit Edition. The tag sticking out of her bikini is really what makes the entire photo shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you open up the pictures and click on the &quot;&lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt;&quot; button really fast, Tan Mom will give you the most terrifying flip book show ever. And in almost every picture, she&#039;s saying &quot;&lt;i&gt;just doing this for extra booze money&quot;&lt;/i&gt; with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Afternoon Crumbs </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/afternoon-crumbs</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear &lt;b&gt;Miranda Kerr&lt;/b&gt;, please pull out your notebook and turn to your left. That is how you deliver a pose that&#039;ll make the boys salivate, honey! - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/John-Travolta-chin-growth-and-Kelly-Preston-with-son-Benjamin-in-Sydney/26574&quot;&gt;Lainey Gossip &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the evil spirit of &lt;b&gt;Deadmau5&lt;/b&gt; took over &lt;b&gt;RiRi&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; body... - &lt;a href=&quot;http://drunkenstepfather.com/2013/04/18/rita-ora-for-elle-of-the-day#.UXBUzpV5iXI&quot;&gt;Drunken Stepfather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jaden Smith&lt;/b&gt; needs less Scientology in his life - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebitchy.com/292774/jaden_smith_if_people_think_were_the_only_people_that_live_in_this_universe_then_something_is_wrong_with_them/&quot;&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremy Irons &lt;/b&gt;opened up his trap hole about same-sex marriage again - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.towleroad.com/2013/04/moreirons.html&quot;&gt;Towleroad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll know &lt;b&gt;RiRi&lt;/b&gt; is knocked up when we hear someone crying &quot;&lt;i&gt;WHYYYYY MEEEE?????&quot; &lt;/i&gt;from her stomach area - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesuperficial.com/rihanna-pregnant-04-2013&quot;&gt;The Superficial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time when I was 6 or 7, I went to a birthday party and the kid&#039;s mom gave us so much candy and I kept eating and eating and eating and eating until I barfed it all up on the white kitchen floor. What I stared at on that kitchen floor looks exactly like what&#039;s on &lt;b&gt;Kelly Brook&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; dress - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodtuna.com/?p=92857&quot;&gt;Hollywood Tuna&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rosario Dawson&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; serving us some ho shit in &lt;i&gt;GQ&lt;/i&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popoholic.com/2013/04/18/rosario-dawson-seriously-sizzlies-in-gq/&quot;&gt;Popoholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;OhmyXenu, me too, Heather!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; - &lt;b&gt;John Travolta&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://icydk.com/2013/04/18/how-does-heather-locklear-keep-her-skin-so-radiant-semen-the-actress-admits/&quot;&gt;ICYDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC should pull &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Today&#039;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ratings back up by turning the camera around and showing all the foolery that happens behind-the-scenes - &lt;a href=&quot;http://jezebel.com/theres-crazy-crap-going-on-behind-the-scenes-at-the-to-476048703&quot;&gt;Jezebel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our luck, &lt;b&gt;Kim Kartrashian&lt;/b&gt; will use this to her advantage and get cast as Chewbacca in the new &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Star Wars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; movies - &lt;a href=&quot;http://idly.craveonline.com/2013/04/kim-kardashian-is-basically-covered-in-hair-at-all-times/?slide=1&quot;&gt;IDLYITW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is trying to sell us that they have no idea what the definition of &quot;&lt;i&gt;influential&lt;/i&gt;&quot; is - &lt;a href=&quot;http://theberry.com/2013/04/18/todays-celebrity-rundown-14-photos-52/&quot;&gt;The Berry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Levy&lt;/b&gt; is hot even with &lt;b&gt;Kim Kardashian&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;used wax strips on his head - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justjared.com/2013/04/18/william-levy-shirtless-for-pepsi-next-campaign-shoot/&quot;&gt;Just Jared&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panty Creamer of the Day: &lt;b&gt;Mark Wright&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omgblog.com/2013/04/omg_mr_wright_mark_wright_in_h.php&quot;&gt;OMG Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &quot;&lt;i&gt;Suki Waterhouse&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is one of &lt;b&gt;Victor Garber&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;nicknames, then the answer is yes - &lt;a href=&quot;http://imnotobsessed.com/2013/04/18/bradley-cooper-suki-waterhouse-the-one/&quot;&gt;I&#039;m Not Obsessed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for why is &lt;b&gt;JLo&lt;/b&gt; wearing a children&#039;s nightgown from the 1890s? - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/jennifer-lopezs-short-dress-photo_n_3110507.html?utm_hp_ref=celebrity&quot;&gt;HuffPo&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teen Mom Farrah&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is not only brainless, but she&#039;s homeless now too&amp;nbsp;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realitytea.com/2013/04/18/sex-tape-lies-force-farrah-abraham-out-of-moms-home-plus-sneak-peek-of-farrah-on-dr-phil/&quot;&gt; Reality Tea&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think, &lt;b&gt;Adrienne Maloof&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;mouth has been on that - &lt;a href=&quot;http://seriouslyomg.com/?p=33217&quot;&gt;SOW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess &lt;b&gt;Vanessa Hudgen&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; ecstasy-induced Coachella high wore off - &lt;a href=&quot;http://celebslam.celebuzz.com/2013/04/vanessa-hudgens-gym-finger.php&quot;&gt;Celebslam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth Hurley&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; dress looks like it made of glitter-covered red licorice laces - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/Kate-Hudson-Matthew-Bellamy-Hot-Pink-Party-Photos-29570467&quot;&gt;Popsugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Open Post: Hosted By The Snow Miser With The Heat Miser&#039;s Hairstyle </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/open-post-hosted-snow-miser-heat-misers-hairstyle</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Conan O&#039;Brien&#039;s face twin and alien goddess &lt;b&gt;Tilda Swinton&lt;/b&gt; finally woke up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dlisted.com/2013/03/23/art-sleeping-tilda&quot;&gt;her glass box nap &lt;/a&gt;and put on some couture (or &quot;&lt;i&gt;cature&lt;/i&gt;&quot; as my cousin calls it) to pose in a spread for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2013/05/tilda-swinton-tim-walker-las-pozas-cover-story-ss#slide=18&quot;&gt;W Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. The picture above is my favorite, because it&#039;s a mix between&lt;b&gt; January Jones&#039; &lt;/b&gt;frightened tampon, &lt;b&gt;Jim Bob Duggar&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; traumatized sperm fish and something you&#039;d see if you put a magnifying glass up to one of &lt;b&gt;Nicole Kidman&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; frozen forehead pores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&#039;t even try to analyze or figure out Tilda&#039;s art. I should just sit back and enjoy the Tilda, enjoy the ART!!! and enjoy all the WTF.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What Did Billy Ray Cyrus Say When Liam Hemsworth Asked For His Daughter&#039;s Hand In Marriage? </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/what-did-billy-ray-cyrus-say-when-liam-hemsworth-asked-his-daughters-hand-marriage-0</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Billy Ray Cyrus&lt;/b&gt; didn&#039;t write about&lt;b&gt; Miley Cyrus&#039; &lt;/b&gt;relationship with&lt;b&gt; Liam Hemsworth&lt;/b&gt; in his new book &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hillybilly Heart &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;(that really is the name), because why give precious page space in his straight-to-the-clearance-shelf-at-Piggly-Wiggly memories to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20692424,00.html&quot;&gt;something that is going to end any second now&lt;/a&gt;? But Billy did tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accesshollywood.com/&quot;&gt;Access Hollywood Live&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a474347/billy-ray-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-asked-my-permission-to-marry-miley.html&quot;&gt;DS&lt;/a&gt;) about how Liam came to him and asked for his meal ticket&#039;s hand in marriage. Usually when an outsider asks for a hillbilly&#039;s daughter&#039;s hand, that hillbilly father will only allow it if it the outsider wins a naked wrestling match in a mud pit against a hog after downing two XXX jugs. Billy let Liam skip that challenge, but he did ask for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;He didn&#039;t have to, but he did. He&#039;s got a really sweet side to him and he came in. They had the big rock. They [were] all bashful about it and then said, &#039;Hey, look at this&#039;. And Miley was showing that ring and Liam kind of [said] a little something to me - it was kind of the professional question and I jokingly [said], &#039;Can I be in your brother&#039;s next movie?&#039; And then I said, &#039;No, I&#039;m joking&#039;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Ray wasn&#039;t joking...... and that is why his mullet is going to play &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/thumb/8/82/Mongoose_2.jpg/406px-Mongoose_2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mongoose&lt;/b&gt; in the next &lt;b&gt;Thor&lt;/b&gt; movi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel//universe3zx/images/thumb/8/82/Mongoose_2.jpg/406px-Mongoose_2.jpg&quot;&gt;e&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s Billy Ray working the hell out of his Mrs. Brady season 2 hairstyle while leaving GMA yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>By Popular Demand: The Sorority Girl Email To End All Sorority Girl Emails </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/popular-demand-sorority-girl-e-mail-end-all-sorority-girl-e-mails</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ve already won my heart and made the edges of my cunt gene tingle when you start off an email with &quot;&lt;i&gt;because this email is going to be a rough fucking ride.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://deadspin.com/we-fucking-suck-so-far-a-sorority-girl-lashes-out-at-476159462&quot;&gt;Deadspin&lt;/a&gt; reader sent them an electronic bitch slapping that the head of some bottom of the barrel sorority at the University of Maryland gave to her sisters. If there was a MoCA (Museum of Cunty Art), this email would be its Mona Lisa. The Mel Gibson of sorority sisters broke her MacBook Air when she rage typed out an email to her sisters, letting those slacking slackers know that they need to get their shit together. This chick&#039;s sorority has been matched up with a big frat on campus for Greek Week and I guess the only thing her sisters have been winning are credits toward getting their PhD in SUCK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire email is after the cunt (typo and it stays) and it&#039;s best if you read it in &lt;b&gt;Christian Bale&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; voice, because this is pretty much the same rant he shouts at the crew every morning. Going half-Kanye (aka using random CAPS) was a nice, poetic touch. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/04/18/popular-demand-sorority-girl-e-mail-end-all-sorority-girl-e-mails&quot;&gt;Go, you AWKWARD, boring bitches!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Don&#039;t You Just Hate It When A One Night Stand Pulls A Knife On You? </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/04/18/dont-you-just-hate-it-when-one-night-stand-pulls-knife-you</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Seen above as the kosher meat in a caucasian-jewish-korean manwich, &lt;b&gt;Eddie Kaye Thomas,&lt;/b&gt; better known as Shit-Break from the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;American Pie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; movies, had to call the police yesterday afternoon after his one night trick turned into a knife-wielding crazy bitch who was once step away from boiling his bunny rabbit. Didn&#039;t Eddie Kaye Thomas learn anything from his own movies? Sometimes it&#039;s better just to stay home and fuck an apple pie from Costco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/18/eddie-kaye-thomas-american-pie-swat-house-standoff-girlfriend-knife/&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; says that Eddie picked up a trick at Mel&#039;s Diner of all places on Tuesday night and brought her back to his house in the Hollywood Hills. The next day, Eddie tried to get the trick out of his house and that&#039;s when she pulled some &quot;&lt;i&gt;I&#039;m not going to be ignored&lt;/i&gt;&quot; shit. My guess is that Eddie told her she had to leave, because he was needed on set. Even crazy bitches know that Eddie hasn&#039;t said that line truthfully since 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Eddie asked that insane trick to leave, she pulled a knife on him. Eddie ran outside and called the police. They sent the SWAT team and while they were outside of Eddie&#039;s house, the crazy bitch was inside, trashing his house. The SWAT team had to tear gas the ho to get her out. She was booked for felony vandalism after she was checked out at a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who in the hell brings a jump-off home anymore? (If you&#039;ve got a one night trick cleaning out their genitals in your bathroom sink while you&#039;re reading this, you should make a guilty face.) Yes, most of us have done it, but we still know that you&#039;re not supposed to bring a one-time fuck partner to your house. That&#039;s what the backseat of cars, alleyways, bar bathrooms and Porta Potties on construction sites are for. (Side note: Somebody should really make Porta Potties for one night stands. They can put &#039;em outside of all the bars. They can call &#039;em Porta Fuckies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Eddie wanted to get that lunatic ho out fast, he should&#039;ve just put on one of those direct-to-DVD &lt;i&gt;American Pie&lt;/i&gt; movies. That will make even the craziest bitch scatter for the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that being said, you know Eddie&#039;s going to call her back for a second round, because there ain&#039;t no ass like crazy ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
