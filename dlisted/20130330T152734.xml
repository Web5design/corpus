 <title>Jeremy Renner Is A Daddy </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/jeremy-renner-daddy</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/2013/01/16/jeremy-renners-ex-girlfriend-knocked-his-baby&quot;&gt;A couple of months ago&lt;/a&gt;, we all found out that &lt;b&gt;Jeremy Renner&lt;/b&gt; knocked up his ex-girlfriend &lt;b&gt;Sonni Pacheco&lt;/b&gt; and instead of cutting her a check, putting her on a bus and sending her far, far away, he put her up in the mansion he lives in with his roommate. I know, it&#039;s like the most bizarre episode of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The New Normal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ever. Well, Jeremy and Sonni are now Super Glued to each other for life, because a baby with his DNA and her DNA now exists. Jeremy&#039;s rep tells &lt;a href=&quot;http://celebritybabies.people.com/2013/03/29/jeremy-renner-welcomes-daughter-ava-berlin/&quot;&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; that Jeremy did make a baby with Sonni and that baby was born. People puts it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He and girlfriend Sonni Pacheco confirm to PEOPLE that they are the proud parents of a 7 lb. baby girl, &lt;b&gt;Ava Berlin Renner.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are beyond thrilled,” his spokesperson tells PEOPLE in a statement. “Mother and daughter are doing great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of a baby-on-the-way for the Oscar nominee first hit the web in January following the Golden Globes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renner, 42, had not previously addressed the rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually like the name Ava Berlin Renner and I always hiss at celebrity baby names. Ava Berlin sounds like the name of a super elegant drag queen who only sings songs from the musical &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cabaret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and only performs at lounges that use cloth napkins. &amp;nbsp;Ava Berlin also sounds like the name of lounge singer turned mob wife (Michelle Pfeiffer will play her in the movie).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, congrats to Ava Berlin, because she gets to look up at&lt;b&gt; Jeremy Renner&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;eyeliner-lined bunny eyes and say, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Daddy&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Good Friday Crumbs </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/good-friday-crumbs</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kellan Lutz&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;talks to a hot director type on the set of his new straight-to-the-dollar-theater masterpiece and all I can scream is, &quot;&lt;i&gt;KISS! KISS! KISS! KISS!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.towleroad.com/2013/03/a-slice-of-kellan-lutz-beefcake.html&quot;&gt;Towleroad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prince William&lt;/b&gt; has quit flying helicopters with the Royal Air Force, because he wants to focus all his energy on trying to convince &lt;b&gt;Prince Hot Ginge&lt;/b&gt; to move to California and shack up with a certain bitter, crusty, skinny fat gay blogger (that&#039;s how I&#039;m reading that item, anyway) &amp;nbsp;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laineygossip.com/Prince-William-to-quit-the-Royal-Air-Force/26391&quot;&gt;Lainey Gossip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I want to go to there,&lt;/i&gt;&quot; said &lt;b&gt;Goopy Paltrow&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; kids as they stared at this picture of &lt;b&gt;Hayden Panatroll &lt;/b&gt;nibbling on a bag of Oreos -&lt;a href=&quot;http://drunkenstepfather.com/2013/03/29/hayden-panettiere-gives-up-now-that-shes-engaged-of-the-day&quot;&gt; Drunken Stepfather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, &lt;b&gt;Kathie Lee Gifford&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;got a new favorite wine glass - &lt;a href=&quot;http://theberry.com/2013/03/29/its-a-girl-thing-33-photos-6/&quot;&gt;The Berry&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every frat boy who wore white socks with Nike sandals will file a copyright infringement lawsuit against &lt;b&gt;Sarah Jessica Parker &lt;/b&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebitchy.com/288918/sarah_jessica_parker_is_designing_socks_to_wear_with_heels_ridiculous_or_trendy/&quot;&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh how I wish this was a &lt;b&gt;Ryan Gosling&lt;/b&gt; panty flash instead - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesuperficial.com/eva-mendes-upskirt-panty-flash-03-2013&quot;&gt;The Superficial&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m pretty sure that &lt;b&gt;Adrianne Palicki&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;dress used to be one of &lt;b&gt;Michelle Kwan&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; skating outfits - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodtuna.com/?p=91627&quot;&gt;Popoholic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For&lt;b&gt; Lil Wayne&#039;s &lt;/b&gt;sake, I hope Sizzurp cures epilepsy&amp;nbsp;-&lt;a href=&quot;http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/29/lil-wayne-reveals-he-has-epilepsy/&quot;&gt; The Marquee Blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kim&lt;/b&gt; and&lt;b&gt; Kanye Kardashian&lt;/b&gt; should name their baby Head West, because that&#039;s what it&#039;s going to do as soon as it&#039;s able to crawl... It&#039;s just going to crawl west until it hits the ocean and it&#039;s going to keep going until it gets as far away from all things Kardashian as possible - &lt;a href=&quot;http://idontlikeyouinthatway.com/2013/03/kim-kardashian-wants-to-name-her-kid-easton-west-now.html&quot;&gt;IDLYITW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Duck Dynasty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; dudes want more money - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realitytea.com/2013/03/29/should-the-duck-dynasty-cast-get-more-money-for-a-fourth-season/&quot;&gt;Reality Tea&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see &lt;b&gt;Justin Theroux&lt;/b&gt;, I just think to myself that &lt;b&gt;Shane&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The L Word&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; would look so much hotter in that outfit - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-Furniture-Shopping-28935511&quot;&gt;Popsugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Brandi Glanville Hides Her Burnt  Freddy Krueger Hand With A Leather Glove </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/brandi-glanville-hides-her-burnt-freddy-krueger-hand-leather-glove</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;While sharing the green carpet with other bright shining A-listers like &lt;b&gt;Scott Isadick, Khloe Kartrashian, Hot Piece Mauricio, Kyle Richards &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; Lisa Rinna&lt;/b&gt; at a McDonald&#039;s party last night, &lt;b&gt;Brandi Glanvill&lt;/b&gt;e wore leather gloves and some just figured she had a layer of hand skin peeled off, because she wanted her hands to look as plastic as her face. But Brandi &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BrandiGlanville&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebitchy.com/289020/brandi_glanvilles_all-leather_ensemble_at_the_mcwrap_launch_tacky_or_sexy/&quot;&gt;Celebitchy&lt;/a&gt; to let them know that she covered up her hand with a leather glove, because it&#039;s got a serious burn on it. Brandi just had to tweet a picture of it. Brandi didn&#039;t say how she burned her hand, but I&#039;m guessing she either fisted a ginger or burnt it while cooking meth on a cooktop. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that burnt hand picture didn&#039;t make you feel queasy enough,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brandi-glanville-licks-and-kisses-go-daddy-actor-jesse-heiman-on-the-red-carpet-2013293&quot;&gt; UsWeekly has a picture&lt;/a&gt; that&#039;ll take you over the edge. It&#039;s the closest Brandi has gotten to having a Heiman in CENTURIES!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s more pictures of Brandi and those other hos at last night&#039;s McDonald&#039;s event. Yes, Brandi&#039;s face looks like it has all the Botox in it, but it&#039;s still more natural than anything McDonald&#039;s puts between two buns.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Coming Soon: The Real Falkor Of Hidden Hills </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/coming-soon-real-falkor-hidden-hills</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, there were rumors that the producers of&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; Real Housewives of Beverly Hills &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;were leaving a trail of laxative pills from &lt;b&gt;LeAnn Rimes&#039; &lt;/b&gt;cave in Fantasia to their casting offices, because they wanted her to join the cast. LeAnn&#039;s arch rival &lt;b&gt;Brandi Glanville &lt;/b&gt;said she thought the rumor was funny since LeAnn always shits on the Housewives and LeAnn later said it wasn&#039;t true. But just because LeAnn said &quot;&lt;i&gt;neigh&lt;/i&gt;&quot; to the producers of Housewives doesn&#039;t mean that she&#039;s saying &quot;&lt;i&gt;neigh&lt;/i&gt;&quot; to all reality shit shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gossipcop.com/leann-rimes-eddie-cibrian-pitching-reality-show-lives-together-docu-series/&quot;&gt;Gossip Cop &lt;/a&gt;says that LeAnn and Eddie Cibrian are currently pitching their own reality show about their life together. It&#039;ll be the perfect show to watch after Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Because right after you gain 30 pounds from watching Mama June drink a gallon jug of melted butter and liquefied Peeps, you can barf it all up while watching LeAnn and Eddie act like they have the perfect life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wanted to see an emaciated pony with fake tits slobber on a squinty whore of a donkey, I&#039;d turn on Animal Planet After Dark. LeAnn&#039;s brain must&#039;ve slipped out of her gaping nostrils, because putting her marriage in front of reality show cameras is the dumbest thing she&#039;s done since marrying Eddie Cibrian. Everybody knows that nothing kills a marriage faster than a reality show. This is not how it&#039;s supposed to end, anyway. LeAnn and Eddie&#039;s marriage isn&#039;t supposed to die because of a stupid reality show. It&#039;s supposed to die when she catches Eddie&#039;s side piece biting onto one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leannrimes/status/315538015319629824/photo/1&quot;&gt;her Union Jack pillows&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;as he hits it from the back on their Pier 1 daybed. Brandi Glanville feels so cheated, again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s LeAnn hollering and yodeling at her concert in London a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Goopy Lets Her Kids Have One Coke Per Week </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/goopy-lets-her-kids-have-one-coke-week</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;b&gt;Goopy Paltrow&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://dlisted.com/2013/03/12/you-wont-find-one-chicken-egg-or-slice-bread-house-goop&quot;&gt;regularly serves her kids&lt;/a&gt; a delicious dinner of hallowed-out fennel seeds with a side of organic lettuce sweat, she says that &lt;b&gt;Apple&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Moses Martin&lt;/b&gt; sometimes get hunger pangs in their stomachs. (&quot;&lt;i&gt;Privileged kids of privileged asshole millionaires are just like us!&lt;/i&gt;&quot; - the starving orphans of Ethiopia) But in this week&#039;s edition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goop.com/journal/make/218/its-all-good&quot;&gt;POOP&lt;/a&gt;, Goopy says that Apple and Moses don&#039;t always eat a gluten-free, sugar-free, fun-free diet. They get one Coke per week and sometimes she lets Apple swallow down the top food group on the Spears family food guide pyramid: CHEETOS! Goop spat out this shit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I tried to start them off with all of the right foods but as they got older, the lure of Oreos and cotton candy outweighed the lure of carrots with hummus. And that’s all a part of childhood and I love Oreos too, so I completely understand. I try to make sure that what is on their plate at home is nutritious and tasty and then I loosen way up on the reigns when we are out. They love a brown rice stir-fry but they also love their &#039;Coke of the week&#039;. My daughter gravitates toward fresh fruit and raw nuts but will inhale a bag of hot Cheetos at the airport. It&#039;s all about balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Goopy&#039;s idea of Oreos are probably imported Belgian dark chocolate truffles filled with cream made from the milk of an Iberian Lynx and her idea of hot Cheetos are slivers of gold-flecked cheddar puffed up with distilled air, but at least the Goopy kids get to eat something other than grass tips every now and again. They&#039;re still going to turn to a life of a crime in a few years and by that I mean they&#039;re going to rob grocery stores for junk food. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Give me all the boxes of hot Cheetos you&#039;ve got in the back or I&#039;ll tie you down and make you read my mom&#039;s newsletter out loud!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;b&gt;White Oprah&lt;/b&gt; probably saw the headline &lt;i&gt;&quot;Gwyneth Paltrow lets her kids have one Coke per week&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and immediately called CPS. Giving your kid only one line of coke per week is child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Lindsay Lohan Is Broke Off, Dozed Off In São Paulo </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/lindsay-lohan-broke-dozed-s%C3%A3o-paulo</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Next to video of a train derailing before crashing into the side of a building, this picture is the best visual definition of the current state of &lt;b&gt;Lindsay Lohan&#039;s&lt;/b&gt; life. The people of São Paulo have been told to triple lock their bottles of booze and hide their valuables under bars of soap (she&#039;ll never look there), which means that Lindsay Lohan is in town. LiLo is currently in Brazil to collect a six figure check for promoting a clothing line called John John. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/29/lindsay-lohan-brazil-table-drunk/&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; posted this picture from Twitterer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/orgastic_desire/status/317533664072310785&quot;&gt;@orgastic-desire&lt;/a&gt; of LiLo mingling with the cigarette butts and other pieces of trash while hiding under the DJ table at a club. Mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/29/lindsay-lohan-brazil-table-drunk/5/#comments-anchor&quot;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt; says that LiLo was at the club for hours and when a bunch of people started asking her to take pictures with them, she refused and hid from them under the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody should leave Lindsay Lohan alone. After a long, hard day of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eonline.com/news/402591/lindsay-lohan-braceletgate-did-the-anger-management-jewelry-surface-in-brazil-see-the-pic&quot;&gt;snatching bracelets&lt;/a&gt; and snorting mini bottles of vodka on a plane ride to Brazil, you too would want to take a quick, early morning disco nap on a comfortable concrete floor under a table at a club. Sometimes a mess just needs a quiet moment to herself to get her thoughts together (aka snort a line of the bad shit) in peace while sitting on a dried puddle of whiskey. A dried puddle of whiskey that probably has Syphilis now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, who hasn&#039;t been there? If you replace that club with a suburban backyard, replace that black table with a plastic white lawn table from KMart, replace those stolen Louboutins with dollar store flip-flops and replace that glass of vodka masquerading as water with a cup of white wine and Mountain Dew, that&#039;ll be me this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Richard Griffiths Has Died </title>
 <link>http://dlisted.com/2013/03/29/richard-griffiths-has-died</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harry Potter&#039;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Uncle Vernon floated up to the great big &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_in_the_Sky_(TV_series)&quot;&gt;Pie in the Sky&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;yesterday at the age of 65. &lt;b&gt;Richard Griffiths &lt;/b&gt;died at the University Hospital Coventry from complications after heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before playing Uncle Vernon in all the Harry Potter movies, Richard played the carrot-loving Uncle Monty in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Withnail and I &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and Dr. Meinheimer in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Naked Gun &amp;nbsp;2 1/2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (his greatest achievement, I know). Richard was also in &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The History Boys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, one of the &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; movies, &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hugo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sleepy Hollow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; Daniel Radcliffe&lt;/b&gt;, who was the Harry to his Uncle Vernon and who also worked with him in the stage revival of &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Equus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, had a few words to say to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21973505#TWEET694121&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; about Richard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Richard was by my side during two of the most important moments of my career. I was proud to know him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that Richard Griffiths was an award-winning, respected and seriously accomplished actor, but since I&#039;m trash, my first thought after hearing this news was, &quot;&lt;i&gt;He got to see&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlisted.com/node/28327&quot;&gt; Harry Potter&#039;s peen&lt;/a&gt; up close and on stage&lt;/i&gt;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace, Richard Griffiths.&lt;/p&gt;
