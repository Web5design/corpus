<p>Today is the 1st of March, which means that in 30 days, we&#8217;ll be jumping in a plane and leaving Chiang Mai, the place we&#8217;ve been calling home for the past 3 years in <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/category/thailand/">Thailand</a>. It&#8217;s going to be a sad departure but we&#8217;re looking forward to moving to our new chosen city: <strong><em>Granada, <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/category/spain-2/">Spain</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>During the past three years, I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to live in a residence that overlooks the city and has a balcony facing west. My wife must secretly think I&#8217;m crazy but I&#8217;ve never failed to capture the sunset almost every evening since living here. Well, apart from the horrible <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/03/missing-beautiful-sunsets-in-chiang-mai-thailand/">smoky season</a> when the setting sun is hidden behind a thick layer of smoke.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re going to live in Granada, or if we&#8217;ll have a balcony facing west, but I&#8217;m sure that this view here is one of the things I&#8217;m going to miss the most. Having the leisure to wake up in the morning and observe the city, or get out on the balcony, while the temperature is cooling down in the evening and a warm light is flooding our room, to capture the amazing different sunsets&#8230; That&#8217;s just amazing.</p>
<p>So, I decided to compile some of the best shots I&#8217;ve captured in honor of the beautiful dramatic sunsets of Chiang Mai, to show how different they can be every evening, and to prove that you can also get great shots from the comfort of your home. It&#8217;s all about being patient and waiting for the best light.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>I often enjoyed the warm and cool colors during sunsets. But I&#8217;ve always hated that ugly building.</p>

<p>Hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed these few shots. Since it&#8217;s the smokey season now, I might not have the opportunity to get wonderful sunset shots again before I leave. I&#8217;m grateful for all these beautiful skyscapes I&#8217;ve seen and look forward to seeing more in the South of Spain.</p>
<p>Thanks and feel free to pin and share if you like!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin" style="height: 42px; width: 250px;" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Post-divider-141.png" /></div>
<p>A couple of days ago, I shared this photo I took last <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/11/the-colors-of-fall-usa/">Fall in Kentucky</a>. It&#8217;s an old barn located near Rough River lake with hanging tobacco waiting to be fire cured.</p>
<p>The photo was well received but I had a few comments from people telling me &#8220;It&#8217;s HDR&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, on the one hand, I want to ask: &#8220;<em>Does it matter?</em>&#8220;. This shot is supposed to be a beautiful artistic shot. It&#8217;s not a documentary so, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what style I use to make it look the way it is. What matters is that I like it and the public likes it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;d like to add: &#8220;No, this is not HDR&#8221;.</p>
<p>This image was processed in <strong>Lightroom</strong> only and I&#8217;ll show you step by step how I achieved this look in less than 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I work with <strong>Lightroom 4</strong> so some of the sliders have different names (or don&#8217;t exist) in older versions. If you haven&#8217;t upgraded, I urge you to do so. LR4 is a much better product than the previous ones.</p>
<p>(<em>Disclaimer: Actually, the above statement is not entirely true. I did use an external plugin to add a different vignette since it gives me more control, but all the rest has been done in Lightroom. In fact, you&#8217;ll see in the end result at the bottom of this post that both images are VERY similar. You probably wouldn&#8217;t have been able to tell the difference if I hadn&#8217;t mentioned it</em>).</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start with the original image below. This was shot handheld at sunrise with a Canon 50D and a Sigma 10-20mm lens. This was the best exposure I could get without completely blowing out the sky. Despite what it looks like, it was much darker and the sun was juuuust below the horizon, so I had to overexpose the sky in order to get enough details on the barn which obviously, is the main subject. Reminder: I only shoot in <strong>RAW</strong> (VERY important if you need to process your images).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3152 " alt="Original Raw shot" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-2-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Obviously, this image wouldn&#8217;t be published in a magazine, or anywhere. The sky is too bright, there&#8217;s not enough contrast and the colors are dull.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t crop the image at all, I liked the way it was. So, why did I work on this image? It&#8217;s not very obvious at first but I liked the fact that the colors are warm on the left side and cool on the right side (due to sunrise). I wanted to enhance those colors, as well as the gritty old look of the barn.</p>
<p>Main priority: Rescue that super-bright sky. I head out to the <em>Highlights</em> slider and decrease it all the way to -100. This brings back a little bit of the colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3153 " alt="Highlights" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-3-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>You can see the top part of the image is slightly darker. But it&#8217;s still not enough. I want it darker.</p>
<p>I click on the <em>Adjustment Brush</em> (K), select a fairly large brush size, decrease the <em>exposure</em> and <em>highlights</em> sliders a little bit and paint over the sky. To make it easier, since there&#8217;s a clear separation between the sky and the barn, I tick the &#8220;<em>Auto Mask</em>&#8221; option so that I don&#8217;t accidentally paint over the barn too.</p>
<p>No need to go overboard. The left side of the image is still very bright but it&#8217;ll be toned down later with the addition of a vignette so I don&#8217;t worry too much about it right now. Here&#8217;s the result so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>Much better than the original one. The sky is not crying for attention and we can notice a few warm colors appearing on the right and left side.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m done painting over the sky right now. I&#8217;ll fix the colors in a moment. But first, I like to add clarity in my shots so that it gives the barn a gritty look and doesn&#8217;t mess up too much with my exposure later (the clarity slider slightly brightens the image).</p>
<p>I increase the <em>Clarity</em> to +30 just to give me an idea of how it&#8217;s going to look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3155 " alt="Clarity" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-5-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s an improvement from the original image, this shot still lacks punch. Looking at it, the colors are dull and there&#8217;s not enough contrast. So let&#8217;s boost that up!</p>
<p>I adjust the <em>Vibrance</em> slider (+50) and the <em>Contrast</em> (+20) to really make the colors stand out. In my previous tutorial, I already explained why I prefer the <em>Vibrance</em> slider instead of <em>Saturation</em> slider. Also, I usually add contrast by adjusting the <em>Curves</em> but &#8230; the contrast slider did its job ok.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we get now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3156 " alt="Colors and Contrast" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-6-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Much better!</p>
<p>Some might say that now it looks fake and unnatural: It doesn&#8217;t matter. Most photos with a &#8220;wow&#8221; factor all have unnatural enhanced colors. Photos of the Milky Way or Mars also have enhanced saturated colors. Color is good.</p>
<p>So now we have a nice looking, colorful image. I&#8217;d really like to enhance the difference between the left warm side and the fading cool right side. I could just saturate colors even more but then the barn and grass would look awful and radioactive.</p>
<p>Instead, I decide to use the <em>Graduated Filter</em> (next to the adjustment brush) to achieve the effect I want. Now pay attention, this is getting complicated: I create 2 filters, one that I place on the left side with a temperature adjustment of +7 (warmer), and one that I place on the right side with a temperature adjustment of -7 (cooler). The filters are placed diagonally so that the warm filter covers the side of the barn facing the sunrise, and the cooler filter covers the blue sky and the remaining side of the barn. Hard to explain in words, but if you check the below image, you might get it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3157 " alt="Graduated Filters" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-7-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>If you look carefully, you can see that all the bottom+left side of the image became warmer and all the top+right side of the image became cooler. This helps enhance the colors and give the illusion of warm sunlight hitting the barn from the left.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m happy with the colors and the sky, it&#8217;s time to direct the viewer&#8217;s attention to the barn. And the easiest way to direct attention to the center of an image is to use <em>vignetting</em>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I used Nik Software&#8217;s Color Efex Pro 4 to create vignetting, because it gives me more control, but it still works well in Lightroom alone.</p>
<p>I go to the<em> Post-Crop vignetting</em> section and decrease the slider to darken the edges of the frame. This also helps pull your viewer&#8217;s attention away from the bright patch of sky on the left side. I am a big fan of vignetting and I recommend you use it to help the eye focus in the center of the frame.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3158 " alt="Vignetting" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-8-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Almost done!</p>
<p>You can clearly see how the eye is now focusing on the barn instead of the sky around.</p>
<p>Next step, I continue doing a few adjustments here and there to achieve the look I really want. I go to the <em>Adjustment Brush</em> again and add some more warmth, clarity and sharpness to the barn and the grass in the foreground. I also slightly increase the exposure of the barn to make it brighter. You can just play around and try various effects to see if it fits better or not.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my semi-final look.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3159 " alt="Adjustment Brush 2" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-9-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>At this point the photo is basically done, but since I also want my viewers to notice the hanging tobacco and not just the barn, I decide to use the<em> Dodge tool</em> (in the adjustment brush) to make them a little brighter.<br />
Finally, I add some overall sharpness, noise reduction and that&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the final image:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3160 " alt="Final Image" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121015-CoLP-0295-small-10-850x566.jpg" width="850" height="566" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" alt="" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>If you scroll back up, it&#8217;s almost exactly the same as the top image, except that the vignetting is a little darker.</p>
<p>Could all this be done using HDR? Maybe, I don&#8217;t really use HDR (I&#8217;m not very good at it). I love spending time processing my images so I&#8217;d rather achieve the look I want by having total control on the process instead of using a software.</p>

<p>Someone recently asked me: &#8220;2012 is over, where&#8217;s your retrospective post?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well.. I&#8217;ve already been so busy with all of 2013&#8242;s new projects that I&#8217;ve been rushing forward at full speed. I guess it&#8217;s a good thing to just stop for a moment and look back at what happened in the past year.</p>
<p>2012 was a fantastic year. So many good things happened, starting with our marriage, new business opportunities and so much more. It was certainly one of those years that I felt I was growing in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>In 2009, I took a big step by quitting my comfortable job and backpacking around the world to become a photographer. 2012 was the first year that I really felt like an accomplished professional after so much hard work.</p>
<p>2013 also sounds very promising and big changes are coming into our lives in the next few months. But I&#8217;ll talk about them later in a different post.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s a little gallery of some of the best photos I took during 2012, with a little explanation of what it meant to me.</p>
<p>Enjoy and I wish you all a great new year and the realization of your dreams and goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120604-CoLP-0112-Edit-Edit-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3129 " title="Lighting up Candles" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120604-CoLP-0112-Edit-Edit-small-850x566.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="566" /></a></p>
<p>2012 was the year I really got into Thai culture and Buddhist holidays. I tried to attend to every festival I could to capture the wonderful mood during these celebrations. This was taken during <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/06/visakha-bucha-in-chiang-mai-thailand/">Visakha Bucha</a> holiday in June, at my favorite temple in town: Wat Phan Tao.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121120-CoLP-1232-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3130 " title="Terracotta Buddha" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20121120-CoLP-1232-small-512x768.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>Last year was also the year I launched my &#8220;<a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/photography-workshops/">Private Workshops</a>&#8221; section, giving photography courses and photo tours in town to beginners or more advanced photographers. I wasn&#8217;t really expecting it to work as well but I was surprised by the amount of requests I&#8217;ve received since then. The photo above was taken at the &#8220;<em>terracotta garden</em>&#8220;, a beautiful hidden place where I take my students to practice on their photo skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120708-CoLP-1237-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3131 " title="Chiang Dao temple" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120708-CoLP-1237-small-850x566.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="566" /></a></p>
<p>Although 2012 was a very busy year, I also tried to take some time off with my wife and friends out of town. My favorite place to escape was Chiang Dao, about an hour and a half north of Chiang Mai. It&#8217;s a beautiful resort under the highest limestone mountain in Thailand with a beautiful temple sitting on top overlooking the misty forest.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120525-CoLP-0880-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3132 " title="Zeus' fury" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120525-CoLP-0880-small-512x768.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, living in Chiang Mai means tropical and hot weather but also <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/02/chiang-mai-rainy-season-thailand/">rainy and stormy season</a>. Although 2012 didn&#8217;t have as much rain as the previous years, I managed to capture my best lightning shot so far from my balcony. My wife knows by now that when there&#8217;s a storm coming over, I&#8217;m outside taking lightning photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>Lightning apart, I also gathered an enormous collection of <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/02/fiery-sunset-ii-thailand/"><em>sunset shots</em></a> from my balcony. Having a great view overlooking the city to the west, I managed to capture some great colors almost every evening and even thought about starting a different website showcasing only sunsets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120613-CoLP-0594-Edit-small.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3134 " title="Muay Thai boxing" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/20120613-CoLP-0594-Edit-small-512x768.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>You may laugh at me but after 3 years in Chiang Mai, I&#8217;ve attended my first Muay Thai fight only last year just because a friend of ours was also fighting. I took about fifty shots that were all discarded except for this one. At least it made me realize I&#8217;m not interested in sports photography and would rather sit back and enjoy the game/fight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>2012 was also the year of low light photography. I had a great time running around with my tripod capturing all the monks with their candles during Buddhist festivals. Look out for more low key shots during this year!</p>

<p>Another big event during 2012 was the <a href="http://www.foundryphotoworkshop.org/">Foundry Photojournalism workshop</a> that I attended in July. It was an amazing experience working with real talented photojournalists from around the world, networking with incredible photographers and trying to document the story I chose within 5 days which appeared to be quite challenging. My story was: &#8220;<strong><em>The Commercialization of Buddhism</em></strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>Last year was also the first time in my life I&#8217;ve really experienced <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/11/the-colors-of-fall-usa/">Fall season</a>. I had the pleasure to capture the turning leaves and cooling temperatures on a short holiday to Kentucky in the US. It quickly became my favorite season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>And of course, let&#8217;s not forget the most beautiful festival that takes place every year in the North of Thailand: <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/11/yi-peng-the-festival-of-lights-in-chiang-mai-thailand/">Yi Peng and Loy Krathong</a>. This was my third time experiencing it here in Chiang Mai and even though last year was a little disappointing, it still is a magical moment to see all those thousands of lanterns fly together, carrying the wishes of thousands of Thai people gathered at Mae Jo.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>And finally, if I had to choose my favorite shot of the year 2012, it would be this one with the monks at Wat Phan Tao, lighting up lanterns to release during Loy Krathong. This ended up also being my most popular image on various social media platforms.</p>

<p>Just a little message to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays for those who don&#8217;t celebrate it. Hope you enjoyed the festivities with friends and families.</p>
<p>I am currently on holiday in China so Internet is spotty and not every website is available. I&#8217;ll be back to Chiang Mai before New Year&#8217;s Eve and get back to my usual updates.</p>
<p>As French people say (and since I&#8217;m French), it&#8217;s bad luck to wish someone a &#8220;<em>Happy New Year</em>&#8221; before the 1st of January so I won&#8217;t do it right now ;)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How did you spend your holidays?</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin" style="height: 42px; width: 250px;" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Post-divider-141.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>Since my <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/05/how-to-fix-and-improve-your-photos-with-lightroom-tutorial/">Lightroom tutorial</a> is one of the most popular posts on my website, I&#8217;ve decided to continue and offer some free  &#8221;behind the scene glimpse&#8221; of my editing process by creating a new section called <em><strong>&#8220;How I Edited It&#8221;</strong></em>. Hope it will be useful in understanding how you can improve your shots and that there&#8217;s nothing bad in post-processing your images since the creative process does not end when the shutter is pressed on your camera (you know what <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/02/why-a-purist-in-photography-is-nonsense/">I feel about Purists</a>).</p>
<p>The shot above was taken in Dubai, in the UAE. I was trying to find a good angle to superimpose the old-style traditional buildings in the foreground (which are not old at all) and the self-proclaimed 7-star Burj-Al-Arab hotel in the background.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since I was with my wife and parents, I didn&#8217;t have the leisure to walk around and find the best angle, so I just snapped a few shots from where we were. I wasn&#8217;t sure about the final crop which is why I decided to go a little wider and include more of the scene. Here&#8217;s the original shot, straight out of the camera (RAW format).<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3081 " title="How I Edited it - Original" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-512x768.jpg" alt="How I Edited it - Original" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The shot was taken late afternoon. The sky was a little hazy and the lightwasn&#8217;t to harsh on the shot. The foreground was a little underexposed but the main subjects (the buildings) were correctly exposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Back home, the first step was importing, cataloging and keywording the shots. Later, after trying a few crops, I decided to remove the foreground and the water from the picture as it didn&#8217;t really add much. The final crop was tighter and included only the hotel, the market and some palm trees to give it an exotic feel.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3084 " title="How I Edited It - Crop" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-2-512x768.jpg" alt="How I Edited It - Crop" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>I can already hear one of the questions: <em>But what about the rule of thirds? Why is the hotel in the middle of the shot?</em><br />
Well, the rule of thirds is not really a rule, but more of a guideline, or a suggestion to improve composition. I felt that the hotel being in the middle gave more balance to the whole image so I decided to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Once the cropping was done, it was time to start working on making the photo pop. This is the jpeg conversion of the original RAW file, without any retouching, so it lacks contrast and saturation (another reason why it&#8217;s important to process photos, RAW files are ugly files).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My first step was to adjust the <em><strong>Clarity</strong> </em>slider. The reason I started with this slider before adjusting the exposure is that clarity adds a little bit of contrast and highlights already, as well as washing out the colors a little bit, so I&#8217;d rather start with that and then adjust the exposure/contrast/saturation instead of going back and forth.<br />
I don&#8217;t increase the clarity slider by much, since it gives the photo a very grungy look. I usually go between 10 and 30, which is enough in most cases. Here I brought the clarity up to 30.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3086 " title="How I Edited It - Clarity" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-3-512x768.jpg" alt="How I Edited It - Clarity" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As you can see, the image looks a little bit &#8220;sharper&#8221;, with more details in the branches and the buildings. The colors are a little bit washed out too, so I played around with <em><strong>Vibrancy</strong> </em>to add back some of the colors. I prefer using Vibrancy instead of Saturation as the latter saturates every color and the buildings start looking a little too orange. I also never increase Vibrancy too much, I went with +21 in here.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3087 " title="How I Edited It - Vibrancy" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-4-512x768.jpg" alt="How I Edited It - Vibrancy" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>The photo looks a bit better now but still lacks punch.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, every photographer has his own style. I like to add contrast to my photos so I decided to adjust the curves to my liking to add some contrast on the foreground branches. Most of the time, I avoid using the Contrast slider and prefer playing around with the <em><strong>Curves</strong> </em>as it gives much more control. I like to achieve the &#8220;<em>S-shaped</em>&#8221; curve by decreasing the dark tones and increasing the highlights.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3088 " title="How I Edited It - Curves" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-5-512x768.jpg" alt="How I Edited It - Curves" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Of course, the changes are subtle but you can notice more contrast, especially in the foreground. This is the style that I like, my photos tend to be a little underexposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Next I wanted to improve the sky a little bit, so here&#8217;s a Lightroom secret that I use all the time: If you want to have more interesting skies with a beautiful dark blue color, don&#8217;t use Saturation or Vibrance. Instead, go to the HSL sliders and decrease the <em><strong>Blue Luminance</strong></em>. This will darken skies a little bit. I went for -44 and here&#8217;s the result.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3089 " title="How I Edited It - Luminance" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7638-small-6-512x768.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="768" /><br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>The sky looks better and is darker. There might be some noise introduced when you bring down the Luminance slider too much, but since it&#8217;s a featureless sky anyway, it&#8217;s easy to just remove the noise and not lose details (there aren&#8217;t any).</p>
<p>The image is now &#8220;normalized&#8221;, which means I adjusted the colors, the contrast and the exposure. Next step is to apply the extra &#8220;creative layer&#8221; to make it look like the way I envisioned it.</p>
<p>This is the fun part, since you get to create the photo you want.</p>
<p>The original shot was taken around sunset, but the sky was hazy and the colors were bland. I really wanted to capture some beautiful and warm sunset colors. So my solution was to add some of the colors during editing to achieve that look.</p>
<p>In order to do that, I used the <strong><em>Split Toning</em></strong> section. I know that Split Toning is for Black and White photos but we just need to think outside the box and try different things.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The way I envision sunsets is a beautiful sky that slowly turns to a purple-ish hue fore going dark. Since it&#8217;s also around the Golden Hour, all the colors become a little warmer. So first I adjusted the <em>Highlights</em> color and added a slight purple color. This changed the colors of the sky and the brighter areas. Next I applied a slight orange hue to the <em>Shadows</em> to warm up the darker areas. You really don&#8217;t need to go overboard with the sliders. I chose a saturation of +5 for the Highlights and +4 for the Shadows. Here&#8217;s what the photo looks like now.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>Quite a dramatic change. Now THIS is what I had in mind when I was thinking about sunset colors.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One last thing I always add in all of my shots is a bit of Vignetting to force the viewer to focus on what I want him to see. I adjusted the <em><strong>Post-Cropping Vignette</strong></em> amount to -10 and here&#8217;s the final result.<br />
<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<img class="nopin aligncenter" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>Since the edges of the frame are darker, the brain forces the viewer to focus in the center of the shot.</p>
<p>Of course, before exporting, I applied some noise reduction and then sharpened the image. I also added some additional keywords, a title and a caption and voila! Ready to be exported on my HDD and on my cloud storage.</p>
<p>Some people would tell me that the original image doesn&#8217;t look like the final one, because I manipulated the colors. To them I reply: &#8220;So What? Picasso&#8217;s portraits don&#8217;t look like the original person at all either&#8221;.</p>
<p>Photography is not about <em>copying the world</em>. It&#8217;s about the <em>vision </em>of the person behind the viewfinder, combined with his <em>aesthetic sense</em>. Vision and aesthetics result in the interpretation of the scene through the photographer’s mind. So don&#8217;t be afraid to edit your photos and apply your aesthetic sense. (Of course, this doesn&#8217;t really apply in photojournalism).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a before/After of the shot.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin" title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>When we mention mobile photography, the first thing that comes up to mind usually is &#8220;<em>iPhoneography</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no denying that iPhones have opened up the door to a <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/11/is-photography-dying-history-photography/">new genre of photography</a> and Hipstamatic+<a href="http://instagram.com/canvasoflight">Instagram</a> have popularized filters on lifeless bland snapshots that are now directly shared online to hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Since then, many more apps that allow users to edit photos directly on their phone, have surfaced. Some are good and some are gimmicky. But it seemed that Android smartphones, although having cameras as good as the iPhone, were lagging behind. The main reason in my opinion was the lack of powerful editing tools.</p>
<p>Well, the good news is, <em><strong>Snapseed</strong></em>, one of the best editing apps on the app market is now available on Android phones and tablets. For free too!</p>
<p><em><strong>Snapseed</strong> </em>is an app developed by <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/"><strong>Nik Software</strong></a>, one of the leading companies when it comes to photo-editing, with plugins like <em>Silver Efex Pro</em> or <em>Color Efex 4</em>. This powerful app treads the line between professional and amateur photography. It&#8217;s packed with different tools and even has the company&#8217;s unique U-point technology that lets you make precise exposure, contrast and color adjustments to various user-defined control points in an image. But it was only available on iOS for $4.99.</p>
<p>Last September, Google announced that they had acquired Nik Software, so it was only a matter of time until an Android version of Snapseed would be released.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the good news: Snapseed is now available since yesterday on Android phones and tablets. And for free!</p>
<p>I downloaded it on both my Samsung Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 to play around with it and I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I haven&#8217;t encountered any bugs. Just like on iOS, it works great and is quite fast, especially on the tablet.</p>
<p>The interface is clean and user-friendly. With a vertical swipe, I can choose different options like brightness, contrast or saturation, and by swiping left or right, I can control the intensity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3063 " title="Snapseed Interface" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-07-13.39.52-850x498.png" alt="" width="850" height="498" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are different tools to choose ranging from basic editing tools to grungy filters, frames or even an efficient black and white conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3061 " title="Snapseed Options" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/snapseed1.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="200" /><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3062 " title="Snapseed Options" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/snapseed2.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="200" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s now a Google product, it&#8217;s tightly integrated with <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105204974467621325780/posts">Google+</a> but photos can also easily be shared to any other application or platform that your already have on Android, unlike the iOS&#8217;s closed system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3060 " title="Snapseed Interface" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2012-12-07-13.38.38-450x768.png" alt="" width="450" height="768" /><br />
If you&#8217;re serious about editing your photos instead of just applying the same old boring Instagram filters, I definitely recommend installing this app on any device you own. I forgot to to mention that it&#8217;s also free on iOS too now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fairly big file (25MB) so make sure you have enough space to install it.</p>
<p>Go get it now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5uaWtzb2Z0d2FyZS5zbmFwc2VlZCJd">Google Play</a> and have fun editing!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3070 " title="Photo edited in Snapseed on Galaxy S2" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Snapseed_0.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="768" /></p>

<p>Once again, for the third time since I&#8217;ve been living in Chiang Mai, I had the pleasure to attend to one of the most beautiful and photogenic festivals in the world: <strong><em>Yi Peng</em></strong> and <em><strong>Loy Krathong</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Yi Peng (or Yee Peng) is a festival of light that coincides with <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2010/11/photo-essay-loy-krathongyi-peng-festival-2010/">Loy Krathong</a> in Thailand. It&#8217;s a <em>Lanna</em> festival so it is mainly celebrated in the northern part of the country. The festival takes place during the 2nd lunar month of the Lanna calendar (Yi means &#8217;2nd&#8217; and Peng means &#8216;month&#8217;) which usually falls on a November.</p>
<p>The main attraction during this beautiful event is the multitude of <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/02/khom-loy-flying-lanterns-thailand/">flying lanterns</a> that are released in the sky, compared to Loy Krathong which is more about floating lanterns on the river.</p>
<p>Like in the past years, the biggest lantern release (over a thousand lanterns launched simultaneously) took place in <em>Mae Jo</em>, a small town outside of Chiang Mai. Thousands of people gathered up near a temple to meditate before releasing lanterns.</p>
<p>In the past years, I had an amazing time during this festival. However, this year, I felt the slimy tentacles of commercialism starting to taint the whole experience. Already in 2011, they created 2 separate events in Mae Jo, one that was for &#8216;locals&#8217; and remained free, and the second one was for tourists, costing about $80 (which is a LOT of money in Thailand for a single event). This didn&#8217;t bother me much since we still could attend the first free event anyway.</p>
<p>This year was a little different. There still was a free event, but half of the field was reserved by tour agencies, hoarding tourists from various Asian countries. It not only limited the space we all had, but it spoiled the experience a little bit since nobody respected the meditation (speaking and laughing loudly) and nobody followed the rules that attendants should light the lanterns and release them all together at the same time. It was chaotic, crowded, and a little disappointing.</p>
<p>Having said that, I still think <em>Yi Peng</em> and <em>Loy Krathong</em> are amazing festivals that need to be added on a bucket list (along with <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/04/songkran-the-thai-new-year-thailand/">Songkran</a> at least once). It didn&#8217;t suck, it was just a little disappointing. Yi Peng isn&#8217;t just about Mae Jo&#8217;s release, it&#8217;s also the celebrations in town, the events in temples, the happy locals, and all the decorations around Chiang Mai&#8217;s old city.</p>
<p>I attended this event 3 times and I knew what to expect. But for a newcomer, it is still an incredible experience and I often see huge smiles and happy tears all around me when the lanterns are all launched together in the sky.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, add it to your bucket list and head out to Chiang Mai during the month of November.</p>
<p>Here are a few shots from this year, hope you enjoy them and don&#8217;t hesitate to pin or share them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="nopin" style="height: 42px; width: 250px;" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Post-divider-141.png" alt="" /></div>
<p>One thing we often hear in various photography forums on the net, is that <strong><em>Photography is dead</em></strong>, or at least dying.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/02/why-a-purist-in-photography-is-nonsense/">Disillusioned Purists</a> claim that Digital Photography already soiled the purity of Film Photography. Later, the emergence of photography techniques like HDR further corrupted a critically wounded art.<br />
And now, the executioner is ready to deliver the fatal blow with his sharpened axe: <em>Phone Photography</em>.</p>
<p>Like almost everything on this planet, photography is constantly evolving. Old styles fade away and new techniques take over. We never lived in a static world.</p>
<p>Is Photography dying? Heck no it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s alive and never been healthier. As a matter of fact, more and more people are becoming photographers.<br />
DSLRs are affordable and everyone with a smartphone can take photos. The combination of accessibility, ease and sharing capabilities of smartphones are already causing a major change in the world of photography, forever. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/11/01/why-time-magazine-used-instagram-to-cover-hurricane-sandy/">Remember Time Magazine&#8217;s cover</a> a few weeks ago?</p>
<p>So, while it&#8217;s not dying, Photography is changing rapidly from an art, practiced by people who had the patience and money to invest in, to a more &#8216;personal and social&#8217; craft. Photos no longer need a purpose, whether it&#8217;s artistic, educational, scientific or journalistic. It has become a kind of a personal visual diary, with snappers documenting their daily life and sharing it to social media platforms. And the fact that others can interact and &#8220;like&#8221; each other&#8217;s photos enhances the illusion that anyone can become an instant celebrity. <em>I&#8217;ve got 500+ likes on my coffee shot, thus I&#8217;m famous.</em></p>
<p>But this proliferation of happy snappers is not killing photography either. Look at Youtube and how it democratized video. Anyone can create a video and make it go viral with over a million views. But video is still doing well and nobody&#8217;s worried about it.</p>
<p>We can also sit down and debate about &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; photography. But that&#8217;s a whole other topic and I&#8217;ll write about it later.</p>
<p>But for now, let&#8217;s just stop labeling things and Nostradamusing (<em>making up new words is fun</em>) or predicting the death of every new/old technology. It&#8217;s just called evolution (apologies if you&#8217;re a creationist) and the sad reality is: You either hop in and go with the flow, or be left out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an interesting infographic about this topic I found on the net. Feel free to share (and credit the original author).</p>

<p>Fall (or Autumn if you prefer) is a season I have very rarely experienced in my entire life. I grew up in the desert (<a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/category/uae/">UAE</a>), then the years I&#8217;ve spent in <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/category/france/">France</a>, I lived in Toulouse, away from woods and forests. And now I live in Thailand, with its tropical climate and 3 seasons (Hot, <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/05/zeuss-fury-and-lightning-in-chiang-mai-thailand/">Rain</a> and <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/03/missing-beautiful-sunsets-in-chiang-mai-thailand/">Smoke</a>)</p>
<p>So when I went on a holiday last month (October) to the <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/category/usa/">US</a>, it was really my first time experiencing the changing leaves and the beautiful colors during what now became my favorite season.</p>
<p>I was lucky I arrived at the best time, when the leaves were slowly starting to change. A few days later after we&#8217;ve left, most trees were already naked. I also am happy I got to wear extra layers of cloth with gloves and scarfs instead of just t-shirts and flip-flops like I do in Thailand.</p>
<p>I leave you with a few extra photos from this beautiful season. Don&#8217;t hesitate to share them or Pin them if you like!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As often, Fall is associated with Halloween and Thanksgiving so there are often decorations in front of houses with pumpkins and ghosts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first few days we arrived in Kentucky, the weather was really cold (about 2C/35F) with frost in the mornings. It was a nice &#8220;break&#8221; from Thailand&#8217;s hot weather.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An abandoned canoe near Rough River lake in the state of Kentucky. A lovely place to relax and enjoy the changing leaves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some more pumpkins and an old watercan in front of a cabin. Loving the old gritty texture!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something really amazing about the morning light (The Golden Hour). It&#8217;s even more accentuated during fall when all the leaves are already in different shades of warm colors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790 " title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" class="nopin" width="280" height="14" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves hanging in an old barn waiting to be fire-cured. Natural tobacco contains lethal amounts of nicotine and need to be cured before consumption. In Kentucky, farmers hang the tobacco leaves and set fires of hardwood inside the barn during a few weeks depending on the process and tobacco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A beautiful scenic road with amazing colors in Kentucky. I don&#8217;t like being in cars for too long but it was a pleasure admiring the view during this time of year.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even a boring empty field can become a beautiful subject if you look for different angles and the best light. This is one of my favorite shots of this trip. It was taken early morning, while I was crouching in a field covered with frost, waiting for the rising sun to get this beautiful golden light.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davidduchemin.com/">David DuChemin</a>, renowned Travel and Humanitarian photographer, describes landscape photographers quite accurately:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;<em>Anyone who gets up that early, or stays out that late, to make photographs, or hauls a heavy tripod up a hill </em><em>to do so, can’t possibly have all their marbles&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Landscape photography might seem like an easy field. You just point your camera towards a landscape and click. But that&#8217;s a big misconception. There are many factors that come into play to create a great landscape photo, that not only looks beautiful, but also creates a certain emotion.</p>
<p>Landscape photography requires patience, understanding of light, equipment, strength (to carry all these heavy bags) and passion. And David DuChemin does a great job guiding amateurs into crafting exceptional landscape shots in this beautiful ebook, for a ridiculously low price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1133873&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=175744&amp;cl=88199"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2989 " title="Portraits of Earth by David Duchemin" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/POE2s.jpg" alt="Portraits of Earth by David Duchemin" width="800" height="517" /></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790 " title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" class="nopin" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>The book is broken into different sections covering different elements of Landscape Photography. David starts by talking about his experience as a humanitarian photographer, trying to understand landscape photography, and ends up comparing it to taking portraits of the Earth. Just like portraits of people, you need to understand your subject and get closer, more intimate to be able to produce better photos.</p>
<p>The first part focuses on <em>Gear</em>. Of course, great gear doesn&#8217;t make a great shot, but taking advantage of different lenses, filters and a good strong tripod can help you achieve better results.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t specifically need high-end ultra-expensive gear anyway, but good understanding of filters can make a difference.</p>
<p>Next, David goes on talking about the importance of Light, which is the reason why photographers wake up early and go to bed late. The quality of light is going to play a major role in the way your photos <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2012/02/fiery-sunset-ii-thailand/">are going to look</a>. The following chapter covers composition and how to compose your photos to have the best impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1133873&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=175744&amp;cl=88199"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2990 " title="Portraits of Earth ebook by David DuChemin" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/POE3s.jpg" alt="Portraits of Earth ebook by David DuChemin" width="800" height="518" /></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790 " title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" class="nopin" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>The whole book has a light tone, without being too technical for beginners or amateurs. David is not known for his love of &#8220;rules&#8221; and obsession of equipment, so he keeps it simple, with tips and tricks on how to achieve interesting images using different techniques like light-painting. A minimum of knowledge in <a href="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/2011/05/how-to-fix-and-improve-your-photos-with-lightroom-tutorial/">post-processing</a> software is also required to take advantage of some tricks like exposure-blending or Black and White processing.</p>
<p>Not only the ebook is filled with valuable information, but you&#8217;ll end up coming back to it over and over just to get some inspiration from the high-quality inspiring photos contained within. Almost every page has gorgeous images illustrating his words, including valuable EXIF information in case you&#8217;d like to understand and emulate the shots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1133873&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=175744&amp;cl=88199"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2991 " title="Portraits of Earth ebook by David DuChemin" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/POE4s.jpg" alt="Portraits of Earth ebook by David DuChemin" width="800" height="516" /></a></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2790 " title="article_separator" src="http://www.canvas-of-light.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/article_separator.png" alt="" class="nopin" width="280" height="14" /></p>
<p>The eBook contains a collection of lessons learned throughout David&#8217;s journey that will be of benefit to all. I strongly recommend to grab a copy since they cost probably as much as a latte at Starbucks anyway.</p>
<p>As he claims in the introduction:  <strong><em>&#8220;It was learning to photograph landscapes where I found that a broader understanding of photography&#8221;.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So go ahead, make yourself a service and spend those $5 on Portraits of the Earth by David DuChemin. <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=1133873&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=175744&amp;cl=88199" target="ejejcsingle">Click here to view more details</a>.</p>
