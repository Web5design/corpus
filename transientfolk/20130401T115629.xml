			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I have been really struggling to write this post over the last few days. The passing of Jason Molina last week hit me a lot harder than I could have imagined. Listening to his music again reminds me how much I owe him for opening up my love of music and especially my love of a sad song.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/jason.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" title="jason" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/jason.jpg" alt="" width="352" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I can remember the first time I ever heard Jason sing, and it was a moment that changed my life.</p>
<p>I was on my computer looking on Audiogalaxy for some Shellac B sides and spotted a song called &#8220;Steve Albini&#8217;s Blues&#8221; by a band called Songs:Ohia. Steve Albini played heavy noise punk with his band Shellac, which is a lot of what I listened to at the time, and was what I was expecting when I put this song on to play.</p>
<p>That was the moment that changed everything. Expecting punk music I got something almost opposite, but something that awoke part of me deep inside. Similar to a good Shellac song, but multiplied tenfold, was the amount of emotion that came through in the song, as if this man was baring his soul for all to see. Stunned by the song I listened to it over and over again as I waited for my dial up modem to bring me more of this mysterious, gut wrenching sound, hoping that it wasn&#8217;t just a one off.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t, and the album I ended up with that night was &#8220;Didn&#8217;t It Rain&#8221;. This album will always be the most meaningful of his albums to me, as other people will hold his other albums most dear to them. I listened to this album over and over before actually going to the record store to try buy anything of his I could find, which was a big step for a broke university student, but searching as much as I could I couldn&#8217;t find anything in my town. How could the world not know about this?</p>
<p>As more songs where acquired, one way or another, my housemates and friends all fell in love with his music, especially when I got hold of &#8220;The Lioness&#8221; and &#8220;Electric Magnolia Co.&#8221; His music opened up a whole new appreciation for us of how beautiful a slow sad song could be, and how good that could make you feel. This is a statement that includes more people than just myself and in this case, possibly one of the only, I can speak with pure confidence of its truth.</p>
<p>Jason, you will be sorely missed. Not just by myself, but my whole community of friends that I am  part of, and by many many groups of people and friends that I am not. May you rest in peace.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Today I have the honour to bring you something that I have trouble finding a lot of the time, fantastic new Australian folk music.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/chris_gillespie_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-329" title="chris_gillespie_1" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/chris_gillespie_1-798x1024.jpg" alt="" width="479" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Listen While You Read</span></p>
<p>After a week of overdoing it at the <a href="http://www.woodfordfolkfestival.com/">Woodford Folk Festival</a> this year I wandered into a tent for a little shade and quiet music, only to be completely blown away by what I heard. This is quite a big thing after a week of non stop music for something like this to drag me out of my weary stupor.</p>
<p>Folk country like this can easily lose its Australian feel as voices can often drift towards the more neutral or even american accent. Chris has kept the most easy and unforced Australian accent in his music, which is something as someone who does sing a few songs myself I admire a lot.</p>
<p>This album has great instrumentation and great vocal harmonies. But it is Chris&#8217;s earnest lyrics and vocals that are the real stand out.</p>
<p>Once again a call out to any Australian folk fans, where can I find more great Australian music like this?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/OldAbout_clip_image002.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-330" title="OldAbout_clip_image002" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/OldAbout_clip_image002.jpg" alt="" width="246" height="246" /></a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It may seem like an odd choice at first, but I have to class Micah as one of the best song writers I have encountered in the last 10 years. Hard rock isn&#8217;t something you often associate with great lyric writing, but the Two Cow Garage front man&#8217;s solo efforts really let the quality shine through (and is a little sideways of hard rock anyway).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7003-1024x768.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-316" title="IMG_7003-1024x768" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_7003-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Listen While You Read</span></p>
<p>His voice may not hit your ears sweetly on first listen, but it is a unique voice that has a lot of depth and one that you will grow to love over a few listens.</p>
<p>As said this album is a bit different to his harder rock band Two Cow Garages work, but really most of it wouldn&#8217;t feel too out of place as a slower song on one of the others albums. Maybe just a little more melodic, and of course a little more acoustic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Micah_ImDeadSerious.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-321" title="Micah_ImDeadSerious" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Micah_ImDeadSerious-296x300.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go grab the CD <a href="http://micahschnabelmusic.bigcartel.com/product/i-m-dead-serious">here</a>. You can get the mp3s at amazon, but not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Im-Dead-Serious/dp/B007NVHK9I">here</a> in Australia, oh well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I think I need to brush up on by guitar and banjo playing and go join a string band. Well thats what goes through my head whenever I hear a good string band.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pmp.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-297" title="pmp" src="http://www.transientfolk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/pmp.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="347" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Listen While You Read</span></p>
<p>These guys have been gracing my car stereo speakers pretty heavily over the last couple of month and most likely will for more to come.</p>
<p>Great vocals really get these guys standing out, though admittedly they are a bit younger than a lot of string bands you hear from. Though maybe that is just a lasting impression I have from my less learned past that string bands were for retirees that needed something to do with their time.</p>
<p>I wish we had more bands like this in Australia, which is not where these guys are from at all, so I could just go down the pub and see some good music. Oh well I will just have to put up with greasy crooners singing bad covers like they are gods gift to an empty pub.</p>
<p>Sorry off topic there. And maybe I need to get out more.</p>

<p>Give this a listen, soak up the amazing harmonies.</p>

<p>I love the shirt above that says &#8220;if it aint country&#8221;, which only confuses me more.</p>
<p>I will try get back on track and start posting some good tunes up for your consideration a bit more regularly. Life just gets a little hectic sometimes, and I was never a very good blogger in the first place.</p>

<p>Their last album was excellent, and so far this one is a great follow on.</p>
<p>On first listen you may think every song sounds the same, but trust me listen to it again.</p>
<p>Great harmonies, great guitar and even greater banjo. Bring it on.</p>

<p>Yeah you know the drill, but after you have made your choice I not quite sure how you get the electricity to actually play the CDs, let alone find a stereo.</p>
<p>This album is one of my favourite of all time, with a couple of years living at the top of my personal listening list.</p>
<p>This is what modern folk music is about, great rhythms, excellent instrumentation and catchy yet interesting lyrics. Their other albums are also pretty good, from both before and after this, but this in my opinion if their best.</p>
<p>Every song on the album is unique, but every song is great, which is not something I can say for even most of my other favourite albums you find on these pages.</p>

<p>Go buy the CD <a href="http://www.peapodrecordings.com/artists/brown-bird">here</a>, and make sure you pack it during any sketchy sea voyages just in case.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Listen While You Read</span></p>
<p>The haunting melancholic music of The Ashtray Hearts albums has been some of my most played over the years. There is something about this soft folk pop music that is just both ethereal and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I waited many years hoping for a new CD, only  read somewhere that the singer moved to europe with his girlfriend. That said, it was a few years ago and I can&#8217;t seem to find any indication any more that they not still together or possibly even reunited, there is always hope.</p>

<p>They seem to describe themselves at &#8220;apartment music&#8221;? Not sure what that means, music that wont piss off the neighbours?</p>
<p>You can grab the CDs <a href="http://freeelection.org/ashtrayhearts/">here</a>.</p>
