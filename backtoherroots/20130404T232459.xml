				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16291" alt="groceries" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4140.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m sharing <a title="this week’s menu" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/04/04/this-weeks-menu-4/">my weekly menus</a>, a few folks have asked to see a sneak peek into what a grocery store trip for me is like. I did one of <a title="in my grocery cart" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/05/07/in-my-grocery-cart/">these posts</a> a while back, but a lot has changed since then—namely, we&#8217;ve moved since then! And, even though we moved out into the middle of nowhere, our somewhat-close-by grocery shopping options expanded lots when we got here. Within 45 minutes, we have a Whole Foods, Trader Joe&#8217;s and tons of other shopping options.</p>
<p>I do a &#8220;big&#8221; grocery shopping trip once every two weeks and then, weekly, we get a fresh infusion of milk, eggs and produce from <a title="all about our new csa" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/01/09/all-about-our-new-csa/">our CSA</a>. It may sound crazy, but because I only go grocery shopping a couple of times a month,  I usually hit up at least three (and sometimes more) different stores. There are just certain things that I like—and are much cheaper—at certain stores. Like, you can&#8217;t beat the prices on organic frozen veggies at Trader Joe&#8217;s, but their fresh produce is kinda iffy (at least at our location). But Whole Foods&#8217; fresh produce? To die for.</p>
<p>This shopping trip, I did the majority of my shopping at Whole Foods (my happy place) plus a little bit at both Trader Joe&#8217;s and my favorite supermarket, Meijer. Sometimes, for speciality items, I&#8217;ll also hit up our local health food store—Rainbow Blossom. But I didn&#8217;t have anything to grab there this trip. Unfortunately, as much as I&#8217;d love to support local business, the prices are so high there that I just can&#8217;t justify doing a lot of shopping there. But it is great for local goodies.</p>
<p>Alright, onto what I did get this trip.</p>
<h3>Produce</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16292" alt="IMG_4144" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4144.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Like I said, Whole Foods is my absolute favorite spot for produce. I can almost always guarantee everything I need will be in-stock, high-quality and organic. It&#8217;s definitely a little more pricey, but it&#8217;s worth it for me. Here&#8217;s what I got in the Whole Foods produce section. Everything is organic unless otherwise noted.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Romaine</span></li>
<li>Carrots—a big bag! We eat carrots all the time.</li>
<li>Parsley</li>
<li>Sliced Mushrooms</li>
<li>Strawberries—Whole Foods is pretty much the only place I can find organic berries in the area.</li>
<li>Cucumbers</li>
<li>Blueberries</li>
<li>Cauliflower–they were out of organic, so this is conventional.</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Green Peppers</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16293" alt="IMG_4146" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4146.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I popped over to Trader Joe&#8217;s (it&#8217;s literally within walking distance to Whole Foods) and picked up a few produce items that I knew I could count on.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Pears—I swear, this is the best deal on pears on the planet. $3 for a whole bag of organic pears? Some places, you pay $3 for one pear! These are the perfect little guys for lunches and snacks.</span></li>
<li>Apples—Same deal for the apples. Cheapest place to buy small organic apples. Perfect for snacking and lunching.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16294" alt="IMG_4148" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4148.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy a ton of produce at Meijer. They have an incredible produce section—but the vast majority of it is conventional. Here is what I got there.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Potatoes—for some reason, I never buy organic potatoes. I&#8217;m not sure why? I guess just out of habit. We&#8217;re planting a ton of potatoes in the garden this year, so maybe this will be one of the last bags I have to buy for a while.</span></li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Bananas—I couldn&#8217;t find a single organic banana at any of the stores! Apparently the Chiquita banana lady decided to skip Louisville this week. So I got conventional instead. About 2/3 of these will go in the freezer for smoothies.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16295" alt="IMG_4150" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4150.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I also pick up our CSA on grocery shopping days. In our produce box this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Ramps</span></li>
<li>Sweet Potato</li>
<li>Cilantro</li>
<li>Radish Microgreens</li>
<li>Kohlrabi</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meat &amp; Dairy</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16296" alt="IMG_4153" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4153.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We get the majority of our meat and dairy from our CSA and Trader Joe&#8217;s, but I did pick up a few things at Whole Foods:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Butter</span></li>
<li>Almond Milk Yogurt—not really dairy, but I&#8217;ve been meaning to try this.</li>
<li>Shrimp—I love, love, love the scoop-your-own shrimp at Whole Foods. We only needed a little bit! Perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16297" alt="IMG_4159" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4159.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to beat the prices on cheese and meat products at Trader Joe&#8217;s. Here&#8217;s what I got:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Sliced Turkey</span></li>
<li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
<li>Feta</li>
<li>Bacon Pieces—We hardly ever eat full slices of bacon—we use it much more for flavor in dishes—so these ends and pieces are such a great deal. This package is about $3 cheaper than whole slices. Woohoo!</li>
<li>Plain Yogurt</li>
<li>Andouille Chicken Sausage</li>
<li>Parmesan</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="IMG_4160" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4160.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>From our CSA, we get this each week:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Eggs—we go through two dozen eggs in a week </span><span style="line-height: 13px;">no problem. We love eggs!</span></li>
<li>Skim Milk—for drinking.</li>
<li>2% Milk—for making kefir or yogurt.</li>
<li>Cheeses—we get two random cheeses each week in our CSA, this week it was Monterey Jack and Mozzarella</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bulk</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16299" alt="bulk" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4162.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Whole Foods also has the best bulk section! In bulk, I got:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Kidney Beans</span></li>
<li>Raw Cashews</li>
<li>Chia Seeds</li>
<li>Sunflower Seeds</li>
<li>Medjool Dates</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grocery</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16300" alt="IMG_4166" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4166.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>For some items, Whole Foods totally lives up to the &#8220;Whole Paycheck&#8221; moniker, but I think there are some really good deals to be had, too.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Cereal</span></li>
<li>Whole wheat and white flour—this is from a local mill and it&#8217;s awesome!</li>
<li>Freekeh—because <a href="http://www.oatmealafterspinning.com" target="_blank">Oatmeal Lauren</a> (&lt;3) told me I had to try it.</li>
<li>Beer—we like to snag some new fun beer to try when we go shopping.</li>
<li>Unscented Dr. Bronner&#8217;s—You can&#8217;t beat the Dr. Bronner&#8217;s price at Whole Foods. We use this for everything—hand soap, body wash, laundry detergent, dish soap.</li>
<li>Pasta</li>
<li>Rye Crisps</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16301" alt="IMG_4167" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4167.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to beat Trader Joe&#8217;s for staples. The price is right and the quality is great! A lot of times their speciality items might not be in stock, but you can pretty much always guarantee they&#8217;ll have the standards.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Olive Oil Cooking Spray</span></li>
<li>Chicken Broth</li>
<li>Peanut Butter</li>
<li>Frozen Green Beans</li>
<li>Frozen Broccoli</li>
<li>Hamburger Buns</li>
<li>Farro</li>
<li>Marinara Sauce</li>
<li>Tortillas</li>
<li>Pitas</li>
<li>Tuna</li>
<li>Olive Oil</li>
<li>Ketchup</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16302" alt="IMG_4170" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4170.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I hit up Meijer for more standard staples.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Almond Milk—Meijer is definitely the cheapest place to buy unsweetened almond milk. I can get a big container of it for the price of one small container at Whole Foods (and TJs doesn&#8217;t sell unsweetened almond milk).</span></li>
<li>Raisins—the best raisins in the whole wide world. If you can find these, BUY THEM.</li>
<li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
<li>Mrs. Dash Italian—Adds so much flavor to salads and pizza.</li>
<li>Tortilla Chips—I&#8217;d love to buy organic/natural ones instead, but I can&#8217;t find any natural scoops! And I love the scoops!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16303" alt="IMG_4172" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4172.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We get some standard grocery staples in our CSA each week too:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Whole Wheat Fettuccine—we get this each week. It&#8217;s such a nice option for a quick dinner.</span></li>
<li>Whole Wheat Pizza Dough—we get this each week, too. It&#8217;s so much quicker and easier to just defrost this dough ball for pizza night. And it&#8217;s delicious and local!</li>
<li>Black Bean Hummus—they threw this in as a bonus this week! Yum!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now ready for the grand total? All together I spent:</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 24pt;">$295.22</strong></p>
<p>That includes my receipts from Whole Foods, Trader Joe&#8217;s and Meijer, plus this week&#8217;s CSA payment. We&#8217;ll pay another $50~ or so next week for our next CSA box. And then, in a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ll go out again for another largeish shopping trip (although, probably not as big as this).</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t eat out (really, ever), so this is enough food to cover us for every meal for the next two weeks, at least. That boils down to about $3.50 per meal per person not including snacks or our next CSA box.</p>
<p>In total, we try to keep our grocery budget around $600-$700 a month, but sometimes go over that, and we try not to worry too much about it. For the longest time, we tried to wedge our grocery budget into a smaller number—like $300-$400 a month. But we decided a while back that good, local, organic food was important to us, and we were willing to pump more money into it. I know folks tend to look at their grocery budget as the first place to cut when they need to tighten their belt, but for us, getting good food is just as important as paying the mortgage and the electricity bill. We&#8217;ll give up cable (oh no!) and our iPhones (double oh no!) before we cut back on our grocery budget. My Papaw always said that if you want to know what&#8217;s important to a person, just look where they spend their money. And if someone looked at our bank account, they&#8217;d see that food is <em>definitely</em> important to us.</p>
<h3 class="question">What&#8217;s your favorite place to grocery shop? How much do you tend to spend on groceries each month?</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been so swamped with work stuff, that I&#8217;ve been pretty M.I.A. in the kitchen lately—thus the reason why the only recipe on the blog this week is one that takes about <a title="super simple raw kale salad" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/04/02/super-simple-raw-kale-salad/" target="_blank">three minutes</a> to put together. But things are (hopefully) going to die down a bit this week and I&#8217;m jonesin&#8217; to get back into the kitchen and make some new creations! So I&#8217;ve put a lot of new ideas into the menu for dinners this week.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s official! I made it all through Lent without touching the sweet stuff, woohoo! I&#8217;m proud of making it sugar-free for six weeks, but I am so excited sugar is back in my diet. If I was more organized, I would have taken my WIAW pictures this week of my first day back on the juice—Easter day. But I totally forgot. Instead, you get a run-of-the-mill Monday. Onto the eats&#8230;</p>

<p>My breakfast was a little bit of a change of pace from my normal, beloved yogurt bowl. I looked in the fridge and saw lots of yummy Easter dinner leftovers that were just asking to be made into an omelet! I had an omelet with ham, roasted asparagus, dill, and swiss cheese. On the side, I had an apple.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16269" alt="smoothie" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4100.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>After my morning workout, I refueled with a smoothie. In the mix: almond milk, a banana, frozen blueberries, protein powder, chia seeds and a touch of honey.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16270" alt="lunch salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4127.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>You already saw my lunch, yesterday. <a title="super simple raw kale salad" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/04/02/super-simple-raw-kale-salad/">Simple kale salad</a>, topped with roasted beets and asparagus. On the side, I heated up a small bowl of scalloped potatoes leftover from Easter. Also, the triumphant return of lunch dessert! I&#8217;ve been hoarding these truffles in the freezer for a month waiting for Lent to be over. This one is a dark chocolate balsamic vinegar truffle. So. Good.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16271" alt="cereal" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4129.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>Craig was working late, so dinner was going to be late. To hold myself over, I had a small bowl of shredded wheat with raisins and almond milk in the afternoon.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16272" alt="dinner sloppy joes potatoes pickles" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4136.jpg" width="800" height="530" />
<p>Our late dinner was a good one! <a title="lentil sloppy joes" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2011/07/26/lentil-sloppy-joes/">Lentil sloppy joes</a> (open-face style, topped with mustard and pickles) with roasted potato wedges and pickles on the side.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16273" alt="dessert cookies" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4139.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>Dessert was two leftover lemon cookies and another one of those truffles—this time, white wine dark chocolate. Yum!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16257" alt="kale salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4110.jpg" width="800" height="992" /></p>
<p>Kale is pretty much the poster child for healthy eating, isn&#8217;t it? Before I cleaned up my diet, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d ever had a single bite of kale. But slowly I opened up my world to this dark, leafy green. I started by blending it into green smoothies. And then baking it into kale chips. And then I started sautéing it as a side dish. And now, I&#8217;ve reached 100% kale love, because I&#8217;m eating it raw, kids!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16258" alt="kale salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4113.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Even to the hardiest of veggieaholics, I know raw kale can sound a little&#8230;kale-y. And it is, but by massaging the world&#8217;s simplest dressing (seriously, it&#8217;s so easy) into the leaves for a few minutes, the kale softens both in texture and flavor. It&#8217;s incredible how a few minutes of massaging completely relaxes the kale. It almost turns it into an entirely new veggie.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16259" alt="kale salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4116.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t kidding about the whole world&#8217;s-easiest-dressing part, either. This avocado-based dressing is so easy you just mix it up right in the bowl with the kale. It&#8217;s also oil free and only has four ingredients (two of which are salt and pepper). The flavors are so bright and creamy, and it pairs so beautifully with the earthy kale.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda in love with this salad. Not only is it pretty much the cleanest, healthiest, simplest salad on the planet, but it also comes together so quickly that it&#8217;s a perfect way to inject some serious nutrition into any lunch or dinner—even on a weeknight. It also works as a beautiful base for lots of other delicious toppings—I topped mine with leftover roasted beets and asparagus. Yum!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16261" alt="kale salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4128.jpg" width="800" height="598" /></p>
<p>Of course, kale really is one of the world&#8217;s healthiest foods. Did you know a one cup serving of kale has 1327% of your daily vitamin K intake (that&#8217;s no typo, friends)? Plus 354% of your vitamin A and 88% of your vitamin C! Wowzers. <a href="http://www.eatmorekale.com/" target="_blank">Eat more kale</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. I don&#8217;t like April Fools&#8217; Day. Not at all. Not one bit. I just not a fan of pranks or practical jokes in general. Just not my thing. Thankfully, Craig isn&#8217;t into them either, so we&#8217;re a prank-free household.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16250" alt="me babyface lake" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fr_3518_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>2. I did a &#8220;real&#8221; workout in the gym yesterday for the first time in weeks. It is not a coincidence that this workout also happened to fall the day after I started eating sugar again. Balance!<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16251" alt="treadmill" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fr_3525_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>3. I am the world&#8217;s worst procrastinator. In fact, it&#8217;s so bad that I pretty much can only work now if I&#8217;m under pressure. Just this past week, I tried getting ahead of the curve by working on a project early—no inspiration. For days, totally empty. But as soon as the deadline started to get closer? BINGO. Inspired.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16145" alt="desk computer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_40051.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>4. When I go grocery shopping each week, afterward, I go to a coffee shop across the street from the grocery store, get a cup of tea and sit there in their big comfy chairs by the fireplace and read for an hour. It reminds me of when I used to go sit in the big comfy chairs in the student union in college to study. It feels so insanely decadent, but it&#8217;s one of my favorite times of the week.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16249" alt="coffee shop fire" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fr_3405_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>5. I have a ton to do right now, but instead of doing it yesterday, I spent the entire afternoon watching an unidentified-number of Ugly Betty episodes. See #3.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16252" alt="ugly betty computer laptop" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fr_3527_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>

<p>A few folks have been asking me with April&#8217;s wellness calendar was going to be up, so I went ahead and worked on it to get it up a few days early for you guys! There are some really fun items in this one (I particularly like day #2—yum!) so I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never downloaded one of my wellness calendars before, these little guys have a daily wellness-focused challenge. When you put them all together, you&#8217;ve got yourself a great start to a healthy month! I like to believe that a healthy lifestyle is built off of a lot of small, daily healthy decisions, and this calendar helps you get there. Download the PDF, print it out and hang it up so you can see it daily.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16227" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4068.jpg" width="800" height="1074" /></p>
<p>I love cheese. Like, epic-novel-is-written-about-it-and-spends-120-weeks-on-the-bestseller&#8217;s-list kind of love. But I&#8217;m starting to notice that my &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221; mantra seems to apply to everything in my life except for cheese (and, at a higher level, dairy in general). It seems I&#8217;ve given my cheese-doling hand freedom to shower as much yummy, cheesy goodness as I want on every single meal. Which pretty much is the complete opposite of &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m trying to cut back a little bit on my cheese and dairy consumption. I&#8217;m not a big fan of cutting out entire food groups, but I&#8217;m also not a big fan of abusing entire food groups (well, maybe fruits and veggies), and my cheese, yogurt, milk, and butter consumption is bordering on abuse. The moment I knew I had a problem? When our cheese drawer in our fridge—which is huge, by the way—wouldn&#8217;t close because it was overflowing with cheese.</p>
<p>I guess &#8220;cutting back&#8221; isn&#8217;t even the right way of putting it, more than anything, I&#8217;m forcing myself to be aware of the amount of cheese and dairy I&#8217;m consuming. And now that my cheese-sight has been opened, I can see how I probably didn&#8217;t need to put 1/2 cup of feta in my omelette the other morning—a tablespoon or two would have been enough. I&#8217;m mostly just wanting to inch the cheese and dairy lever slowly back to the moderate-consumption speed.</p>

<p>One of the ways to help me get through cheese withdrawal (I swear, it&#8217;s muscle memory to reach over to that cheese drawer and grab a big handful of something to toss on&#8230;everything) is to experiment with other flavors–especially on dishes that I&#8217;d usually smother in cheese—like these fajitas. Before I was forcing myself to be aware of my dairy consumption, I&#8217;d probably put 1/3 cup of&nbsp;shredded&nbsp;cheddar or Monterey jack onto two of these guys, plus four tablespoons of sour cream. That&#8217;s an extra 275 calories—and not a whole heck of a lot of extra nutrients. I get plenty of protein and calcium from other sources, so my dairy consumption is mostly just for taste reasons.</p>
<p>So this time, instead of covering up my food with dairy, I made sure the filling of the fajitas was incredibly flavorful and I had lots of yummy, non-dairy toppings to throw on.</p>
<p><img alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4060.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>This is maybe one of the best Mexican-flavored dishes I&#8217;ve ever made! I marinated the portabellas in a spicy chile and lime sauce and then sautéed those and some sweet peppers and onions and packed them inside my <a title="whole wheat coconut tortillas" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/27/whole-wheat-coconut-tortillas/">whole grain coconut tortillas</a>. And then I set out a fajita &#8220;bar&#8221; with chopped cilantro, fresh guacamole, salsa, lime wedges and (unpictured) black beans and plain Greek yogurt. I did cave and eventually put a couple of tablespoons of Greek yogurt on mine, but honestly, it wasn&#8217;t necessary—at all. All the other flavors worked so well together, that I should have just eaten it 100% dairy-free and saved the calories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to break old habits. I want to save those dairy calories for when the dish really needs that flavor (like the scalloped potatoes I plan on making for Easter dinner this weekend) not just use it all willy-nilly. When I&#8217;m trying to lose weight, I like to think of calories as money in my bank account. And when I spend those calories on something, I want to try to get as much nutrient and flavor bang for my calorie buck. I wouldn&#8217;t spend $275 on a scarf that I just sorta like that doesn&#8217;t add much to my wardrobe. So why would I spent 275 calories on something that doesn&#8217;t add much to the dish?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16228" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4075.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>These fajitas are definitely going into regular rotation in our house. Not only were they delicious for dinner, but the leftovers made for one heck of an exciting lunch salad. Just throw the leftover sautéed peppers and mushrooms on top of some lettuce with the leftover guacamole, salsa, cilantro and black beans—flavor city!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h4 id="ingr_header">Ingredients</h4>
<ul id="ingr"></ul>
<h5>For the Marinade</h5>
<ul id="ingr">
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>4 large portabella mushroom caps, sliced thinly</li>
</ul>
<h5>For the Fajitas</h5>
<ul id="ingr">
<li>8 whole wheat tortillas</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
<li>1 large yellow bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
<li>1 large onion, sliced thinly</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
<li>Toppings such as guacamole, salsa, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, black beans, cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="instructions">
<h4 id="inst_header">Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200°.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients—minus the mushrooms—until well-combined. Add in the mushroom slices and toss to coat. I found that using my hands is the best way to keep the mushrooms from breaking. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. While mushrooms are marinating, you can prepare your toppings bar.</li>
<li>Once mushrooms are marinated, saute in a large skillet over medium heat until they are very tender and have released most of their liquid—about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>While the mushrooms cook, wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and place in preheated oven to warm.</li>
<li>In a second skillet, over medium heat, heat the remaining olive oil. Add in the pepper and onions slices and cook until very tender—about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>To assemble fajitas, place a few mushroom slices and a few pepper and onions slices in the middle of each tortilla. Top with desired toppings.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16198" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4079.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Tortillas are one of those things that I&#8217;ve always meant to make, but never got around to. There are so many delicious, relatively healthy, yummy options in the grocery store, that it was always hard to justify the time to make them.</p>
<p>What finally motivated me to take the plunge and make them myself? Flavored tortillas! I had this idea of a coconut tortilla that would work well with savory, spicy flavors (like the portabella fajitas I&#8217;m sharing with you tomorrow) or more sweet dishes (like these <a title="pear and cheddar breakfast quesadillas" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/01/03/pear-and-cheddar-breakfast-quesadillas/">pear and cheddar quesadillas</a>). So I took to the kitchen and got to working.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16204" alt="mixer kitchen" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3937.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The ingredient list is pretty short for these guys, which always makes me happy. All you need is whole wheat flour, salt, coconut oil and water. Easy, peasy!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16200" alt="ingredients" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3926.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I mixed my tortilla dough up in my mixer, but you can just as easily do this by hand. In the mixer goes 2-1/3 cups of whole wheat flour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16201" alt="mixer flour" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3932.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Plus 1 teaspoon of sea salt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16202" alt="sea salt mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3933.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>And 1/3 cup coconut oil. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so to get it so liquidy, I just put the jar in the microwave for a few seconds until it was melted enough to pour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16203" alt="coconut oil mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3936.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Then, with the dough hook attached, let the mixer run at medium speed until the dough is crumbly and the oil is well-distributed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16205" alt="dough mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3939.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Then, slowly stream in 1 cup of hot water with the mixer running at medium speed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16206" alt="water mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3943.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>You may need to scrape the sides down as you go. The resulting dough will be pretty wet and sticky (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll add more flour when we knead).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16207" alt="tortilla dough" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3945.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Dump the dough out on a well-floured work surface and kneed—adding up to an extra 1/3 cup of flour as need—until the dough is smooth and soft. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. I used a kitchen scale to do this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16208" alt="scale dough" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3947.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Roll each piece into a ball, flatten slightly, and then put on a baking sheet. Cover the sheet with plastic wrap or a barely-damp kitchen towel and let rest at room temperature for at least an hour. The longer these rest, the softer and more bend-able they will be at the end.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16209" alt="tortilla balls" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3948.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Once the dough has rested, preheat a cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. While the skillet is heating, roll out one of the dough balls on a lightly-floured surface until it&#8217;s about 8&#8243;-10&#8243; in diameter and very, very thin. You want to err on the side of it being too thin, because if it&#8217;s too thick, it&#8217;ll crack when you go to roll them later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16210" alt="rolling pin tortilla" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3989.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Toss the tortilla in the skillet. I didn&#8217;t use any sort of oil or fat, because my cast iron skillet is pretty non-stick, but if you prefer, you can put a touch of coconut oil in the skillet before each tortilla.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16211" alt="tortilla skillet" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3990.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>While your tortilla cooks, you can start working on rolling out your next tortilla. The tortilla in the skillet will start to bubble and turn solid-looking (kinda like a pancake). That&#8217;s when you know it&#8217;s ready to flip! It took me 4-5 minutes to get to this point.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16212" alt="tortilla skillet" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3995.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Cook the tortilla for another minute or two on the other side and then, it&#8217;s finished!</p>
<p>Just to keep them soft, I stashed them in a closed zip-top bag while they were still warm. Because of the whole wheat flour, these tend to get a bit hard-to-roll when they are cold, so the heat and the steam keeps them soft and pliable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16213" alt="tortillas bag" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3997.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It took me about 30 minutes to roll out and cook all the tortillas—it definitely isn&#8217;t a super speedy process. But the flavor? Oh my gosh, the flavor is <strong>so</strong> worth it! These are hearty and slightly-sweet with just a tiny touch of coconut-flavor. And they freeze beautifully! Next time, I plan on doubling or tripling the recipe and batch cooking a bunch for the freezer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16197" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4077.jpg" width="800" height="559" /></p>
<p>They also make insanely-delicious baked tortilla chips! I used a pizza cutter to slice them into triangles and popped them on a baking sheet under the broiler for a few minutes until the were nice and crispy. They added such a fun and interesting sweet, cocount-y flavor to guacamole and salsa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16187" alt="guacamole chips" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4049.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Of course, if you aren&#8217;t big on coconut, you can swap out the coconut oil for any other oil that makes you happy, but I definitely recommend trying it out with the coconut oil. So. Good. And so good for you! Yay for short ingredient lists, whole grains and healthy fats!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16196" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4052.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Stay tuned tomorrow for those portabella fajitas I promised! They come together in a flash and are so flavorful, easy and perfect for a Meatless Monday meal.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15904" alt="wiaw header" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3786.jpg" width="800" height="548" /></p>
<p>One of the things that took me a while to learn with healthy eating is that it isn&#8217;t about all-or-nothing. Sometimes you&#8217;re not going to eat the healthiest. Sometimes you&#8217;re going to eat really healthy. And, in fact, I kinda feel like that yin-and-yang diet is the healthiest kind of all. It&#8217;s the kind of diet that lets you enjoy cookies at Christmas and zucchini in the summer. Usually it&#8217;s a pretty organic process, but sometimes, I find myself playing catch-up from a day of not-so-stellar eating. Take Monday for example, I was swamped and when I&#8217;m swamped, I do a terrible job at making and eating food—not eating much is one of my stress reactions. Not really picture of health, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>So, on Tuesday, when things had settled down a bit, I made up for my day of lack-luster eating. I made sure to pack in tons of fresh fruit, veggies and whole grains and really feed my body well! Onto the eats&#8230;</p>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16184" alt="breakfast cereal fruit" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4008.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>Craig did a good job of setting me on the right path and brought me a yummy bowl of Grape Nuts, almond milk and lots of fruit for breakfast. We got a giant box of Grape Nuts at Costco a few weeks back, and I am definitely doing my part to put a dent in it. Yum!</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16185" alt="lunch salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4044.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>For lunch, I dumped out two of my <a title="how i prep food for the week" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/21/how-i-prep-food-for-the-week/">salads-in-a-jar</a>&nbsp;and then topped them with some sliced cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, and some sprouted lentils. In the original jar was dressing, quinoa, red onions, celery, blue cheese, and romaine. I am <strong>so</strong> not usually a salad person, but this was delicious and filling!</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16186" alt="banana dates" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4047.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>I was craving something sweet after lunch, so I had a banana and two dates as my lunch dessert.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16187" alt="guacamole chips" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4049.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>In the afternoon, I whipped up a batch of guacamole to have with dinner, and of course, had to sample some myself with some homemade baked whole grain coconut tortilla chips. That recipe is coming your way this afternoon. Yum!</p>

<p>Of course, I had more guacamole with dinner—portabella fajitas! These were incredible. So yummy! And the recipe will be coming your way later in the week. Inside the tortillas are marinated portabella, sautéed peppers and onions, guacamole, salsa, black beans, Greek yogurt and cilantro. Yum!</p>

<p>As always, big thanks go out to Jenn at <a href="http://www.peasandcrayons.com/" target="_blank">Peas and Crayons </a>for hosting this fun food-filled party we have every week. If you guys haven&#8217;t clicked over to the main WIAW post yet, you should! There are so many fun eats and so many new blogs to discover. You could lose a handful of hours just discovering new friends and foods!</p>
