<p>A few folks have been asking me with April&#8217;s wellness calendar was going to be up, so I went ahead and worked on it to get it up a few days early for you guys! There are some really fun items in this one (I particularly like day #2—yum!) so I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never downloaded one of my wellness calendars before, these little guys have a daily wellness-focused challenge. When you put them all together, you&#8217;ve got yourself a great start to a healthy month! I like to believe that a healthy lifestyle is built off of a lot of small, daily healthy decisions, and this calendar helps you get there. Download the PDF, print it out and hang it up so you can see it daily.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16227" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4068.jpg" width="800" height="1074" /></p>
<p>I love cheese. Like, epic-novel-is-written-about-it-and-spends-120-weeks-on-the-bestseller&#8217;s-list kind of love. But I&#8217;m starting to notice that my &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221; mantra seems to apply to everything in my life except for cheese (and, at a higher level, dairy in general). It seems I&#8217;ve given my cheese-doling hand freedom to shower as much yummy, cheesy goodness as I want on every single meal. Which pretty much is the complete opposite of &#8220;everything in moderation&#8221;.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m trying to cut back a little bit on my cheese and dairy consumption. I&#8217;m not a big fan of cutting out entire food groups, but I&#8217;m also not a big fan of abusing entire food groups (well, maybe fruits and veggies), and my cheese, yogurt, milk, and butter consumption is bordering on abuse. The moment I knew I had a problem? When our cheese drawer in our fridge—which is huge, by the way—wouldn&#8217;t close because it was overflowing with cheese.</p>
<p>I guess &#8220;cutting back&#8221; isn&#8217;t even the right way of putting it, more than anything, I&#8217;m forcing myself to be aware of the amount of cheese and dairy I&#8217;m consuming. And now that my cheese-sight has been opened, I can see how I probably didn&#8217;t need to put 1/2 cup of feta in my omelette the other morning—a tablespoon or two would have been enough. I&#8217;m mostly just wanting to inch the cheese and dairy lever slowly back to the moderate-consumption speed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16224" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4055.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>One of the ways to help me get through cheese withdrawal (I swear, it&#8217;s muscle memory to reach over to that cheese drawer and grab a big handful of something to toss on&#8230;everything) is to experiment with other flavors–especially on dishes that I&#8217;d usually smother in cheese—like these fajitas. Before I was forcing myself to be aware of my dairy consumption, I&#8217;d probably put 1/3 cup of&nbsp;shredded&nbsp;cheddar or Monterey jack onto two of these guys, plus four tablespoons of sour cream. That&#8217;s an extra 275 calories—and not a whole heck of a lot of extra nutrients. I get plenty of protein and calcium from other sources, so my dairy consumption is mostly just for taste reasons.</p>
<p>So this time, instead of covering up my food with dairy, I made sure the filling of the fajitas was incredibly flavorful and I had lots of yummy, non-dairy toppings to throw on.</p>
<p><img alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4060.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>This is maybe one of the best Mexican-flavored dishes I&#8217;ve ever made! I marinated the portabellas in a spicy chile and lime sauce and then sautéed those and some sweet peppers and onions and packed them inside my <a title="whole wheat coconut tortillas" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/27/whole-wheat-coconut-tortillas/">whole grain coconut tortillas</a>. And then I set out a fajita &#8220;bar&#8221; with chopped cilantro, fresh guacamole, salsa, lime wedges and (unpictured) black beans and plain Greek yogurt. I did cave and eventually put a couple of tablespoons of Greek yogurt on mine, but honestly, it wasn&#8217;t necessary—at all. All the other flavors worked so well together, that I should have just eaten it 100% dairy-free and saved the calories.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to break old habits. I want to save those dairy calories for when the dish really needs that flavor (like the scalloped potatoes I plan on making for Easter dinner this weekend) not just use it all willy-nilly. When I&#8217;m trying to lose weight, I like to think of calories as money in my bank account. And when I spend those calories on something, I want to try to get as much nutrient and flavor bang for my calorie buck. I wouldn&#8217;t spend $275 on a scarf that I just sorta like that doesn&#8217;t add much to my wardrobe. So why would I spent 275 calories on something that doesn&#8217;t add much to the dish?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16228" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4075.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>These fajitas are definitely going into regular rotation in our house. Not only were they delicious for dinner, but the leftovers made for one heck of an exciting lunch salad. Just throw the leftover sautéed peppers and mushrooms on top of some lettuce with the leftover guacamole, salsa, cilantro and black beans—flavor city!</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h4 id="ingr_header">Ingredients</h4>
<ul id="ingr"></ul>
<h5>For the Marinade</h5>
<ul id="ingr">
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>4 large portabella mushroom caps, sliced thinly</li>

<h5>For the Fajitas</h5>
<ul id="ingr">
<li>8 whole wheat tortillas</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
<li>1 large yellow bell pepper, sliced thinly</li>
<li>1 large onion, sliced thinly</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
<li>Toppings such as guacamole, salsa, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, black beans, cheese, sour cream, chopped onions, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="instructions">
<h4 id="inst_header">Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 200°.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the marinade ingredients—minus the mushrooms—until well-combined. Add in the mushroom slices and toss to coat. I found that using my hands is the best way to keep the mushrooms from breaking. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes. While mushrooms are marinating, you can prepare your toppings bar.</li>
<li>Once mushrooms are marinated, saute in a large skillet over medium heat until they are very tender and have released most of their liquid—about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>While the mushrooms cook, wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and place in preheated oven to warm.</li>
<li>In a second skillet, over medium heat, heat the remaining olive oil. Add in the pepper and onions slices and cook until very tender—about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>To assemble fajitas, place a few mushroom slices and a few pepper and onions slices in the middle of each tortilla. Top with desired toppings.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Nutritional Info</h4>
<p>Serving size: 2 fajitas. Servings per recipe: 4. Nutritional info does not include toppings.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16198" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4079.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Tortillas are one of those things that I&#8217;ve always meant to make, but never got around to. There are so many delicious, relatively healthy, yummy options in the grocery store, that it was always hard to justify the time to make them.</p>
<p>What finally motivated me to take the plunge and make them myself? Flavored tortillas! I had this idea of a coconut tortilla that would work well with savory, spicy flavors (like the portabella fajitas I&#8217;m sharing with you tomorrow) or more sweet dishes (like these <a title="pear and cheddar breakfast quesadillas" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/01/03/pear-and-cheddar-breakfast-quesadillas/">pear and cheddar quesadillas</a>). So I took to the kitchen and got to working.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16204" alt="mixer kitchen" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3937.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The ingredient list is pretty short for these guys, which always makes me happy. All you need is whole wheat flour, salt, coconut oil and water. Easy, peasy!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16200" alt="ingredients" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3926.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I mixed my tortilla dough up in my mixer, but you can just as easily do this by hand. In the mixer goes 2-1/3 cups of whole wheat flour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16201" alt="mixer flour" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3932.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Plus 1 teaspoon of sea salt.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16202" alt="sea salt mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3933.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>And 1/3 cup coconut oil. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature, so to get it so liquidy, I just put the jar in the microwave for a few seconds until it was melted enough to pour.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16203" alt="coconut oil mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3936.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Then, with the dough hook attached, let the mixer run at medium speed until the dough is crumbly and the oil is well-distributed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16205" alt="dough mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3939.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Then, slowly stream in 1 cup of hot water with the mixer running at medium speed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16206" alt="water mixer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3943.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>You may need to scrape the sides down as you go. The resulting dough will be pretty wet and sticky (don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll add more flour when we knead).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16207" alt="tortilla dough" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3945.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Dump the dough out on a well-floured work surface and kneed—adding up to an extra 1/3 cup of flour as need—until the dough is smooth and soft. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. I used a kitchen scale to do this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16208" alt="scale dough" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3947.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Roll each piece into a ball, flatten slightly, and then put on a baking sheet. Cover the sheet with plastic wrap or a barely-damp kitchen towel and let rest at room temperature for at least an hour. The longer these rest, the softer and more bend-able they will be at the end.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16209" alt="tortilla balls" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3948.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Once the dough has rested, preheat a cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. While the skillet is heating, roll out one of the dough balls on a lightly-floured surface until it&#8217;s about 8&#8243;-10&#8243; in diameter and very, very thin. You want to err on the side of it being too thin, because if it&#8217;s too thick, it&#8217;ll crack when you go to roll them later.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16210" alt="rolling pin tortilla" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3989.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Toss the tortilla in the skillet. I didn&#8217;t use any sort of oil or fat, because my cast iron skillet is pretty non-stick, but if you prefer, you can put a touch of coconut oil in the skillet before each tortilla.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16211" alt="tortilla skillet" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3990.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>While your tortilla cooks, you can start working on rolling out your next tortilla. The tortilla in the skillet will start to bubble and turn solid-looking (kinda like a pancake). That&#8217;s when you know it&#8217;s ready to flip! It took me 4-5 minutes to get to this point.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16212" alt="tortilla skillet" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3995.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Cook the tortilla for another minute or two on the other side and then, it&#8217;s finished!</p>
<p>Just to keep them soft, I stashed them in a closed zip-top bag while they were still warm. Because of the whole wheat flour, these tend to get a bit hard-to-roll when they are cold, so the heat and the steam keeps them soft and pliable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16213" alt="tortillas bag" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3997.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It took me about 30 minutes to roll out and cook all the tortillas—it definitely isn&#8217;t a super speedy process. But the flavor? Oh my gosh, the flavor is <strong>so</strong> worth it! These are hearty and slightly-sweet with just a tiny touch of coconut-flavor. And they freeze beautifully! Next time, I plan on doubling or tripling the recipe and batch cooking a bunch for the freezer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16197" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4077.jpg" width="800" height="559" /></p>
<p>They also make insanely-delicious baked tortilla chips! I used a pizza cutter to slice them into triangles and popped them on a baking sheet under the broiler for a few minutes until the were nice and crispy. They added such a fun and interesting sweet, cocount-y flavor to guacamole and salsa.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16187" alt="guacamole chips" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4049.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Of course, if you aren&#8217;t big on coconut, you can swap out the coconut oil for any other oil that makes you happy, but I definitely recommend trying it out with the coconut oil. So. Good. And so good for you! Yay for short ingredient lists, whole grains and healthy fats!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16196" alt="tortillas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4052.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Stay tuned tomorrow for those portabella fajitas I promised! They come together in a flash and are so flavorful, easy and perfect for a Meatless Monday meal.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h4 id="ingr_header">Ingredients</h4>
<ul id="ingr">
<li>2-2/3 cups whole wheat flour, divided</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
<li>1/3 cup coconut oil</li>
<li>1 cup hot water</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="instructions">
<h4 id="inst_header">Instructions</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the bowl of a mixer fitted with a dough cook, add in 2-1/3 cups flour, salt and coconut oil. Mix on medium until the oil is distributed and the dough looks crumbly.</li>
<li>With the mixer on medium, stream in the hot water slowly until the mixture is well-mixed—it will be a wet dough, you may need to scrape the sides as it mixes. Continue to mix for 3-4 minutes.</li>
<li>Dump out the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead—adding in remaining 1/3 cup flour—until the dough is soft and supple.</li>
<li>Divide the dough into twelve even pieces, roll into balls and let rest, covered on a baking sheet for at least an hour or up to four.</li>
<li>When you are ready to cook the tortillas, heat a cast iron or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. While the skillet is heating up, roll out one of the dough balls on a lightly-floured surface until they are 8&#8243;-10&#8243; in diameter and very, very thin.</li>
<li>To cook the tortillas, place in the skillet and cook until bubbly—about 4 minutes. Flip and cook on other side for 2-3 minutes. While the tortilla is cooking, roll out next dough ball. To keep the tortilla soft and warm while the others are cooking, stash them in a closed zip-top bag.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Nutritional Info</h4>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15904" alt="wiaw header" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3786.jpg" width="800" height="548" /></p>
<p>One of the things that took me a while to learn with healthy eating is that it isn&#8217;t about all-or-nothing. Sometimes you&#8217;re not going to eat the healthiest. Sometimes you&#8217;re going to eat really healthy. And, in fact, I kinda feel like that yin-and-yang diet is the healthiest kind of all. It&#8217;s the kind of diet that lets you enjoy cookies at Christmas and zucchini in the summer. Usually it&#8217;s a pretty organic process, but sometimes, I find myself playing catch-up from a day of not-so-stellar eating. Take Monday for example, I was swamped and when I&#8217;m swamped, I do a terrible job at making and eating food—not eating much is one of my stress reactions. Not really picture of health, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>So, on Tuesday, when things had settled down a bit, I made up for my day of lack-luster eating. I made sure to pack in tons of fresh fruit, veggies and whole grains and really feed my body well! Onto the eats&#8230;</p>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16184" alt="breakfast cereal fruit" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4008.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>Craig did a good job of setting me on the right path and brought me a yummy bowl of Grape Nuts, almond milk and lots of fruit for breakfast. We got a giant box of Grape Nuts at Costco a few weeks back, and I am definitely doing my part to put a dent in it. Yum!</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16185" alt="lunch salad" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4044.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>For lunch, I dumped out two of my <a title="how i prep food for the week" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/21/how-i-prep-food-for-the-week/">salads-in-a-jar</a>&nbsp;and then topped them with some sliced cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, and some sprouted lentils. In the original jar was dressing, quinoa, red onions, celery, blue cheese, and romaine. I am <strong>so</strong> not usually a salad person, but this was delicious and filling!</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16186" alt="banana dates" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4047.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>I was craving something sweet after lunch, so I had a banana and two dates as my lunch dessert.</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16187" alt="guacamole chips" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4049.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>In the afternoon, I whipped up a batch of guacamole to have with dinner, and of course, had to sample some myself with some homemade baked whole grain coconut tortilla chips. That recipe is coming your way this afternoon. Yum!</p>
</div>
<div id="wiaw1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16188" alt="fajitas" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4084.jpg" width="800" height="533" />
<p>Of course, I had more guacamole with dinner—portabella fajitas! These were incredible. So yummy! And the recipe will be coming your way later in the week. Inside the tortillas are marinated portabella, sautéed peppers and onions, guacamole, salsa, black beans, Greek yogurt and cilantro. Yum!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16153" alt="syrup" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4019.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>Sometime last summer, we had this crazy idea that, even though we live decidedly South of the prime maple syrup zone, maybe we could tap a few of the maple trees we have on our nine acres and try our hand at making our own maple syrup. We had no idea what we were doing, but the appeal of possibly creating our own, barely-processed, all-natural sweetener was just too tempting to ignore.</p>
<p>A few years back, we made the switch to using all-natural sweeteners almost exclusively—we use mostly local maple syrup and local raw honey—but the cost was always incredibly discouraging—local maple syrup costs about $20 per quart around here. So we were really excited about the idea of maybe recouping some of that cash by producing our own syrup.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16158" alt="maple sap syrup tree" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_2933_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know how syrup is produced (I didn&#8217;t before this!), you drive a spile into the tree, hang a bucket on it and the sap drips into the bucket. We ended up tapping six maple trees back in mid-February (after ordering aluminum spiles, buckets and lids from eBay).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="babyface drill tree" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_2934_size8801.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Just as long as you don&#8217;t use too many spiles in the same tree, it doesn&#8217;t hurt the tree at all. The sap runs really well when the night is cold and the day is sunny and cool. The sap doesn&#8217;t run so much if it&#8217;s overcast, really cold, or really warm. Since we tapped our trees on a nice, sunny day, the sap started running immediately. I definitely let out a little squeal of excitement when that first drop hit the bottom of the bucket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16160" alt="maple sap bucket" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_2939_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Some days, we&#8217;d have to empty the buckets two or three times because of the weather. Other times, we could go three days without emptying them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="full sap bucket" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_3120_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>We actually got a little bit of a late start because we were out of the country at the very beginning of sugaring season, but even with that late start, we still managed to produce a lot more syrup that either of us expected! Honestly, in the beginning, I had planned on getting a lot more than six buckets going, but cost prohibited us from buying more. I&#8217;m so thankful we didn&#8217;t tap more! We wouldn&#8217;t have been able to keep up with it. Six taps are more than enough to cover us for a full year (and even have some leftovers to give away to family and friends).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16007" alt="maple sap buckets" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_5616.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve collected some sap, the only other part of the process is to boil off the water. Depending on which type of maple tree you are tapping, maple sap is between 1-4% sugar content, and turn it into syrup, enough water needs to be boiled off to reach 66.9% sugar content. Which means, it takes a crapload of sap to make a little bit of maple syrup—about 43 gallons of sap for each gallon of syrup.</p>
<p>We just boiled off our syrup on our stove an a big stock pot and a shallow turkey roaster acting as our evaporating pan (well, until I burnt that to a crisp, more on that below). It took hours and hours of evaporating to turn the sap into syrup, but it was okay because it was mostly hands-off time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16161" alt="sap boiling" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_3052_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Tada! Syrup! Wondering about the different colors? Earlier in the season, the syrup is lighter in color and flavor, by the end of the season it&#8217;s very maple-y and almost black. The more you know!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="syrup" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4025.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Of course, considering it was our first time doing this, there were some hiccups along the way. We were a bare-bones operation this year, and we already have plans in the works for next year to make it easier to collect sap. We (quite literally) did all the heavy lifting this year, but we&#8217;re planning on rigging up our tractor and a wagon next year to help us collect. No more hulking 60 pounds of sap! Yay!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16008" alt="feet sap" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_5617.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>I also burned no less that five different batches of syrup because I forgot they were on the stove. Most syrup-makers have a sugar shack or create an outdoor evaporator and just watch their syrup all day, we were doing such a small amount, we just kept it going on our stove in the kitchen—which meant I could wander off and get lost in other things and not realize syrup was burning until the smoke detectors were going off. We do have plans to do it outdoors next year (firewood for outdoor fire=free, propane for our stove=not free). I will miss the amazing amount of humidity boiling off sap added to the dry winter air. I will not miss the smell of burnt maple syrup.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16164" alt="burnt sap" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_3260_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>One of the bigger hiccups we dealt with was figuring out when the syrup was done. More expert maple syrup producers use something called a hydrometer, which measures the density of sugar in the mixture. When it&#8217;s at 66.9% sugar, it&#8217;s maple syrup. If it&#8217;s higher sugar content than that, it&#8217;ll crystallize and become hard. If it&#8217;s lower than that, it&#8217;ll spoil when you store it on the shelf (although, this isn&#8217;t a problem if you plan on keeping your syrup in the fridge, like we are).</p>
<p>But we didn&#8217;t have a hydrometer, and we certainly weren&#8217;t going to buy one for this little experiment so we went the homespun route—a thermometer.</p>
<p>Maple syrup boils at 7° above the boiling point of water. So once the syrup hits that number, we knew it was done. Honestly, the thermometer itself was a big hassle. Never before have I needed a <em>really</em> accurate kitchen thermometer. I ended up trying three different thermometers I had kicking around my kitchen—two meat thermometers and a candy thermometer. And they all sucked.</p>
<p>The candy thermometer was useless from the second I put it in the pot because it was completely fogged over and was impossible to read—let alone down to the degree.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16165" alt="candy thermometer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3759.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The other two digital thermometers were so jumpy that it made it impossible to get a consistent reading. One would jump around like the Biggest Loser scale—140°, 430°, 85°, 219° and eventually just land on &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Lo&#8221;. It was absolutely infuriating, especially considering the point when the batch goes from not syrup to syrup to not syrup again happens incredibly quickly.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16166" alt="thermometer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3763.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>So during one of my fits of thermometer rage, I took to Twitter to complain and ended up connecting with the amazing folks at <a href="http://www.thermoworks.com/" target="_blank">ThermoWorks</a> and they offered to send me one of their <a href="http://www.thermoworks.com/products/thermapen/splashproof_thermapen.html" target="_blank">ThermaPens</a> to make my syrup-making life a little easier. I pretty much collapsed to my knees out of gratitude (and Craig was very happy with the bonus Jelly Bellys they sent along with it).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16163" alt="thermapen" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_3109_size880.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>It changed my life. Seriously. It was accurate. It was easy. It was fast. So fast, in fact, that with my other thermometers, I kept burning my hand on steam because I had to hold it for so long to get a solid reading, but the ThermaPen reads in three seconds—no more steam burns. Yay! Each and every batch of syrup after I got my ThermaPen turned out perfectly. Not only could I get down to the degree, but down to the tenth of the degree! I certainly don&#8217;t need a hydrometer now. And I will recommend ThermaPens to everyone in the whole wide world.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16169" alt="thermometer syrup" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3769.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>My favorite thing about the ThermaPen is how simple it is. It&#8217;s just a thermometer. That&#8217;s it. You open it, it comes on, you close it, it goes off. My other thermometers had timers and alarms and clocks and bells and whistles that did nothing but get in the way. One of them didn&#8217;t even have an &#8220;off&#8221; button, so to turn it off, I had to take the battery out. Ridiculous, right?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16167" alt="thermometer battery" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3765.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>My ThermaPen saved sugaring season. I don&#8217;t normally swoon over a lot of kitchen products, but this one is completely swoon-worthy. The price may seem crazy for something like a thermometer, but considering I probably spent more than that on the three other crappy thermometers I own combined, it&#8217;s well worth it in my opinion. I am so incredibly grateful to ThermoWorks for offering to send me one to review. I might have to build a little pedestal for this guy in my kitchen. He deserves to be worshipped by all the other utensils in my kitchen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="thermopen" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3772.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Anywho, once I got the &#8220;how do I know when it&#8217;s finished?&#8221; problem solved, the process went really smoothly. Every day for the past month, I&#8217;ve woken up, put the tea kettle on to boil and the maple sap on to evaporate and let it do it&#8217;s thing all day long. We evaporated our sap as we went, mostly because we didn&#8217;t have any place to store that much sap, but some folks will store it all in big food-grade barrels and boil it down all at once.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="syrup" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4039.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>We ended up with about 2 1/2 gallons of syrup (not including the batches we messed up or gave away as gifts).  A lot of home syrup producers will preserve their syrup in canning jars and store them on the shelf, but since we didn&#8217;t have a hydrometer (and would be crushed if our &#8220;babies&#8221; spoiled) we decided to just stash it all in beer growlers in our basement fridge. It should last pretty much indefinitely. Or at least until we eat it all.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16173" alt="syrup growlers" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fr_3104_size8801.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Speaking of eating it all, let&#8217;s talk about how I haven&#8217;t had a single drop of this stuff yet. Nope. Not a one. We finished our first batch of syrup on Ash Wednesday, and have been producing all <a title="my lent sacrifice" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/02/12/my-lent-sacrifice/">through Lent</a>, which means none for me. We&#8217;re definitely having French toast on Easter morning, though! I can&#8217;t wait to try our own syrup.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16154" alt="syrup" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4022.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d consider it a very successful first sugaring season. We learned a ton (a ton!) and still managed to get enough sweetener to last us quite a while. I&#8217;ve done a lot of crunchy, self-sustainability stuff in my life, but I think producing our own maple syrup is on the top of the list of my favorites. I&#8217;m happy that sugaring season is over for now—mostly because I&#8217;m so sick of carrying sap buckets—but I know come February next year, I&#8217;ll be chomping at the bit to get started again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>1. Our Office.</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16146" alt="office" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_40012.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We recently played a little musical chairs with some rooms in our house and flip-flopped the guest room with the office. Originally, our office was upstairs, which was great, in theory. But in practice, it turns out that being so far away from all the main living areas meant that we rarely used it. In fact, I pretty much never used it. I much preferred working on my tiny 13&#8243; Macbook screen on the couch downstairs. But now that we&#8217;ve switched it, I feel so much more connected the rest of the house when I&#8217;m working. And, it makes it easy to plug into the big monitor (which certainly makes designing websites easier). It&#8217;s so funny how you plan for certain spaces in a house and then, in reality, they just don&#8217;t work even though, on paper, they look perfect. Our office is now, easily, the most used room in the house. Granted, it&#8217;s chock full of hand-me-down furniture and needs a good makeover, but at least it&#8217;s functional!</p>
<h3>2. Keen Arcata Shoes.</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15967" alt="me jeans feet keens" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3834.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>When <a href="http://www.zulily.com/invite/cjohnston392" target="_blank">Zulily</a> had their last Keen sale (knocking things down by 50-70%), Craig and I stocked up and purchased 16 pairs of shoes between the both of us (so not exaggerating). We both had a ton of cheap-o discount store shoes in our closet and figured it was time to become adults and spring for some nice, long-lasting options. Anywho, I love every single pair I ordered—Keen has never steered me wrong—but out of all of them, my<a href="http://www.zulily.com/p/black-arcata-sneaker-women-30014-1947711.html?s=1&amp;pos=2147483647" target="_blank"> black Arcatas</a> are my absolutely most worn. I wear them almost everyday. They are so comfortable and cute. I wish I would have picked them up in the other colors when the Zulily sale was still going on. Speaking of Zulily, for those fo you that were commenting on all my glass storage containers in my <a title="how i prep food for the week" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/21/how-i-prep-food-for-the-week/" target="_blank">food prep post</a>, Zulily is having <a href="http://t.co/a8GenTXxQ8" target="_blank">a storage container sale </a>right now and they have quite a few nice glass ones.</p>
<h3>3. Being busy.</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16145" alt="desk computer" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_40051.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I have a tendency to bitch and moan and complain when I get overwhelmed, but the truth is, I thrive when I&#8217;m busy and right now, damn, am I busy. I knew being my own boss would be hard, but I didn&#8217;t quite realize it was going to be don&#8217;t-have-time-to-take-a-shower kinda hard. But even though it&#8217;s more work than I&#8217;ve ever done in my life, it is such a nice feeling to know that, even on my own, I can do my part to pay the mortgage. Yesterday, I clocked about 14 hours worth of work in front of the computer (surviving mostly on easy-to-grab yogurt and bananas). A little more healthy balance would be nice, but I&#8217;ll take this over working for the man any day. Eventually, I&#8217;m hoping to have enough business that I feel comfortable saying &#8220;no&#8221; or &#8220;not this month&#8221; to new clients, but right now, I&#8217;m taking on whoever wants to work with me. Hire me! I&#8217;m an award-winning graphic designer who loves doing anything from websites to wedding invitations! Oh, and sometimes I bake cupcakes for my clients. Just sayin&#8217;.</p>
<h3>4. Raisins.</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16074" alt="raisin clementine" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3897.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Such a weird thing to be digging right? On a whim last week, I picked up a container of raisins (mostly because I wanted something sweet) and Craig and I plowed through them in three days. I forgot how yummy raisins are! I love how much they plump up in oatmeal. Yum.</p>
<h3>5.Portabella Mushrooms</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16147" alt="portabella mushrooms" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_4015.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I used to hardly ever buy portabellas because the organic ones were so, crazy expensive at the grocery store I shopped at. But I changed stores when I moved here and, for some reason, they almost always have organic portabellas on sale, and even at regular price, they are crazy cheap. I buy 10-12 portabella caps every time I go grocery shopping. They are so versatile! We use them on pizza, in pastas and last night, Craig sautéed some to put as a baked potato topping. Yum!</p>
<h3 class="question">What are you digging right now?</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16130" alt="protein powder smoothie" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3984.jpg" width="800" height="1200" /></p>
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with protein powder. I love that it helps make my daily smoothie more filling and meal-like. I love that it&#8217;s a quick and easy way to get a nice dose of the recovery-helping macronutrient after a hard workout.</p>
<p>But I hate the price. And I, more often than not, hate the ingredient list. There are definitely more natural protein powders out there, but the price is just so restrictively high! And the rare times I found a natural protein powder that wasn&#8217;t exorbitantly expensive, it was exorbitantly gritty, earthy, and generally not delicious.</p>
<p>We recently ran out of our giant tub of protein powder, and I&#8217;ve been meaning to buy another one. But every time I&#8217;ve gone grocery shopping, I&#8217;ve landed in the protein powder aisle, taken one look at the prices and turned my shopping cart right around. I have a seriously hard time justifying $20+ for some powder.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3962.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>But then it hit me, hey, I have stuff that has protein in it in my pantry. And I have a coffee grinder that does a dang good job of turning things into powder. So, uh, why not? So I did.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16124" alt="protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3960.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>It took a little bit of experimentation to get something that didn&#8217;t overwhelm other flavors in smoothies. At first, I tried just straight ground dried lentils. Tons of protein, yes, but also tons of lentil-y flavor. Not recommended, unless you are one of those people who thinks a peanut butter-banana-lentil smoothie sounds delicious. So then I started to think about ways to cut the lentil flavor, but still add protein—enter steel cut oats and brown rice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16122" alt="protein powder lentils, grains" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3955.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Both the steel cut oats and the brown rice have protein, but more importantly in this little concoction they are pretty flavorless, which helps cut back on the earthy flavor of the lentils. I worked a little bit on the ratio, and soon enough, I had a nice protein-packed powder that just was pretty much flavorless in a smoothie. Win!</p>
<h3>Want to make your own? Here&#8217;s the break down:</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">1/3 cup steel cut oats</span></li>
<li>1/3 cup brown rice</li>
<li>1 cup dried green lentils</li>
</ul>
<p>I mixed all of that up in a bowl, and then ground it in my coffee grinder about 1/3 cup at a time (just because my grinder is small) until it was a very fine powder. I ended up with just shy of two cups total of protein powder.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16125" alt="protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3962.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The nutritional info isn&#8217;t quite as high in protein as your standard off-the-shelf protein powder, but it&#8217;s still pretty amazing, especially considering the low price tag and the low number of ingredients. Because of the carb-y nature of the oats and rice, it&#8217;s higher in carbs that store-bought powder, too, but I&#8217;m a big fan of whole grain, natural carbs, so I&#8217;m good with it! And, of course, you can play with the ratios to up the protein even more (more lentils) and reduce the carbs (less steel cut oats and rice).  You could also try other protein-tastic add-ins, like dried soybeans or dired black beans. I just always have lentils kicking around, so it was a good fit for our lifestyle.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the comparision between my homemade protein powder and my typical off-the-shelf protein powder.</p>
<h3>Homemade Protein Powder (per 1/4 cup of powder)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">130 calories</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">8g protein</span></li>
<li>1g fat</li>
<li>24g carbs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Lentils, Brown Rice, Steel Cut Oats</p>
<h3>Store-Bought Protein Powder  (per 1/4 cup of powder)</h3>
<ul>
<li>80 calories</li>
<li>14g protein</li>
<li>0g fat</li>
<li>5g carbs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong>: Proprietary non-GMO protein blend (rice protein, pea protein and soy [isolated soy protein and fermented soy]), di-calcium phosphate, FOS (fructooligosaccharides), curcumin (natural color), banana flavor, potassium citrate, guar gum, magnesium oxide, psyllium, natural vanilla flavor, oat bran, microcrystalline cellulose, spirulina, vitamin C, vitamin E (d-alpha tocopheryl acetate), choline bitartrate, inositol, apple pectin, bee pollen, niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, zinc oxide, manganese sulfate, ferrous fumarate, calcium pantothenate, lecithin, lemon bioflavonoids, papaya, bromelain, chlorophyll, pyridoxine HCl, riboflavin, thiamine HCl, vitamin B-12, vitamin D, folic acid, biotin, potassium iodide, chromium chloride, sodium selenite, sodium molybdate</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16129" alt="smoothie protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3980.jpg" width="800" height="1042" /></p>
<p>I know what some of you are saying—but I don&#8217;t have a coffee grinder! Well, I think it&#8217;s worth the cash to go out and buy one. My coffee grinder was a whopping $10 at Target a few years ago. A $10 coffee grinder, $1 bag of lentils, $1 bag of brown rice and $2 worth of steel cut oats will make you much more than $14 worth of all-natural, plant-based, vegan protein powder.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16131" alt="protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3985.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a unflavored, unsweetened protein powder kind of girl, but I know that sometimes it can be really fun to mix it up with fun flavors, so I spent a little time creating four different flavor variations on the powder.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16128" alt="protein powder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3971.jpg" width="800" height="771" /></p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><strong>Cappuccino</strong>: For each 1/3 cup of lentil/rice/oats mixture you blend in the coffee grinder, throw in 1 tablespoon of whole coffee beans and blend until a fine powder. To sweeten, add desired amount of stevia or sugar.</span></li>
<li><strong>Chocolate</strong>: For each 1/3 cup of lentil/rice/oats mixture you blend in the coffee grinder, throw in 1 tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder and blend until a fine powder. To sweeten, add desired amount of stevia or sugar.</li>
<li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: For each 1/3 cup of lentil/rice/oats mixture you blend in the coffee grinder, add in the insides of 1/2 of a vanilla bean or slice a whole vanilla bean in half lengthwise and stash in a jar with the whole batch of protein powder to flavor continuously. To sweeten, add desired amount of stevia or sugar.</li>
<li><strong>Pumpkin Spice</strong>: For each 1/3 cup of lentil/rice/oats mixture you blend in the coffee grinder, add in 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger and ground cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg and ground cloves. To sweeten, add desired amount of stevia or sugar.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16127" alt="coffee grinder" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3965.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Let me know if you guys try it out with any other ratios, flavors or ingredients! I&#8217;d love to hear what you guys come up with. Happy protein powder making!</p>
<h3 class="question">Does anyone else have a near panic-attack when they go to buy protein powder? Or am I just a cheapskate?</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15905" alt="yogurt bowl" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3757.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>For this week&#8217;s menu, I wanted to really focus on making our diet lean a little more toward the plant-based world. We&#8217;ve been steadily working our way through our stash of meat in the freezer (which has been awesome!) but I&#8217;d really like to be more cognizant of when we&#8217;re eating meat. If you look back at the past few of my WIAWs, you&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;ve been eating meat at most of my meals. And while, that&#8217;s cool if that&#8217;s you thing, I&#8217;ve found that I feel my best and get in my most fruits and veggies when I keep the meat to a minimum. So this week, we&#8217;re all about being strong with the plants!</p>
<p>As always, if you’d like to refer to this post throughout the week, you can by clicking the big, honkin’ button in my sidebar for this week’s menu.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-16-at-8.40.38-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter" alt="menu button" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-16-at-8.40.38-AM.png" width="411" height="195" /></a></p>
<p>Onto this week&#8217;s eats&#8230;</p>
<h3>Breakfasts</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been noticing that we&#8217;re focusing a lot more on quick breakfasts lately, so I figured I might as well go with that trend and put quick options on the docket for the week.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Cereal with almond milk and <a href="http://instagram.com/p/XIVuvSw_NC/" target="_blank">a big selection of fruit</a></span></li>
<li>Banana and berry protein smoothies (with homemade protein powder—more on that soon)</li>
<li>Toast with peanut butter and fruit</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6299" alt="blueberry smoothie" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_01921.jpg" width="800" height="550" /></p>
<h3>Lunches</h3>
<p>Our fridge is actually still pretty packed from last weekend&#8217;s<a title="how i prep food for the week" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/21/how-i-prep-food-for-the-week/" target="_blank"> food prep</a> (we ended up having more leftovers to eat on this week than I anticipated), so some of these are repeats, but there are a few new items in there, as well.</p>
<h4>Main Dishes</h4>
<ul>
<li><a title="cold greek quinoa salad" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/06/07/cold-greek-quinoa-salad/" target="_blank"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Greek Quinoa Salad</span></a></li>
<li>Salads in a Jar</li>
<li><a title="slamdunk black bean sliders with sriracha mayo" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/19/slamdunk-black-bean-sliders-with-sriracha-mayo/" target="_blank">Black Bean Burgers</a></li>
<li>Leftovers (whatever we have kicking around the fridge)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Side Dishes</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Veggies with Hummus</span></li>
<li>Fruit</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16094" alt="veggies" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3881.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<h3>Snacks</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been finding myself snacking a lot less now that I&#8217;m home all the time. I think, when I was working in an office, I used &#8220;snack time&#8221; as a way to break up the day. Now, I don&#8217;t need that break! But just in case, here are the snacks I have planned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="peanut butter cookie date bites" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/08/30/peanut-butter-cookie-date-bites/" target="_blank"><span style="line-height: 13px;">Peanut Butter Cookie Date Balls</span></a></li>
<li>Veggies with hummus</li>
<li>Cereal with almond milk and fruit</li>
<li><a title="coconut-pistachio stuffed dates" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2012/01/16/coconut-pistachio-stuffed-dates/" target="_blank">Stuffed Dates</a></li>
<li>Cashews</li>
</ul>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16107" alt="dates" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dtaes1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></h3>
<h3>Dinners</h3>
<p>A few folks asked me why I don&#8217;t do dinner prep when I do my <a title="how i prep food for the week" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/21/how-i-prep-food-for-the-week/" target="_blank">weekly food prep routine</a>, that&#8217;s because I love cooking dinner! Usually, right around when time comes for me to start on dinner happens to be time I&#8217;m ready to quit working for the day. Heading to the kitchen is a nice change of pace after a few hours in front of the computer or out in the garden.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday, everyone! I know I&#8217;ve skipped these accountability posts for the last few weeks, but I&#8217;m back this week with a vengeance!</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p><a href="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/shabby.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15331" alt="shabby slider" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/shabby.jpg" width="590" height="106" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to the quality and quantity of foods, I feel like I&#8217;m doing really well. I&#8217;m also feeling incredibly inspired in the kitchen lately. I have so many ideas for fresh recipes and clean food and healthy, delicious eats. Now that we are into spring (although, admittedly, it doesn&#8217;t feel like it outside), I find myself drifting toward a lot more of a plant-based diet. In the winter, I tend to crave dairy and meat and heavy carbs, but as soon as that sun starts shining and the snow stops, I want fresh greens, fruit, whole grains, and fish. I want lots of light and bright flavors, and that is great for my recipe inspiration and great for my health. I absolutely cannot wait until our garden is producing and my &#8220;grocery shopping&#8221; involves just walking out the door with a basket and a knife.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16095" alt="salad jars" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3890.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still 100% off the sugar. It&#8217;s been kinda remarkably easy for me, and has me really second-guessing the &#8220;need&#8221; for sugar in my life. Even though I swore I wasn&#8217;t going to, I started watching this season of the Biggest Loser the other day (no spoilers, I&#8217;m only a few episodes in) and one of the things that really resonated with me was the idea that your home should be your healthy food bubble. You can have cookies and brownies and cupcakes in a healthy lifestyle, but there is no reason to bring them into your bubble. There will be plenty of opportunities to eat those things outside of the bubble, so why would you add that temptation to your safety blanket? I really like the idea of keeping my bubble clean and green, and then getting my &#8220;fix&#8221; outside of the house. Get dessert with a dinner out at a restaurant. Eat a piece of birthday cake at a birthday party. Have a fancy coffee drink while out shopping. There is a certain nice black and white line about that &#8220;bubble&#8221; concept that really resonates with my all-or-nothing personality. I definitely still have a lot of thinking about how I&#8217;m going to go about reincorporating sugar back into my life now that Lent is coming to a close.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve next week:</strong> I&#8217;d like to pick one day this upcoming week and track my food just to see how I&#8217;m doing with a typical day. As I&#8217;ve said before, my issue comes with portion control, and just as long as I keep an eye on it, I think I should be fine.</p>
<h3>Fitness</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15268" alt="slider okayish" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/okayish.jpg" width="590" height="106" /></p>
<p>Fitness for the past few weeks has been a world of extremes. When it was nice out, I&#8217;d be working my buns off. I actually wore my heart rate monitor one day while I was out doing work around here and I burned about 900 calories in three hours. It&#8217;s not an extreme amount, but enough that I was tired and very, very sore the next day. And that was a short day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15997" alt="shovel soil" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_5598.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Since the nice days are devoted 100% to working outside, I tend to be overcompensating on the not-so-nice days. I spend the cold and rainy days inside cleaning and working on the computer to make up for the neglect from the outside work. Which means, not a lot of activity on those days. If I were a more devoted person, I&#8217;d hop on the treadmill on those days, but the truth is, I&#8217;m not. And I&#8217;m working my arse off on outside days, so I&#8217;m mostly okay with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still struggling with my mindset accepting that yes, indeed, three hours of shoveling is a workout and not feeling guilty for not using the treadmill in the last three weeks. The definition of an &#8220;active life&#8221; extends way beyond the gym, and I&#8217;m constantly reminding myself of that.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve next week:</strong> Stop worrying about it so much. Just keep moving and just&#8230;be.</p>
<h3>Hydration</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15333" alt="awesome slider" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/awesome.jpg" width="590" height="106" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a water rockstar for the past few weeks. Partially because it makes me feel so good, but also partially because I&#8217;m fighting off a UTI (TMI, right?). So to fight that off, I&#8217;m draaaaaankin&#8217; my weight in water and pucker-inducing 100% cranberry juice.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, when I&#8217;m in the house, at the desk and working, I drink a ton of water because my water bottle is right there. But when I&#8217;m outside working? I drink a lot less because I&#8217;m moving all around and my water bottle is never close. I&#8217;m actually considering wearing my CamelBak when I work outside. Especially once it starts to get warmer.</p>
<p><strong>How to improve next week:</strong> Keep on, keepin&#8217; on.</p>
<h3>Weight</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="awesome slider" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/awesome.jpg" width="590" height="106" /></p>
<p><strong>Starting Weight:</strong> 236.8 lbs<br />
<a title="accountability update #7" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2013/03/01/accountability-update-7/"><strong>Last Weigh In</strong></a>: 229.1 lbs<br />
<strong>This Week’s Weight</strong>: 226.4 lbs<br />
<strong>This Week’s Loss</strong>: -2.7 lbs<br />
<strong>Total Loss:</strong> -10.4 lbs.</p>
<p>Woohoo! Down 10 pounds since January 20th! It certainly is coming off slow this time around (that 2.7 pounds took about three weeks to come off), but I&#8217;m moving in the right direction. I feel myself closing in on my &#8220;happy weight&#8221;. I know that sounds crazy that someone could be happy at 200+ pounds, but I honestly feel my best when I&#8217;m somewhere between 210-215ish, so we&#8217;re closing in.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15968" alt="me jeans" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3842.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>When I first started losing weight, back when I was close to 300 pounds, I thought I&#8217;d be my absolute happiest at 150 pounds. That was the magic number. But then I started to realize that your happy weight isn&#8217;t just about how you look and what size your jeans are, it&#8217;s also about what is maintainable with the lifestyle you want.</p>
<p>I could get down to 150 pounds. I could be a single-digit size. I know how. And maybe I&#8217;d even be crazy happy with my appearance at that weight. But that&#8217;d also mean I&#8217;d have to skip trying new beers at our local brewery. And only have dessert once a month. And count all my calories. And spend hours a week on the treadmill. My genetics just don&#8217;t make it easy to maintain that size, so it&#8217;d take some serious work to get there and stay there. And honestly, I&#8217;m just not willing to do that. Maybe that makes me lazy, but it&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p>For me, finding my happy weight is a balance between health, appearance and lifestyle. At nearly 300 pounds, I wasn&#8217;t healthy, I didn&#8217;t like my appearance, but my lifestyle was certainly enjoyable. At my lowest weight, I was healthy, and I liked my appearance, but I hated my lifestyle of calorie-counting and dessert-skipping. At my &#8220;happy weight&#8221; I want to be healthy, like my appearance <strong>and</strong> get to enjoy my life. And I think that &#8220;magic&#8221; number is different for anyone (and certainly isn&#8217;t found on any height/weight or BMI chart). Anywho, I can feel myself closing in on that happy place, and that, well, makes me happy!</p>
<p><strong>How to improve next week:</strong> Just keep on eating fresh and staying active. If I keep both of those up, the scale will probably move. And if it doesn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not supposed to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16097" alt="food prep" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3902.jpg" width="800" height="577" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned a few times on here how my food prep binges on the weekend really help me stay on track with nutrition throughout the week. I hadn&#8217;t really thought much about writing a post about it until I saw the awesome Lindsay over at the <a href="http://www.theleangreenbean.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Green Bean</a> do her weekly series on her food prep routine. I was so inspired by everyone else&#8217;s food prep, that I thought maybe I should give you guys a small peek into mine as well. So this past weekend, I snapped some photos while I set off one of my patented kitchen bombs.</p>
<p>The first step for my food prep is to make a list. This shouldn&#8217;t surprise you. I&#8217;m pretty much the queen of lists. Ha! I did a little pre-list when I made my menu and went grocery shopping for the week, but now that it&#8217;s time to actually do the work, I make a &#8220;real&#8221; list and make sure to put it in the order I want to work.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16091" alt="food prep list" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3876.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>After my list is made, I usually pull out all the ingredients I&#8217;ll need to get through the whole list. I&#8217;m lucky to have a giant island to spread out on. Having all the ingredients out and clumped together really saves me some time. Plus, I also like the visual of working my way through them. I put ingredients away as I&#8217;m finished with them, and as the counter starts to get empty, I know I&#8217;m closing in on the finish line.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16092" alt="food prep ingredients" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3878.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>To make the most out of my time, I try to start with the things that have an element of inactive work. Like making bread. I make a loaf of bread each week, and I get the dough together and rising first, before I do anything else. Bonus: because I&#8217;m working in the kitchen and have the stove and the oven on, it warms up and my dough rises better. Win!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16093" alt="dough bread" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3879.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Next, I just start working through my list. I try to keep like things together so I can use the same kitchen utensils without washing. Like, for example, I chop all my veggies for snacking&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16094" alt="veggies" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3881.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>&#8230;and then right after, I start working on my salads-in-a-jar. I&#8217;m not sure who the first person to think of putting a salad in the jar, but man, it is genius. I was skeptical when I first tried it, but just as long as the lettuce is separate from the dressing, it all stays fresh and crisp for days. My lunchtime veggie intake has skyrocketed thanks to these little salad jars stashed in the fridge. I usually dump the whole thing into a bowl, but Craig just shakes it up and eats it right out of the jar. It&#8217;s a a perfectly portable healthy lunch. Love &#8216;em.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16095" alt="salad jars" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3890.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Once I&#8217;ve made it through my whole list, I stash everything on the top shelf of the fridge. Not only does it make it easy to get to, but it&#8217;s also the first thing we see when we open up the fridge door. I&#8217;m a believer that if I&#8217;m visually assaulted with healthy foods, I&#8217;m much more likely to eat healthy foods.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16098" alt="fridge" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3909.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Curious what I made this week? Here&#8217;s the whole lot of it:</p>

</ul>
<p>This, plus some other additions like cereal for breakfast or leftovers for lunch, will be enough food to get us through the week. It took me about three hours to get through all this cooking, but I know it saves so much more time than that during the week. It makes it so easy to grab breakfasts, lunches and snacks during the week. Honestly, the time and effort isn&#8217;t all that bad. The worst part about the whole thing? The pile of dishes afterward. Yeeeeesh.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-16071" alt="kitchen dishes" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-19-at-5.30.14-PM.png" width="800" height="800" /></p>
<p>But thankfully, I have an awesome husband who doesn&#8217;t mind cleaning up after I spent hours cooking us healthy, yummy food for the whole week.</p>
<p>Each week, I try to make 2-3 options for lunches, 2-3 options for breakfast and a handful of options for snacks. It changes each week. Here&#8217;s another food prep I did a few weeks back. In this one, you&#8217;ll see other food prep frequenters like granola bars, <a title="overnight oats 101" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2011/05/11/overnight-oats-101/" target="_blank">overnight oats</a>, <a title="my favorite snacks : packable fruit and yogurt parfait" href="http://backtoherroots.com/2011/02/17/my-favorite-snacks-packable-fruit-and-yogurt-parfait/" target="_blank">fruit and yogurt parfaits</a>, and tuna salad. It all just depends on what we&#8217;re in the mood for.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-15733" alt="food prep" src="http://backtoherroots.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_3450.jpg" width="800" height="675" /><br />
If it weren&#8217;t for food prepping each week, my diet would probably consist of some leftovers and whatever food was within reach in the pantry. I know having all these fresh fruits and veggies ready and waiting has definitely made me eat more goodies. Even Craig agrees! He says that without the weekly food prep, he probably wouldn&#8217;t even bother with packing fruits or vegetables in the lunch he takes to work, but with it all there and ready to go, it&#8217;s actually easier to just grab something healthy instead of doing the work to pack something not-as-healthy.</p>
<p>Food prepping takes a pretty big time commitment, but for us, it&#8217;s a system that works, so that time is worth it. If you&#8217;ve never tried it before, I highly recommend making your own list and setting off a kitchen bomb of your very own!</p>
