				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a dream the other night that I had to send a very important email to a friend and instead I sent it to a client.  I then woke up out of a deep sleep in a cold sweat.  That would be pretty disastrous, wouldn&#8217;t it?  Well it happens more than you think it does, especially in cases where people or organizations have multiple social media accounts and the lines between business and personal becomes faint.  Social media can be a great way to build your brand, but if handled incorrectly, can erode these efforts in a hurry.</p>
<p>In light of this panic, I thought it would be a good time to post this article which had been sitting in my draft folder for over a year.  The 13 Most Common Social Media mistakes which can either damage your brand or cause others to look at it and then move on to someone else.</p>
<p>Back in the day, your handshake was your word, and if you shook someone&#8217;s hand and then didn&#8217;t follow through or did so with the intent on lying or being deceitful, it was your name that was ruined.  Fast forward, and it&#8217;s your brand.</p>
<p><strong>13. Having Incomplete Profile(s)</strong></p>
<p>Having profiles which are not completely filled out, or are filled out in a comical way, or through false credentials is meaningful to the person / organization looking for you.  It means that you are either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely unqualified that you do not have enough background information to fill a profile up.</li>
<li>Very lazy because you don&#8217;t have one hour to add all the information into your profile.</li>
<li>A joker who cannot take anything seriously, or</li>
<li>A scammer who has to make things up in order to cover up for something you must be hiding.</li>
</ul>
<p>1<strong>2.  Inconsistency among networks</strong></p>
<p>Imagine this.  You are looking to do business / connect with someone and you think you have found them on Facebook, but when you check on Twitter, they have a name and email address, which is different from Linkedin, and from Pinterest.  So now you Google these names and email addresses and all kinds of stuff comes back to you.  What are you thinking now?  Probably that they&#8217;re hiding something, or that they are very disorganized.   All these micro-networks that make up your overall network should be as consistent as possible as a consistent image is key to building a memorable, identifiable brand.</p>
<p><strong>11.  Using Social Media to make money after building a significant network.  </strong></p>
<p>For this mistake, I am thinking about the blogging world where bloggers attract a significant following due to their writings, then they realize they can pitch products to their networks which eventually turns their brand into an advertising site.  Those are a dime a dozen, and readers often wonder if the blogger is endorsing a product that they actually use and support, or because they are getting it for free.  The message becomes lost.  There is a fine line between doing what made you popular, and losing credibility among your readership.</p>
<p><strong>10.  Audience participation.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you have invested so much into your brand, and get so little in return?  Could it be that you are not meeting the needs of your readers / customers?  It is important to make sure that you engage your base whenever they take the time to reach out, for whatever reason they have chosen to reach out.  Talk to them, not about them.  Also, have a look through your Twitter feed and see how many of the last 30 tweets engage others, and how many are just random posts to your entire network.  Successful brand-builders don&#8217;t just tweet and re-tweet.  They also respond, engage, ask questions, and answer questions.</p>
<p><strong>9.  Not Interlinking Your Profiles</strong></p>
<p>The simplest mistake to fix.  Take 10 minutes, make sure all your social network profiles link to one another because the more touch points that exist to connect with your network, the better.  Your next best connection might be a die-hard Google + user, but you might only use Facebook and Twitter.   Make sure you have all profiles linked.</p>
<p><strong>8.  Being impersonal </strong></p>
<p>Connections are gold in this day and age, so don&#8217;t take a potential connection for granted and allow the service you use to send out a generic stock message when trying to connect.  Linkedin, for example, provides a stock message that reads “I’d like to add you to my professional network on Linkedin.”   Take some time and put some effort into a greeting which makes that person want to connect with you.  Surely you have 30 seconds to include your name and a personal message.</p>
<p><strong>7.  Stay on-topic as much as possible</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A first-time visitor to any of your social media outlets should be able to instantly tell “what you are about”.  Don’t mistake frequent posting with relevant posting or think that everyone you are connected to is reading each and every post.  Every once in a while, logout and review your posts as if you were a visitor to see if you messaging is “on-brand” and if it&#8217;s not, get back in there and fix it!</p>
<p><strong>6.  Automated Direct Message</strong></p>
<p>The automated direct message on Twitter is the biggest personal branding disaster that seen on a daily basis.  It says, &#8220;You’ve just met me, and you want to spam me with your blog or product?&#8221;  Epic fail, and a sure way to lose followers quicker than you gain them.  Instead, send them a personalized direct message or @reply with someone’s actual name and a message relevant to their area of interest.  This one message may lead to a lasting connection that might not have occurred otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Tunnel Vision</strong></p>
<p>Have you focussed your brand-building on you and you only?  The 90/10 rule of social media brand building generally states that</p>
<p style="display:inline!important;"><strong>90% of what you share should be made up of personal insights and thoughts along with a heavy dose of helpful links, while 10% should directly benefit you.”</strong></p>
<p>Keep this rule in mind the next time you want to Tweet about your site or product.  I guarantee that the 90% of the time you take to help others will increase the attention paid to the other 10%.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that a successful social media / brand building campaign takes into consideration the views and opinions of others.  For every organization which has a social media manager, there are probably 10-20 other employees who have ideas, thoughts and suggestions about the business which, if implemented, will help the business grow and get recognized.  To ignore this dedicated internal network is a crucial error that many organizations suffer from.  The silos have to be broken down in all areas of the business in order to improve the brand, and relying on one person to know the ins and outs of every organization is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Don&#8217;t forget the impact of your word</strong></p>
<p>In the age of social media it&#8217;s easy to forget that what you say to someone on the phone or in person can still come back to bite you in the ass.  You may not be sending an email to someone because you don&#8217;t want what they say to have a living trail, however as much as people save emails and forward emails, people also take what you said and post it on social media, and this negative messaging can mess with your brand.   So make sure when you are dealing with others that you are prepared to be upfront and honest because there is nothing worse than having them erode your credibility over a matter in which you chose a less than professional approach to.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Un-friending, Un-following, Un-linking</strong></p>
<p>All of these connection removals can have disastrous impact on your brand, especially around timing and how seriously the other person takes your connection.  If, for example, a friend from highschool removes you from Facebook, you will certainly get offended and you might even ask why.  If a follower on Twitter removes you, you probably understand that they may have followed you expecting something but got something else, or they disagree with your views, the frequency of posts, or possibly they need to remove people in order to be able to add others.  If, however, someone on Linkedin removes you, the severing of the business network goes much deeper because what that message says is that they never want to use you as a connection in the future ever again and that all those other people who are connected to both of you as 2nd or 3rd degree connections can get caught in the middle.  Imagine if a 3rd degree connection was ready to connect, then found themselves no long part of your network, but choose to reach out using their previous connection as the link, unbeknownst that this connection ended badly.</p>
<p>As well, people forgive and forget, so to remove someone right away may potentially sever that relationship for good, and you never know down the road when you might really need them!  One should never cut off their nose to spite their face in this day and age and to do so without proper thought often comes back to bite someone in the behind.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Keeping your marketing and social media objective quiet &#8211; internally and externally</strong></p>
<p>You build a business / brand through communicating internally and externally your message so that not only will your network be engaged, but also your customers, clients, friends, family, colleagues, etc.  Keeping them in the dark, or only focussing on external networks does not take into consideration that employees have lives outside of the office or social networks of their own.  The faster the message gets out and to the greater number of people, the better are the odds that your business / brand will be successful.  To not tap into that network is akin to advertising a businesses services on a telephone pole.  Sure the message gets out but only to those who see it and tell others.  If this was the chosen method to advertise the business, would you not want every employee to post advertising flyers on telephone poles near where they live?  That already increases the network and the chances that your business is going to get customers.  To do otherwise, just doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>1.  Not having a Social Media plan</strong></p>
<p>Not having a social media plan, including ways to promote your brand is the biggest mistake that an individual / organization can make.  By just signing up to multiple micro networks and using them here and there demonstrates a poor social media plan just as much as signing up for multiple social media platforms and never using them, or worse, using them to connect with networks outside of your desired market.  In the few seconds that someone checks out your profile, they are deciding whether to stay and browse some more, or go back and look at one of your competitors.  If they choose to stay and see empty networks or random connections they quickly come to a conclusion about your brand and social media plan, that you don&#8217;t have one, and they will move on.</p>
<p>Know beforehand what your social media plan is going to be and share it, along with the do&#8217;s and please don&#8217;t, so they can be on board and help grow the brand.  To not have a plan in this day and age, or to make one up on the fly is going to lead to issues, inconsistency and confusion for everyone involved.</p>

<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Sarah Thomson (actor)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Thomson_%28actor%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Sarah Thomson</a>, the editor of the Woman&#8217;s Post and who ran for the mayor&#8217;s office in 2010, claimed on both social media and in several interviews that Mayor <a class="zem_slink" title="Rob Ford" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Ford" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Rob Ford</a> grabbed her buttocks (&#8220;Grabbed my ass&#8221; were her exact words on the radio) while taking a photo with Ford at the event.  Ms. Thomson also said in an interview that Ford suggested to her that evening that she should have been in Florida with him because his wife was not there.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomson also posted a very unflattering picture of the Mayor on her Facebook page &#8211;  his eyes were closed and there was either a stain on his shirt or he was sweating a lot.</p>
<p>In a radio interview, she continued to pile on the accusations by suggesting that Ford was high on cocaine that night.  Apparently she Googled cocaine use and concluded that &#8220;&#8230;it’s, you know, sweaty, talking quickly, out of it, arrogant. Like all these things were on there.”</p>
<p>While Thomson has continued to stand by her allegations, she has also thrown her own allegation into doubt because she said, “I looked up the symptoms and it looked like it was cocaine use, it could have been anything like that, I’m not sure what it is. I’ve also read that diabetes could have some odd effects. I’m not sure what was wrong with him, but there was definitely something wrong with him that night.”  Oops.  Cocaine, diabetes&#8230; Well, he was “erratic” and “arrogant” that night so it might have been one of those.</p>
<p>When Thomson was asked if she’d ever taken cocaine herself, she said she didn’t know, as she spent time on the street in her youth.</p>
<p>But it gets even more odd from here&#8230;</p>
<p>Two councillors from Richmond Hill, who were at the event, were part of a crowd when Thomson allegedly was devising a plot to get a photo of the mayor’s hand on her assistant’s rear end.  She planned on using this &#8221;evidence&#8221; to corroborate her story and she told the group it would be put to good use when she ran for Mayor again in 2014.</p>
<p>Thomson has ruled out pressing sexual assault charges against Ford; “It’s a big waste of time to go through the legal procedures,” Thomson said. “Now, I looked at it and I realized I had no proof.”</p>
<p>Thomson put herself at risk of being sued by making the public allegations against Ford.</p>
<div>The mayor had responded to her accusations on Friday in a written statement calling them “absolutely, completely false.”</div>
<div>
<p>Thomson responded to the mayor’s comments by saying that HE was trying to discredit HER.  “Decades ago powerful men who sexually assaulted women would call them ‘hysterical,’ or ‘crazy’ to debase their credibility,” Thomson said. “It pushed many assaulted women into silence…. He will not push me into silence and I hope his accusations do not re-ignite the old fears that once silenced women.”</p>
<p>Thomson went on to say, “I did not make these accusations lightly.”  And as for her hopes of one day being Mayor, she said the approach she took may not have been the best one; “I admit I did not handle the press perfectly.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div>The problem here is not about he said vs she said, or is drawn along political lines.  It&#8217;s about a very serious allegation, made on a very important day and what the implications are if one of these parties is not telling the truth.  Since Ms. Thomson has in fact announced in public that she was sexually &#8216;assaulted&#8217; by the <a class="zem_slink" title="List of mayors of Toronto" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mayors_of_Toronto" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Mayor of Toronto</a> (in front of dozens of people no less) then I would think the police are duty-bound to investigate it to see if there are sufficient grounds for charges against the Mayor.</div>
<p>If it turns out however that this was just a politically motivated, vexatious, stunt by the publisher of a women&#8217;s-only magazine made purposely on the eve of International Women&#8217;s Day then of course SHE should be criminally charged with public mischief and making false accusations.</p>
<p>Criminal sexual assault is a very serious crime. Making public, false, allegations about it are equally so.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is very sad because either Sarah Thomson was assaulted by Rob Ford on the eve of International Woman&#8217;s Day, or Sarah Thomson was playing the victim and trying to set up the Mayor in order to further ruin his reputation and ultimately for her political gain.</p>
<p>Given the recent troubles Ford has had publicly under the attack of the left, a situation like this certainly causes people to question Ford&#8217;s ability to lead and make many people wonder if he is promoting a good image of Toronto for the rest of the world to see.  In light of the recent information revealed by Georgio Mammoliti we know the left have been targeting the reputations of right-wing politicians.</p>
<p>One of these two people made a horrible decision on the eve of International Woman&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>Shame on him if it&#8217;s true and shame on her if it&#8217;s not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents, as we grow older, we see products and services for our children and wonder how cool it would have been to have had that when we were kids.  I&#8217;m not the only one who does this, right?  Massive bouncy castles, iPads, gas-controlled mini-cars, and SO much more.</p>
<p>So yesterday, when I saw a clever twist on an established product, I was blown away.  I saw a change table which not just contained all that a father would need to change a diaper &#8211; diapers, wipes, etc., but also with a TV.  Sweet.</p>
<p>I can remember having to change diapers in stores, or malls, or restaurants only to find out that the change table was in the woman&#8217;s bathroom.  Then came the change table in the family / handicapped bathrooms, and finally change tables in men&#8217;s bathrooms.  We do change diapers too!!!</p>
<p>But a change table at a sporting events with a TV.  Brilliant!  As Dads, we have to make sure our children are clean and we gladly miss several minutes of live action to make sure we look after our kids, but not having to miss any of the action is a luxury and a gift to father&#8217;s everywhere.</p>
<p>I saw the Dove Men + Care Ultimate Gameday Change Table &#8211; billed as a &#8220;souped-up baby change table&#8221; at the Toronto Raptors / Miami Heat basketball game at the Air Canada Centre.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" align="center"><i>The official press release: </i></p>
<p><b>Toronto, ON (March 18, 2012)</b>  &#8211; Dove Men+Care unveiled an interactive change table to Toronto sports-fan dads at the Air Canada Centre, yesterday. The table was designed to be a light-hearted way to call attention to the brand’s campaign to support real men and their changing role in today’s society.</p>
<p>The Dove Men+Care Ultimate Gameday Change Table’s was given a ‘field-test’ during one of the hottest ticket basketball games of the season. The souped-up change table provides all the tools necessary to keep dads and their babies happy during unplanned intermissions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A built-in television so dad didn’t miss any game action</li>
<li>An emergency Lullaby button that played soothing music</li>
<li>An interactive timer and scoreboard to determine the best diaper-changer in the game</li>
</ul>
<p>According to a recent study, men have tripled their involvement in childcare over the last four decades. That’s why Dove Men+Care has taken steps to change societal norms by tailoring a public change table temporarily to suit the needs of men and make it more enjoyable too. The Ultimate Gameday Change Table is designed to help men maintain at least one aspect of their daily life so they can maintain everything else and never miss a moment.</p>
<p><b>About Dove® and Dove Men+Care</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Dove Men+Care all men can literally be comfortable in their own skin. Built on Unilever’s success in the men’s deodorant, personal wash and hair categories, and the Dove brand’s heritage in outstanding skincare, Dove Men+Care products are specifically designed to provide men with both the results and the care they need. The Dove product lineup, manufactured by Unilever, includes beauty bars, body washes, face care, anti-perspirant/deodorants, body mists, hair care and styling aids. Dove is available nationwide in food, drug and mass outlet stores.</p>
<div>I actually began using Dove Men + Care products recently when my current deodorant / anti-perspirant started giving me a rash.  It&#8217;s safe on sensitive skin, smells great and the scent is not overpowering at all.  It also helps that their products are available everywhere.</div>

<p><a title="" href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> <b>Bianchi, S.M. (2011). “Family Change and Time Allocation in American Families”.</b> The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 638:21-44. The author analyzes how recent changes have altered American family life and have produced new challenges for working caregivers. Unpaid and paid work hours are averaged over all couples with children under age 18 and over the 2003–2008 American Time Use Survey data collections.</p>
</div>
<p>You can and should follow Dove on Twitter @madeformen.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the table.  The music note is so you can add a lullaby if your baby is cranky.  There is a pile of diapers already stocked in the table (on the right).  The TV screen you can see is in the middle and the hand on the top right let&#8217;s you compete with other Dads to see who can complete the diaper change the quickest.  The ranking is on the left of the TV screen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s smart, it&#8217;s cool, and it&#8217;s fun!</p>

With St. Patrick’s Day here this weekend, did you prepare any “Green Eggs and Ham” for the kids (or for yourself) for Sunday brunch?</p>
<p>The Egg Farmers of Ontario sent across a recipe for Green Eggs and Ham (or Green Eggs and Tofu-Ham in our home, including directions on how to make your eggs shamrock green (which would be a great family activity!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When was the last time you ripped open a bag of <a title="Sweetpea Organic Cookies" href="http://www.sweetpeababyfood.com/sweetpeababyfood.php">Sweetpea Organic Cookies</a>, served them for family, friends or guests, and had any leftover to be eaten later?  Probably not very often.   These cookies, if you have not tried them before, are addictive.  They are great for what they have as much as for what they do not have.  If you have not tried them before, you might want to have a quick read below, to see what makes these cookies so unique, which will probably lead you to run out and pick up a bag of any (or all) of the 3 flavours of these cookies;</p>
<p><strong>Sweetpea Baby Food Organic Cookies</strong></p>
<p>1) They are for ages 1-101.  Really they are.  The cookies are flavourful, but certainly not overpowering.  If you freeze them, young kids can teethe on them, and if you put them out on a plate, the pretty flower pattern makes them look appealing.</p>
<p>2) The cookies are organic.</p>
<p>3) They are made from 100% whole grain organic ingredients.</p>
<p>4) They are dairy-free.</p>
<p>5) They were made without salt.</p>
<p>6) They do not contain eggs, preservatives or additives.</p>
<p>7) They are certified Kosher.</p>
<p>8) They are made in a peanut-free facility.</p>
<p>9) They come in resealable bags &#8211; so you might not want to &#8220;rip&#8221; open the bag unless you know there are not going to be any cookies left over.</p>
<p>Whew.</p>
<p>And the three flavours they currently come in are; Banana Pear, Pumpkin Spice and Sweet Apple.</p>
<p>As a parent, you can be comfortable having your nanny leave out cookies for your children and for their playdates because they do not have much of what children are allergic to &#8211; nuts, eggs, dairy and they also cover off dietary restrictions by being certified Kosher.  The fact they taste great is secondary to their appeal across the masses, but is also what keeps people from buying them over and over again.</p>
<p>Did I mention that the packaging rocks!</p>
<p>Have a look;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://urbandaddy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cookiesweetappleimage.jpg?w=340&#038;h=432" width="340" height="432" /><img alt="" src="http://urbandaddy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cookiepumpkinspiceimage.jpg?w=360&#038;h=432" width="360" height="432" /><img alt="" src="http://urbandaddy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/cookiebananapearimage.jpg?w=361&#038;h=432" width="361" height="432" /></p>
<p>What parent wouldn&#8217;t want these in their house?</p>
<p>If all the information I provided above has not convinced you to try these cookies, I dropped by the <a title="Sweatpea Baby Food" href="http://www.sweetpeababyfood.com/sweetpeababyfood.php">Sweetpea website, </a>and pulled off some nutritional information which you certainly will find interesting as it relates to the flavours and ingredients chosen to go into the cookies.</p>
<p>Sweet Apple:</p>
<ul>
<li>When added to food, cinnamon inhibits bacterial growth and food spoilage.</li>
<li>Whole grain spelt flour has a higher protein content than normal wheat grown under similar conditions</li>
<li>Eating organic snacks ensures your child&#8217;s diet is free from harmful herbicides, pesticides and fungicides.</li>
</ul>
<p>Banana Pear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bananas are rich in vitamin B6 and are a good source of fiber, vitamin C and magnesium</li>
<li>Pears are an excellent source of water-soluble fiber</li>
<li>Canada&#8217;s new <a class="zem_slink" title="List of nutrition guides" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nutrition_guides" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Food Guide</a> recommends that at least half of your grain consumption daily is whole grains &#8211; which contain phytonutrients (plant chemicals that fight disease).</li>
</ul>
<p>Pumpkin Spice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pumpkins are a rich source of potassium</li>
<li>Spelt is a nutritious source of B2, manganese, niacin, thiamin and copper.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow Sweetpea Baby Food and Organic Snacks on Facebook <a title="Sweatpea on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sweetpea-Baby-Food-and-Organic-Snacks/130671103640774">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for some cookies right about now, but cannot choose between the flavours, so I think I&#8217;m going to have to open a bag of each flavour, mix them all together and just enjoy what comes next, one cookie at a time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Weblog_Awards.png" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="logotype of The Weblog Awards (Bloggies)" alt="logotype of The Weblog Awards (Bloggies)" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/The_Weblog_Awards.png/300px-The_Weblog_Awards.png" width="300" height="46" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">logotype of The Weblog Awards (Bloggies) (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure how this happened, or how I missed this but a couple of weeks ago I noticed a massive spike in readership here at The Urban Daddy and after a very quick check of my statistics I came to realize that I had a whole bunch of new readers coming to see me from <a title="The Bloggies" href="http://2013.bloggi.es/">The 2013 Weblog Awards aka The Bloggies</a>.</p>
<p>The specific reason for the increased traffic was because many folks were dropping by to learn more about this blog which was nominated, and made it to the finals of the 2013 Weblog Awards in the following two categories.</p>
<p>Best Parenting or Family Weblog<br />
Best Canadian Weblog</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a big fan of the Bloggies because of their global coverage and I looked through many of the other blogs who made the finals in their respective categories and there are some pretty awesome blogs out there being written by some pretty amazing writers. Being nominated is really great, as I&#8217;ve said before after being nominated for the Canadian Weblog Awards, it&#8217;s great just to be nominated.  That someone other than myself has taken the time to put forward my URL is quite humbling. (thanks Mom!).</p>
<p>But now I need your help, and I need it quickly! I don&#8217;t normally beg or ask for favours but I&#8217;m going to do both today. I need your vote! Please.</p>
<p>Voting for the 2013 Bloggies closes on March 17th, and all you need to do in order to vote for me (or someone else if you like them better) is follow the link to their website, <a title="2013 Bloggies" href="http://2013.bloggi.es/">here</a>, then vote for at least 3 blogs, enter the security code and your email and you are almost done. You will receive an email from The Bloggies to ensure you are legitimate, and once you confirm that, your vote goes through. Nice and easy!</p>
<p>But remember to only vote once, please. If you vote more than once, the awards use your most recent vote.  We don&#8217;t want to waste your time now, do we?</p>
<p>Then, after that has been completed, you can sit back until the 24th of March, at which time you can Watch the Ceremony from 8:00-10:30 PM EST (UTC-5) on the<a title="Bloggies on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/Bloggies"> Bloggies’ Twitter feed </a>and <a title="Bloggies on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/bloggies">Facebook page</a>. One winner will be announced approximately every five minutes, culminating with the Weblog of the Year at 10:30, at which point the winners will be posted to the site. Follow the feed to keep up to date on the Bloggies!</p>
<p>If you are able to take the time to vote, I appreciate it. Heck, I&#8217;m happy that you even come by, subscribe and &#8220;like&#8221; my blog.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57958712@N00/6843309597" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="Giorgio Mammoliti speaks to reporters" alt="Giorgio Mammoliti speaks to reporters" src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7009/6843309597_47d6dc7d91_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Giorgio Mammoliti speaks to reporters (Photo credit: hyfen)</p></div>
<p>When Toronto City Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti alleged he, Mayor Rob Ford and other &#8220;right-wing&#8221; councillors at Toronto City Hall have been victims of a &#8220;left-wing conspiracy”, everybody laughed.  When Mammoliti said that a preliminary investigation he has conducted has pointed to a group of people “out to do some damage, personal damage” to the right-wing councillors on City Council, people again laughed and thought Mammoliti was going crazy.</p>
<p>A former member of Mayor Rob Ford’s executive committee, Mammoliti claimed that he has been followed by private citizens here in Toronto and that his home and office phones have been tapped.  He raised the question about just how badly do the left-wing councillors really want him, Ford and the other right-of-centre councillors out of office, replaced with the free-spending, union-loving, tax-the-rich, left-leaning council which almost brought Toronto into bankruptcy.  (Insert Olivia Chow here).</p>
<p>Mammoliti revealed that an investigation has pointed to a number of key suspects; city councillors, private citizens, lawyers in this city, who have united together to ruin the reputation of the right-wing candidates, force the public to sour on them and run them right out of office and we need to look no closer than the legal actions brought against Mayor Rob Ford by a private citizen &#8211; a very pro-NDP citizen, no less &#8211; which was handled pro-bono by another pro-left-wing lawyer in Toronto, Clayton Ruby.  This legal action resulted in the temporary removal of the Mayor from office and tarnished his reputation.  The citizen who was the front-man of this lawsuit and his lawyer were eagerly expecting the Mayor to cover the court costs, around $150,000.00, however, upon winning the appeal Ford had gone to the court to ask his costs be covered by this duo.  They in turn have asked Ford to cover the costs by taking the money from the taxpayers of Toronto, stating the individual who brought the case against Ford does not have those kinds of funds.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also waiting to see if lawyer Clayton Ruby is going to follow through on his pledge to waste more taxpayers money and take the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.  This case is that important but it&#8217;s not going to challenge the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is it??</p>
<p>So what do you make of this conspiracy?</p>
<p>Following this failed attempt to remove Ford from office, came an audit of his 2010 election funding in which Ford over-spent by $40,000.00.  Yes, he kept very detailed books and records and the auditor was impressed by that, and yes there was no further action against him, but I&#8217;m sure every single Councillor would be in contravention of the Elections Act if scrutinized by audit.  Where are the other audits of team lefty?  Oh, yeah.  Not in Toronto.</p>
<p>Did you know Mammoliti is also up against the same audit?</p>
<p>What about the audit of George Smitherman when he ran for Mayor?  He promised to reveal who donated to him campaign but never did.  Something to hide, maybe?</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s move on to the conspiracy&#8230;</p>
<p>When Mayor Ford announced (for probably the 50th time) that he was seeking right-leaning (fiscally Conservative) citizens to run in the next election, in order to get better traction on some of his ideas to reel in spending, cut costs and reduce duplication of services, the cries from the left were deafening.  I think the most critical of them all, Adam Vaughan, wanted to haul Ford before some panel or committee or something, yet again, to be slapped on the wrist.  Apparently it&#8217;s in bad taste to say it, but it&#8217;s okay to skulk around with your left-wing colleagues to find ways to overthrow the Mayor.</p>
<p>Mammoliti mentioned specific knowledge of secret meetings of left-wing councillors and their &#8220;inner circle&#8221; with their plans to run the &#8220;righties&#8221; out of City Hall and that&#8230; Well, that is okay.</p>
<p>So as the crack researcher that I pretend to be, I have uncovered their plans and compiled a list of the top thirteen items on the secret agenda of these left-wing councillors.</p>
<p>13. Hire unionized workers at $85.00/hour to remove all the doors at City Hall which open to the right and re-hang them so they open on the left.</p>
<p>12. Re-name any streets in the Greater Toronto Area which bear the name &#8220;Ford&#8221; to &#8220;Fraud&#8221;.</p>
<p>11. Create their own newspaper aimed at reporting items supported by the left and trashing any thoughts or suggestions by the right. Oops, that one was done already in triplicate; Toronto Star, NOW magazine and the Grid.</p>
<p>10.  Move to teach children left-wing socialist views at schools and institutions of higher-learning.  Oops.  That already happens too&#8230;</p>
<p>9.   Remove the term &#8220;Right of Way&#8221; from the Highway Traffic Act and replace it with &#8220;Wrong Way&#8221;.</p>
<p>8.   Pressure Ford Canada to rename its Canadian operations and to give its unionized workforce the credit they deserve, so all cars coming from their factories will cost $350,000.00 each, but a wealth tax on the rich will bring the price down to $45,000.00.</p>
<p>7.   Bringing in a fat tax aimed to penalize fat people, especially ones who take office and do not lose weight like David Miller did.</p>
<p>6.   Ban football in Toronto.</p>
<p>5.   After sending that CBC &#8220;comic&#8221; Marg whatever her name is to harass Ford on his driveway, the lefties are lining up more characters to disrupt Ford&#8217;s personal life including; Doink the Clown, David Suziki, ummm, other famous left-wing Canadiens like Brandon Prust, Max Pacioretty and Travis Moen, and the gravy train and a few others&#8230;  If they&#8217;re smart, however, they will stay out of Ford&#8217;s backyard.</p>
<p>4.    Toronto will implement a new wealth tax on all citizens making more than $65,000.00 a year (politicians exempted) and the new tax will be call the &#8220;Open your Wallet&#8221; tax whereby those rich bastards &#8211; damn them for getting educated and working hard to earn money and pay taxes &#8211; will pay to ensure that Toronto&#8217;s lowest class are able to move into Forest Hill or the Bridle Path like everyone else.</p>
<p>3.   Shows like AM640, SunTV and the like will come with disclaimers warning the risks associated with their dangerous, fiscally conservative views.</p>
<p>2.   Left-wing media will post unflattering pictures of Ford everywhere, including putting his head on top of a naked body in order to&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t know why they did that actually&#8230;</p>
<p>1.   The number one thing that the secret left-wing group will do is to continue to pester and harass all the right-wing candidates in Toronto, in Ontario and in Canada and turn all the moderates into fiscally Conservatives resulting in right-wing political leaders at all three levels of government for a long time.  This secret operative will forever be known as Operation backfire.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be many new jokes as a result of this secret plan, such as; &#8220;How many socialist, left-wing people does it to take down Mayor Rob Ford?&#8221;  Answer:  We&#8217;re not sure yet.</p>
