&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Servings:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 to 2 cups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time in the Kitchen:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 to 20 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a recipe for coconut butter. After all, coconut butter only contains one ingredient: coconut. And to make coconut butter, you only do one thing: blend. What you do need, are these 10 no-fail tips for making the best coconut butter ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #1:&lt;/b&gt; Buy unsweetened, dried coconut, either shredded or flakes. The flakes often turn into a smoother butter than shredded coconut does. Do not use desiccated, sweetened, reduced fat or fresh coconut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #2:&lt;/b&gt; Both a food processor and a high-powdered blender (like a Vitamix) can make coconut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-36084"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros of using a food processor: It’s easier to make smaller batches in a food processor and you don’t have to scrape the sides down much. It’s also easier to scrape the finished butter out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons of using a food processor: Takes longer and sometimes the butter isn’t quite as smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros of using a high-powered blender: Takes a shorter amount of time and can result in a smoother butter. You can make larger batches, but should add the coconut flakes a few cups at a time as you blend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons of using a high-powered blender: You have to scrape down the sides/push the flakes down more often. Some blenders get really hot and burn out if too much coconut is added at once. It’s harder to remove the finished butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #3:&lt;/b&gt; Put at least 4 cups (or 7 ounces/200g) of coconut flakes/shreds into your food processor/blender. Less than that and it’s hard to get the right consistency. This will make between 1 to 2 cups of butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="ingredient" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/ingredient.jpg" width="540" height="382" title="10 Tips for Making the Best Coconut Butter Ever" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #4:&lt;/b&gt; Be patient. The coconut needs to be blended for 15 to 20 minutes in a food processor and half that amount of time or even less in a blender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step1 7" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step1-7.jpg" width="540" height="380" title="10 Tips for Making the Best Coconut Butter Ever" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #5:&lt;/b&gt; Stop and scrape down the sides of the machine as needed if the blade isn’t catching and blending the coconut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #6:&lt;/b&gt; The coconut will go through three stages on its way to turning into butter. First the texture will be finely shredded, then thin out into a grainy liquid, then finally turn into a smooth, thick liquid. The finished butter will seem runny, but when you taste it the texture will be like thick, sticky, slightly grainy peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step2 7" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step2-7.jpg" width="540" height="392" title="10 Tips for Making the Best Coconut Butter Ever" /&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step3 3" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step3-3.jpg" width="540" height="360" title="10 Tips for Making the Best Coconut Butter Ever" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #7:&lt;/b&gt; Pour the butter into a glass jar and let it cool to room temperature so it has a solid but spreadable consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #8:&lt;/b&gt; Cover the jar with a lid and store at room temperature. There is no need to refrigerate coconut butter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #9:&lt;/b&gt; Warming the coconut butter up just slightly (10 seconds in the microwave) makes the texture smoother and softer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip #10:&lt;/b&gt;  Enjoy the flavor and health benefits of coconut butter in a million different ways. Eat it with a spoon or blend it into coffee and smoothies. Add it to curries. Mash it into roasted vegetables. Spread onto pancakes. Dip dark chocolate into coconut butter for dessert. Combine it with almond butter.  Flavor it with sea salt, cinnamon or vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One taste and you’ll immediately realize that its incredibly rich texture and intense flavor sets coconut butter apart from &lt;a title="The Wonderful World of Coconut Products" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-wonderful-world-of-coconut-products/ "&gt;other forms of coconut&lt;/a&gt;. If you love coconut, watch out. This stuff’s addictive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s Friday, everyone! And that means another &lt;a title="Success Stories" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/success-story-summaries/"&gt;Primal Blueprint Real Life Story&lt;/a&gt; from a Mark&amp;#8217;s Daily Apple reader.

I’ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Primal Blueprint Real Life Story" alt="real life stories stories 1 2" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA2009/real_life_stories_stories-1-2.jpg" width="320" height="240" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s is a special edition of Primal Blueprint Real Life Stories. Last year, I put out a call for people to &lt;a title="Success Stories in the Making: The Big Unveil  " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/success-stories-in-the-making-the-big-unveil/"&gt;make a public commitment to going Primal in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. Over 500 Mark&amp;#8217;s Daily Apple readers joined the &amp;#8220;Success Story in the Making&amp;#8221; challenge, submitting their personal goals, before photos, and updates throughout the year. At the beginning of this year, I reached out to the participants to see how they were doing, and the results were impressive. While it&amp;#8217;s an ongoing journey for many of them (&lt;a title="It's a Journey, Not a Race" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/its-a-journey-not-a-race/"&gt;all of us!&lt;/a&gt;), the stories were familiar: weight lost, energy gained, illness overcome. Some of the participants were gracious enough to share their stories for an eBook I&amp;#8217;ve put together. You can get it for free as a newsletter subscriber (see the details below). The following story from 26 year old Ganeesha is one of the inspiring stories included in the eBook. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-36058"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First Submission &amp;#8211; January 7, 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m Ganeesha. I&amp;#8217;m 26. I&amp;#8217;m Trinidadian. I&amp;#8217;m a primary school teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal for 2012 is twofold. First, I intend to kick my asthma&amp;#8217;s ass. Second, I want to do it while getting back to the size I was most comfortable at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want to do it while keeping butter, bacon and play in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to Groking Out for the rest of my life &lt;img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt="icon smile" class='wp-smiley' title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first pic is what I looked like for all of 2011. I was 190 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Ganeesha2011 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Ganeesha2011-1.jpg" width="540" height="720" title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went Primal at the end of November, but could not say no to corn until January 1st. I&amp;#8217;ve lost 15 lbs so far. I&amp;#8217;m 175 lbs right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second pic is a picture of me 5 years ago, strutting (or at least not wobbling) my stuff down a runway in Barbados. I was 145 lbs. That&amp;#8217;s what I want to be again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="GaneeshaBarbados 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/GaneeshaBarbados-1.jpg" width="537" height="800" title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Second Submission &amp;#8211; April 5, 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot believe the way my body has changed. Before I went fully Primal, I had lost about 15 pounds. Since January however, I have lost a further 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve lost 40 lbs. And I feel freakin AWESOME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Ganeesha April2012 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Ganeesha_April2012-1.jpg" width="540" height="720" title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asthma&amp;#8217;s ass has been successfully kicked. Asthma was the symptom, not the problem. The problem was gluten. Turns out, I&amp;#8217;m allergic. :-s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined a gym. I go to spin once a week, twice if I&amp;#8217;m being extra hyper. I do a bit of weight training as well. And most notably, I did my first ever push up. Laugh all u want, I&amp;#8217;m proud. &lt;img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt="icon biggrin" class='wp-smiley' title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;  Since I joined the gym, my weight loss slowed down, but my fat loss continued. I&amp;#8217;m still losing inches and I have teeny baby muscles starting to form. God, It feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t, I CAN&amp;#8217;T go back. My skin has cleared up, I have all my energy back, I can breathe normally, even my work performance has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family is catching on too. I&amp;#8217;ve put them all on to MDA. They&amp;#8217;re still trying to wrap their minds around &amp;#8220;No grains? EVER?&amp;#8221; (We&amp;#8217;re big on pasta and rice). But they&amp;#8217;re making the effort to improve their health and they&amp;#8217;ll get there. Eventually. I hope. Maybe my whole generation will escape diabetes. *crosses fingers*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot thank all of you at MDA enough. I&amp;#8217;m beside myself. I&amp;#8217;m happier than I have been in years. And it&amp;#8217;s because I found this. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ganeesha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Now that I&amp;#8217;ve gotten this far, I&amp;#8217;m going to spend the next 90 days trying to convince myself that &amp;#8220;moderation&amp;#8221; also applies to cheesecake and dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Third Submission &amp;#8211; July 7, 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own case, My weight has stabilized at around 150 lbs. Since April however, I&amp;#8217;ve lost some more inches. My waist, for example, has gone from 30&amp;#8243; to 28&amp;#8243;. This time last year 28&amp;#8243; was the circumference of one of my thighs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year, for the first time, I will be putting on a costume and playing mas for Trinidad carnival. I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to for years. Now, I can. I&amp;#8217;ll look fantastic, but more importantly, I&amp;#8217;ll have the stamina to dance in the street for 2 days straight. &lt;img src='http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt="icon biggrin" class='wp-smiley' title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not as disciplined as I would like to be with exercising, but I go to spin class, or dive in a pool once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just feel so good about everything; I feel healthy, energetic, and so freaking HAPPY all the time, that I want to practically evangelize from the rooftops about Primal Living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have my own little tribe of cavemen. It&amp;#8217;s about 10 of us (friends and family) who follow Primal Blueprint now. The results are astounding. My uncle has lost 25 lbs. My best friend has lost 30. My cousin&amp;#8217;s weight has remained the same but his muscles are ripping out! We&amp;#8217;re a sexy little Primal Tribe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s awesome. I&amp;#8217;m always so inspired by &lt;a title="Success Story Summaries" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/category/success-story-summaries/"&gt;the stories&lt;/a&gt; I see on MDA, and I&amp;#8217;ve gotten to pass that inspiration on to others. I kind of feel like a Superhero!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, thank you, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;eBook Submission &amp;#8211; March 18, 2013&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What were your goals in 2012?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to feel like I owned my body again. I wanted to be able to lead my class by example during PE and run around with them. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to end up in the hospital wheezing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Why did you decide to go Primal, and what exactly was your plan to accomplish your goals in 2012?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &amp;#8220;asthma&amp;#8221; attacks landed me in the hospital 5 times in 2011, I&amp;#8217;d had enough. I knew something was wrong so I saw a doctor. My blood tests showed that at 26 I was pre-diabetic and pre-hypertensive. At 190 lbs, I was borderline obese. I was told that if I didn&amp;#8217;t change my habits I would have diabetes, hypertension and heart problems before I hit 40. (All 3 run in my family.) I was instructed to give up gluten immediately (since it was an allergy to this, and not asthma, which was causing my breathing issues), along with meat, dairy, coffee, and everything else I loved. I politely refused to ever give up meat in favour of flavoured soya chunks and sought out a plan that better suited my palate. I stumbled upon a blog entry that began, &amp;#8220;What do you feed a lion?&amp;#8221; Grok stole my heart&amp;#8230; And stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How successful were you in sticking with your plan?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the occasional cheesecake slice or scoop of chocolate-caramel-pralines ice cream, I&amp;#8217;ve had no problem sticking with my primal plan. At first, I can&amp;#8217;t lie, tears were shed over the loss of bread. After about a week though, I stopped noticing the smell. Through a happy accident involving dried fruit in the spice cupboard, I now crave raisins every time I smell Cinnabon. I&amp;#8217;ve lost 50 pounds so far, going from 190 to 140. I&amp;#8217;m still working on my 6 pack, but my legs are amazing! Who knew this body was hiding under there all this time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Ganeesha2 DEC2012 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Ganeesha2_DEC2012-1.jpg" width="540" height="720" title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Ganeesha DEC2012 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Ganeesha_DEC2012-1.jpg" width="540" height="720" title="I Cannot Believe the Way My Body Has Changed" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your biggest hurdles, and how did you overcome them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly? My biggest hurdle wasn&amp;#8217;t dietary. I had no problems adjusting to caveman food (apart from the aforementioned bread tears). It was getting off my ass. I had to really kick my own behind to start spin class. I started walking everywhere. I lived at the top of a hill for a while, so I made it my business to walk it every day. When I moved, I started doing sprints once a week. I currently do my own version of Shaun T&amp;#8217;s Insanity (in my version, I only do it 3 times a week and almost never go past 30 minutes. I&amp;#8217;m not trying to pass out on the floor or cry after a workout here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your biggest accomplishment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a Primal Evangelist. My whole life has become so much more organised since I went primal. I graduated from university, I&amp;#8217;m more effective as a teacher (I&amp;#8217;m as energetic as my 11 year olds!), I&amp;#8217;m taking better care of myself and it shows&amp;#8230; and it spreads. Several of my friends and family members are now Primal as well (my best friend, Saidi, lost 50 pounds too!), and we have our own little tribe, swapping recipes, stories and inspiration all over the place! It really is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did your average daily meal plan consist of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On mornings, I have coffee with a pinch of sugar. If I have breakfast, it&amp;#8217;s usually a layered omelette (egg, bacon, cheese, random vegetable, another egg on top). Lunch is more often than not a big salad with lamb, chicken or fish. Dinner is usually a bunch of vegetables tossed in a pot with whatever seasonings I feel like (but always including cayenne and cumin) and whatever meat is closest at hand. When I feel like dessert, there&amp;#8217;s always fruit available and when I&amp;#8217;m celebrating, I have cheesecake. Because sometimes I want to indulge, dammit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did your average weekly exercise routine consist of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it&amp;#8217;s Capture the Flag. Sometimes, Cops and Robbers. Sometimes, I swim, or run, or just walk around my neighbourhood for a while. As mentioned before, I do pseudo-Insanity 3 times a week and sprints once a week. After that, it&amp;#8217;s all play and leisure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else did you change in 2012 (sleep, sun, stress management,etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since going Primal, things sort of fell into place. I became less stressed. I sleep better. I read more. I have a constant level of energy that wanes around 10 pm and I just go to sleep. I hardly ever watch tv now. I go to the beach after work sometimes (and almost every weekend) and just relax. My body&amp;#8217;s happier than it&amp;#8217;s ever been and I think because of that, my mind is at ease.  I just enjoy life now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; What are your goals for 2013 and beyond?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m happy with my life exactly the way it is. I just want to maintain that. I&amp;#8217;m compelled to keep moving and keep healthy. I do want to organise some Primal Island recipes, that is, adapt some Primal recipes to a Caribbean ingredient list. I keep telling people about the Primal life and hopefully I can convince even more that this is the way we were meant to be. We don&amp;#8217;t have to be shaped by our family history. We can change our own lives, bodies and destinies through our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you would like to share?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a primary school teacher. My class used to get excited about pizza. Now they scoff at it and encourage their parents to make them salads for lunch. They swap ideas and recipes for that and bring fruits, nuts and veggies to school as snacks. Not all the time, but hey, it&amp;#8217;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We face fear daily. Maybe you’re afraid to ask your boss for that pay raise, or maybe you’re making a big life decision. But a not so obvious way fear may be creeping into your life to sabotage your efforts for a healthier lifestyle is in your movement. Whether you’re wanting to begin a new fitness routine or are a seasoned mover, it’s worth your time to evaluate how fear could be preventing you from reaching your full potential. Confronting that fear can help you reach your goals and bring you to the next level of your training. Let’s look at some &lt;strong&gt;common fears that could be preventing you from getting and staying active&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-36032"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fear of Failure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when you were a kid, and you felt invincible? You would try almost anything, and if you failed, you would bounce back up without blinking twice. Somewhere along the way, most of us lost a great deal of that resilience and have become scared to move!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we fail at something we thought we would be able to do? Failure has a bad reputation. Everyone fails, yet we are all afraid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this inner dialogue sound familiar to anyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should really be able to do a push up&amp;#8230;I know I used to do lots of push ups, but now I don’t think I can do any. I don’t want to fail, so I don’t want to try. I’d rather do something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a thought process called &lt;a title="Wikipedia: Self-handicapping" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping" target="_blank"&gt;self-handicapping&lt;/a&gt;. I have to admit, this one gets me. I practice &lt;a title="True Nature Training" href="http://www.truenaturetraining.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Parkour and natural movement&lt;/a&gt; which both contain some scary skills. When I am placed in a situation where I am surrounded by practitioners who are much more experienced than I am, my first reaction is to go into self-preservation mode, so I can avoid revealing that I may not be able to do something. Since becoming aware of this behavior pattern, I can more easily recognize when I am doing it, confront it, drop the ego, and try! It is amazing how much you can accomplish when you get out of your own way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Action:&lt;/strong&gt; The key here is letting go of the ego, and developing a playful and positive attitude. Robert Allen reminds us that “There is no failure. Only feedback.” So feedback, then, will always be a part of everyone’s life in some way. You have to choose to accept this feedback as a part of the human condition. You have to start somewhere. Wherever you are, it’s okay. Take charge of your path of improvement. When you do this, you will surprise yourself with how much room for success you create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fear of Judgement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. To some of the general population, some of the primal movements can seem strange and even child-like. (Little do they know, kids have had it right the whole time!) Climbing a tree, or rolling in the grass can be viewed as activities for kids, and adults should act like adults, not kids. I suppose that means contained in their cubicles, and not free in trees. But what is more natural than crawling in some grass, lifting logs and jumping on rocks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether we are conscious of it or not, we all seek acceptance from our communities. It’s common to fear rejection from your peers if you are doing something outside of the box, and outside of the general population’s scope of what working out should look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Action:&lt;/strong&gt; A remedy for this fear is working out/playing with a group of people. Starting a &lt;a title="Start a Meetup Group" href="http://www.meetup.com/find/" target="_blank"&gt;MeetUp&lt;/a&gt; group is an excellent way to find others interested in joining in on some primal playouts. Schedule group hikes, bring in local primal fitness experts, or get together a game of Ultimate Frisbee with your group. You might draw more attention with a larger group, but now you have the validation of an entire group of people with you. You also develop a stronger community, which in turn helps spread the word of living a Primal lifestyle. People may judge, but in the grand scope of things, you are working towards lifelong health and that trumps any judgment others may have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fear of Injury&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a movement can literally just be scary. The fear of going for that tall box jump, balancing high off the ground, or going for that huge lift can be a scary experience. No one wants injury, and when going into unknown territory, well&amp;#8230;the outcome is unknown. To &lt;a title="Choose Not To Fall " href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSOe-rDa9Y" target="_blank"&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; Daniel Ilabaca: “If you’re afraid to fall, you fall because you’re afraid.” If you approach a task with fear, you are preparing to fall instead of preparing to succeed. Expectations are extremely powerful. Predicting that you are going to drop the weight makes you much more likely to make that come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid creating self-fulfilling prophecies by becoming mindful. Meditate regularly, and when you are preparing to try something new, take some deep breaths, imagine yourself succeeding, and stay focused. This mindfulness can greatly help you avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Progress skills properly. For example, precision jumps can be scary, yet when progressed correctly, are a great skill to practice. Begin by grabbing a couple of 2x4s and set them parallel to each other with only a foot or two distance. Practice jumping between the two and landing on the balls of your feet and absorbing through your legs to make a quiet landing. As you get comfortable with the distance, you can increase the distance between the 2&amp;#215;4’s. As the distance to your landing increases, the more important it is to have a parabolic jump. This means your jump’s path through the air should be rainbow shaped versus too horizontal. Not having this parabolic motion can cause an unstable landing surface to slip beneath your feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="JumpSeries" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/JumpSeries.jpg" width="540" height="180" title="3 Types of Fear That May Be Keeping You from Getting Fit (and How to Overcome Them)" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to prevent injury is to have an exit strategy. What happens if mid-jump you discover you aren’t going to make it? How are you going to land? How far will you fall? How will you stop your momentum safely? Try your exit strategy before going for the actual skill. Then when you really go for it, you know how to bail out of it if you aren’t quite there yet. Practicing this exit strategy will take away some of that fear of injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Take-Away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the more often you face your fears, the better you will become at recognizing when fear is present, and knowing how to breeze past it. Starting is always the hardest part, and seeking help from those in your community is an excellent way to start. If you are looking for a place to start, you can look towards MeetUp groups, or even come join us for &lt;a title="PrimalCon Austin 2013" href="http://primalblueprint.com/products/PrimalCon-Austin-2013.html" target="_blank"&gt;PrimalCon Austin&lt;/a&gt; this June to meet a group of welcoming and trusting people to kick start your Primal lifestyle efforts again! You will meet so many interesting presenters and attendees you will leave feeling energized and motivated to face your fears and find freedom of movement again. I will be there, and hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carnitine is found in red meat, mostly, as well as &lt;a title="The Definitive Guide to Dairy" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dairy-intolerance/#axzz2Q1fbPgs0"&gt;dairy&lt;/a&gt;, tempeh, and some other &lt;a title="In Defense of Meat Eaters, Part 1: The Evolutionary Angle   " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/meat-eating-human-evolution/#axzz2Q1fmI9dY"&gt;meats&lt;/a&gt;, and it performs a number of important roles in the human body, foremost of which is the transportation of fatty acids into the &lt;a title="Managing Your Mitochondria" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/managing-your-mitochondria/"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; for breakdown into useable energy. It’s so important to basic function that we make endogenous carnitine by synthesizing it from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Vegans and vegetarians, who tend to run deficient in carnitine, &lt;a title="Systemic carnitine deficiency exacerbated by a strict vegetarian diet." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6703771" target="_blank"&gt;benefit greatly from supplementation&lt;/a&gt; (or a nice steak). It’s even been used to reduce atherosclerosis (&lt;a title="L-carnitine prevents the progression of atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11529691" target="_blank"&gt;albeit in rabbits&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a title="Propionyl-L-carnitine improves endothelial function, microcirculation and pain management in critical limb ischemia." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936457" target="_blank"&gt;improve arterial function&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a title="L-carnitine treatment for congestive heart failure--experimental and clinical study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1538579" target="_blank"&gt;help heart failure patients recover&lt;/a&gt;. Carnitine is not some evil compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-36046"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, &lt;a title="Intestina microbiota metaboism of l-carnitine,a nutrient in red meat, promotes atheroscerosis" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/134715081/nm-3145" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;#8217;s get into it. It consisted of several sections, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they fed humans eight ounce steaks (amounting to roughly 180 mg carnitine) with a side of 250 mg carnitine tabs. Omnivores showed increased blood and urine levels of Trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), a compound associated with cardiovascular disease, while vegetarians and vegans (who were somehow &lt;a title="How to Eat Meat: Transitioning Away from Vegetarianism" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-eat-meat-transitioning-away-from-vegetarianism/"&gt;able to get the steak down&lt;/a&gt;) showed far lower levels of TMAO in their blood and urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, they tested what was producing the TMAO by administering antibiotics. Eliminating gut flora populations with antibiotics also eliminated the food-induced increase in TMAO, showing that the intestinal microbiota were metabolizing carnitine into TMAO. After allowing the subjects’ guts to repopulate, they ate more steak. The increase in TMAO after eating steak reappeared, confirming that gut flora metabolism of carnitine was responsible. Subjects with higher levels of Prevotella bacteria in their guts saw the biggest increases in TMAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As it turns out, gut flora convert carnitine to TMA, which the liver then converts to TMAO using a hepatic enzyme called FMO3, but it’s easier to just say carnitine converts to TMAO.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also tested ApoE-deficient mice and got similar results. Feeding mice carnitine increased TMAO levels in serum and doubled arterial plaque formation over control, while giving antibiotics abolished this effect. So, in a certain strain of mice, dietary carnitine increases TMAO levels, which accelerates atherosclerosis. If you recall from this week’s Dear Mark, &lt;a title="Dear Mark: ApoE4, Red Eye Recovery, TEDx Paleo Debunking, and Cough Drops" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/apoe4-allele-jet-lag-tedx-paleo-debunking-cough-drops/"&gt;ApoE status&lt;/a&gt; is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk, and these mice were totally deficient in it. They were bred to be extremely sensitive to atherosclerosis in order to facilitate research. It&amp;#8217;s a common and useful tool &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not like they&amp;#8217;re trying to pull a fast one &amp;#8211; but we should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also examined how TMAO increases atherosclerosis in mice: by reducing reverse cholesterol transport. In other words, it impaired the mouse’s ability to remove cholesterol from the arterial wall without decreasing cholesterol uptake or synthesis to the same degree, creating a net surplus of cholesterol in the wall and speeding up atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before you unplug your chest freezer full of &lt;a title="The Differences Between Grass-Fed Beef and Grain-Fed Beef   " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-differences-between-grass-fed-beef-and-grain-fed-beef/"&gt;grass-fed beef&lt;/a&gt; and start buying &lt;a title="The Problems with Modern Wheat" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-problems-with-modern-wheat/"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt; futures, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The initial association between TMAO and cardiovascular disease in humans is just that &amp;#8211; an association&lt;/strong&gt;. Causation is not established, and it may even be that cardiovascular disease or some other common event increases TMAO as a response to injury or disease. An increase in serum TMAO is, for example, a marker of certain kidney injuries (&lt;a title="Metabolomics in monitoring kidney transplants" href="http://www.metabolomics.ca/News/publications/MetabolomicsInMonitoringKidneyTransplants.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;). It could merely be correlation or even reverse causation. We simply don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t know if the experimental results in rodents apply to humans&lt;/strong&gt;. Sure, the omnivorous people who ate steak and took supplements saw an increase in serum TMAO, but &lt;a title="The Straight Dope on Cholesterol: 10 Things You Need to Know – Part 1   " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-10-things-you-need-to-know-part-1/#axzz2Q1joLljK"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; was not measured. The same mechanisms that affect ApoE-deficient mice may not apply to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was the gut flora, not the carnitine&lt;/strong&gt;. While subjects who typically ate meat saw the biggest increases in TMAO &amp;#8211; which the researchers saw as evidence of the gut flora adapting to the host diet &amp;#8211; and were characterized as having Prevotella-dominant guts, most evidence suggests that &lt;a title="Linking long-term dietary patterns with gut microbial enterotypes." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21885731?dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;holding=npg" target="_blank"&gt;Prevotella bacteria are associated with carbohydrate-rich diets&lt;/a&gt;. That said, &lt;a title="Gut microbial 'enterotypes' become less clear-cut" href="http://www.nature.com/news/gut-microbial-enterotypes-become-less-clear-cut-1.10276#/b2" target="_blank"&gt;accumulating evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the hundreds of species living in our guts can’t be quite so easily and neatly cataloged or categorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know what else raises TMAO? Fish&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s right &amp;#8211; heart attack-inducing, artery-clogging, linked-to-every-disease-state-known-to-man fish actually contains TMA, the metabolite that converts to TMAO in the body.&lt;a title="What makes fish smell “fishy”?" href="http://www.nutrition.org/asn-blog/2011/08/is-fish-smelly/" target="_blank"&gt; TMA is what gives fish the “fishy smell&lt;/a&gt;,” and when people eat fish, &lt;a title="Dietary precursors of trimethylamine in man: a pilot study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10456680" target="_blank"&gt;urine TMAO increases&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, the &lt;a title="Fish consumption and CHD mortality: an updated meta-analysis of seventeen cohort studies." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21914258" target="_blank"&gt;latest research&lt;/a&gt; shows that fish is consistently associated with better cardiovascular health, not worse (despite the TMA content and effect on TMAO levels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMO3, which as you’ll recall from the parenthetical above is responsible for the conversion of TMA to TMAO, does things other than produce heart disease&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also involved in the &lt;a title="Oxidative metabolism of seleno-L-methionine to L-methionine selenoxide by flavin-containing monooxygenases." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17173378" target="_blank"&gt;metabolism of selenium&lt;/a&gt; (an important cardioprotective, thyroid-protective, and cancer-protective nutrient).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TMAO itself may not be “all bad.”&lt;/strong&gt; It’s an osmolyte &amp;#8211; a &lt;a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja004206b"&gt;protein stabilizer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s even been used to&lt;a href="http://www.molvis.org/molvis/v15/a299/"&gt; prevent cataract formation in mammalian eye lenses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choline, another important nutrient found in eggs, meat, dairy, and &lt;a title="6 Sneaky Ways to Work Offal Into Your Diet" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/6-sneaky-ways-to-work-offal-into-your-diet/"&gt;offal&lt;/a&gt; with a similar structure to carnitine, was shown a couple years ago to convert to TMAO after exposure to certain types of gut flora, causing researchers to suggest it too promotes atherosclerosis (see &lt;a title="Does Dietary Choline Contribute to Heart Disease?" href="http://www.westonaprice.org/blogs/cmasterjohn/2011/04/13/does-dietary-choline-contribute-to-heart-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Masterjohn&amp;#8217;s take on it&lt;/a&gt;). And yet eggs have been vindicated over and over again for their beneficial or neutral effects on heart health, including the most &lt;a title="Weekend Link Love" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/weekend-link-love-237/"&gt;recent one I mentioned this past Sunday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s complicated, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to discredit the results of this latest study; sufficient amounts of TMAO do appear to accelerate atherosclerosis in rodents. Impaired reverse &lt;a title="How to Interpret Cholesterol Test Results" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-interpret-cholesterol-test-results/#axzz2Q1joLljK"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; transport, which TMAO produces (again, in rodents),&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12957326"&gt; probably accelerates atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; regardless of species, all else being equal. We should definitely keep an eye on this and any other future research. I’m particularly interested in what this means for research into the effects of gut flora on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this admittedly interesting research is all very preliminary. Rodents bred to be especially sensitive to cardiovascular disease (ApoE-knockouts) develop atherosclerosis at twice the normal rate when exposed to TMAO in the diet and/or serum. That’s all that they’ve established. Humans with the right (wrong?) &lt;a title="Gut Flora and Your Healthy Immune System" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/gut-flora-healthy-immune-system/"&gt;gut flora&lt;/a&gt; composition also generate serum TMAO in response to dietary carnitine, but increased atherosclerosis has not been shown. And, contrary to their assumptions, a relationship between red meat (not processed meat) and cardiovascular disease has not been established in the literature. Quite the contrary: recent epidemiological evidence seems to &lt;a title="Dear Mark: Is Meat Going to Kill Me (Again)?  " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/processed-meat-death-mortality-study/#axzz2Q1kSd0Yd"&gt;exonerate&lt;/a&gt; the fresher, redder stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, this serves to underline (not undermine) the basic gist of the Primal eating philosophy. Eat a variety of foods. Don’t just eat steak. Eat fish, and eggs, and chicken liver, and pork chops. Don’t just eat meat. Eat vegetables. Eat probiotic-rich foods (probiotics have already been used to &lt;a title="Probiotic modulation of symbiotic gut microbial-host metabolic interactions in a humanized microbiome mouse model." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18197175?dopt=Abstract" target="_blank"&gt;lower TMAO&lt;/a&gt; levels, while &lt;a title="Inter- and intra-individual variations of urinary endogenous metabolites in healthy male college students using (1)H NMR spectroscopy." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19191725" target="_blank"&gt;kimchi consumption was said to account for the inter-individual differences in TMAO production&lt;/a&gt; in another study). Eat prebiotic-rich foods, so as to provide food for your gut and diversify the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last bit is key. We have to realize that it’s the gut flora modulating the effects of carnitine and TMAO &amp;#8211; not the carnitine (or red meat) itself. It may be that we Primal eaters (as if you could categorize us so easily) have the absolute worst kind of gut flora, the kind that produces TMA by the truckload to be carted off to the liver for conversion into TMAO, and we’re about to start dropping off like flies. But I doubt it. I think the way we eat is more likely to diversify our guts and give us a floral profile associated with better health, rather than worse. But we’ll see. We still have a lot to learn about what lurks &amp;#8211; and lives &amp;#8211; inside us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ll be inundated with other writers giving their thoughts today and in the near future, but these are my initial ones. Hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;

These are the teas which purport to help you unwind from a rough day, relax in the midst of exterior (or interior) chaos, and chill out in a state of relatively peaceful bliss. Many of us live in a state of &lt;a title="The Physical Toll of Negative Emotions" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-physical-toll-of-negative-emotions/"&gt;constant stress&lt;/a&gt; punctuated by bouts of acute but transient ease of mind, when it should be the other way around (constant ease of mind punctuated by bouts of &lt;a title="Hormesis: How Certain Kinds of Stress Can Actually Be Good for You" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/hormesis-how-certain-kinds-of-stress-can-actually-be-good-for-you/"&gt;acute but transient stress&lt;/a&gt;), and these teas and their ingredients claim to help you correct the imbalance. But supplement manufacturers say a lot of things, not all of them true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What works? What actually helps you ease troubled thoughts? What&amp;#8217;s actually worth your money and the time it takes to brew a cup of hot water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span id="more-35817"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For those who balk at the idea of &lt;a title=" Grok Didn’t Take Supplements So Why Should I?   " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-to-primal-supplementation/"&gt;supplementing an otherwise solid Primal eating plan&lt;/a&gt;, don&amp;#8217;t be so hasty in your dismissal. Modern life presents novel stressor after novel stressor after novel stressor. Not all of us spend blissed out lives at the beach, or on a remote mountaintop communing with nature, or floating through life on a cloud of bodhisattva farts. Life is hard and often unpleasant, and we don&amp;#8217;t get a lot of downtime these days. Smart use of select herbs and roots with &lt;a title="Wikipedia: Anxiolytic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiolytic" target="_blank"&gt;anxiolytic&lt;/a&gt;, calming, soothing, relaxing properties can go a long way toward restoring the Primal balance between active engagement with the hectic world and passive downtime. The way I see it is if we&amp;#8217;re trying to emulate the physiological, psychological, and &lt;a title="Spiritual Encounters in Nature" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/spiritual-encounters-in-nature/#axzz23HTckodo"&gt;spiritual state&lt;/a&gt; of human being established as &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; by natural selection, we may have to take a few extra steps to get there. Humans don&amp;#8217;t do very well under &lt;a title="Dear Mark: Matcha Tea, Runner’s High, Stress and Weight Gain, and Fasting for Teens" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-matcha-tea-runners-high-stress-and-weight-gain-and-fasting-for-teens/"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;, so mitigating supraphysiological stress by supraphysiological means (whether through &lt;a title="Mindful Eating: The Art of Being Present at the Dinner Table" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/mindful-eating-the-art-of-being-present-at-the-dinner-table/"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt; or chamomile or &lt;a title="The Restorative Power of the Personal Retreat" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/the-restorative-power-of-the-personal-retreat/"&gt;taking a plane to Hawaii&lt;/a&gt;) makes sense and is unabashedly Primal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ultimately, it&amp;#8217;s about feeling better and improving our health, no matter the means. I go with what works, regardless of some kind of ideology, using our human evolutionary heritage as a starting point and utilizing &lt;a title="When Science Trumps Grok" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/when-science-trumps-grok/"&gt;the best of 21st century technology&lt;/a&gt; to get real results with the least amount of pain, suffering and sacrifice as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some of these so-called stress relief tea ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kava Kava&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kava is a crop grown in the South Pacific. Traditionally, its roots were chewed fresh (with the resultant liquid often spit into communal bowls), pounded to release the moisture, or sun-dried, ground, and steeped in water to make an intoxicating, relaxing mild sedative. Nowadays, the active kavalactones are also extracted and pressed into capsules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Pacific cultures used kava, including those of Hawaii, Polynesia, Tonga, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea (to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s supposed to reduce anxiety, induce calmness, cause sedation without mental impairment, and generally chill a person out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. A Cochrane review concluded that kava extract is &lt;a title="Kava extract for treating anxiety." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12535473" target="_blank"&gt;effective against anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, while another &lt;a title="Neurocognitive effects of kava (Piper methysticum): a systematic review." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21437989" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; found that kava has no significant negative effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be some concern toward hepatotoxicity. The tendency of some supplement makers to use the leaves and sticks (which contain toxins) to increase yield may lead to hepatotoxicity, but the root itself appears reasonably safe. Preparation may also matter; traditionally, kava is prepared with water, whereas modern processing often uses alcohol. Water-based kava preparations extract different proportions of active compounds than alcohol-based kava preparations. For instance, water extracts glutathione (a powerful antioxidant that our bodies manufacture) from kava, whereas alcohol does not, and this could have ramifications for toxicity. Like many other psychoactive compounds, though, kava root should not be consumed with alcohol, prescription drugs, or any other substance which stresses the liver. Kava Kava root itself is non habit forming, and does not &lt;a title="Does a medicinal dose of kava impair driving? A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259514" target="_blank"&gt;appear to impair driving ability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com has several options available (&lt;a title="KAVA WAKA powder -1 LB- Fijian High Quality Kava" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A80163M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00A80163M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Premium Vanuatu Kava Kava Root Powder 16 oz (1 lb)" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EWUBUQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002EWUBUQ&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a title="Gaia Herbs Kava Kava" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036THN8E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0036THN8E&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer extracts), but there are also &lt;a title="KAVA KAVA PRODUCTS FROM AMERICA'S FIRST KAVA BAR" href="https://www.nakamalathome.com/" target="_blank"&gt;designated online vendors&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you stick with actual root (dried, ground, whole, or fresh) or supplements that only use the root and not the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;L-Theanine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amino acid found in tea leaves, especially &lt;a title="Dear Mark: To Tea or Not to Tea?" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/to-tea-or-not-to-tea/"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s technically been around for thousands of years, or as long as people have been harvesting and brewing tea (and even longer, unless you answer in the negative to &amp;#8220;If green tea grows in the forest and nobody brews it, does it still impart a healthy dose of L-theanine?&amp;#8221;), but it wasn&amp;#8217;t until 1949 that L-theanine was isolated and identified by Japanese scientists who proceeded to stick it into a variety of different products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L-theanine is promoted as a stress-relieving compound that binds to GABA receptors and induces changes in brain waves indicative of relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it appears to lower the negative effects of stress, reduce anxiety, and improve relaxation, as a quick look at the literature shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In adults subjected to psychological and physical stress, L-theanine &lt;a title="Effects of L-theanine or caffeine intake on changes in blood pressure under physical and psychological stresses." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107346" target="_blank"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; anxiety and attenuates the rise in blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In children with ADHD, L-theanine &lt;a title="The effects of L-theanine (Suntheanine®) on objective sleep quality in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22214254" target="_blank"&gt;improves sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with schizophrenia &lt;a title="L-theanine relieves positive, activation, and anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: an 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-center study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21208586" target="_blank"&gt;have found relief from anxiety&lt;/a&gt; using L-theanine, and the compound has been shown to increase &lt;a title="The neuropharmacology of L-theanine(N-ethyl-L-glutamine): a possible neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing agent." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182482" target="_blank"&gt;GABA levels and dopamine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L-theanine also &lt;a title="L-theanine, a natural constituent in tea, and its effect on mental state." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296328" target="_blank"&gt;increases brain wave activity in the alpha frequency&lt;/a&gt;, improving relaxation without inducing drowsiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a title="Wikipedia: Median Lethal Dose" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose" target="_blank"&gt;LD50&lt;/a&gt; of L-theanine is incredibly high and impossible to reach via tea and nearly impossible to reach via supplement (you&amp;#8217;d have to take dozens of bottles or drink hundreds of gallons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s richest in green tea, with &lt;a title="Dear Mark: Matcha Tea, Runner’s High, Stress and Weight Gain, and Fasting for Teens" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-matcha-tea-runners-high-stress-and-weight-gain-and-fasting-for-teens/"&gt;matcha&lt;/a&gt; appearing to have the highest L-theanine content. Taking &lt;a title="Kinetics of L-theanine uptake and metabolism in healthy participants are comparable after ingestion of L-theanine via capsules and green tea." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23096008" target="_blank"&gt;L-theanine via capsule is roughly the same as taking it via tea&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s also present in &lt;a title="Primal Calm" href="http://primalblueprint.com/products/Primal-Calm.html"&gt;Primal Calm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chamomile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A flowering plant similar to the daisy that can be infused in hot water to produce a relaxing, calming tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of chamomile as a medicinal herb dates back at least to the ancient Egyptians. In medieval Europe, chamomile was a &amp;#8220;strewing herb&amp;#8221; (herbs which were strewn about the floor of living spaces), a beer-making ingredient, and one of the Nine Sacred Herbs used by Anglo-Saxon god Woden (or Odin in Norse mythology) to &amp;#8220;smote the serpent.&amp;#8221; In other words, it was pretty dang significant to people throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act as a mild sedative and anti-anxiety agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, several studies show efficacy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chamomile extracts have recently been shown to &lt;a title="A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral Matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract therapy for generalized anxiety disorder." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593179" target="_blank"&gt;reduce anxiety levels&lt;/a&gt; among patients with generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apigenin, a component of chamomile, &lt;a title="Apigenin, a component of Matricaria recutita flowers, is a central benzodiazepine receptors-ligand with anxiolytic effects." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7617761" target="_blank"&gt;possesses anxiolytic and sedative effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s pretty safe, with a couple exceptions: pregnant women, for whom chamomile can induce uterine contractions (&lt;a title="Chamomile " href="http://www.tceconsult.org/TOW%20downloads/Supplements&amp;amp;SpecialFoods/Chamomile062705.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), potentially leading to early labor; and people with ragweed allergies, for whom chamomile can exhibit cross-reactivity symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chamomile tea, being one of the more common varieties, is easy to find. &lt;a title="Traditional Medicinals Organic, Chamomile, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3PM6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0009F3PM6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20" target="_blank"&gt;This is a legit brand&lt;/a&gt;, or you could &lt;a title="Chamomile: How to Grow, Use and Identify It" href="http://www.motherearthliving.com/health-and-wellness/chamomile.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;grow your own&lt;/a&gt;. Chamomile provides attractive (and useful) ground cover for your garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Valerian Root&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a root, obviously, most often served up as dried powder in capsules, a tea, or a tincture. The plant itself has lovely flowers and leaves that resemble ferns, but it&amp;#8217;s the root and rhizome we&amp;#8217;re interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayurvedic, Chinese, and classical Hellenic medical systems employed valerian as an anti-insomnia and anti-anxiety medicine. More recently, it was prescribed to Edward Norton&amp;#8217;s insomniac character in Fight Club (&amp;#8220;chew some valerian root&amp;#8221;). I can&amp;#8217;t remember if it was in the book, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s said to be a mild but effective sedative, anxiolytic, and sleep aid, akin to the benzodiazepine class of drugs without the side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinda. There are a few studies, but the results are mixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among patients with generalized anxiety disorder, &lt;a title="Effect of valepotriates (valerian extract) in generalized anxiety disorder: a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12410546" target="_blank"&gt;valerian&lt;/a&gt; extract has an anxiolytic effect on the &amp;#8220;psychic symptoms of anxiety.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valerian &lt;a title="Extract of valerian root (Valeriana officinalis L.) vs. placebo in treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a randomized double-blind study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22718671" target="_blank"&gt;may be effective&lt;/a&gt; against obsessive compulsive disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among insomniacs, valerian extract &lt;a title="Polysomnographic evaluation of the hypnotic effect of Valeriana edulis standardized extract in patients suffering from insomnia." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11731907" target="_blank"&gt;improves&lt;/a&gt; the &amp;#8220;sleep efficiency,&amp;#8221; reducing morning grogginess and improving sleep architecture. Another &lt;a title="A randomized clinical trial of valerian fails to improve self-reported, polysomnographic, and actigraphic sleep in older women with insomnia." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18482867" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, using lower amounts of valerian, did not get the same results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 2006 meta-analysis was unable to decide whether or not it was effective against anxiety, however. Another &lt;a title="Valerian for sleep: a systematic review and meta-analysis." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17145239" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that valerian &amp;#8220;might improve sleep quality without producing side effects,&amp;#8221; while a more recent &lt;a title="Effectiveness of Valerian on insomnia: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20347389" target="_blank"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; (of just RCTs) found it likely to improve subjective insomnia symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the weight of the anecdotal evidence, my own experience with it, and the fact that some, but not all, clinical trials find efficacy, leads me to the tentative conclusion that valerian can be useful against anxiety and maybe insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerian is safe, well-tolerated, and seems to have fewer side effects than pharmaceutical sedatives and anti-anxiety meds. Pregnant women should avoid it due to a lack of safety studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any health food store should carry the capsules and the tea, and perhaps even the whole or ground root. Online is always an option, of course. I recommend &lt;a title="Frontier cut &amp;amp; sifted Valerian Root Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNKZFK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001VNKZFK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20" target="_blank"&gt;buying the root direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rhodiola Rosea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as rose root or arctic root, rhodiola rosea hails from Siberia originally and pretty much everywhere else that&amp;#8217;s cold &amp;#8211; the Arctic, the Rockies, Northern Europe, the mountains of central Asia &amp;#8211; and possesses a root with interesting characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ancient Greeks, Viking raiders, Central Asian horsemen, Chinese emperors &amp;#8211; they all prized rhodiola rosea as an anti-fatigue, anti-stress medicinal herb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Act as a powerful adaptogen, a compound which improves your ability to adapt to physiological stressors without compromising your body&amp;#8217;s normal ability to function once removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely. Although most of the research comes from Scandinavia and Russia, there are a good number of trials available on Pubmed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodiola rosea &lt;a title="Rosenroot (Rhodiola rosea): traditional use, chemical composition, pharmacology and clinical efficacy." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20378318" target="_blank"&gt;contains 140 known bioactive compounds&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are effective against depression, anxiety, fatigue, and stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In patients with &lt;a title="A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of the standardised extract shr-5 of the roots of Rhodiola rosea in the treatment of subjects with stress-related fatigue." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19016404" target="_blank"&gt;stress-related fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, rhodiola rosea lowers cortisol, increases mental performance, and lowers fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It &lt;a title="Clinical trial of Rhodiola rosea L. extract SHR-5 in the treatment of mild to moderate depression." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17990195" target="_blank"&gt;improves symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in subjects with mild to moderate depression, absent side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodiola rosea &lt;a title="A pilot study of Rhodiola rosea (Rhodax) for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18307390" target="_blank"&gt;appears effective&lt;/a&gt; against generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It even &lt;a title="Acute Rhodiola rosea intake can improve endurance exercise performance." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256690" target="_blank"&gt;improves endurance performance&lt;/a&gt; and can be a potent agent in the &lt;a title="Attenuation of long-term Rhodiola rosea supplementation on exhaustive swimming-evoked oxidative stress in the rat." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20034236" target="_blank"&gt;fight against overtraining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, rhodiola rosea &lt;a title="Rhodiola Rosea Research" href="http://smart-drugs.net/Rhodiola-rosea.htm" target="_blank"&gt;improves your ability to handle stress&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re lagging, it&amp;#8217;ll bring things up. If you&amp;#8217;re freaking out, it&amp;#8217;ll bring you closer to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a title="The effectiveness and efficacy of Rhodiola rosea L.: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036578" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be extremely safe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Primal Calm" href="http://primalblueprint.com/products/Primal-Calm.html"&gt;Primal Calm&lt;/a&gt; has it, as do plenty of other products. You can even &lt;a title="Rhodiola root" href="http://www.starwest-botanicals.com/category/rhodiola-root/" target="_blank"&gt;buy it in bulk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Magnolia Bark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnolia bark is the lay name for magnolia officinalis, a deciduous tree whose bark is prized in traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have been using the bark for its medicinal qualities as far back as 100 AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it purported to do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets billed as a sedative with strong anti-anxiety and anti-stress effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the research back that up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, yes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Components of magnolia bark &lt;a title="The natural products magnolol and honokiol are positive allosteric modulators of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABA(A) receptors." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22445602" target="_blank"&gt;enhance the activity of GABA receptors&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, offering up an explanation for its anti-anxiety, calming effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In post-menopausal women, &lt;a title="Effect of a proprietary Magnolia and Phellodendron extract on stress levels in healthy women: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426577" target="_blank"&gt;magnolia bark reduces anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and stress levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnolia bark &lt;a title="Effects of extract and ingredients isolated from Magnolia obovata thunberg on catecholamine secretion from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10856439" target="_blank"&gt;may reduce stress hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A magnolia bark-containing product lowers body weight by &lt;a title="Effect of a proprietary Magnolia and Phellodendron extract on weight management: a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16454147" target="_blank"&gt;reducing &amp;#8220;stress eating&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding magnolia to an anti-menopause concoction &lt;a title="Randomized controlled study on clinical efficacy of isoflavones plus Lactobacillus sporogenes, associated or not with a natural anxiolytic agent in menopause." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21311416" target="_blank"&gt;makes it more effective&lt;/a&gt; at reducing anxiety, irritability, and insomnia while improving &lt;a title="A Guide to Maintaining a Healthy Sex Drive" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/a-guide-to-maintaining-a-healthy-sex-drive/"&gt;libido&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are no long-term safety studies, trials indicate an extreme paucity of negative side effects. As always, exercise caution if you&amp;#8217;re &lt;a title="5 Primal Superfoods for Fertility and Pregnancy" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/5-primal-superfoods-for-fertility-and-pregnancy/"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to find it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use it in &lt;a title="Primal Calm" href="http://primalblueprint.com/products/Primal-Calm.html"&gt;Primal Calm&lt;/a&gt;. Chinese herb stores will have it (if you&amp;#8217;ve got a Chinatown in your city, you can probably find it there).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some teas blend some or all of these (and other) ingredients, so not only are you getting the dozens of bioactive compounds found in this herb, root, or rhizome, you&amp;#8217;re getting the hundreds of bioactive compounds found in these other herbs, roots, and rhizomes. Plus, one ingredient might potentiate, inhibit, or otherwise modify the action of another ingredient, so it&amp;#8217;s difficult to predict exactly what you&amp;#8217;ll be getting out of a blend. Take valerian and lemon balm, which &lt;a title="Anxiolytic effects of a combination of Melissa officinalis and Valeriana officinalis during laboratory induced stress." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16444660" target="_blank"&gt;combine to become an effective anti-anxiety blend&lt;/a&gt; against acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of kava kava, though, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t worry too much about any interactions &amp;#8211; and even with kava, it seems reasonably safe as long as you&amp;#8217;re smart and moderate about it while avoiding &lt;a title="Alcohol: The Good and the Bad" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/alcohol-the-good-and-the-bad/"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and other compounds with a liver load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for this week, folks. Next week, I&amp;#8217;ll explore some other helpful ingredients in tea. Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

This week, I&amp;#8217;m covering four reader questions. First up is a really tricky one: ApoE4, the ancestral allele that&amp;#8217;s classically associated with a host of maladies, like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s. What&amp;#8217;s the deal with it? We don&amp;#8217;t have any concrete answers (yet), but I give my take on it. Next, I tell a reader who&amp;#8217;s flying to Chile for vacation how I recover from travel-related sleep disturbances and realign my &lt;a title="Circadian Rhythms: Zeitgebers, Entrainment, and Non-Photic Stimuli" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/circadian-rhythms-zeitgebers-entrainment-and-non-photic-stimuli/#axzz2PpZx0xCL"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. After that, I cover another paleo debunking that&amp;#8217;s actually not much of a debunking, this time a TEDx video from Christina Warriner. And finally, I explore the eternal question of Halls cough drops, including whether or not any natural alternatives exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-35987"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img title="More..." alt="trans" src="http://cdn.marksdailyapple.com/wordpress/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Mark and Worker Bees,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read that APOE4 is the &amp;#8220;ancestral&amp;#8221; allele for the APOE genes. It is the risk factor for Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s. I find it hard to believe that checking out mentally is in any way desirable. You linked a few months ago to an interesting article about high-carb seniors succumbing to cognitive impairment. Might you be able to think aloud about this topic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Joy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ApoE is apolipoprotein E, the string of amino acids that attaches to lipoproteins and allows them to cross the blood-brain barrier and get into the brain to deliver nutrients and cholesterol and remove toxins. If a lipoprotein has the ApoE marker, it will be allowed into the brain to do its work. Different genetic variants of ApoE are better and worse at this task, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ApoE2, is associated with a lesser risk of Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s and ApoE3 is &amp;#8220;neutral.&amp;#8221; Meanwhile, ApoE4 is associated with higher total &lt;a title="How to Read a Cholesterol Test" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-interpret-cholesterol-test-results/"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and a greater risk of Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s. Thus, most people assume that the high cholesterol is also causing the &lt;a title="Science News Roundup: Brain Health" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/science-news-roundup-brain-health/#axzz2PpaRzGx7"&gt;Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; and dementia. It&amp;#8217;s not quite so simple, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain is perhaps the richest source of &lt;a title="The Definitive Guide to Cholesterol" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/cholesterol/#axzz2PpadnAWL"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in all the land (or sea); just an ounce of raw lamb brain contains nearly 400 mg of cholesterol. In fact, brains &amp;#8211; living ones &amp;#8211; need plenty of cholesterol to work right. The synapses, or connections between neurons, are made of cholesterol. In case our brains aren&amp;#8217;t getting enough cholesterol, the astrocytes &amp;#8211; brain cells which supply nutrients to neurons &amp;#8211; can even manufacture their own cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may explain why &lt;a title="Cholesterol-Reducing Drugs May Lessen Brain Function, Says Researcher" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090223221430.htm" target="_blank"&gt;statins can hamper brain function&lt;/a&gt;, why &lt;a title="High total cholesterol levels in late life associated with a reduced risk of dementia" href="http://www.neurology.org/content/64/10/1689.abstract" target="_blank"&gt;high cholesterol late in life is associated with a reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and why Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s patients have lower levels of &lt;a title="Reduced levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, and fatty acids in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer disease patients are not related to apolipoprotein E4." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9772023" target="_blank"&gt;cholesterol, phospholipids, and fat in their cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, our brains need cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is ApoE4 associated with high cholesterol &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a title="APOE-4: The Clue to Why Low Fat Diet and Statins may Cause Alzheimer's" href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/seneff/alzheimers_statins.html" target="_blank"&gt;hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; is that people with ApoE4 need higher baseline plasma lipids because ApoE4 makes the brain less efficient at taking up cholesterol. If that&amp;#8217;s true, high cholesterol may be a protective mechanism designed to overcome this limitation. This would jibe with the observation that Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s and dementia are &lt;a title="Twenty-six-year change in total cholesterol levels and incident dementia: the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210816?dopt=AbstractPlus" target="_blank"&gt;often preceded by a big drop in cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. That is, the early, asymptomatic stages of Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s are associated with a decline in serum total cholesterol, not a rise. Interestingly, &lt;a title="Better Memory and Neural Efficiency in Young Apolipoprotein E ε4 Carriers" href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/8/1934.full" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;young &lt;/em&gt;ApoE4 carriers have better memory&lt;/a&gt;, better learning capacities, and more neural efficiency in general than non carriers, so it&amp;#8217;s not all bad. Something goes wrong down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My take is that ApoE4 carriers, being &amp;#8220;ancestral,&amp;#8221; are simply more susceptible to neolithic stressors like &lt;a title="How Might Inflammation Cause Heart Disease?" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-might-inflammation-cause-heart-disease/#axzz2PpbE0k7C"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; (yeah, yeah, I know it&amp;#8217;s been smoked for a long time, but not in its current form), heavy metal toxicity, &lt;a title="Why We Don’t Walk Anymore (plus a Primal Health Challenge)  " href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/why-we-dont-walk-anymore/#axzz2PpbqwNgp"&gt;sedentary living&lt;/a&gt;, and chronic &lt;a title="15 Ways to Fight Stress" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/15-ways-to-fight-stress/#axzz2Ppbi1QVO"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. Some evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you &lt;a title="No APOEepsilon4 effect on coronary heart disease risk in a cohort with low smoking prevalence: the Whitehall II study." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15488872" target="_blank"&gt;remove tobacco smoking&lt;/a&gt;, the association between ApoE4 and cardiovascular disease disappears. Another study had similar results, finding that &lt;a title="The significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk in APOEepsilon4 carriers is evident only in men who smoke: potential relationship between reduced antioxidant status and ApoE4." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16266401" target="_blank"&gt;only smoking ApoE4s&lt;/a&gt; had increased levels of oxidized LDL and lower levels of antioxidants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Among the ApoE alleles, ApoE4 is the worst at binding heavy metals, including (at least) mercury (&lt;a title="Apolipoprotein E genotyping as a potential biomarker for mercury neurotoxicity" href="http://abcmt.org/01%20-%20ApoE%20and%20Mercury.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a title="An observational study on the influence of the APOE-epsilon4 allele on the correlation between 'free' copper toxicosis and EEG activity in Alzheimer disease." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18486114" target="_blank"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt;. Ancestral populations weren&amp;#8217;t sporting mercury amalgams in their mouths or relying on coal-fired power plants, so heavy metals weren&amp;#8217;t really much of a selective pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For ApoE4 carriers, &lt;a title="Exercise Engagement as a Moderator of the Effects of APOE Genotype on Amyloid Deposition." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22232206" target="_blank"&gt;being sedentary is far more dangerous&lt;/a&gt; than it is for carriers of other alleles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In older adults with ApoE4, &lt;a title="The Effects of Prolonged Stress and APOE Genotype on Memory and Cortisol in Older Adults" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2002507/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic stress results in higher cortisol and greater losses in memory&lt;/a&gt;. ApoE4 carriers are also &lt;a title="Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele affects the relationship between stress and depression in caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11563433" target="_blank"&gt;more likely to develop depression from chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also guess that a bit of &lt;a title="The Myriad Benefits of Intermittent Fasting" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/health-benefits-of-intermittent-fasting/#axzz2PpbV68Do"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;, or at least a movement away from the wholly modern grazing method of eating, would also be helpful. At any rate, closer adherence to a &lt;a title="Definitive Guide: The Primal Blueprint" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint/#axzz2PpbNXc66"&gt;Primal way of life&lt;/a&gt; appears especially crucial for ApoE4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another view is that ApoE4 carriers are actually more sensitive to dietary fat, particularly saturated fat, as well as carbohydrate. William Davis MD has &lt;a title="When MIGHT statins be helpful?" href="http://blog.trackyourplaque.com/2011/04/when-might-statins-be-helpful.html" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that for these individuals, moderation of both fat and carbs is necessary to avoid elevations in the number of LDL particles, particularly small dense LDL. ApoE4s should probably at least monitor their lipids and spring for the more advanced tests to note how fat and SFA affect LDL-P, LDL-C, and small dense LDL &amp;#8211; just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m leaving for a vacation to Chile later this week and I&amp;#8217;m facing 2 overnight flights within 10 days of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m about 6&amp;#8217;2&amp;#8243;, broad shouldered, and for the time being my pocketbook precludes me from sitting in the pointy end of the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This upcoming flight has me wondering what tips and/or advice you have for people who are facing a situation with non-ideal sleeping conditions? What can be done in advance from an exercise/nutrition/supplementation standpoint to partially mitigate the effects of poor sleep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, do you have any suggestions for things that can be done to promote better sleep in a tight spot (no pun intended!)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for everything you do with this site. Look forward to your suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a frequent traveler, I&amp;#8217;ve figured out a perfect regimen for getting my clock aligned with wherever I&amp;#8217;m staying. It may not work for you, but it certainly does for me and pretty much everyone else to whom I&amp;#8217;ve suggested it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On overnight flights going East, you&amp;#8217;ll be experiencing what amounts to two &amp;#8220;shortened days&amp;#8221; as you erase multiple time zones from you diurnal rhythm overnight. Set your watch to your new intended time zone when you are in the air. Get as much sleep as you can on the plane. Typically you&amp;#8217;ll arrive sometime later in the day at your destination, so you won&amp;#8217;t have to work hard to stay awake, but do so. You got 4-6 hours on the plane maybe, but the new &amp;#8220;day&amp;#8221; will be several hours shorter. Adapt your mindset to the new time zone immediately. Do NOT nap. I usually go for a short walk to explore the city or I hit the gym and ride the bike a bit. As it gets close to the new bed time, try to take 3-5 mgs of melatonin an hour before your intended bedtime. By the time you hit the hay, it will have done a decent job resetting you internal clock and allowing to get some regular zzz&amp;#8217;s. Repeat the melatonin ritual the next night and then cut in half the third night. From there you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for Westbound flights that follow the daylight most or all of the way, you will be experiencing a very long single day and usually arriving towards the end of that day. In this case, same thing, set your watch on the plane to &amp;#8220;get into&amp;#8221; the new time zone. Stay awake as you see fit, but try to take a long nap maybe halfway through the flight. You will have rested, but not have had too much sleep that it throws your normal night off. When you arrive, same process, stay awake until it&amp;#8217;s the local bedtime, find things to do, take a hike or work out, and do the same melatonin ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, for long night flights, just get as much sleep on the plane as you comfortably can, because you&amp;#8217;ll have a long day at your destination. I try to do two naps with a few movies in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sleep on the plane itself, I have a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a window seat. I know the aisle offers more legroom, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to get comfortable when you have to worry about where to put your head. With a window seat, you can wedge yourself up against the side of the plane. Plus you won&amp;#8217;t have people crawling over you to get to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get an exit row. More legroom is always better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consult &lt;a title="Seat Guru" href="http://www.seatguru.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Seat Guru&lt;/a&gt;. Figure out what model plane you&amp;#8217;ll be on and then check reader reviews to find the best seat in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring a pillow if the airline doesn&amp;#8217;t provide one. I like a super compact backpacking pillow, the kind you&amp;#8217;ll find at &lt;a title="REI" href="http://www.rei.com/" target="_blank"&gt;REI&lt;/a&gt;. Barring that, a rolled up article of clothing works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Mark, big fan of this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen &lt;a title="Debunking the paleo diet: Christina Warinner at TEDxOU " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMOjVYgYaG8" target="_blank"&gt;this TED talk&lt;/a&gt; by Christina who claims to debunk your theory and other Paleo like diets? She does a lot of fad calling, showing your books and movement a fad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the talk when you have the time and please, as your readers, we&amp;#8217;d all like to see a post on your thoughts around this. She has left a lot unsaid and I&amp;#8217;m wondering if she&amp;#8217;s even read any of the books she&amp;#8217;s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madelain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen it. It was better than &lt;a title="Is It All Just a “Paleofantasy”?" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-it-all-just-a-paleofantasy/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paleofantasy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it suffered from some of the same mistakes. Mainly, she didn&amp;#8217;t really do her homework and ends up promoting a fairly Primal way of eating without actually realizing it. It&amp;#8217;s just that the first five or six minutes are really rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She begins by saying that humans have no anatomical or physiological adaptation to eating meat, meaning (I assume) because we don&amp;#8217;t have big scary claws and teeth and the ability to overpower and devour a bison barehanded, we aren&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;meant&amp;#8221; to eat animals. On some level, this makes sense. Dogs, cats, lions, tigers, and other fearsome predators all come equipped with the physical, mechanical equipment to break down and consume a carcass. Humans do not. We do, however, have technology. We have spears, stone knives, bows, atlatls, slingshots, and, now, rifles, to kill and butcher our prey. We&amp;#8217;ve harnessed fire to cook it. We&amp;#8217;ve also harnessed fire to cook starch, which &amp;#8211; unlike meat &amp;#8211; we &lt;em&gt;actually have to cook in order to really digest&lt;/em&gt;. Why no mention of that in the video?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, despite the pretty obvious vegetarian bias (&amp;#8220;paleo is for men,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;paleo is all about meat,&amp;#8221; etc), the rest of the talk is good. She ends by acknowledging that we can learn a few things from paleolithic nutrition: eat fresh foods; eat whole foods; and eat high species diversity. Oh, and don&amp;#8217;t eat refined sugary drinks. I agree with her on all these points. I think if she read through this blog she&amp;#8217;d agree with most of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robb Wolf &lt;a title="Debunking The Paleo Diet: A Wolf’s Eye View" href="http://robbwolf.com/2013/04/04/debunking-paleo-diet-wolfs-eye-view/" target="_blank"&gt;gave a good minute by minute summary&lt;/a&gt; (a Wolf&amp;#8217;s Eye View) that I&amp;#8217;d recommend reading. I agree with everything he says in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have need for a cough drop for nighttime sleeping or when attending an event requiring quiet. I just looked at the ingredients in the 5 bags of Halls my hubby bought and it&amp;#8217;s almost all sugar and junk. What would you recommend especially now that I&amp;#8217;m on 21-day Sugar DeTox? Help!  :)&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, I have 2 cloves of clove in my mouth guessing this may help!  ??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t really able to find any natural cough remedies with strong evidence. If natural methods aren&amp;#8217;t working, a single Halls cough drop only has about 4 grams of sugar, mostly glucose (from glucose syrup). Unless you&amp;#8217;re really wedded to this 21-day detox, I&amp;#8217;d say just go ahead and take the cough drop. Besides, the 21-day sugar detox is more about avoiding sweets &amp;#8211; elective junk food &amp;#8211; than eliminating every trace molecule of sugar, which in this case is primarily glucose rather than fructose. One &lt;a title="Sweet taste and menthol increase cough reflex thresholds." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22465565" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; even found that both menthol and a sweet taste are effective at suppressing coughs, so combining the two is likely more effective than either alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bad night&amp;#8217;s sleep is way, way more detrimental to your health than a tiny bit of sugar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single night of partial sleep deprivation &lt;a title="A single night of partial sleep deprivation induces insulin resistance in multiple metabolic pathways in healthy subjects." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20371664" target="_blank"&gt;induced insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; via multiple metabolic pathways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four nights of bad sleep caused women to &lt;a title="Influence of partial sleep deprivation on energy balance and insulin sensitivity in healthy women." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20054188" target="_blank"&gt;eat more and gain weight&lt;/a&gt;. Same &lt;a title="Acute partial sleep deprivation increases food intake in healthy men." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20357041" target="_blank"&gt;goes for men&lt;/a&gt; after just one night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partial sleep deprivation &lt;a title="Cardiovascular effects of partial sleep deprivation in healthy volunteers." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22539169" target="_blank"&gt;decreases endothelial function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad sleep &lt;a title="Poor sleep the night before an experimental stressor predicts reduced NK cell mobilization and slowed recovery in healthy women." href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17029702" target="_blank"&gt;reduces your tolerance of stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those are just a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a title="Is Honey a Safe(r) Sweetener?" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/is-honey-a-safer-sweetener/#axzz2PpcfBAvj"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Is Chocolate the Tastiest Natural Cough Medicine of All?" href="http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/is-chocolate-the-tastiest-natural-cough-medicine-of-all.html" target="_blank"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt; may be effective against coughs, but, well, those aren&amp;#8217;t exactly sugar-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it for today, guys. Thanks for reading and be sure to chime in with your thoughts/opinions/suggestions in the comment section!&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, to do that, the relevant compounds will have to make it through the gut wall and into the bloodstream to interact with our genes, which wheat has never, ever been shown to do. Right?

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/head-cheese/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" alt="HeadCheese1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/HeadCheese1.jpg" width="320" height="212" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;Head cheese is not cheese at all, and these days it’s not always made from meat simmered off the head of a pig. A more accurate and appetizing way to think of head cheese is simply that it’s a cold cut made from tender, fatty pork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head cheese isn’t hard to make at home, especially if you have a pressure cooker and use pig’s feet instead of a pig’s head. A pressure cooker completes the simmering process in 1 hour, rather than 3 or 4. And pig’s feet are easier to find than a whole pig’s head (and there’s a little less of a gross-out factor if you’re squeamish). Hispanic supermarkets almost always sell pig’s feet, or you can special order them from a butcher or local farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-35977"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pig’s feet are inexpensive and the perfect addition not only to head cheese, but to any stock. The skin, joints and bones release tons of &lt;a title="Cooking with Bones" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/cooking-with-bones/#axzz2PKTnm4St"&gt;healthy collagen&lt;/a&gt;, giving the simmering liquid texture and helping it firm up when chilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cooking head cheese at home, you can control the texture and flavor, making it meatier or more gelatinous, seasoned heavily with spices or hardly at all. The head cheese in this recipe photo is light on meat, resulting in a smoother melt-in-your-mouth texture. Most people, however, prefer a meatier mix, and that’s what you’ll get if you add all of the meat from the recipe below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe for head cheese takes some time but very little effort. Mostly, it’s about simmering and refrigerating. For some, head cheese is a nostalgic treat. For others, it’s an adventurous and surprisingly tasty way to embrace gelatinous food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serves:&lt;/strong&gt; 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time in the Kitchen:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 hour of simmering, plus 8 hours of refrigeration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="ingredients 57" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/ingredients-57.jpg" width="540" height="404" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 to 6 pig’s feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 pounds of a bone-in, inexpensive cut of pork (ribs, roast, un-smoked ham hocks) (900 g)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (60 ml)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt and pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wash the pig’s feet, making sure to remove any hair that remains by scraping it off with a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="pigs feet" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/pigs_feet.jpg" width="540" height="374" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the feet and the other cut of pork in a pressure cooker with the vinegar, a generous pinch of salt and pepper and just enough cold water to cover everything. You can also add bay leaves, peppercorns, allspice and other spices to the pot if you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step1 6" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step1-6.jpg" width="540" height="373" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cook in the pressure cooker for 1 hour. If you don’t have a pressure cooker, then simmer in a pot until the meat is fork-tender, about 3 to 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain the solids (meat, fat, bones) from the liquid (save the liquid!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step2 6" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step2-6.jpg" width="540" height="318" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the solids on a plate or cutting board to cool and then separate all the meat and fatty bits from the bones and chop it up fine. If the really fatty pieces aren’t appetizing you can throw some out, but don’t go overboard or you’ll lose all the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generously season the meat with salt and pepper to taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add as much of the cut up meat as desired back into the broth and pour it into a 9 x 13 cake pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Step3 2" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Step3-2.jpg" width="540" height="360" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mixture can also be poured into terrine or loaf pans filled 1/2 to 3/4 full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosely cover the mixture of meat and broth and let the head cheese firm up in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the head cheese has set, use a spoon to scrap off and discard any white fat that has come to the surface. At this point the head cheese is done, but if the texture is too soft for your liking, then put it back into a pot and simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Return the mixture to the refrigerator to cool and set again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is cooled and set, cut the head cheese into slices or squares and serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="HeadCheese2" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/HeadCheese2.jpg" width="540" height="360" title="Head Cheese" /&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recipe Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pressure cooker extracts more gelatin in a shorter amount of time than simmering in a pot does. If you’re not using a pressure cooker for this recipe it’s very likely you’ll have to simmer the mixture again after the first refrigeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not a pressure cooker is used, the head cheese can always be firmed up by adding &lt;a title="Salmon Mousse Gelatin Ring and Raspberry Coconut Gelatin Dessert" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/salmon-mousse-gelatin-ring-and-raspberry-coconut-gelatin-dessert/#axzz2PKTnm4St"&gt;powdered gelatin&lt;/a&gt; to the broth and meat mixture before refrigerating it. The head cheese in the photo has had powdered gelatin added. However, if you use enough pigs feet (make sure to use at least 4 feet) then adding powdered gelatin shouldn’t be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Primal Blueprint Real Life Story" alt="real life stories stories 1 2" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA2009/real_life_stories_stories-1-2.jpg" width="320" height="240" /&gt;Dear Mark,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although you are totally unaware of it, you and I just celebrated our second anniversary. It was two years ago, February of 2011, that I was introduced to you. At the time, you were nothing but an experiment, a fling if you will, but now you are among the most important men in my life. No, I’m not really flirting with you. I’m a 54 year old teacher from the Midwest, married, mother of four and grandmother of two. But now that I have your attention, here’s the rather unremarkable story of my two-year Primal journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-35969"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had an interest in healthy eating and fitness. I have read most of the books, tried a lot of diets, and done a variety of fitness activities, and every one of them ran its course to be followed by something new. Two years ago my older son, Adam, started telling me about this blog he was reading where this guy had &lt;a title="Definitive Guide: Primal Blueprint" href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint/"&gt;ten basic rules&lt;/a&gt; for living like the cavemen lived. He was intrigued and was set to try the eating plan as an experiment for Lent. I thought I might just give it a try as well. Adam is a high school science teacher, so all the science information he’d been reading on this blog really clicked with him. I’m an English teacher, so I skimmed the science and paid close attention to the summarizing paragraph and asked my son a lot of questions. I downloaded &lt;a title="Amazon.com: The Primal Blueprint Kindle" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I8VGYE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004I8VGYE&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=marsdaiapp07-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Primal Blueprint&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and read it immediately as well as spending a lot of time on Mark&amp;#8217;s Daily Apple. Since I was in the Lenten mode of self-sacrifice, the new eating style really came pretty easily. Then came Easter. My time of “sacrifice” was ended, but I no longer felt like I was sacrificing anything. By then it was my new lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, that the Primal lifestyle was basically an experiment for me; I had no real goals for weight loss or improved health. I just wanted to see what it was like and what might happen. I was not particularly overweight – 5’5 ½” tall, about 145 pounds, size 8. But after a few weeks, pounds started dropping off, and the little aches and pains I had been noticing disappeared. I never realized how bloated I felt until the feeling was gone. The most notable difference was in the pain and stiffness I had been experiencing in my fingers. The pain would wake me up in the night, and in the morning I could barely wrap my fingers around my toothbrush. As the day progressed, the pain subsided, and I just attributed it to being in my 50s. At some point during that six-week experiment, that pain and stiffness disappeared and has never returned. Knees don’t hurt like they used to. Mid-afternoon energy crashes are non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="gymphoto 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/gymphoto-1.jpg" width="540" height="720" title="The Pain and Stiffness Disappeared and Has Never Returned" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say that I had adopted the Primal lifestyle, but in reality during the first several months it was mostly the Primal eating style that I embraced. I used to be a twenty-mile-a-week runner, but I had given that up because of back pain, so at this point my exercise consisted of walking. I had the “moving frequently at a slow pace” part down pat, but it took some time to get myself on the rest of the program. That’s where my younger son comes into the picture. Aaron had become a CrossFitter and was often telling me how much I would like it if I tried it. My response was always that I was too old… until October of 2011 when I finally joined in the boot camp program at the gym. In January 2012 my husband and I both jumped into the CrossFit classes, and we’ve been doing 3-4 CrossFit workouts per week ever since. Mark, you are so right about lifting heavy things! It not only has changed my body, but it feels so empowering to be able to back squat my own body weight, lift barbells over my head, climb up a rope or do a bunch of handstand pushups. I consider the short, highly intense workouts that last only a few minutes to be my sprint. While I love the gym atmosphere and the progress I’ve made over my past year in CrossFit, I don’t do CrossFit just so I can do more CrossFit. I do it so I can do whatever I want to do with confidence that my body has the strength and flexibility to handle it. Last summer I went whitewater rafting on the Chatooga River with my two daughters (exactly the section where the movie Deliverance was filmed), and I won my age group in a 5-K race with no real running training. Earlier this month my husband and I went stand-up paddleboarding when we were on a trip to St. Thomas. Who knows what else I’ll try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="alignnone" alt="Destin2012 1" src="http://i247.photobucket.com/albums/gg158/MDA2008/MDA%202011/Destin2012-1.jpg" width="540" height="723" title="The Pain and Stiffness Disappeared and Has Never Returned" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of that trip to St. Thomas, we traveled with people we have known for over 25 years but see infrequently. It was so gratifying to hear their comments about how I look better than ever. My current weight is 128, I wear a size 4 or sometimes a 2, and I do not hesitate to hit the beach wearing a bikini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Primal journey hasn’t been about a dramatic weight loss. It has been about some easy-to-do lifestyle changes that I expect to make the next few decades an entirely different life story than they might have otherwise been. That’s why you are on the list of “most important men in my life,” Mark. I’m really glad you came into my life &amp;#8211; figuratively speaking, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kathy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote to you recently telling you about my two years as a Primal, and I have a quick update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I allowed my son/trainer to talk me into registering for the CrossFit Open although I felt kind of silly doing it. It was my hope that I could make it through the first workout because I figured it would start with something all body weight and would soon advance beyond my abilities. Well, I did 13.1 on Friday and scored 142. Because I will turn 55 before the Open ends, I was put into the 55-59 Masters Women category, so I got to use lighter weights on the snatches. But here&amp;#8217;s the really crazy part. As of right now I am in 17th place in the North Central Region. I still know that I won&amp;#8217;t be able to do everything they throw at us in the Open, but I&amp;#8217;m having fun with it right now!&lt;/p&gt;
