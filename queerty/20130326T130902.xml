<p>One of the Commission&#8217;s patrols first spotted a car pulled over the side of the road in the capital city. When they investigated, members found the man applying makeup.</p>
<p>A subsequent search of the car turned up three bottles of alcohol.</p>
<p>“After verification, the man was found to be an editor at a well know newspaper…he was getting ready for a homosexual party,” reports the Arabic-language daily <em>Alsaudeh</em>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, a U.S. &#8220;ally&#8221; in the Middle East, criminalizes homosexuality—with punishments ranging from fines and prison sentences to lashings and even execution.</p>
<p>Saudi Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz Bin Nasir, who was convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering his male aide in Britain in 2010, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/9851866/Gay-Saudi-prince-who-killed-manservant-to-serve-jail-term-at-home.html">recently returned to the country</a> to complete his prison sentence.</p>

Tonight&#8217;s episode of <em>The New Normal </em>will address the Boy Scouts&#8217; current ban on gay scouts and leaders.</p>
<p>In the episode &#8220;About a Boy Scout,&#8221; former Eagle Scout David (Justin Bartha) volunteers to chaperone a Scouts camping trip, despite complaints by Bryan (Andrew Rannells) that the organization is anti-gay.</p>
<p>The troop and its Scout Masters eat David up (who wouldn&#8217;t) but he soon gets a letter from the BSA telling him his membership has been revoked for &#8220;homosexual conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s forced to tell the kids he can&#8217;t be their leader: &#8220;When the Scouts can live up to the values they taught me, I&#8217;m happy to be of service,&#8221; he tells the troop. &#8220;I do [love the Scouts], but they don&#8217;t respect the way that I love.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>The New Normal</em> airs Tuesday, March 26, at 9:30pm EST on NBC.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254664" alt="dan choi" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/dan-choi-360x220.jpg" width="360" height="220" />Thousands of members of the LGBT community are descending on Washington, DC, to bear witness to the Supreme Court hearings on marriage equality.</p>
<p>But others are coming  to protest the trial of Lt. Dan Choi, who was arrested for chaining himself to the White House at a Don&#8217;t Ask Don&#8217;t Tell demonstration in 2010.</p>
<p>Instead of lighting candles or carrying placards, though, Choi&#8217;s supporters will be getting into downward dog and pigeon pose.</p>
<p>On Wednesday and Thursday morning at 8am, Julia Romano will lead a yoga and meditation session for justice outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse, where attorneys are presenting closing arguments</p>
<blockquote><p>As decorated veteran and celebrated gay activist Lt. Dan Choi prepares himself for closing arguments, supporters from across the country are gathering in solidarity in order to plan actions to stand with him in the buildup for his trial. Events planned this week have been scheduled to show solidarity with Lt. Choi’s court struggle, which due to the nature of the charges leveled has thus far prevented him from re-enlisting in the United States Army&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We got Dan&#8217;s back but, given that <em>our </em>back is shot, we&#8217;ll be sending him positive vibes from the couch.</p>

Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) are the latest victims of evolution, having recently come around on the gay marriage debate.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Supreme Court&#8217;s hearing of California&#8217;s Prop 8, Warner <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MarkRWarner/posts/10151583789527853" target="_blank">posted on his Facebook page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I support marriage equality because it is the fair and right thing to do. Like many Virginians and Americans, my views on gay marriage have evolved, and this is the inevitable extension of my efforts to promote equality and opportunity for everyone. I was proud to be the first Virginia governor to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBT state workers. In 2010, I supported an end to the military’s ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy, and earlier this month I signed an amicus brief urging the repeal of DOMA. I believe we should continue working to expand equal rights and opportunities for all Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Warner is up for re-election in 2014 in Virginia, where voters banned gay marriage in 2006. However, a recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/poll-support-grows-for-same-sex-marriage-in-florida-ohio-and-virginia/2012/10/09/969bea0e-1220-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html" target="_blank">poll by <em>The Washington Post</em></a> showed 49% of Virginians in favor of marriage equality, compared to 40% opposed. Warner is also considered a  potential presidential candidate in 2016.</p>
<p>Missouri banned gay marriage in 2004, but on Sunday Sen. McCaskill announced her support via social media as well &#8212; with a <a href="http://clairecmc.tumblr.com/post/46209857472/and-now-abide-faith-hope-love-these-three-but-the" target="_blank">posting on her Tumblr,</a> directly following her recipe for her husband&#8217;s favorite <a href="http://clairecmc.tumblr.com/post/44942264360/a-perfect-saturday#notes" target="_blank">Leftover Frittatas</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.queerty.com/mark-warner-claire-mccaskill-gay-marriage-20130326/mccaskill-frittata/" rel="attachment wp-att-254816"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-254816" alt="mccaskill-frittata" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/mccaskill-frittata.jpg" width="448" height="336" /></a></p>

<p>The meeting was also attended by representatives from the Nepali government, including Minister for Women, Children and Social Welfare Riddhi Baba Pradhan, who said the gathering &#8220;proves that the common assertion that LGBT rights are incompatible with Asian values is false.”</p>
<p>In a video address, UN Secretary General  Ban Ki Moon remarked that “far too many people and governments still refuse to acknowledge the injustice of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nepal has been one of the more progressive countries in the region, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-charter-to-grant-gay-rights/Article1-499154.aspx">adopting a new constitution</a> that guarantees equal rights to sexual minorities, <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/01/22/nepal-introduces-gender-neutral-citizenship-documents/">issuing gender-neutral passports</a> for trans citizens, and, last October, launching a <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nepal-holds-asias-first-gay-sports-festival-20121015/">LGBT sports festival.</a></p>
<p>Sunil Baba Pant, who practically founded Nepal&#8217;s gay-rights movement in the early 2000s, said this meeting was important because it addressed issues specific to Asian LGBTs, including questions of identity: “Not everyone in the world likes the lesbian or gay or transgender labels, so we have to make sure human rights are for everyone.&#8221;</p>

And I just said “I cannot do it. I cannot do it.” And they said we will double the money. And I am like “I can do it. I can do it.’</p>
<p>So then I got there. Then, we got down to [the sex and I said] — “Wow, oh God, I cannot do it.” [And Catalina said again] “We will double it.” [And I said] “I can do it! I can do it!” Then, my first three movies I became most famous [but] the close-ups weren´t my dick. They used a thing called a stunt dick&#8230;</p>
<p>But in those days, once I got my amount up so high because I couldn&#8217;t do it, then they said all we do is use — and this was John Travis — “We will just use your face and your body, and it won´t be your dick.” I am like “people will think it is my dick, won´t they?” “Yeah, of course they will.” But that is how it worked. … Here I was being made a porn star and I wasn´t doing porn. I couldn’t. Couldn&#8217;t function.</p>
<p>Three movies later, I got where I could.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/mike-freeman/21946093/some-believe-atmosphere-is-safe-for-gay-nfl-player-to-come-out" target="_blank">CBS Sports&#8217; Mike Freeman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on interviews over the past several weeks with current and former players, I&#8217;m told that a current gay NFL player is strongly considering coming out publicly within the next few months &#8212; and after doing so, the player would attempt to continue his career.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m told this player feels the time is now for someone to take this step &#8212; despite <a href="http://www.queerty.com/san-francisco-49er-chris-culliver-sorry-he-told-gay-players-to-get-out-of-the-nfl-20130130/" target="_blank">homophobic remarks</a> from San Francisco 49ers defensive back Chris Culliver and the controversy arising recently at the Indianapolis Scouting combine, when prospects were asked <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/brennan/2013/02/27/nfl-sexual-orientation-nick-kasa-scouting-combine/1951857/" target="_blank">questions about their sexuality</a>.</p>
<p>This player&#8217;s true concern, I&#8217;m told, is not the reaction inside an NFL locker room but outside of it. The player fears he will suffer serious harm from homophobic fans, and that is the only thing preventing him from coming out. My sources will not say who this alleged player is.</p>
<p>There has never been an active openly gay player in a major American team sport, but the information I&#8217;ve gathered on the player in question comes from several current and former players.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I honestly think the players of the NFL have been ready for an openly gay player for quite some time now,&#8221; said Scott Fujita, a free agent linebacker who <a href="http://www.queerty.com/scott-fujita-pens-essay-in-support-of-marriage-equality-20130325/" target="_blank">recently penned a letter</a> in support of gay marriage for <em>The New York Times</em>. &#8220;Trust me, the coming out of a player would create much bigger waves outside the locker room than inside. The way I&#8217;ve seen the conversation around LGBT issues evolve, especially in the past few years, has been encouraging. Guys are more accepting than they used to be. Even those who raise personal objections to homosexuality, some of whom are good friends of mine, would still be able to coexist and accept a gay teammate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fujita was among the supporters of a marriage equality brief to the Supreme Court started by NFL players Chris Kluwe and Brendon Ayanbadejo. Should the Supreme Court overturn Prop 8, Freeman said it would &#8220;send yet another signal to closeted gay NFL players that the environment is changing for the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it will happen in baseball sooner than in football or basketball. The reason I say that is because I think there is less of a connection to religion in baseball. The religious roots are a lot deeper in basketball and football&#8230; I think baseball players are more open minded.</p>
<p>The baseball players I have known from growing up — I&#8217;ve known guys like Pat Burrell — just my interaction with the baseball players and them being on the road and stuff, their lives are a lot different. Whereas, the football guys, we have chapel every Sunday, no matter where we are — there are a lot of religious things going on, whether it&#8217;s chapel or Mass or whatever religious group you&#8217;re a part of, we have something for you. We do prayers before and after every game. I don&#8217;t know if baseball is like that, but I don&#8217;t think that it is.</p>
<p>I played baseball for 12 years growing up as a kid. So I don&#8217;t know. I could be wrong. But I just felt that they were a bit more open-minded and not so tied to religion as much as football and basketball.</p>

<p>Produced by Oscar-nominated documentarian Lauren Lazin (<em>Tupac: Resurrection</em>), the eight-episode series does include a same-sex couple—but whether you&#8217;d want them representing the LGBT community is debatable.</p>
<p>According to the press release, Jeff Pedersen, 46, and Blair Late, 30, metcute at a pool party and began dating &#8220;after a whirlwind one-week courtship that consisted of a dinner at Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills and a weekend trip to Catalina.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since California doesn&#8217;t recognize same-sex marriage. the two men actually <a href="http://www.blairlate.com/just-married/">had an extravagant domestic-partnership celebration</a> in Savannah, Georgia in April 2012.</p>
<p>But their love is complicated by a 16 year-age difference and contrasting &#8220;careers&#8221;—i.e. Jeff has one and Blair is an entertainment personality and &#8220;former European pop star.&#8221; Before they even toast their first anniversary, the guys are already seeing a sex therapist because of their divergent sex drives and the stress that their finances have put on their union.</p>
<p>Are we annoyed that such flakes are representing same-sex couples at a time when we&#8217;re desperately fighting for our rights? Meh, maybe if every other couple on every other reality-TV show wasn&#8217;t just as nuts.</p>
<p>Below, check out Blair&#8217;s reel from when he was with B3.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bravotv.com/newlyweds-the-first-year/season-1/videos/the-fantasy-and-reality-of-the-first-year"><em>Newlyweds: The First Year</em></a> premieres Monday, May 6, at 10pm on Bravo. </strong></p>

<p>Today the Supreme Court will hear arguments in <i>Hollingsworth v. Perry, </i>which explores the constitutionality of California&#8217;s Prop 8—and tomorrow, they Gang of Nine dig into the DOMA-busting <em>Edie Windsor v. U.S</em>. But it&#8217;s not the first time the Supremes have weighed in on our rights.</p>
<p>In January we pulled up some case histories to see how the Court has addressed the LGBT community to date. Given the importance of today and tomorrow, we&#8217;re reposting the feature. Hopefully the next time you see it, Number Six will include the case where the Court made a call for marriage equality.</p>
<p><em>Check back all day for updates on everything from the Supreme Court hearings themselves, to the dozens of vigils, rallies and events planned nationwide</em></p>

Year: 1958<br />
Subject: obscenity</strong> <strong>laws</strong></p>
<p>When members of the Mattachine Society tried to ship issues of <i>One: The Homosexual Magazine</i>, the FBI and U.S. Post Office declared it obscene—and, therefore, unmailable—even though the magazine didn&#8217;t include any erotic imagery or photos.</p>
<p><em>One</em>&#8216;s publishers sued, but lost their case and a subsequent appeal. Finally, the case made it to the Supreme Court, which reversed the earlier courts&#8217; decision, marking the first time the Court explicitly ruled on free-press rights regarding homosexuality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-245790" alt="bowers hardwick" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/01/bowers-hardwick.jpg" width="205" height="245" />Bowers v. Hardwick (1986)<br />
</span>Year: 1986</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: right to privacy, sodomy laws<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Upholding a Georgia state law, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that consenting adults do not have a constitutional right to private homosexual acts. The majority opinion, written by Justice Byron White, argued that the right to privacy only protected sexual acts between married couples and that there was no connection &#8220;between family, marriage, or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The case involved Michael Hardwick, a gay bartender with an outstanding warrant for public drinking. When the police came to his home unannounced, they found him, um, making a male friend <em>very </em>happy.</p>
<p>He was then charged under Georgia&#8217;s archaic sodomy statute.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited longstanding religious and social taboos against homosexuality, including 18th-century jurist William Blackstone&#8217;s description of gay sex as an &#8220;infamous crime against nature.&#8221;  Burger also stated that &#8220;to hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching. &#8221;</p>
<p>In his dissenting opinion, Justice Harry Blackmun accused the Court of an &#8220;almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity&#8221; and argued just because &#8220;certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry.&#8221;</p>
<p>We always liked Justice Blackmun.</p>

</span>Year: 1996</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: anti-discrimination laws</strong></p>
<p>In 1992, Colorado voters passed Amendment 2, which prevented any city, county or town from recognizing gays and lesbians as a protected class. Opponents claimed such a measure was unconstitutional and the ensuing lawsuit made its way to the Supreme Court, which struck down the amendment in a 6–3 decision.</p>
<p>In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy explained that anti-discrimination laws weren&#8217;t a &#8220;special right&#8221;—they simply enumerated the protections already enjoyed by all other citizens.</p>
<dl>
<dd>&#8220;The amendment imposes a special disability upon those persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint&#8230;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Its sheer breadth is so discontinuous with the reasons offered for it that the amendment seems inexplicable by anything but animus toward the class that it affects; it lacks a rational relationship to legitimate state interests.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Our good friend Antonin Scalia wrote the dissent, and was joined by Clarence Thomas and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. In Scalia&#8217;s opinion, Amendment 2 was &#8220;a modest attempt by seemingly tolerant Coloradans to preserve traditional sexual mores against the efforts of a politically powerful minority to revise those mores through use of the laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly how powerful Colorado&#8217;s LGBT community was in 1996 is open to debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Boy Scouts of America v Dale<br />
</span>Year: 2000</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: Boy Scouts of America, discrimination laws</strong><br />
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-245792" alt="James-Dale" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/01/James-Dale-360x432.jpg" width="194" height="232" /></p>
<p>Assistant Scoutmaster James Dale was booted from the Boy Scouts of America after revealing he was gay—and took them to court.</p>
<p>In another setback to the gay-rights movement, the Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Scouts have a right to their bigotry because the organization&#8217;s opposition to homosexuality was part of its &#8220;expressive message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justice Rehnquist&#8217;s majority opinion stated that the Constitution&#8217;s guarantee of freedom to association allows a private group like the Boy Scouts to be as prejudiced as they want, when &#8220;the presence of that person affects, in a significant way, the group&#8217;s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the KKK will never have to accept black people as part of an affirmative-action suit. That&#8217;s a relief!</p>
<p>Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent—joined by Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, and Souter—in which he lamented that &#8220;ancient&#8221; prejudices against gays and lesbians would be nurtured by the &#8220;creation of a constitutional shield.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-245793" alt="Lawrence-v-Texas" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/01/Lawrence-v-Texas-360x270.jpg" width="260" height="195" />Lawrence v. Texas </span><br />
Year: 2003</strong><br />
<strong>Subject: <strong>right to privacy</strong>, sodomy laws<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This was the big one: Just 14 years after <em>Bower v. Hardwick, </em>The Court did an about-face and overturned it, declaring a Texas sodomy law unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Justice Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion: &#8220;The state cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The whole case was a joke to begin with, honestly: Police had answered a 911 call claiming a black man with a gun was going wild in a Houston apartment building. But though John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner were arrested for  “deviate sexual intercourse,” the arresting officers couldn&#8217;t agree on what they saw: One cop said he witnessed oral sex, another anal, and two others said they didn&#8217;t see any sex at all. Lawrence and Garner had to endure public embarrassment, but at least a greater justice was served.</p>
<p>In a dissent that earned the enmity of the entire LGBT community, Justice Scalia chided his fellow jurists as having &#8220;largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ugh, it&#8217;s gonna be a long wait till March.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-230080" alt="Mike Huckabee" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/10/mike_huckabee-360x240.jpg" width="360" height="240" />Just yesterday, we reported how GOP chairman Reince Priebus told the <em>New Republic </em>that Mike Huckabee s<a href="www.queerty.com/gop-head-reince-priebus-thinks-mike-huckabee-should-be-partys-lgbt-rights-ambassador-20130324/">hould be the party&#8217;s point man on same-sex marriage </a>because he&#8217;s so &#8220;reasonable&#8221; on the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always tell people: Listen to Governor Mike Huckabee,&#8221; said Priebus. &#8220;I don’t know anyone that talks about them any better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, Huck wasn&#8217;t gonna let that insult go unchallenged!</p>
<p>In an interview with <em> <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/newswidget/huckabee-evangelicals-gay-marriage/2013/03/20/id/495593?promo_code=125BD-1&amp;utm_source=125BDTelegraph_Media_Group&amp;utm_medium=nmwidget&amp;utm_campaign=widgetphase1#ixzz2ObQvu9My">NewsMax</a></em>, the former presidential also-ran explains that there ain&#8217;t no way he or his Evangelical buddies will ever condone gay marriage. And if the GOP does? Well the faithful will abandon the party, praise Jesus!</p>
<p>Said Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister:</p>
<blockquote><p>They might [support gay marriage]. And if they do, they’re going to lose a large part of their base because evangelicals will take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>And it’s not because there’s an anti-homosexual mood, and nobody’s homophobic that I know of</strong>. But many of us, and I consider myself included, base our standards not on the latest <em>Washington Post poll,</em> but on an objective standard, not a subjective standard&#8230;</p>
<p>On this issue, I recognize the culture is moving away from the traditional standard, but it’s almost like saying, well, we have a basketball team and nobody on the team can hit the goal that’s 10 feet off the floor so we’re going to lower the goal down to six feet and that way everybody can slam dunk the ball.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, sounds reasonable and well-spoken to us!<em><strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve always wondered though, where would these ticked-off evangelicals go? Starting a third party is a losing proposition (even the Tea Party has only been able to influence the GOP, not rival it), and if they stay home, gays will reap even bigger benefits from a Democratic Congress.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s cut the bull, Mike—you are yours aren&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>

<p>On Monday, NYC Pride announced that <a href="http://www.queerty.com/?s=edith+windsor" target="_blank">Edith Windsor</a>, Harry Belafonte and Earl Fowlkes are the Grand Marshals of the 2013 pride parade. The news comes ahead of the oral arguments to be heard at the Supreme Court of the U.S. on Prop 8 and DOMA.</p>
<p>All three are being recognized for their tireless work for LGBT rights: Edith for her battle for marriage equality, Harry for his fight for human rights, and Earl for his leadership at the Center for Black Equity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year&#8217;s Grand Marshals have enriched the LGBT community through their dedication, accomplishments and commitment to the LGBT civil rights movement. By recognizing Edith Windsor’s historic court case, Harry Belafonte’s trailblazing activism and Earl Fowlkes’ outstanding LGBT leadership, we hope to<br />
inspire further action in attaining worldwide equality,&#8221; said Mike Dunlap, March Director for NYC Pride.</p>
<p>The Grand Marshals will lead the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/photos-more-from-the-2012-new-york-pride-march-20120627/" target="_blank">LGBT Pride March</a>, which runs from Midtown along 5th Avenue to the West Village along Christopher Street on June 30th. (More information on the parade <a href="nycpride.org/events" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Will Portman, the son of GOP Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, opens up about his coming out story. His father recently <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gop-senator-with-gay-son-embraces-marriage-equality-good-news-or-too-little-too-late-20130315/" target="_blank">changed</a> his position on marriage equality, citing Will as one of the reason for the shift. In the essay he <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/03/25/portman-coming-out/" target="_blank">wrote</a> for the <em>Daily Yale News</em>, Will talks about his father&#8217;s position as well as his own reluctance to make his personal life public.</p>
<p>One thing Will knew for sure was that he needed to come out to his parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;In February of freshman year, I decided to write a letter to my parents. I’d tried to come out to them in person over winter break but hadn’t been able to. So I found a cubicle in Bass Library one day and went to work. Once I had something I was satisfied with, I overnighted it to my parents and awaited a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;They called as soon as they got the letter. They were surprised to learn I was gay, and full of questions, but absolutely rock-solid supportive. <strong>That was the beginning of the end of feeling ashamed about who I was.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>After clearing the first major hurdle, Will began coming out to his friends and family &#8211; finding more confidence along the way. &#8220;I got serious about coming out,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;If anything, coming out seemed to strengthen my friendships and family relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for his father, he talks about the conversations they had leading up to Sen. Portman&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had decided that my dad would talk about having a gay son if he were to change his position on marriage equality. It would be the only honest way to explain his change of heart. Besides, the fact that I was gay would probably become public anyway. I had encouraged my dad all along to change his position, but it gave me pause to think that the one thing that nobody had known about me for so many years would suddenly become the one thing that everybody knew about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Monday, Cleveland Browns linebacker, Scott Fujita, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/sports/football/scott-fujita-acceptance-by-example-in-locker-room-and-at-home.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">published</a> a powerful essay in support of marriage equality. In the piece, which was posted to <em>The New York Times</em>, the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/?s=Scott+Fujita" target="_blank">player</a> writes about confronting the issue because his daughters asked him a question he couldn&#8217;t answer: “Why aren’t Clare and Lesa married?”</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t know how to explain to them what &#8216;inferior&#8217; means or why their country treats our friends as such,&#8221; Fujita writes. &#8220;I don’t want to tell them that &#8216;Yes, our friends love each other just like Mommy and Daddy love each other, but that their love is considered &#8216;less than.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fujita addresses the intolerance by mentioning what his own family went through (dealing with racial intolerance and his father being born in an internment camp). He also reveals what pushed him to speak out on the issue:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Years ago, my wife and I became friendly with a young woman whose teenage brother committed suicide after coming out to an unsuspecting and unsupportive father. This woman explained that her father was a football guy, a “man’s man” — whatever that means. She challenged me to speak up for her lost brother because, as she said, the only way to change the heart and mind of someone like her father was for him to hear that people he admires would embrace someone like his son.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;I hope that soon after Tuesday’s arguments in front of the Supreme Court, people like me won’t have to speak up for those sons or daughters. No one owns the definition of love. It comes in all shapes and sizes. As Toni Morrison wrote, &#8216;Definitions belong to the definer, not the defined.&#8217; One thing I know for certain is that you can’t put a face on love, and you can’t tell me what a family is supposed to look like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fujita&#8217;s essay comes ahead of the oral arguments to be heard at the Supreme Court regarding Prop 8 and DOMA. You can read the full essay <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/sports/football/scott-fujita-acceptance-by-example-in-locker-room-and-at-home.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>As we barrel toward Tuesday, when the Supreme Court starts hearing arguments in pivotal same-sex-marriage cases, GLAAD has <a href="http://www.glaad.org/blog/open-letter-lesbian-and-gay-couples-who-want-get-married">put together a checklist</a> of some of the things denied to gay couples looking to tie the knot.</p>
<p>Oh not tax breaks or health-care benefits—we&#8217;re talking about wedding cake, gowns, flowers and other accoutrement venders have refused to provide to same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Have a gander:</p>
<p>? <b>Cake</b>: This February, Oregon-based <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/aaron-klein-oregon-bakery-owner-lesbian-wedding-cake_n_2615563.html?view=screen" target="_blank">Sweet Cakes Bakery owner Aaron Klein</a> refused to sell a lesbian couple a wedding cake. &#8220;If I have to be penalized for my beliefs, then I&#8217;ll let it be what it is,&#8221; he said. Citing religious conviction, he said he&#8217;d rather be forced to close his business down than &#8220;be forced to do something that violates my conscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>? <b>Dress</b>: After trying on a dress in a New Jersey bridal salon, lesbian bride Alix Genter was called by the shop owner and told her business was no longer welcome. When <a href="http://gawker.com/5832200/bridal-shop-refuses-to-sell-a-lesbian-a-wedding-gown" target="_blank">Donna of Here Comes the Bride in Somers Point</a> saw that Genter had crossed out &#8220;groom&#8221; on an informational sheet and written, instead, &#8220;partner&#8221;, she contacted Genter with her decision: &#8220;There&#8217;s right and there&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and this is wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>? <b>Flowers</b>: Most recently, a beloved flower shop in Washington State, one that Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed had frequented for years, refused to do the flowers for their wedding after marriage equality passed in the November election. &#8220;I am sorry. I can&#8217;t do your wedding because of my relationship with Jesus Christ,&#8221; owner <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/07/arlenes-flower-shop-gay-wedding-washington_n_2828195.html?view=screen" target="_blank">Baronelle Stutzman</a> told the couple. Her shop has been open for almost forty years, and this is the first wedding she has declined.</p>
<p>? <b>Photographer</b>:  <a href="http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2012/08/21/abqnewsseeker/updated-n-m-high-court-to-hear-gay-ceremony-photo-case.html" target="_blank">Elane Photography</a> is a New Mexico based company co-owned by Elaine Huguenin, a devout Christian woman who refused to photograph a commitment ceremony after realizing that the couple was gay.</p>
<p>? <b>Wedding venue</b>: A Texas couple was denied a <a href="http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Tarrant-County-Party-Facility-Refuses-Gay-Couples-Wedding-Reception-192173061.html" target="_blank">venue for their reception</a>.</p>
<p>? <b>Honeymoon</b>: Two men were asked to leave a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/18/christian-gay-couple-ordered-pay-damages" target="_blank">Bed &amp; Breakfast</a> because of the owner&#8217;s Christian beliefs.</p>
<p>?<b> Paperwork</b>: A <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57936.html" target="_blank">New York town clerk</a> said she&#8217;d do everything in her power never to sign a gay or lesbian wedding license.</p>
<p>?<b>Reception</b>: The Boardwalk Pavilion—a public space run by the United Methodist Church in Ocean Grove, New Jersey—banned <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/judge-rules-christian-facility-cannot-ban-same-sex-civil-union-ceremony-on" target="_blank">same-sex couples from renting the property</a> for a ceremony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-189087" alt="Cardinal Keith O'Brien TH" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/03/Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-TH.jpg" width="250" height="186" />Disgraced <span>Cardinal Keith O&#8217;Brien, who stepped down from his post after allegations he made advances toward at least four priests, was allegedly in a &#8220;longstanding physical relationship&#8221; with one of them.<br />
</span></p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2297547/Cardinal-Keith-OBrien-priest-boyfriend-years-told-Vatican-lovers.html">The Daily Mail</a></em> reports that O&#8217;Brien, former head of<span> the Catholic Church in Scotland, had a priest boyfriend for years, one who made frequent visits to O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s official residence in Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span>His beau was going to go to the press, supposedly, until the Cardinal stopped him.</span></p>
<p>O&#8217;Brien, 75 has been vocal in his attacks on homosexuality and equal marriage, which he deemed a &#8220;grotesque subversion&#8221; and equivalent to child abuse and slavery. Vatican insiders initially tried to downplay the accusations as coming from part of a supposed &#8220;gay cabal&#8221; in the Church looking for revenge against O&#8217;Brien.</p>
<blockquote><p>These guys, we now know, were part of an inner circle. In the 30 years since these allegations took place there&#8217;s been ample time to complain. The Cardinal has had a huge profile for the past decade. But the door wasn&#8217;t just shut on them, it was bolted in the past 18 months,&#8217; another said.</p>
<p>I believe they wanted to silence O&#8217;Brien &#8211; as he&#8217;s about to do another conclave, and make a huge deal of it. As he&#8217;s retiring, a decision&#8217;s been taken to go public and take him down,&#8217; he claimed.</p></blockquote>
<p>But in an interview with the <em>Observer, &#8220;</em>Father Peter&#8221;—who admits to a longtime relationship with the Cardinal—says he came forward for &#8220;altruistic reasons: “I see the bigger picture: the cleansing of the church.”</p>
<p>Father Peter also says he&#8217;s in therapy for what he now considers abuse: “I was vulnerable and he knew that. He was very charismatic and I couldn’t believe his interest in me. I thought he was helping me.”</p>
<p>The ousted holy man is facing a Vatican inquiry, as well as a possible police investigation. One of the accusers, presumably not his boyfriend, is also suing O&#8217;Brien for groping and kissing him.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-145173" alt="sebelius_gay_health_2" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2011/06/sebelius_gay_health_2.jpg" width="300" height="200" />Shortly after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, President Obama asked me to identify steps we could take at the Department of Health and Human Services to improve the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans. As we mark the beginning of LGBT Health Awareness Week, I am proud to say that we have been working hard to ensure LGBT Americans have the same rights and protections as other Americans.</p>
<p>For example, we have released rules requiring Medicare and Medicaid-participating hospitals to allow visitation rights for same-sex partners. This means LGBT Americans now have the same opportunities as other Americans to be with their families and loved ones when they are sick.</p>
<p>LGBT Americans have experienced – and continue to experience – health disparities and are more likely than other Americans to be uninsured or underinsured. Now, because of the Affordable Care Act, our major national health surveys are beginning to include data on LGBT populations. This will give us the information we need to target and reduce disparities among this group going forward.  We have also formed an internal working group to ensure we’re developing and coordinating policies targeted at increasing access to care for LGBT Americans and addressing their special health-care needs.</p>
<p>Globally, we are leading efforts to advance a World Health Organization resolution supporting the health of LGBT populations around the world through equal access to health care services and by breaking down stigma and discrimination that create barriers to care&#8230;</p>
<p>Moving forward, we remain committed to improving the health of all Americans, including LGBT Americans, and we look forward to continuing this work during LGBT Health Awareness Week and beyond.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254622" alt="prodrasky" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/prodrasky.jpg" width="348" height="201" />If having an openly gay person in your life is more likely to make you embrace the LGBT community, then we&#8217;ve got a secret weapon in Jean Podrasky, the first lesbian cousin of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
<p>Roberts <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-prop.8-chief-justices-cousin-a-lesbian-will-attend-prop-8-hearing-20130324,0,834185.story">gave Podrasky a highly coveted ticket</a> to the Supreme Court&#8217;s hearing on California&#8217;s Prop 8, set to begin on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Podrasky, who will sit in seating reserved for family members and guests of the Justices, says she feels &#8220;quite honored and overwhelmed.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Roberts is a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005. Podrasky, who is more liberal, said she rooted for his nomination to be approved by the U.S. Senate. “He is family,”  she said.</p>
<p>Podrasky lives in San Francisco and usually sees Roberts only on family occasions. His mother is her godmother, whom she adores. She said Roberts knows she is gay and introduced her along with other relatives during his Senate confirmation hearing. She hopes he will meet her partner of four years, Grace Fasano, during their Washington visit. The couple flew to Washington on Sunday.</p>
<p>“He is a smart man,” she said. “He is a good man. I believe he sees where the tide is going. I do trust him. I absolutely trust that he will go in a good direction.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Podrasky, 48, will be attending with her partner Grace Fasano, as well as her sister and niece. She scored the passes by contacting Roberts’ sister and court secretary.  On Wednesday, her father will join them as the Court hears challenges to the Defense of Marriage Act.</p>
<p>“Everyone in this country has a family member who is part of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community,” Pordrasky wrote in a guest column for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. “As a Californian, I want nothing more than to marry my wonderful girlfriend. And as a tax-paying citizen, I seek basic fairness.”</p>

<p>- <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=328250763945015" target="_blank">According to</a> <em>Arrow</em>&#8216;s <strong>Stephen Amell</strong>, <em>Arrow</em>&#8216;s Stephen Amell is in talks to play the lead in <em>50 Shades of Grey. </em>Color us crazy, but we can totally get on board with that.</p>
<p>- <strong>William Daniels</strong> <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/boy-meets-worlds-mr-feeny-430559" target="_blank">will reprise his role</a> as Mr. Feeny on our future favorite tween comedy, <em>Girl Meets World</em>.</p>

<p>- Since he&#8217;s regressed to a third grader with <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/400815/david-beckham-takes-a-tumble-in-chin" target="_blank">no hand-eye coordination</a>, maybe it&#8217;s time <strong>David Beckham </strong>finally retire.</p>
<p>- Legendary feminist <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong> is no fan of<em> The Real Housewives</em> series, though she finds <strong>Lena Dunham</strong>&#8216;s <em>Girls</em> &#8220;realistic&#8221; &#8212; even if the sex is &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/meganj3/gloria-steinem-blasts-real-housewives-but-likes-girls" target="_blank">silly and boring</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Before she starts 90 days in rehab, <strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong> will make the wise decision to <a href="http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/24/lindsay-lohan-will-party-brazil-going-rehab" target="_blank">party it up in Brazil</a>. It&#8217;s nice to see that she&#8217;s taking it seriously this time.</p>
<p>- <em>American Idol</em> is continuing its rather rapid decline into irrelevance with some <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/03/22/american-idol-how-low-will-the-ratings-go/" target="_blank">seriously low ratings</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Angelina Jolie</strong> reportedly ignores her children <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/287440/the_villainess_jolie_ignores_her_children_until_they_speak_to_her_in_french/" target="_blank">unless they speak in French</a> in an effort to teach them <del>to hate her</del> the language.</p>
<p>- <strong>Carson Kressley</strong> is planning <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/eyeing_return_b4HZwQPR1r9YdNFLUDpyHO" target="_blank">a ten year reunion</a> with his <em>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</em> alums and hopes to give <strong>Ben Affleck</strong> a makeover since he&#8217;s not a fan of his beard. C&#8217;mon, Carson, show some respect &#8212; her name&#8217;s <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong>.</p>
<p>- Here&#8217;s <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> proving he can hang with the big boys by <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/justin-timberlake-takes-five-shots-of-tequila-in-under-10-mi" target="_blank">taking 5 shots of tequila in under 10 minutes</a>, or as we like to call it, a Tuesday:</p>

<p>Hmm, was mama buzzed from the brownies—or did she perhaps have herself a nice box of wine after seeing her son in the altogether with his cute beau?</p>
<p><strong>The followup post was even more precious:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5f9661f83641b94c4c2a19f95eab56a1/tumblr_inline_mj5zoi0Cwk1qcnum8.jpg" width="475" height="356" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My mom responded to the situation by buying me a door knob with a lock on it—best parental reaction or best parental reaction?&#8221;</p>
<p>You better do right on Mother&#8217;s Day, son.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254432" alt="jenkins smith family" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/jenkins-smith-family.jpg" width="400" height="300" />When Melissa Smith retires from the Navy in April, she should feel pride in praiseworthy career defending our nation. Instead she&#8217;ll feel sadness that the letter of recognition she wrote for her wife won&#8217;t be included in her official retirement ceremony.</p>
<p>T.J. Jenkins finally married her partner, Ship&#8217;s Serviceman Melissa Smith, two months ago in Maryland, where same-sex marriage is legal. But because of DOMA, she can&#8217;t be considered a spouse, according to Smith&#8217;s commanding officer.</p>
<p>That means that while other married servicemembers get to honor their partners &#8216; sacrifices as part of a longstanding Naval tradition, Jenkins efforts won&#8217;t be acknowledged.</p>
<p>She calls the snub &#8220;a slap in the face&#8221; and admits Smith has thought about not attending her retirement at all.</p>
<p>“My wife has served our nation for almost twenty years, and this is the way she is treated by her command?” says Jenkins (middle row, center). “I believe that Captain Geis is being a bully and using DOMA as a shield to hide behind.  He wants to use the terms &#8216;service member’s partner,&#8217; when in fact I’m not her partner, I’m her <em>wife</em>!”</p>
<p>The couple also says they&#8217;ve been told that only Smith&#8217;s two biological children will be acknowledged at the ceremony, not Jenkins&#8217; children that they&#8217;ve raised together. &#8220;They’re just going to give the certificates to two of the children and not the other four?” Jenkins explains. “You know how would that make them feel? Because they’re all sisters and brothers.”</p>
<p>Stephen Peters of the <a href="http://www.MilitaryPartners.org">American Military Partner Association</a> believes the C.O.&#8217;s directive show a real lack of leadership from both him and the entire chain of command: “Certificates of appreciation have been given out repeatedly throughout the Navy to same-sex spouses since the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,&#8221; says Peters. &#8221; It is simply outrageous that this commanding officer is now suddenly trying to use the Defense of Marriage Act as an excuse not to honor the wife of this Sailor at her retirement ceremony.”</p>
<p>Smith was named Navy Cash Sailor of the month in June 2008.</p>

<p>Magnolia Junior High School in Moss Point, Mississippi is under fire from the Southern Poverty Law Center after a former student there accused teachers and classmates of harassment.</p>
<p>Destin Holmes, 16, is now home schooled but attended Moss Point for one semester. During her time there, Destin &#8212; who identifies as a lesbian &#8212; claims she was subject to bullying not only from her fellow classmates, but from teachers and even the principal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2013/03/22/4545503/video-gay-student-discusses-being.html" target="_blank">According to Holmes</a>, she was referred to as &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; by staff and refused access to the girls&#8217; bathroom. During one lesson in which boys and girls were divided into teams, she was forced to be by herself.</p>
<p>“[The teacher] told me since she didn’t know what I was, I should be on a team of my own,” <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/23/us-mississippi-school-under-fire-for-alleged-bullying-of-lgbt-students-by-staff/" target="_blank">Holmes said</a> at an SPLC press conference. When she tried to report harassment to the principal, she says she was told, “I don’t want a dyke in this school.”</p>
<p>Holmes then wrote a letter to the SPLC, which launched an investigation of its own. The SPLC found widespread evidence of anti-LGBT bullying by staff and students, while victims were reportedly told by school officials to &#8220;suck it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPLC responded with a letter to the school demanding an end to the bullying and threatening a federal lawsuit if no action is taken.</p>
<p>”Students face enough obstacles in school without also enduring violence and abuse for simply being different,&#8221; said SPLC attorney Sam Wolfe. &#8220;They are entitled by law to attend school in an environment where they are not singled out and tormented because of their sexual orientation or gender nonconformity.”</p>
<p>Mass Point School District said in a statement on Friday that it takes &#8220;allegations concerning bullying and harassment very seriously&#8221; though it is &#8220;unable to discuss the allegations at this time due to it being an ongoing investigation.”</p>

<p>Matthew Lannon, 12, a sixth-grader at Wheeler School in Providence, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday evening at the Rhode Island State House in favor of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>It was a family affair as the bill was sponsored by his aunt, state Sen. Donna Nesselbush, and Matthew&#8217;s two moms were there to lend their support as Matthew articulately urged the Committee to &#8220;choose love.&#8221;</p>

<p>State and local governments pass resolutions honoring all kinds of things, usually with no one paying much mind.</p>
<p>But Georgia state Rep. Matt Ramsey (R-Peachtree City) was so interested in a proposed resolution honoring an LGBT marching band that he&#8217;s apparently trying to block its passage.</p>
<p>Ramsey requested <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/republican-house-member-blocks-freedom-band-resolu/nWzR7/">a delay on voting</a> on a resolution recognizing the <a href="http://www.atlantafreedombands.com/">Atlanta Freedom Marching Bands,</a> which is celebrating its 20th anniversary and gearing up to host the Lesbian And Gay Band Association conference during Atlanta Pride.</p>
<p>His only explanation for the delay was that GOP caucus members had &#8220;some questions&#8221; about it.</p>
<p>Jeez, don&#8217;t folks in marching bands get enough crap?</p>

<div class="giantquote">
<p>So now that I’m here and I’ve got a microphone in my hand and about 6,000 people watching me, I need to tell them how I feel.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, one big issue in hip-hop is the gay thing. It’s 2013, and it’s a shame that, to this day, that topic still gets people all excited. It’s crazy. And it makes me upset that this topic even matters when it comes to hip-hop, because it makes it seem like everybody in hip-hop is small-minded or stupid — and that’s not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve got people like Jay-Z. We’ve got people like Kanye. We’ve got people like me. We’re all prime examples of people who don’t think like that. I treat everybody equal, and so I want to be sure that my listeners and my followers do the same if they’re gonna represent me. And if I’m gonna represent them, then I also want to do it in a good way.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254426" alt="united for marriage" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/united-for-marriage.jpg" width="319" height="208" />This week gays and lesbians across America will be holding their collective breath as the Supreme Court hears arguments in to major marriage-equality cases. United for Marriage has helped sponsor 150 rallies, vigils and other events in all 50 states, and Logo TV is getting behind the group in a big way with on-air and online campaigns.</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, the network will broadcast the names of  LGBT couples—along with their home states and years of commitment, &#8220;in an effort to personalize and publicize the scope of the fight for marriage equality,&#8221; according to a statement (Couples interested in participating can register now on the <a href="http://logo.to/16M7EkT" target="_blank">Logo TV Facebook Page</a>.)</p>
<p>The Logo Instagram and twitter feeds will be featuring comments using the official <em>#UnitedForMarriage</em> tag, including quotes from <em>RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race </em>contestants and other personalities.</p>
<p>“As much as advocacy and personal experiences have made change, the media&#8217;s portrayals of real couples have also helped to bring marriage equality to the front lines,” said network president Lisa Sherman. Logo staffers will also be wearing red to work this week in support of the cause.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;know, if we didn&#8217;t blog in the nude we&#8217;d totally be wearing red, too.</p>

<p><strong>PHOTOS:</strong> Jenna Eagleton and Caroline Currie just got one hell of a wedding present: The couple won <em>Real Maine Wedding</em> magazine&#8217;s $100,000 Wedding of the Year contest.</p>
<p>The magazine announced Eagleton and Currie as winners on Sunday <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/gay-couple-wins-100k-maine-wedding-contest-18802116#.UU-JKhl5EzY">at the Maine Wedding Association Bridal Show</a> in Freeport. They&#8217;ve planned to get hitched in October in Kennebunkport—the prize money includes a reception, a wedding dress, tuxedos, rings, flowers and limo service.</p>
<p>Marriage equality passed in Maine in November—Currie and Eagleton planned to get married in 2014, but Currie&#8217;s father has been diagnosed with leukemia.</p>

<p>GLAAD is no longer the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Going forward the organization will <a href="http://www.glaad.org/blog/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-people-lgbt-community-and-allies-melissa-harris-perry-show" target="_blank">simply be known as</a> GLAAD, the LGBT media advocacy organization.</p>
<p>The name change, announced Sunday on MSNBC&#8217;s <em>Melissa Harris-Perry</em>, reflects GLAAD&#8217;s renewed commitment to incorporate transgender people as well as allies from diverse backgrounds in GLAAD&#8217;s work to shape the media narrative and build public support for LGBT people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a natural progression that reflects the work GLAAD&#8217;s staff is already leading,&#8221; said GLAAD&#8217;s spokesperson Wilson Cruz. &#8220;We respect and honor the full name that the organization was founded with, but GLAAD&#8217;s work has expanded beyond fighting defamation to changing the culture. Our commitment to marriage equality, employment nondiscrimination, and other LGBT issues is stronger than ever, and now our name reflects our work on transgender issues as well as our work with allies.&#8221;</p>

<p>We remember when rock was young: 66 years ago today, Reginald Kenneth Dwight sashayed out of his mother&#8217;s womb in a cloud of glitter, feathers and sequins.</p>
<p>Though he&#8217;s deemed himself <a href="http://social.popsugar.com/Elton-John-believes-he-now-too-old-dress-flamboyantly-1077613" target="_blank">too old</a> to dress &#8220;as flamboyantly as I used to,&#8221; we&#8217;re glad to take that yellow-brick road down memory lane and revisit Elton John&#8217;s greatest fashion &#8220;hits&#8221; in honor of his birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Check out Queerty&#8217;s retrospective of the Rocket Man&#8217;s signature style.</strong><br />
<strong> <a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton_star/" rel="attachment wp-att-254410"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254410" alt="elton_star" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton_star-360x362.jpg" width="360" height="362" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Sir Elton took this rather subtle pantsuit and embellished it with a statement shoulder &#8212; the statement being &#8220;Saturday night&#8217;s all right for gagging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-donald-duck/" rel="attachment wp-att-254418"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254418" alt="elton-john-donald-duck" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-john-donald-duck-360x262.jpg" width="360" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s style could often be described as &#8220;eccentric,&#8221; but this Donald Duck costume was the work of a quack. Note the absence of his signature glasses, meaning he probably got dressed blind. At least, let&#8217;s hope that was the reasoning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-254416"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254416" alt="Elton-John-1" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Elton-John-1-360x248.jpg" width="360" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>With all these feathers, Sir Elton looks like he&#8217;s about to fly away&#8230;and here we thought the peacock was a flightless bird.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonjohn-balls/" rel="attachment wp-att-254423"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254423" alt="eltonjohn-balls" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/eltonjohn-balls-360x505.jpg" width="360" height="505" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s mum must have been so proud when her little boy took first place at the science fair for his human molecule costume.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonjohn7_468x446/" rel="attachment wp-att-254417"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254417" alt="EltonJohn7_468x446" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/EltonJohn7_468x446.jpg" width="211" height="446" /></a></p>
<p>Here he is giving Julie Newmar/Eartha Kitt/Michelle Pfeiffer/Anne Hathaway a run for their money as Honky Catwoman.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-sequins/" rel="attachment wp-att-254419"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254419" alt="elton-john-sequins" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-john-sequins.png" width="320" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton decided to pair this patriotic mohawk with one of Bea Arthur&#8217;s <em>Golden Girls</em> evening gowns for a mash-up of &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; and &#8220;Miami, You&#8217;ve Got Style&#8221; &#8212; America&#8217;s quintessential tunes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-quilted/" rel="attachment wp-att-254421"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254421" alt="elton-quilted" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-quilted-360x306.jpg" width="360" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Who says you can&#8217;t wear a quilted lamé sofa cover as a jacket? It&#8217;s really an everyday look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-tommy/" rel="attachment wp-att-254422"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254422" alt="elton-tommy" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-tommy-360x464.jpg" width="360" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s no tiny dancer. Little known fact: these are the actual size of Sir Elton&#8217;s feet, making him quite popular with the gentlemen &#8212; and a few ladies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonbee/" rel="attachment wp-att-254415"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254415" alt="EltonBee" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/EltonBee.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s battles with drugs and booze have been well-publicized so you can bet he was more than a little buzzed in this bee costume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-50/" rel="attachment wp-att-254414"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254414" alt="elton-50" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-50-360x531.jpg" width="360" height="531" /></a></p>
<p>For his 50th birthday, Sir Elton made an entrance fit for a queen, er, king, serving Louis XIV eleganza  complete with a 15-foot feather train and a 3-foot powdered wig. It&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll repeat this outfit for his 66th, since he now only wears it on laundry day.</p>

<p>We reported on <a href="http://www.queerty.com/physique-magazine-magnate-controversial-bodybuilding-icon-joe-weider-dies-at-93-20130324/#ixzz2OUEmUMSw">the passing of muscle-magazine mogul Joe Weider</a> over the weekend. Starting in the 1940s and 50s, Weider was responsible for publishing some of the biggest physique magazines of the day, which were the pre-Stonewall equivalent of gay porn, even if no one admitted it.</p>
<p>In addition to providing an erotic outlet for gay men, publications <em>Adonis </em>and <em>Body Beautiful </em>allowed men attracted to other men to communicate via &#8220;pen pal&#8221; features. (Think of them as the prehistoric version of social media.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, we&#8217;re posting covers from some of Weider&#8217;s early &#8220;bodybuilding&#8221; publications. Have these kinds of mags been a part of your fantasy repertoire?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfpl/files/201303/Fairness%20Swastika%20Bumper%20Sticker.jpg" rel="nofollow"> <img alt="" src="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfpl/files/styles/placed_wide/public/201303/Fairness%20Swastika%20Bumper%20Sticker.jpg" width="516" height="385" /> </a></p>
<p>LGBT activists and their allies came to the ACLU KY/Fairness Campaign dinner in Louisville, Kentucky, ready to celebrate Governor Steve Beshear&#8217;s <a href="http://www.queerty.com/ky-governor-vetos-religious-freedom-bill-that-wouldve-legalized-anti-gay-discrimination-20130323/#ixzz2OVGZVvtL">veto of a House Bill 279,</a> which would&#8217;ve allowed individuals to ignore states law that ran counter to their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>But what happened afterward left a bad taste in everyone&#8217;s mouth</p>
<p>When Fairness Campaign director Chris Hartman left the Muhammed Ali Center at about 11:30pm, he found that his <a href="http://wfpl.org/post/fairness-campaign-director-chris-hartmans-car-damaged-defaced-swastika">car had been attacked by vandals</a>. The auto had been sideswiped, with the side mirror broken and dents and scratches along the exterior.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254449" alt="Vehicle Damage 3.23.2013 Hate Crime 1" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Vehicle-Damage-3.23.2013-Hate-Crime-1-360x268.jpg" width="264" height="196" /> The trolls also made sure no one thought it was an accident: Scrawled on Hartman&#8217;s Fairness Campaign bumper sticker was a swastika (above), and a sticker of President Obama&#8217;s face had horns and fangs on it. (&#8220;Fuck you&#8221; was written on another Obama sticker.)</p>
<p>The timing of the incident—right as supporters of the &#8220;religious freedom&#8221; bill are strategizing to overrule Beshear&#8217;s veto—is a <em>little</em> suspicious. But Louisville police discovered the side mirror of the car that struck Hartman&#8217;s not far from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re investigating the incident as a hate crime but it&#8217;s not clear if the vandals knew the car belonged to Hartman—one of the state&#8217;s preeminent LGBT activists—or just noticed the stickers.</p>
<p>Last April, the Fairness Campaign joined in a protest against a rally by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM) in Frankfort. And in January, two members of the NSM were arrested <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/01/25/kentucky-neo-nazis-charged-in-gruesome-murder-dismemberment/">for murdering a man</a>, dismembering his body, and then tossing the remains in a landfill.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56046817-78/scout-barnes-wingers-chipotle.html.csp"><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> reports</a> that three restaurants—Winger’s Roadhouse Grill, Utah Sports Lodge and Madeline’s Steakhouse—have stepped in to sponsor the May 4 event.</p>
<p>But Winger&#8217;s—a Western chain affiliated with TGI Friday&#8217;s—is hedging its bet by donating an equal amount to the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56046817-78/www.utahpridecenter.org/" target="_blank">Utah Pride Center</a>’s annual Queer Prom on April 20.</p>
<p>“We believe in the scouting program and believe it offers life skills to people,” said Winger&#8217;s President Curt Gray. “We believe most of all in non-prejudice and non-discrimination. We’re not trying to take a huge political stand here, but we tell this to our staff often and we thought we should put our money where our mouth is.”</p>
<div id="inlineContent">
<div>Gray commented that both organizations help to support and build leaders. The Center helps young gays, he said, who are &#8220;bullied and too often rejected by family and peers.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rejected, like the way they are by the Boy Scouts?</div>

<p><strong>PHOTOS:</strong> Hundreds gathered in Times Square for a candlelight vigil organized by LGBT advocate David Mizner in advance of next week&#8217;s monumental Supreme Court hearings. “The week of March 24 will be a historic week for the LGBT community, family and friends. For two days on that week, the United States Supreme Court is hearing arguments on both the DOMA and Proposition 8 cases. Rarely has a time called for dignified reflections and ‘giving witness’ to the moment,” said Mixner. “Not acknowledging the importance of those hearings in our lives is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Supporters of equality will continue to rev up for the big days at some 150 vigils, talks visits to Congressional offices and marriage bureaus, and more across all 50 states. For more details visit <a href="http://www.lighttojustice.org/">United for Marriage</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-213558" alt="Mike Huckabee" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/07/mike_huckabee-360x240.jpg" width="327" height="218" />Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, was quick to distance himself from <a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-gop-announces-then-renounces-inclusive-platform-20130319/">a GOP committee report </a>suggesting the party had to make substantive outreach to LGBT people and other minorities.</p>
<p>Seems like Priebus has his own plan for handling tough social issues: Put Mike Huckabee on them!</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/343723/priebus-huckabee-model-gop-andrew-stiles" target="_blank">interview with the <em>National Review</em></a>, Priebus said the former presidential candidate was a great point person for handling topics like marriage equality and reproductive rights, because he towed the party line while sounding “reasonable” to voters who disagree.</p>
<p>“I always tell people: Listen to Governor Mike Huckabee. I don’t know anyone that talks about them any better,” said Priebus.</p>
<p>But Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister and Fox news bobblehead, is hardly &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; In fact, he&#8217;s spit venom at gays and lesbians with the best of them. Here are some of his greatest hits, courtesy of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org">ThinkProgress:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>* Being gay is a public health risk.</strong> “I feel homosexuality is an aberrant, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7270.html">unnatural, and sinful lifestyle</a>, and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk”</p>
<p><strong>* Being gay is a sin.</strong> “Well I believe it would be — <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/12/08/4433947-huck-defends-aids-stance">just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful</a>. There are a lot of things that are sinful. It doesn’t mean that a person is a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what’s right and what’s wrong&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>* Same-sex marriage will lead to polygamy. </strong>“If we change the definition to a man or a man and a woman and a woman, why can’t we accommodate <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/02/28/177277/huckabee-polygamy/">a man and two women</a> or a woman and three men.”</p></blockquote>
<p>TP also reminds us Huckabee stood up for Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, backing his claim that women can&#8217;t get pregnant from sexual assaults.</p>
<p>Ugh, we liked it better when the GOP just hated us<em>.<br />

<p>Gender-blending valkyrie Tilda Swinton has fascinated us since we first saw her play both genders in <em>Orlando. </em>Now we can (hopefully) experience her magnificence in person as the ginger actress has put herself on display at the Museum of Modern Art in <a href="http://newyork.gaycities.com">New York</a>.</p>
<p>As part of a performance piece called <em>The Maybe</em>, Swinton will come into <a href="http://gothamist.com/tags/moma">MoMA</a> at various times over the next month and take a nap inside a glass box, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>-style.</p>
<p>Her first unannounced slumber was on Saturday. According to <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/photos_tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_in.php">Gothamist</a>, <em>The Maybe</em> was first performed in London in 1995 at the Serpentine Gallery and again at the Museo Barracco in Rome.</p>
<p>Says MoMA:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>An integral part of <em>The Maybe’s</em> incarnation at MoMA in 2013 is that there is no published schedule for its appearance, no artist’s statement released, no museum statement beyond this brief context, no public profile or image issued.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those who find it chance upon it for themselves, live and in real—shared—time: now we see it, now we don’t.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering we&#8217;d buy tickets to watch Swinton dry her nails, you <em>know </em>we&#8217;re gonna be there.</p>
