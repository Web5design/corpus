<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-nba-exec-rick-welts-rebounds-from-phoenix-suns-with-new-gig-20110928/" target="_blank">Openly gay</a> former Phoenix Suns executive and current Golden State Warriors president Rick Welts <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/gay-pro-athletes-get-backing-from-nike-to-nhl-as-sponsors-await.html" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a> that Nike is ready to just do it with the first athlete to come out.</p>
<p>“They made it clear to me Nike would embrace it,” Welts said. “The player who does it, they’re going to be amazed at the additional opportunities that are put on the table, not the ones that are taken off.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Bob Witeck, 61, a gay-marketing strategist and corporate consultant, the first openly gay team-sport athlete &#8212; provided he’s a recognizable name &#8212; would earn millions in endorsements and speaking engagements from companies seeking to capture more of a U.S. lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adult population whose annual buying power he pegs at almost $800 billion.</p>
<p>“We’ve passed the tipping point to where national advertisers are no longer afraid of the gay market,” said Mark Elderkin, chief executive officer of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Gay Ad Network.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former NBA player John Amaechi, who came out four years after retiring, said that <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nfl-forms-partnership-to-invite-gay-athletes-not-just-tolerate-them-20130412/" target="_blank">teams and leagues</a> are embracing the gays not (just) because it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but rather because it makes dollars and cents.</p>
<p>“Teams are not interested in diversity as a warm and fuzzy concept,” he explained. “It’s about winning. The business angle is the important angle.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Header_Main.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258281" alt="Header_Main" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Header_Main.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Last week, Toronto-based graphic designer, Michael DePippo, <a href="http://michaeldepippo.com/?p=3131" target="_blank">posted</a> pictures of his beautiful marriage to his husband, Shaun Robinson. The theme of their wedding was &#8216;Love At First Flight&#8217; due to the fact that they met each other at the Toronto Pearson Airport on Christmas Eve. They planned and designed the entire wedding themselves with the help of a few friends and family. The result was a unique, very DIY-chic, and memorable event.</p>
<p><strong>The Invitations</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_3623.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258282" alt="MG_3623" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_3623.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The invites included a postcard and an airline ticket. Part of the postcards read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Unlike most love at first sight tales, ours began at an airport one Xmas eve. We each were traveling alone, set to see our families. We shared a few glances. An introduction. Then somewhere between poor weather conditions, fate and a cancelled flight, we found ourselves seated side-by-side as the plane took off. And that’s how we plan to stay.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Logo</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MVDSSR_Logo3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258283" alt="MVDSSR_Logo3" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MVDSSR_Logo3.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Michael designed a logo based on the couple&#8217;s initials. Keeping with the theme, they look like airport codes.</p>
<p><strong>The Venue</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0177.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258284" alt="IMG_0177" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0177.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>They had an intimate ceremony inside the Market Kitchen located inside the St Lawrence Market in Toronto. On each seat was a custom designed airsickness bag in case anyone experienced &#8220;(e)motions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_42394.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258285" alt="MG_42394" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_42394.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ceremony</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1062.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258289" alt="MG_1062" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1062.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The couple&#8217;s officiant came dressed in a full pilot uniform and even customized the speech to stick with the theme of the wedding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome aboard. I am your Captain, Daniel Brereton and on behalf of Shaun, Michael and the rest of the crew here at Love at First Flight airlines, I want to welcome you aboard flight 09/03/13 service from St. Lawrence Market in downtown Toronto to Who Knows Where! We are currently flying at about 249 ft above sea level, however our ultimate cruising altitude will depend on you….and how much you enjoy yourselves this evening.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Food</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0049.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258286" alt="IMG_0049" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0049.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>Each guest was handed an inflight meal and Michael&#8217;s sister decorated the cupcakes.</p>

<p>The New Kids On The Block singer recently opened up to <a href="http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Gay Times</em></a>, in which he talks about being outed by popstar and former beard, Tiffany. &#8221;I felt stupid having to make a public statement,&#8221; he says in the <a href="http://www.afterelton.com/2013/04/renault-jonathan-knight-new-kids-on-the-block-cher" target="_blank">new issue</a>. &#8220;Even when the band got back together in 2008, New Kids fans knew I was gay. Everyone did.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he may have lived an open life, it wasn&#8217;t quite public knowledge. And former outing king, Perez Hilton, was one of the ones that was determined to break the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perez tried to out me many times and I hate that guy for doing that. I was already gay and living a gay lifestyle but he wanted me to talk about it. Why? My brother and the rest of the guys don&#8217;t go on interviews saying &#8216;I&#8217;m straight&#8221; etc. so why do I need to just because I&#8217;m gay? People like him want me to talk about it to make themselves feel better. They think &#8216;I&#8217;m gay so I want to make sure everybody knows I&#8217;m not the only one out there.&#8217; I hate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not that&#8217;s a misguided sentiment, we are happy that Jonathan is &#8216;officially&#8217; out and back in the music game. The group is currently on <a href="http://www.ticketnetwork.com/ticket/nkotb-events.aspx?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;gclid=CODPk8y-yrYCFUyY4Aod-UQAgg" target="_blank">tour</a> with Boyz II Men and 98 Degrees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after a West Hollywood attorney was declared brain dead after he exhibited symptoms of bacterial meningitis, residents of West Hollywood, Calif. have become increasingly concerned about a spread of the outbreak of the potentially deadly bacterial infection.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-258261 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="Brett_Shaad" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Brett_Shaad-360x384.jpg" width="252" height="269" /></p>
<p>On Friday Brett Shaad (pictured), a 33-year-old lawyer based in West Hollywood, was declared brain dead just days after friends described him as fit and healthy.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Shaad, the brother of Brett Shaad, issued the following statement regarding the family’s decision to remove Brett from life support Saturday night:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight our family made the incredibly difficult decision to remove my brother Brett from life support. He died peacefully surrounded by our family and friends.</p>
<p>“Brett was an extraordinary person. He was a loving son, brother and grandson, an attorney with a deep passion for social justice, and a dear friend to so many people. We cannot believe that this wonderful person is gone. We love you Brett.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brett was being treated at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Beverly Hills, CA. He was removed from life support tonight at 6:24 pm and passed away at 6:42 pm.</p></blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for the family, Elizabeth Ashford, issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Shaad family asks for privacy at this painful time, which has been made more devastating by irresponsible and inaccurate reports on the circumstances of Brett’s death. The family wants, and will pursue, answers for how and why this happened.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Queerty previously wrote:</p>
<p>As several media outlets have reported, Shaad attended the White Party in Palm Springs, Calif. during the weekend of March 30, but there has been no definite confirmation that he contracted the bacteria during that event.</p>
<p>The disturbing news comes a month after the New York City Department of Health, responding to a number of reported cases, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nyc-dept-of-health-warns-gay-men-of-terrifying-meningitis-outbreak-urges-vaccination-20130309/" target="_blank">urged men who have intimate contact with other men</a> to get vaccinated against the bacteria. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/after-meningitis-death-in-los-angeles-gay-activists-urge-vigilance.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a> reports &#8220;at least 22 men have contracted meningitis in New York since 2010, 13 of them this year, and 7 have died.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a press conference on Friday, Dr. Maxine E. Liggins, with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, advised residents to be look for early signs of meningococcal meningitis. These include a severe headache and stiff neck. If detected early the disease, an infection of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord, can be treated with antibiotics. She noted that  it can also intensify quickly.</p>
<p>John Duran, a West Hollywood city councilman and one of the few openly H.I.V.-positive elected officials in the country, says in a statement: “The lesson we learned 30 years ago in the early days of H.I.V. and AIDS is that people were not alerted to what was going on and a lot of infections occurred that didn’t need to occur. So even with an isolated case here, we need to sound the alarms, especially given the cases in New York.”</p>
<p>News of Shaad&#8217;s infection has shaken residents of West Hollywood, who quickly mobilized to use forms of social media to raise awareness of the potential epidemic while city officials plan to partner with gay advocacy groups to post notices in West Hollywood gyms.</p>
<p><a href="http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2013/04/12/bret-shaads-death-from-meningitis-causes-alarm-in-the-lgbt-community/" target="_blank">LGBTPOV</a>&#8216;s Karen Ocamb reports Duran as being concerned about the availability of sufficient vaccine to prevent the spread, if requested by people at risk. “We’re going to be working with our partners at the Gay and Lesbian Center, as well as the pharmacies in town, to make sure we have – if necessary – enough vaccines to get it out there to prevent the spread of meningitis,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>According to Huffington Post, Duran plans to introduce an urgency item on Monday to appropriate $20,000 for vaccines, for those who can&#8217;t afford them otherwise. &#8221;I think the county health department is dragging its feet and we don&#8217;t have the luxury of waiting,&#8221; he said. The vaccine will prevent invasive meningococcal disease from taking root but does not treat the disease if a person is already infected.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Queerty <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-man-arrested-at-hospital-after-refusing-to-leave-bedridden-partner-20130411/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Roger Gorley had been arrested and forcibly removed from the hospital room of his partner, Allen Mansell, following an altercation with Mansell&#8217;s brother Lee. The incident was widely reported as a gay rights issue, but now Lee says he is not homophobic and only wanted the best treatment for his brother, who suffers from severe depression.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/incident-at-research-medical-goes-viral-full-story-of-man-removed-from-sick-partners-beside" target="_blank">Kansas City&#8217;s KSHB</a> interviewed both Lee Mansell and Gorley about the incident, which began when Lee, unable to reach his brother, phoned 911 and had transported to Research Medical Center.</p>
<p>The two men began to argue over who had the rights to make medical decisions for Allen. Roger insists he wasn&#8217;t being disruptive, but objected to Lee having had Allen admitted to the hospital.&#8221;That would be like me going over to his house and taking his wife and hauling her off to the hospital without talking to him,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Gorley also says that during his heated discussion with Mansell, hospital security became violent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospital security came, and it started to hit me on my wrist&#8221; while he was holding onto Allen&#8217;s bed, Gorley says. &#8220;(They) hit me &#8230; because I was holding on, and they kept hitting and kept hitting and kept hitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Mansell says he&#8217;s not homophobic and loves Gorley as his own brother. He also reveals he&#8217;s received death threats since news of the incident went viral. &#8221;I&#8217;ve been called everything from a homophobe to things you can&#8217;t even say on TV,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had physical threats since someone was nice enough to post my email address online.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s tough out there for a talk show host, but Anderson Cooper has an idea that might have saved his daytime program. While reflecting on <a href="http://www.queerty.com/anderson-coopers-daytime-talk-show-cancelled-20121031/" target="_blank">the demise of <em>Anderson Live</em></a> Cooper says he&#8217;s had fun developing a new set of skills, but he&#8217;d have been more comfortable emulating the format of <em>Live With Kelly and Michael</em>, rather than hosting solo a la Oprah.<a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/anderson_cooper_01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-258245 alignright" alt="anderson_cooper_01" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/anderson_cooper_01-360x459.jpg" width="252" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>As the show struggled for ratings, it was given a makeover during its second season, including a name change and a new set. In an unfortunate coincidence the series was cancelled just as it began to hit its stride when Cooper enlisted close pals such as Andy Cohen and Kathy Griffin to guest as co-hosts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wanted a sidekick from the get-go,&#8221; Cooper tells <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-cooper-end-his-talk-436870?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20thr%2Fnews%20%28The%20Hollywood%20Reporter%20-%20Top%20Stories%29" target="_blank"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. &#8220;That was something I really regret and we kind of realized early on, but you know, we weren’t able to make the change until the second year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/photos-madonna-anderson-cooper-smash-snooki-and-more-at-glaad-media-awards-20130318/" target="_blank">recent GLAAD Award-winner</a> describes the experience was &#8220;absolutely worthwhile,&#8221; adding, &#8220;I like learning new things and I like developing new skill sets and I like challenging myself in different ways, and I think the daytime show has done that, you know?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can add Harrison Ford&#8217;s name to the list of celebrities wondering why the battle for same-sex marriage has been so lengthy and divisive. The superstar actor, best-known for blockbuster franchises such as the <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> films, is currently in movie theaters in <em>42</em>, the hit film which depicts the story of Jackie Robinson, the pioneering athlete responsible for integrating professional baseball.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-258239 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; cursor: default; float: right; border-width: 0px;" alt="images" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/images1.jpeg" width="154" height="210" /></p>
<p>While promoting the film, Ford discussed parallels between Robinson’s struggle and the current battle for marriage equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there’s a metaphor you can reach for, according to your own interests and your own understanding and your own issues,&#8221; the actor <a href="http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/2013/04/11/harrison-ford-opens-up/" target="_blank">tells Metro</a>. &#8220;But trying to create the best expression of the ideals — the most equal society, the best-regulated society, the best-behaving society — depend on attending to equality and inequity whenever it rears its ugly head. Certainly the marriage issue conveniently falls into that category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford also notes how public opinion on the issue has been rapidly changing over the past few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things do change quickly at a tipping point, as it builds and it builds and it builds until there’s a moment where the balance of opinion, the weight of experience and the understanding comes to a point where the scales tip in the other direction,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;We’re getting there, we’re getting there. You know, you would hope that it would have happened with less resistance. You would have hoped that everyone would get the point at the same time, but life’s not like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, come on, who would ever argue with Indy?</p>

<p>Matt R. Salmon, the gay son of <a href="http://www.queerty.com/az-congressman-with-gay-son-is-still-against-same-sex-marriage-20130331/" target="_blank">antigay Arizona Congressman Matt Salmon</a>, tells Anderson Cooper he still has a loving relationship with his parents and says, &#8221;I couldn&#8217;t expect my parents to fully accept me unless I accept them in their views.&#8221;</p>
<p>The younger Salmon stopped by <em>Anderson Cooper 360</em> says he hopes his father changes his position. I hope to get married some day and I hope I have his support,&#8221; he adds.<a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Salmon.png"><img class=" wp-image-258221 alignright" alt="Salmon" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Salmon-360x291.png" width="288" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>He also shares that he helped proofread a constitutional amendment written in part by his mother that stated marriage is between a man and a woman  because he was going through reparative therapy at the time and hoped to change to straight. &#8220;For me, it wasn&#8217;t really an issue,&#8221; says.</p>
<p>Asked by Cooper about a message for other young people whose conservative families don&#8217;t support their sexual orientation, Salmon says his family is a great example.</p>
<p>&#8220;My big hope is that people can look at my relationship with my parents and see that families can be conservative and have gay members and it doesn&#8217;t have to be this big ordeal. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fights and anger and hatred,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Salmon also reveals that he&#8217;d have no problem introducing his family to a boyfriend and that he thinks they&#8217;d be OK with meeting him.</p>

<p><strong>PHOTOS</strong>: There was a time when men &#8212; and some women &#8212; wore suits while drinking 35-cent whiskeys in bars with names such as Connie&#8217;s &#8220;Why Not?&#8221;, Cissy&#8217;s Saloon and The Purple Pickle. That time was San Francisco some 50, 60 years ago &#8212; before Ellen, before Elton, before Stonewall.</p>
<p>Mike Stabile from the <a href="http://queermuseum.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Pop-Up Queer Museum</a> set about mapping out these bars after pouring over the withered pages of defunct gay rags like <em>Vector</em>, <em>After Dark</em> and <em>David</em>, resulting in the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204308129084127659047.0004ae197e7ef9d21644a&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=37.758844,-122.42642&amp;spn=0.094288,0.052295&amp;source=embed" target="_blank">Lost Gay Bars of San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>While we certainly don&#8217;t yearn for the impromptu police raids and a life lived in the shadows, there&#8217;s something to be said about the gay old times depicted in these ads and photos from that &#8220;lost&#8221; era.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s also something to be said for this drink menu:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/lost-gay-bars-of-san-francisco-20130413/black-cat-menu-1950/" rel="attachment wp-att-258214"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258214" alt="Black-Cat-Menu-1950" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Black-Cat-Menu-1950.jpg" width="576" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>Those kids must have known how to party back then because a dollar and some change could probably get you <em>wrecked</em>.</p>

<p>Campana had unsuccessfully attempted suicide and was taken off life support last August.</p>
<p>According to his mother, Nancy, she was asked about his sexual activity including questions about whether or not he was gay and if he was sexually active or had a partner.</p>
<p>After confirming that he was both, Trillium Gift of Life said that they could not accept his organs.</p>
<p>Although upsetting, the decision didn&#8217;t violate Health Canada&#8217;s rules. In 2007, it had changed donation rules for sexually active gay men and injection drug users.</p>
<p>According to Health Canada policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gay man who had practiced abstinence for five years prior to organ donation would be considered an acceptable donor.</li>
<li>A heterosexual man who has had a single sexual encounter with a male within the past five years would not be considered an acceptable donor.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are similar to similar to donating blood, which limits who can donate to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV.</p>
<p>While Rocky&#8217;s friends understood the situation, Nancy found the news to be a shock.</p>
<p id="yui_3_4_1_2_1365808435018_46">&#8220;When I got off the phone to relay that to both [Rocky's father] Rob and a lot of Rocky&#8217;s friends &#8230; many of them broke down,&#8221; she <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2013/04/12/wdr-rocky-run-organ-donation.html" target="_blank">told</a> CBC. &#8220;The gay ones said, &#8216;Nancy, we can&#8217;t donate blood; they&#8217;re not going to take our organs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Though not all are planning to let the rules stand. According to the CBC, petitions are being developed to challenge the new policies to make it easier for gay men to donate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/gorley1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-258164 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="gorley" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/gorley1.jpg" width="326" height="209" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, Queerty <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-man-arrested-at-hospital-after-refusing-to-leave-bedridden-partner-20130411/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Roger Gorley was arrested and forcibly removed from a hospital where is husband, Allen, was receiving medical attention. Allen had been submitted to the Research Medical Center in Kansas City instead of St. Luke’s Hospital in Lee’s Summit where he regularly went for treatments of his depression.</p>
<p>This decision, which was made by Allen&#8217;s family, was in direct contrast to his and Roger&#8217;s medical treatment wishes. Even though Roger has power of attorney, his directions were not recognized by the family or the hospital staff.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/04/12/1857741/what-actually-happened-to-that-same-sex-couple-in-the-missouri-hospital/" target="_blank">ThinkProgress</a>, Roger&#8217;s daughter Amanda gave a detailed account of what happened inside the hospital resulting in her father&#8217;s arrest. The site breaks down the account into the couple&#8217;s background, the dispute with the family that lead to the violent arrest and the aftermath.</p>
<p>Two of the most disturbing details to come out of Amanda&#8217;s account:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The nurse informed Roger that because of his agitated state, he needed to leave. When he explained that he intended to stay with his husband, she replied, “I know who you two are. You need to leave.” Refusing to acknowledge their legal relationship, she called the police to have Roger forcibly removed.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>The police assumed because Roger is gay that he must have HIV. The brutal struggle had drawn blood, and one officer was so disturbed that he insisted on using gloves to handle Roger and refused to even take back his handcuffs.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>But then again, you&#8217;re probably not a Republican, because that&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/12/republican-party-says-no-to-same-sex-marriage/#ixzz2QHEnCO9U">the Republican National Committee has done</a>.</p>
<p>Even better, one of the resolutions the RNC passed unanimously (of course) was introduced by Dave Agema, a Michigan legislator who has been honored by Queerty as <a href="http://www.queerty.com/michigan-rnc-member-defends-posting-about-gays-filthy-lifestyle-refuses-to-resign-20130329/">Douche of the Week </a>for his homophobic rantings on Facebook.</p>
<p>So now the party is once again on record for supporting traditional marriage.</p>
<p>The real drama is the tension that the RNC move is generating within the party. Last month, a<a href="http://www.queerty.com/gop-knows-it-needs-to-talk-about-change-it-just-doesnt-want-to-actually-make-any-20130321/"> post-mortem of the 2012 election debacle</a> hinted ever-so-gently that perhaps the anti-gay thing might be a bit, you know, <em>de trop.</em></p>
<p>In particular, it doesn&#8217;t sit well with young voters, and <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/345389/against-rnc-s-gay-marriage-resolution-liz-mair">even with young Republican voters</a>. But the party base, which has given us politicians of the Agema ilk, sees things entirely differently.</p>
<p>In fact, even as the rest of the country is getting more comfortable with marriage equality, a <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/12/17719887-first-thoughts-family-ties-vs-modern-family?lite">new poll </a>finds that Republicans are as opposed to it as they were in 1999.  That&#8217;s the group the party is pandering to, even at the expense of its own future demographic demise.</p>
<p>Meantime, the right wing isn&#8217;t at all happy that the subject is even open to debate. The Family Research Council has called on its followers<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/frc-tony-perkins-gop-gay-marriage-89989.html"> to stop donating to the GOP</a> until the party draws a line in the sand on marriage equality.</p>
<p>Fun times all around.</p>

<p>Of the respondents polled, 8-in-10 claim to know or work with someone who is gay or lesbian, which is up <i>14 points</i> since December.</p>
<p>Knowing and working with LGBT people may have helped increase those numbers, but certainly not as much as <a href="http://www.queerty.com/study-tv-turning-the-tide-in-favor-of-gay-marriage-20130412/">television can</a>. Only 15% of those surveyed say their relationships with LGBT people make them more likely to back same-sex marriage, and more than half say it doesn&#8217;t really make a difference.</p>
<p>We wonder how the numbers will change once <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nfl-forms-partnership-to-invite-gay-athletes-not-just-tolerate-them-20130412/">pro athletes start creeping out of the closet</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/1297312154654_ORIGINAL.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-258132" alt="1297312154654_ORIGINAL" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/1297312154654_ORIGINAL-360x234.jpg" width="360" height="234" /></a>With several professional athletes rumored to be coming out of the closet in the very near future, the sports leagues of America are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/12/sports/hockey/nhl-announces-initiative-in-support-of-gay-athletes.html?_r=0">preparing to roll out</a> the red carpet for them in an effort to embrace diversity and combat homophobia in sports. While everyone remains fixated on the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nfl-star-kerry-rhodes-claims-hes-not-gay-after-super-gay-candid-photos-surface-20130411/">players of the NFL</a>, it looks like the National Hockey League may be the <i>most</i> accepting of all.</p>
<p>During a press conference held last night, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman<em> (right)</em> and NHL Players&#8217; Association executive director Donald Fehr joined You Can Play project founder Patrick Burke in <a href="http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/51204-NHL-NHLPA-partnership-with-You-Can-Play-a-monumental-step-forward.html">announcing a partnership</a> that won&#8217;t just tolerate openly gay athletes in the NHL, but welcome them. &#8220;While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community,&#8221; said Bettman, &#8220;we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture…that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The big shift is that this is a professional sports league saying not that, ‘We tolerate you,’ not that, ‘We’ll deal with it if we need to,’ but that they’re inviting us in,&#8221; added Burke. &#8220;It’s exciting.”</p>
<p>A first of its kind, the legally binding partnership will allow You Can Play to conduct seminars educating players on gay equality issues, integrate the organization&#8217;s message of &#8220;respect for all&#8221; into the league&#8217;s Behavioral Health Program, allow players to confidentially seek counseling or education, and create public service announcements that promote equality.</p>
<p>Now that the NHL is working toward making equality a major issue for <i>all</i> sports leagues, let&#8217;s start working on those uniforms. We know the ice is cold, but we&#8217;d probably watch more often if the players were <a href="http://www.queerty.com/pop-brownies-morrissey-beyonce-justin-bieber-turkish-oil-wrestling-20130305/">as scantily clad as Turkish wrestlers</a>.</p>

<p>Lunga Voko recounted the attack, which took place on March 31 &#8212; Easter Sunday &#8212; to <a href="http://www.timeslive.co.za/thetimes/2013/04/12/my-living-hell-for-being-gay" target="_blank"><em>The South African Times.</em></a> At 5:30 pm, on his way home from celebrating his birthday with some friends, a group of drunken men at a gas station not too far from his house began swearing at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys were sticking out of the windows [of their car], calling me gay, <em>istabane</em>, <em>imoffie</em> because I was wearing my shorts, but I ignored them and we kept walking,&#8221; Voko said.</p>
<p>When the car pulled up, Voko&#8217;s friends ran away, leaving him to deal with his harassers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got out of the car and started asking me questions like why I&#8217;m a <em>moffie</em>, but I wouldn&#8217;t answer them,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The next thing one of the guys slapped me and another attacked me with an iron rod, while the others gathered half bricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voko said he lost consciousness after being hit on the head, but witnesses told his family that the men had pulled his penis out of his pants to see whether he was circumcised. The men continued to beat him then finally one of them pulled out a gun and shot at Voko, tearing off part of his right ear.</p>
<p>The young man woke up in the hospital the next day. He attempted to report the attack, but he claims the police refused to help him, though they eventually tracked down the license plate of the attackers&#8217; vehicle.</p>
<p>Western Cape police spokesman Andre Traut said police were investigating but no arrests had been made. &#8220;Crimes of this nature are perpetrated from time to time, but cannot be described as prevalent,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Voko said that while he had been ridiculed for being gay before, neither he nor his gay friends had been attacked before. He had never felt threatened until now. But gay rights activist Mabhuti Mkhangeli said the attack on Voko proves that gays are still not accepted in certain parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will say it&#8217;s not normal and that culture does not permit two people of the same sex to love each other,&#8221; said Mkhangeli of people in townships.</p>
<p>Despite this recent attack, a young gay couple was <a href="http://www.queerty.com/watch-first-traditional-african-gay-wedding-20130409/" target="_blank">married over the weekend</a> in the small South African town of KwaDukuza with the full blessing of their friends and families.</p>

<p>Get ready for a master class in shade when Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi star in the new British sitcom, <em>Vicious</em>, by <em>Will &amp; Grace</em> writer and producer Gary Janetti.</p>
<p>McKellen and Jacobi &#8212; both openly gay and coincidentally, knights in the queen&#8217;s army &#8212; play an acerbic couple who have been together for 48 years, marking the first time either actor has appeared in a sitcom.</p>
<p>The show premieres on the U.K.&#8217;s largest commercial network, ITV, later this month and though it hasn&#8217;t been sold to America as yet, Janetti knows that stateside audiences love a world-class septuagenarian British thespian throwing shade at everyone.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Downton Abbey</em> is the biggest hit PBS has ever had,&#8221; he told <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/miptv-vicious-stars-ian-mckellen-436880" target="_blank"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.  “We all know what a British accent sounds like – we all watched <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em> – I think American audiences will go for this show and will watch it in its British form.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Of all the ridiculous reasons we&#8217;ve heard religious nutjobs give to justify their opposition to same-sex marriage, this one may be the worst. <a href="http://youtu.be/pr0BFezu9dE">In an interview</a> with Current TV&#8217;s John Fugelsang, current president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, Bill Donohue, claimed the &#8220;idea of two men getting married is one of the most bizarre ideas in human history&#8221; because &#8220;marriage is not about love.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pr0BFezu9dE" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>But what, exactly, does Bill Donohue think marriage is all about? Babies, of course! &#8220;The whole purpose of marriage is to make a family,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about making people happy, it&#8217;s not about love.&#8221; He still believes sterile heterosexuals have the right to be married, though, claiming they&#8217;re still &#8220;anatomically equipped&#8221; for children.</p>
<p>Though he claims to loosely support civil unions, Donohue believes the idea of same-sex marriage is bizarre namely because he can&#8217;t think of &#8220;a single society in the history of the world…that would ever entertain this.&#8221; Perhaps he had fallen asleep during history class, or conveniently forgot about the same-sex pederasty unions in Ancient Greece, the lesbian wedding ceremonies of China&#8217;s ancient Ming dynasty, or the fact that thirteen of the first fourteen Roman Emperors were believed to be homosexual, two of whom were legally wed to other men.</p>
<p>Aside from marriage equality, another &#8220;absolutely bizarre&#8221; concept he can&#8217;t seem to grasp is marriage between two people that love each other. For Donohue, marriage should be treated strictly as an &#8220;act of duty,&#8221; or, a union between two people uninterested in each other for the purpose of creating children that can also marry people they don&#8217;t care for, and so on. He claims there are psychological and emotional advantages to having both a mother and a father, but isn&#8217;t it more psychologically damaging for children to be raised by two heterosexual people that hate each other than two homosexual people in love?</p>
<p>Hey Bill, how do you feel about marriage between two douchebags? Because honey, <strong>you are a Grade-A DOUCHE</strong>.</p>

<p>Bradley Kindrick told police the incident happened around 2:30 a.m. when the assailant walked in and started flirting with him. The two then walked back toward the bathroom where, Kindrick says, the man grabbed and slammed him up against the wall, then forcibly kissed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scared to death,&#8221; Kindrick told <a href="http://www.wavy.com/dpp/news/local_news/va_beach/man-claims-he-was-fired-for-being-gay" target="_blank">NBC affiiate, WAVY</a>. &#8220;I was scared that something was going to go further&#8230; that he was going to do something really bad to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few days later, Kindrick said he was fired by store management, who claimed he was drunk on the job. Kendrick denies the allegations and maintains that he was fired for being gay &#8212; something 7-11 denies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think because I am openly homosexual I think that they think maybe somebody would come in and do it again,&#8221; Kindrick said. &#8220;I think that they made up a reason to let me go because they didn&#8217;t want stuff like that happening at that store, and they felt like if they kept me, something like that would happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Virginia&#8217;s discrimination laws don&#8217;t cover sexual orientation or gender identity, 7-11 says that it does not discriminate against its employees. Meanwhile, police are currently searching for the kissing bandit and anyone with info is encouraged to contact Crime Line at 1-888-LOCK-U-UP.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/my-goodness-is-every-golden-globe-nominee-gay-or-what-20091215/gay-couple-modern-family/" rel="attachment wp-att-77499"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-77499" style="margin: 10px;" alt="gay-couple-modern-family" src="http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2009/12/gay-couple-modern-family-320x160.jpg" width="320" height="160" /></a>A new survey suggests that portrayals of LGBT characters have positively impacted the opinions of Americans on gay marriage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6060&amp;wt.mc_id=1110466&amp;ce=brent@thewrap.com&amp;link=6060top=" target="_blank">According to the poll</a>, conducted by Ipsos MediaCT, 18% of television watchers aged 13-64 say that TV in general has changed their opinion of same-sex marriage in a positive way. In comparison, 10% said TV had a negative impact on their views.</p>
<p>Among the more stubborn TV set, 44% of pro-gay marriage viewers were unaffected by television and 28% of anti-gay marriage viewers remain opposed.</p>
<p>“Based on this data, I think we can conclude that TV has, at least in part, moved the needle of public opinion to see same-sex marriage in a positive way,” says Ben Spergel, Senior Vice President and Head of TV Insights at Ipsos MediaCT. “With everything from higher profile portrayals of gay characters, to celebrity support of gay marriage, to last year’s groundbreaking endorsement by President Obama, we are seeing a shift in our culture that is being influenced by popular culture.”</p>
<p>Media coverage of the Supreme Court hearings on California&#8217;s Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act also played a role in shifting opinion. Nearly half (47%) of TV viewers surveyed felt that TV coverage had been generally well-balanced between proponents and opponents of gay marriage, while a third (33%) felt it was skewed towards the proponents.</p>
<p>Of the 1,096 respondents, 30% say that they watched some news coverage of the Supreme Court hearings.</p>
<p>Leading up to those historic hearings, <em>Modern Family</em> creator Steven Levitan <a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news/modern-family-co-creator-steve-levitan-id-happy-205044580.html" target="_blank">expressed hope</a> that his show had somehow benefited the national marriage equality conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we played even the tiniest role in helping to defeat Prop 8 and giving all gay people the equal rights they deserve, then I&#8217;m a happy man,&#8221; Levitan said.</p>
<p>Cam and Mitch would be proud.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you see a title like <i>Showgirls! The Musical! </i>and buy a ticket without even finding out how much it costs first. The enticing possibility of witnessing a version of the 1995 classic film made even campier with the addition of showtunes is too good to resist, right? While MediumFace Productions doesn’t always deliver fully on the promise of their good idea, they nonetheless offer a solid night of sometimes surprising, sometimes sexy, and frequently hilarious fun.</p>
<p>Rather than setting out to provide a strict retelling of the movie’s plot, the show plays fast and loose with the details, touching on all the moments you remember without getting too fussy about the order in which they occurred or who was there when it happened. While there are events and transitions that wouldn’t make a lick of sense without some foreknowledge of what’s supposed to be going on, it hardly matters, seeing as you wouldn’t attend if you weren’t already a devotee of the source material.</p>
<p>Particular praise goes to the outstanding cast; each person on the Kraine’s tiny stage is thrusting themselves at their task with full force. As Nomi, April Kidwell gives more to the role than Elizabeth Berkley ever could have. Her every line is punctuated with the perfect guttural grunt, glazed facial expression, or inappropriate sexual gesture. Sometimes all three. Rori Nogee, as Cristal Conners, matches her well, slapping on a permanent sexface that simultaneously captures and comments on Gina Gershon’s moist performance. Supporting them is an ensemble of comedic talent, most of whom take on multiple roles, that wrings the script of every last laugh and probably earns a few that weren’t there to begin with.</p>
<p>The writing itself, which blends lines lifted directly from the original film with new dialogue from creators Bob and Tobly Smith, is good but not great. As indicated by the tagline (“Singing. Dancing. Tits.”), the duo occasionally succumbs to the obvious joke. At its best, however, the book is satisfyingly weird and charmingly irreverent, building on the humor you already knew was lurking just below the surface with some fresh laughs you had no idea were coming. Without spoiling anything, I’ll say that a random French accent near the midpoint shocked me into a fit of uncontrollable cackling.</p>
<p>If there’s a weak point to be found in this musical, it’s the music itself. Given the constraints of the space, the players have to forgo a larger band, making do with accompaniment from only a guitar and bass. The resulting sound is somewhat hollow and loose. Especially given how much rhythmic dancing is being done, the omission of any sort of percussion seems particularly glaring. As for the songs themselves, they seemed a bit formless and not always justified. The Act I finale was the first time I felt that the creators had truly used a musical interlude to deliver humor that couldn’t have been earned from simply speaking the lyrics.</p>
<p>While you certainly won’t leave the theater humming any of the melodies (sometimes I’m not sure there was one), I’d nonetheless recommend <i>Showgirls! The Musical!</i> overall. Live theater is a delight to behold when executed by performers with this much dedication, skill, and dare I say sex appeal. (I’d go again just to see Israel Viñas in his gold underwear a couple more times.) The $20 price point is a tad steep for a production of this scale, but it’s more or less earned by the end of the night. There are few other places in the city where you’d be laughing this hard for that price, and nowhere that would also provide partial nudity. It&#8217;s bad taste at its best.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Nevada Senate Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would repeal the state&#8217;s ban on same-sex marriage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/apr/11/nevada-senate-committee-approves-resolution-gay-ma/" target="_blank">Las Vegas Sun News</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>The original proposal sought only to repeal language in the state constitution that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. But a late amendment adopted by the committee today adds that the state &#8220;shall recognize marriages and issue marriage licenses, regardless of gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt it would be cleaner to both eliminate the current prohibition and make it clear Nevada does not discriminate in any way,&#8221; said Sen. Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, who introduced the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2002, Nevada voters overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the state constitution that “only a marriage between a male and female person shall be recognized and given effect in this state.” Then in 2009, despite a veto from then-Governor Jim Gibbons, the legislature passed a domestic partnership law affording rights similar to marriage.</p>
<p>Segerblom&#8217;s bill now goes to the full Senate, but it will have to be approved by this session of the legislature and again in 2015 before being placed on the ballot for voters to decide during the 2016 election.</p>
<p>And of course, there are staunch opponents to repealing the ban on gay marriage, such as Janine Hansen, president of Nevada Families for Freedom, who called the resolution a &#8220;kick in the teeth&#8221; to voters who banned gay marriage in the first place.</p>
<p>Okay, so maybe Nevada didn&#8217;t get invited to the party so much as just crash with a bunch of its rowdy friends, drink all the booze, pee in the kitchen sink and drive into the mailbox on its way back to ten years ago &#8212; but it was nice to see &#8216;em.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/5437432197_1ed10abdd8_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-257985" alt="" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/5437432197_1ed10abdd8_b-670x446.jpg" width="390" height="259" /></a>In the annals of political follies, Progress KY holds a special place as one of the most inept groups ever. Despite their name, they are the best friends Republican Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ever had. In February, Progress Kentucky made news for suggesting that Elaine Chao, McConnell&#8217;s wife and the former Secretary of Labor, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/02/26/172987819/liberal-super-pac-under-fire-for-tweets-about-mcconnells-chinese-wife">wanted to move American jobs to China</a> because she&#8217;s Asian-American.</p>
<p>Now the duo behind Progress Kentucky, Curtis Morrison and Shawn Reilly, have followed that disaster up with an even bigger one: <a href="http://wfpl.org/post/source-progress-kentucky-behind-mitch-mcconnell-campaign-recording">apparently taping, potentially illegally, a meeting at McConnell headquarters</a> at which staffers trashed potential opponent Ashley Judd. The tape was leaked to <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine and has since become a political bonanza for McConnell, allowing him to portray himself as a victim of &#8220;left-wing activists.&#8221;</p>
<p>And just our luck, there is a gay angle to this story. <a href="http://unitedwestandky.com/2010/03/exclusive-interview-with-curtis-morrrison-d-louisville-candidate-for-jefferson-county-judgeexecutive/">Curtis Morrison is gay</a>.</p>
<p>Morrison and Reilly were outed by <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/democratic-official-now-talking-to-fbi-about-progress?ref=fpa">Jacob Conwa</a>y, a Democratic county official who says that the duo told him about the recording shortly after they made it. Conway adds another lavender dimension to the story, since he has been <a href="http://insiderlouisville.com/news/2012/06/29/freedom-to-marry-effort-in-kentucky-starts-with-louisville/">a leading voice for marriage equality</a> in the state party.</p>
<p>So, to recap: we have a PAC that<a href="http://wfpl.org/post/source-progress-kentucky-behind-mitch-mcconnell-campaign-recording"> raised $1005 in the last election cycle and spent $18</a>, has an openly gay man in its leadership in one of the nation&#8217;s most conservative states and has been involved in ethnic slurs and potentially illegal taping.</p>
<p>Is this a gift from the gods to Mitch McConnell? Will he make hay of it at our expense?</p>

<p>Ok gays and girls, there&#8217;s one movie you absolutely need to make time to see: <em>G.B.F.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a brand new teen comedy from the director of Jawbreaker and a fabulous gay screenwriter from Moon Twp, PA, George Northy. The film will make it&#8217;s premiere at the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/g-b-f-gore-vidal-moms-mabley-and-more-queer-goings-on-at-tribeca-20130311/" target="_blank">Tribeca Film Festival</a> next week and hopefully breakout nationwide soon after. And like the title of this post mentioned, everyone is in it: Natasha Lyonne (<em>American Pie</em>), Sasha Pieterse (<em>Pretty Little Liars</em>), Andrea Bowen (<em>Desperate Housewives</em>), Molly Tarlov (<em>Awkward</em>), JoJo (<em>Aquamarine</em>), Evanna Lynch (<em>Harry Potter</em>), Megan Mullally (<em>Will &amp; Grace</em>), Derek Mio (<em>Greek</em>), Mia Rose Frampton (<em>Bridesmaid</em> &#8211; the c*nt scene), Paul Iacono (<em>The Hard Times of RJ Berger</em>), Rebecca Gayheart (<em>Jawbreaker</em>), Horatio Sanz (<em>Saturday Night Live</em>), Jonathan Silverman (<em>Weekend At Bernies</em>) and Xosha Roquemore (<em>Precious: Based on the Novel &#8220;Push&#8221; by Sapphire</em>).</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve watched the movie last week and it&#8217;s absolutely hilarious. If you love teen comedies from the &#8217;90s, you&#8217;ll love this. It&#8217;s hardcore referential. Watch the trailer below.</p>

<p>Over 40 years ago, Burt Reynolds posed for the now-famous centerfold in <em>Cosmopolitan</em>&#8216;s April issue. His iconic photograph is partly responsible for the launch of <em>Playgirl</em> and other countless evolutions in nude celebrity photography. But another gift that photo gave us was mimics. Check out six guys who recreated Reynold&#8217;s pose on on a bearskin rug.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Former Mass. Senator Scott Brown</strong></p>

For someone that claims to have a <i>strong</i> &#8220;relationship with Jesus Christ,&#8221; she can&#8217;t seem to catch a break.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/washington-florist-refusing-service-to-gays-faces-lawsuit-from-attorney-general-20130410/">We previously reported</a> that Stutzman was being served with a lawsuit from state attorney general Bob Ferguson after discriminating against gay customers, and even had the chance to reconsider her position before legal action was taken. Without flinching, Stutzman continues to claim Jesus would be completely devastated if her &#8220;artwork&#8221; were on display at the most fabulous gay wedding in town, something she &#8220;doesn&#8217;t agree with.&#8221;</p>
<p>And what incredible &#8220;artwork&#8221; it is! Just look at the rows and rows of beautifully crafted, exotic and colorful arrangements (pictured above) that she chose to feature in an interview syndicated around the country. This woman <i>clearly</i> knows how to run a business!</p>
<p>The second lawsuit is being threatened by the gay couple Stutzman refused service, Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed, who have received the help of the ACLU. Aside from her violating Washington state law, the <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/04/10/gay-couple-makes-florist-choose-between-supporting-gay-rights-or-getting-sued">ACLU claims</a> &#8220;Your refusal to sell flowers to Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Freed for their wedding has hurt them very deeply. It is a disturbing reminder of the history of discrimination and disparate treatment that they and other gay men and women have experienced over the years.&#8221;</p>
<p>To avoid the lawsuit, Stutzman has been asked to &#8221;vow to never again discriminate in her services for gay people, write an apology letter to be published in the Tri-City Herald, and contribute $5,000 to a local LGBT youth center.&#8221;</p>
<p>After talking it over with Jesus Christ, Stutzman still isn&#8217;t budging. Perhaps she could land a job gardening around the gates of heaven when she ends up losing her flower shop?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-11-at-5.27.58-PM.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-257897" alt="Screen shot 2013-04-11 at 5.27.58 PM" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Screen-shot-2013-04-11-at-5.27.58-PM.png" width="278" height="231" /></a>After outing legendary comic book superheroes <a href="http://www.queerty.com/great-ceasars-ghost-wolverines-gay-and-batwomans-marrying-her-girlfriend-20130223/">Batwoman</a> and <a href="http://www.queerty.com/dcs-green-latern-is-officially-queer-and-here-and-weve-got-a-sneak-peek-20120601/">Green Lantern</a> last year, DC Comics is making an effort to represent a more diverse LGBT community by introducing the first bisexual <i>and</i> openly transgender character in a mainstream superhero comic.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batgirl-2011/batgirl-19"><em>Batgirl #19</em></a>, an emotional exchange between Alysia Yeoh and Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl) prompts Alysia to reveal she is a transwoman.</p>
<p>For <i>Batgirl </i>writer Gail Simone, a more diverse LGBT comic book cast is the biggest issue in her industry today—in fact, she considers it &#8220;<i>the</i> issue for superhero comics.&#8221; In <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/04/transgender-dc-comics-batgirl/?pid=9875">an interview with Wired</a>, Simone claims the addition of Alysia&#8217;s new plotline was a no-brainer, and overdue for the loyal comic book fans waiting for more relatable characters. &#8220;It just hit me,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Why in the world can we not do a better job of representation of not just humanity, but also our own loyal audience?&#8221;</p>
<p>Girl took the words right out of our mouths. Can she try working for Fox News?</p>
<p>The introduction of a transwoman in mainstream comics may be a dramatic first for the industry (even though independent comics have featured trans characters for years), but Simone believes the comic industry may be one of the most accepting. After pitching the idea to DC Comics Co-Publisher Dan DiDio, Alysia&#8217;s new plotline was &#8220;immediately approved,&#8221; and Simone expects most superhero comic readers to be just as open-minded and quick to embrace.</p>
<p>Simone isn&#8217;t planning on turning Alysia into an inflated stereotype, either, realizing the power behind approaching the subject in a way that isn&#8217;t intense and hostile. She reassures Wired that Alysia is &#8220;a character, not a public service announcement…being trans is just part of her story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we wonder why real life can&#8217;t be more like a comic book?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/1365595497727e886af2868.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-257890" alt="1365595497727e886af2868" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/1365595497727e886af2868-360x241.jpg" width="360" height="241" /></a>In the midst of a <a href="http://www.queerty.com/four-gay-players-coming-out-20130405/">rumored mass outing</a> in the NFL and growing support from Magic Johnson (via his own <a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-american-decency-association-thinks-magic-johnsons-hiv-status-influenced-gay-son-20130408/">fabulously dapper gay son</a>), NFL star Kerry Rhodes is one of the first to be pegged as a homosexual after giving his assistant some hands-on lovin&#8217; while on vacation this week.</p>
<p>The photos, <a href="http://cdn.mediatakeout.com/62222/mto-super-duper-world-exclusive-top-nfl-superstar-is-photo-d-on-vacation-with-one-of-his-male-friends-this-ish-here-is-looking-suspect.html">posted by Media Takeout</a>, show Rhodes pulling the old arm-around-your-shoulders-in-the-movie-theater trick and carrying his presumed lover to the pool. He&#8217;s shirtless, and his man is <i>beaming</i> with the glow of 1,000 suns (a natural reaction for anyone being carried by a beautiful, jacked, shirtless football player).</p>
<p>Rhodes spoke <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/04/11/kerry-rhodes-nfl-star-not-gay-media-takeout-photos/">exclusively with TMZ</a> shortly after the photos leaked. &#8220;Photos have been circulating of my former assistant and I that have caused some rumors regarding my sexuality, and I want to address the situation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am not gay.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>Bummer!</i></p>
<p>According to Rhodes, the shots were taken &#8220;in a casual environment&#8221; in good fun. He&#8217;s managing to be a good sport about the situation, using it as an opportunity to show support for fellow athletes struggling to come out: &#8220;I know a lot of people are recently talking about athletes struggling to come out to their fans right now, and I support them, as well as wish those individuals comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aww! With an attitude like that, how could you <em>not</em> want to jump into his arms?</p>

<p>Pretty much the entire political leadership of the state is <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/04/11/delaware_the_next_blue_state_to_move_on_marriage_equality.html">lined up in support of the legislation</a>, and with Democrats controlling both houses of the legislature and the governorship, prospects look bright.</p>
<p>Civil unions only became legal in the state last year, but with the momentum on the side of marriage equality, Delaware looks well positioned to become the tenth state to approve same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>It probably hasn&#8217;t hurt that Vice President Joe Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for 36 years, was one of the first high-profile national figures to come out for marriage equality.</p>
<p>Joe knows his state, and if can <a href="http://www.queerty.com/obama-says-biden-pushed-him-into-gay-marriage-speech-biden-says-sorry-20120511/">push his boss into supporting marriage equality</a>, he can probably help out back at home too. He&#8217;s also got inside help: his son Beau is the state attorney general and one of the key supporters of the new legislation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/montana_capitol.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-257872" alt="Helena Capitol building" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/montana_capitol-360x293.jpg" width="288" height="234" /></a>Great news this morning for anyone that thought Montana had a chance at getting away with enforcing an outdated sodomy law in 2013. After <a href="http://www.queerty.com/38-montana-state-representatives-lobby-to-make-homosexuality-a-felony-20130409/">an emotionally taxing debate</a> earlier this week, the Montana House has voted 64-34 in favor of repealing the law, which currently makes sodomy a felony.</p>
<p>The bill is now cruising into Montana Gov. Steve Bullock&#8217;s office, where it&#8217;s expected to be swiftly signed into law. Though Montana&#8217;s Supreme Court held the law unconstitutional in 1997, Gov. Bullock&#8217;s signature has the power to strike it from the books altogether.</p>
<p>The great news came from Montana&#8217;s only out gay lawmaker, Rep. Bryce Bennett, who tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/brycebennett/status/322073769315270656">this convenient photo</a> that clearly shows which 34 Representatives are still in favor of the sodomy ban. It&#8217;s quite hypocritical, given the fact that under their precious law, the giant sticks up their asses would make them all felons.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s exciting that we got to this point,&#8221; Rep. Bennett <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/montana-might-finally-repeal-its-sodomy-law-this-week">told Buzzfeed</a> on Tuesday, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got a number of steps to take forward before we can tackle other issues to make sure everyone in our state is truly equal.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re not just baby steps! Since Tuesday, it appears that four representatives had a change of heart. For a state enforcing an ancient law, that&#8217;s pretty progressive!</p>
