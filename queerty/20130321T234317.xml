<p>Kate Bornstein, the famed transgender playwright, author and activist was diagnosed with lung cancer in September 2011. Despite undergoing surgery, she learned in February that the cancer had returned. Doctors are confident that it is curable but her treatments and recovery are complicated by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which Bornstein has had for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The prognosis is good, but she still faces several intensive treatments of radiation and chemotherapy, not to <a href=" "><img class="alignright" title="fund me" alt="fund me" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-7.32.45-PM.png" width="298" height="241" /></a>mention a mounting pile of bills.</p>
<p>Supporters aren&#8217;t just wishing her well—Ally Laura Vogel has launched a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/2cxb6w" target="_blank">Go Fund Me campaign</a> to raise money for medical bills and living expenses, and you can <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/2cxb6w" target="_blank">donate</a> anything from $5 to $10,000.</p>
<p>Unlike Kickstarter, there&#8217;s no end date to this campaign—the goal is $100,000 and so far more than $9,000 has been raised.</p>
<p>To learn more, check out the <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/2cxb6w" target="_blank">campaign page</a>. And order a copy of Bornstein&#8217;s new memoir, <a href="http://katebornstein.typepad.com/"><em>A Queer and Present Danger</em></a>. It&#8217;s a great read!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/21/support-for-gay-marriage-is-soaring-heres-why/" target="_blank"><i>The Washington Post</i></a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most commonly cited reason for the change of heart — offered by one in three respondents — is that they know someone who is gay.  Interestingly, that’s the reason Ohio Sen. Rob Portman gave for <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gop-senator-with-gay-son-embraces-marriage-equality-good-news-or-too-little-too-late-20130315/" target="_blank">his decision</a> to come out in support of gay marriage recently; Portman’s son, Will, told his parents two years ago that he is gay.</p>
<p>Other regularly-mentioned reasons for changing opinions on gay marriage include “grown more open/thought about it more” (25 percent), “it’s inevitable” (18 percent) and “everyone is free to choose” (18 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the study, a poll conducted in 2003 found that 58% of Americans opposed legalizing gay marriage, compared to 33% in favor. 10 years later, a survey by Pew found the scales significantly tipped, with 49% in favor and 44% opposed.</p>
<p>Another reason for the change is strong support among Millennials &#8212; people of voting age born after 1980 &#8212; who now make up a larger percentage of the adult population (27%). Their views have also evolved over the past ten years, with 51% in favor of gay marriage in 2003 and 70% in favor today.</p>
<p>Democratic media consultant Doc Sweitzer cites another reason all together for the shift in attitudes towards same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Television,” Sweitzer wrote in an email to <i>The Post</i>. “It’s the greatest socializing tool of all time. Archie Bunker changed attitudes about race and the generational divide. Gays are portrayed in all kinds of shows in a positive light, from <em>Law and Order</em> to <em>CSI</em>. They are shown as people who just want to live their lives.”</p>
<p>So thanks for tuning in, America.</p>

<p>Out Republican Fred Karger&#8217;s group, <a href="http://www.rightsequalrights.com/" target="_blank">Rights Equal Rights</a>, took out an ad on the <em>Washington Post</em> website reminding us that if not for the Court tossing anti-miscegenation laws in <em>Loving v. Virginia</em>, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may not have been able to marry his wife, Virginia.</p>
<p>(Not that we&#8217;re big fans of Mrs. Thomas, who founded a right-wing think tank, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Central">Liberty Central</a>, that&#8217;s in bed with the Family Research Council.)</p>
<p>“We are now on the cusp of full equality for all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans,” said Karger, onetime Republican candidate for the presidency. &#8220;The parallels to the 1967 case <em>Loving v. Virginia,</em> that allowed interracial marriage in this country, are so striking, that we paid for this ad. We hope that the nine Justices of the Supreme Court will take this into consideration as they hear oral arguments next week and decide the “Case of the Century.”</p>
<p>The ad will run in the Washington Post for the next five days.</p>

<p>The Tex-Mex franchise got some serious flack after it was announced that Chipotle <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56004883-78/scout-rama-scouts-council.html.csp" target="_blank">would supply food</a> for the Utah Scout-O-Rama, which seemed in direct violation of its own non-discrimination policy.</p>
<p>That <a href="http://www.chipotle.com/en-us/talk_to_us/fundraiser_donation/fundraiser_donation.aspx" target="_blank">policy</a> explicitly states that &#8220;Chipotle will not support organizations that discriminate against a person or a group on the basis of age, political affiliation, race, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, sexual orientation or religious belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chain initially stood behind its decision to sponsor the event, while <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/03/19/1739481/chipotle-violates-non-discrimination-policy-boy-scouts/" target="_blank">acknowledging</a> that it was &#8220;not consistent with our own values.&#8221; Then on Tuesday Chipotle did an about-face, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/03/19/1742331/chipotle-cancels-sponsorship-of-utah-boy-scout-event/" target="_blank">telling ThinkProgress</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believed that terminating the sponsorship and remaining consistent with our policy was the right thing to do, and we have reinforced our policy with the team that makes these decisions to try to prevent similar issues in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chipotle is just the latest casualty for the Scouts after Train and Carly Rae Jepsen <a href="http://www.queerty.com/carly-rae-jepsen-joins-train-in-boycotting-boy-scout-jamboree-20130305/" target="_blank">both backed out</a> of performing at an event this summer. The BSA is currently in the process of reviewing a possible repeal of its gay ban, but until then, at least there&#8217;s Chick-fil-A.</p>

<strong>PHOTOS: </strong>You can&#8217;t accuse Madame Tussauds of doing things half-assed oriented—even though the statue of <em>Twilight </em>hunk Taylor Lautner <a href="http://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00058807.html">now at the wax museum&#8217;s Berlin outpost</a> is wearing a shirt, the sculpture still has his chiseled (and hairless) six pack.</p>
<p>Would you still hit it?</p>

<p>- Despite what <strong>Vivienne Westwood</strong> <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/chronstyle/2013/03/11/oh-no-she-didnt-vivienne-westwood-on-michelle-obama/" target="_blank">might say</a>, <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> is the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/the-brits-make-michelle-obama-a-queen" target="_blank">best dressed woman in the world</a> according to <em>The Sunday Times Style</em> magazine. The FLOTUS even received a faux commemorative stamp to mark the occasion. <a href="http://www.queerty.com/new-music-get-your-first-taste-of-beyonces-bow-down-i-been-on-20130318/" target="_blank">Bow down, Viv</a>.</p>
<p>- Here are those <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/perez-hilton-did-a-shirtless-photo-shoot-with-his-new-baby-t" target="_blank">shirtless <strong>Perez Hilton</strong> photos</a> with <a href="http://www.queerty.com/photo-perez-hilton-is-a-daddy-20130227/" target="_blank">his son</a>, <del>the anti-Christ</del> Perez Jr., that no one asked for.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/pop-brownies-michelle-obama-queen-ryan-gosling-taking-break-from-acting-20130321/miley-twerk/" rel="attachment wp-att-253920"><img class="alignright  wp-image-253920" style="margin: 10px;" alt="miley-twerk" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/miley-twerk.gif" width="162" height="190" /></a>- Here are the GIFs of <strong>Miley Cyrus </strong>going to twerk and <a href="http://peaceloveandrocknrolll.tumblr.com/post/45881277326" target="_blank">doing the wop</a> in a onesie that you didn&#8217;t <em>know</em> you asked for, but will appreciate anyway.</p>
<p>- <strong>Christina Aguilera</strong> debuted a &#8220;<a href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/christina-aguilera-debuts-major-weight-loss-fresh-faced-makeover-at-voice-event-2013213" target="_blank">major weight loss</a>&#8221; last night &#8212; most of which was in make-up and hair extensions.</p>
<p>- <em>The New Normal</em> hit an <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/03/20/tv-ratings-tuesday-splash-premiere-strong-ncis-new-girl-smash-down-golden-boy-up/174026/" target="_blank">all-time ratings low</a> with a 22% drop from earlier this month. But the celebrity diving show <em>Splash </em>is doing fine in case you were wondering &#8212; which you shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>- In a story that&#8217;s oddly familiar, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> will <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/media/tonight-show-expected-to-return-to-new-york-with-fallon.html" target="_blank">inherit <em>The Tonight Show</em></a> from <strong>Jay Leno</strong>&#8216;s cold, dead chin.</p>
<p>- <strong>Rush Limbaugh</strong> <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/399922/rush-limbaugh-slams-beyonc-eacute-for-quot-bow-down-quot-song-says-she-pulled-a-quot-180-quot" target="_blank">really misses</a> Destiny&#8217;s Child-era <strong>Beyoncé</strong>.</p>
<p>- In what should not come as a surprise to anyone who&#8217;s ever smelled Axe Body Spray, it&#8217;s <a href="http://gawker.com/5991575/axe-body-spray-has-same-effect-as-nerve-gas" target="_blank">kind of poisonous</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong> has decided to punish the world for its sins by <a href="http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/20/ryan-gosling-pressing-pause-his-acting-career" target="_blank">taking a break from acting</a> to focus more of his time on being a better Ryan Gosling. So: double-edged sword.</p>
<p>- <strong>James Franco</strong> really doesn&#8217;t like it when you ruin it with a bunch of talking:</p>

<p>A bully at a school in Illinois scrawled the word &#8220;fag&#8221; on the neck of a seventh-grader in permanent marker, forcing him to spend all day tattooed with the slur.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was resting his head on his desk and a boy wrote it on his neck,&#8221; the boy&#8217;s mother <a href="http://fox2now.com/2013/03/20/bully-writes-homosexual-slur-on-7th-graders-neck/" target="_self">told KTVI News</a>. (We&#8217;ve chosen not to include the victim&#8217;s name.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it when he got home and called the school after taking a picture of it. He did not know it was there, but all the kids were laughing at him. It was written in permanent marker.&#8221;</p>
<p>How could his classmates have noticed it but teachers and administrators didn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>The boy was also the victim of an assault in the bathroom, when students kicked in the stall door and kicked the boy in the back. &#8220;&#8221;Urine got all over him,&#8221; says his mother. “It has really changed him into someone who tries to get out of going to school. It is heartbreaking for me.”</p>
<p>School officials at Mason Clark Middle School in East St. Louis, IL, say the incidents were investigated &#8220;and the students responsible were immediately disciplined according to district guidelines.” They also promise the victim will be monitored to prevent further acts of harassment.</p>
<p>We know it&#8217;s wrong, but we&#8217;d love to see some Old Testament justice meted out to the brats responsible: How small would you have to write to get &#8220;I am a worthless piece of crap who will peak in high school and go one to live a live of quiet desperation&#8221; on the back of someone&#8217;s neck?</p>

<p>Paris was speaking about the dangers of chicken injected with hormones on Caracol TV when she made the claim: &#8220;The boys that are eating [that kind of] chicken—because they are injected with female hormones—are starting to turn into homosexuals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, Natalia, that&#8217;s not what we mean when we talk about &#8220;chicken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paris also said the genetically modified poultry was causing girls as young as 7 to go through puberty.</p>
<p>Andrés Fernando Moncada, the head of the National Federation for Colombian Poultry Farmers, called her statement an urban myth. &#8220;When you hear this kind of a statement from a public figure like Natalia Paris, we must express our total outrage.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2013/03/report-that-gay-somalian-teen-stoned-to-death-in-doubt-due-to-fraudulent-photos/" target="_blank">LGBTQNation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A]ll of the photographs purported to be of the stoning, were copied from unrelated incidents dating as far back as 2008, and were taken from stories previously reported by Associated Press, Reuters and Al Jazerra.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is possible that the violent incident did occur as Somalia is one of 78 countries in which homosexuality is illegal. However, according to a <a href="http://paei.state.gov/documents/organization/160144.pdf" target="_blank">2010 Human Rights Report</a> from the U.S. State Department, &#8220;there were no reports of societal violence or discrimination based on sexual orientation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/somali.gay.community.worldwide" target="_blank">Somali Gay Community</a> &#8212; the LGBT group that originally reported the teen&#8217;s death &#8212; has not removed the story or the unrelated photos. <a href="http://identitykenya.com/index.php/homepage/featured/1487-gay-man-allegedly-stoned-to-death-in-somalia" target="_blank">Identity Kenya</a>, which acknowledged that they were unable to verify the story, has since removed the photos.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-253722" alt="Glenbeigh Hospital" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-3.41.00-PM1.png" width="270" height="200" />The Justice Department has <a href="http://www.ada.gov/usao-agreements.htm ">settled with an Ohio rehab clinic </a>that allegedly violated federal law by denying admission to an HIV-positive patient.</p>
<p>Last week, Glenbeigh Hospital in Rock Creek, Ohio, was determined to be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) when it refused to enter an unnamed man into its alcohol-treatment program because of the side effects of his HIV medication.</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Justice Department, &#8220;Glenbeigh cannot show that treating the complainant would have posed a direct threat to the health or safety of others.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ensuring access to medical care for people with HIV requires that those in the medical field make medical decisions that are not based on fears or stereotypes,” said Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez, who is now under consideration for Labor Secretary.   “The ADA does not tolerate HIV discrimination and neither will the Justice Department.”Under the terms of the settlement, Glenbeigh will pay $32,500 to the patient, in addition to $5,000 in fines. The hospital is also required to train its staff on being ADA-compliant and implement a new non-discrimination policy.</p>
<p>In the past two months, the Justice Department has announced similar agreements with three other medical facilities accused of HIV discrimination. The are part of the Barrier-Free Health Care Initiative, a partnership between of Justice Department&#8217;s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney’s offices nationwide.</p>

<p>Beyoncé was just hanging out in the Bahamas when photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin caught her completely off guard in H&amp;M&#8217;s new summer collection.</p>
<p>Introducing &#8220;Beyoncé as Mrs. Carter in H&amp;M.”</p>
<p>The Queen <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/azafar/why-are-people-calling-beyonce-king-b" target="_blank">cum King</a> Bey will appear in television and print ads featuring pieces from the collection in support of her sold-out &#8220;Mrs. Carter&#8221; world tour, kicking off April 15.</p>
<p>“I’ve always liked H&amp;M’s focus on fun and affordable fashion,&#8221; our lord and savior said. &#8220;I really loved the concept we collaborated on to explore the different emotions of women represented by the four elements – fire, water, earth and wind. It was a beautiful shoot on a tropical island. It felt more like making a video than a commercial.”</p>
<p>That stands to reason as the commercial was directed by veteran music video director, Jonas Åkerlund and also features a new song from Bey, “Standing On The Sun.” The song will be available worldwide online and on <a href="http://hm.com" target="_blank">hm.com</a> at the beginning of May, around the same time the collection hits the stores.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/110-members-of-congress-obama-enda-20130321/house-reps/" rel="attachment wp-att-253874"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253874" style="margin: 10px;" alt="house-reps" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/house-reps-360x239.jpg" width="360" height="239" /></a>President Obama received a letter on Wednesday from 110 members of Congress calling on him to sidestep those jackoffs in Congress (present company excluded) and sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act into law by executive order.</p>
<p>Recognizing that the Republican-led House of Representatives will never get its act together, the House Democrats, led by Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.), decided to take the matter to the White House&#8217;s front door. Or at least, its mailbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable that it remains legal to fire or refuse to hire someone based on his or her sexual orientation or gender identity,&#8221; the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/131482259/House-Letter-to-Obama-on-Executive-Order-for-LGBT-Contractor-Employees" target="_blank">letter reads</a>. &#8220;Federal law continues to allow this and discrimination based on sexual orientation is legal in 29 states and discrimination because of gender identity is legal in 34 states. Action at the federal level can put a stop to these unfair and discriminatory workplace practices in every state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/37-senators-urge-obama-for-executive-order-on-gay-rights-in-the-workplace-20130215/" target="_blank">37 Senators</a> and 54 LGBT advocacy groups wrote similar letters calling on Obama to sign the executive order.</p>
<p>While Obama publicly supports ENDA, and his administration has <a href="http://www.queerty.com/obama-may-bypass-congress-with-executive-order-protecting-lgbt-workers-20130212/" target="_blank">hinted in the past</a> that it might issue an executive order, the president would like for the bill to go through Congress. A White House spokesman reaffirmed the president&#8217;s stance, stating that &#8220;his administration will continue to work to build support for it.”</p>
<p>Polis, along with the five other openly LGBT members of the House <a href="http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/03/20/110-house-lawmakers-latest-to-call-for-enda-executive-order/" target="_blank">signed the letter</a>: David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). Noticeably absent from the list of signees, however, was a single House Republican, as well as several prominent House Democrats, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2013/03/110-members-of-congress-urge-obama-to-sign-federal.html" target="_blank">According to a spokesman</a>, Pelosi does not sign group letters as custom&#8230;right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253726" alt="heart_transplant" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/heart_transplant-360x300.jpg" width="334" height="278" />A Senate committee <a href="lezgetreal.com/2013/03/hiv-to-hiv-organ-transplant-bill-gets-through-first-committee/">has approved a bill</a> that would allow HIV-positive patients to receive organ transplants from others who carry the virus.</p>
<p>The HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act—which got the green light from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee—was a bipartisan effort that saw Democratic Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) co-sponsoring with Republicans Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Rand Paul (R-KY).</p>
<p>“I am proud to have worked across party lines on this important issue,&#8221; said Baldwin in a statement. &#8220;The HOPE Act is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that reflects the progress we are making in medicine, as well as in breaking down the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. By allowing us to move forward with this critical research, the HOPE Act will help decrease the organ wait-time, save countless lives and reduce health care costs in the long-run.”</p>
<p>Backed by the AMA and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the HOPE Act would lift the ban on medical research on HIV-positive organs and allow Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebilius to eventually change policy to approve organ-donation between HIV-positive people who were otherwise a match.</p>
<p>“We have learned much about HIV/AIDS and the HOPE Act ensures that medical science – not outdated stereotypes – is driving critical policy related to organ transplant,&#8221; said Dr. John Fangman, medical director at the AIDS Resource Center of Wisconsin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-248686" alt="gay-america-map" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/02/gay-america-map-360x234.jpg" width="322" height="209" />We&#8217;d love to believe the United States is the great American melting pot, where everyone shares common core values and sets aside cultural and religious traditions when it comes to dealing with their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to believe that—but since we&#8217;re not high on airplane glue, we know it&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p>So where can LGBT people and their allies live where they know their opinions on marriage equality, adoption, sodomy laws, workplace discrimination and other key issues are shared by a majority of the populace—or at least by the law?</p>
<p>In the run-up to next week&#8217;s big SCOTUS cases, CNN Digital has created a<a href=" http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/03/opinion/lgbt-rights/">n LGBT rights calculator</a> that will tell you which of the 50 states (plus Washington, DC) you&#8217;d feel most at home in. Users respond to 10 questions on a variety of subjects and indicate how important the issue is on a slider that goes from &#8220;not important&#8221; all the way up to &#8220;very important.&#8221;  (Of course, haters can also find which regions have the most repressive laws.)</p>
<p>Is such a calculator a good idea, or does it encourage people to avoid being pioneers in uncharted territory?<br />

I’m definitely mellower now than I used to be—And I absolutely know that Aaron’s had that effect on me. He’s made me much more emotionally rigid, calmer.</p>
<p>A straight or a gay person is going to be lying to you if, after ten years of marriage, they say it’s all about having sex, alright?&#8230; It is an incredible joy to have someone in your life whom you love and who’s there next to you when you wake up in the morning and you go to bed at night. We always just hold hands before we go to sleep. I love him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of spring, which means underwear-party season is almost upon us. Whether you love to flaunt your body in front of a roomful of guys, or are nervous about just revealing yourself to that lucky fella in your boudoir, every man has the right to feel sexy in his underwear.</p>
<p>Maybe we can&#8217;t <em>all</em> look like David Beckham in our skivvies, but we can all feel like we&#8217;re working what we&#8217;ve got while still keeping all our bits and pieces in the right place. Our pals over at <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/">The Underwear Expert</a> have given us the lowdown on what underwear styles best suit different builds.</p>

<p><strong>Tall &amp; Slender: </strong><em>Low-rise trunks</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a long torso and legs for days—good for you! Show them both off with a pair that sits low and rides high like the <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/2013/03/hugo-boss-innovation-1-micro-modal-trunk-update/">Hugo Boss Innovation 1 Micro Modal Trunk</a> ($34). They&#8217;re just the right amount of fabric to provide support and comfort while still showing off your stems.</p>

<p><strong>Short &amp; Stocky:</strong> <em>Fitted boxer shorts</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re packing a little extra, you might prefer the ease and comfort of a nice tailored pair of boxer shorts. The <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/underwear-brands/cin2/">C-IN 2</a> Hand Me Down Runner Shorts ($26) have a vintage &#8217;80s style, but the jersey material makes them feel trés modern. Fitted yet comfortable, they&#8217;re anything but dumpy.</p>

<p><strong>Apple Bottom: </strong><em>Full coverage boxer briefs</em></p>
<p>You travel with a full trunk and a little extra <em>ba-donk-a-donk</em> in each step. Sir Mix-A-Lot wrote a song about you. You might opt for a fuller boxer brief like this one from <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/2013/03/baskits-just-b-pops-with-color/">Baskit&#8217;s Just /b/</a> collection ($23) to avoid other styles that may ride up.</p>

<p><strong>Average Jock</strong>: <em>Classic briefs</em></p>
<p>While nobody would call you a meathead, you definitely work out—and it shows. You&#8217;ve got the goods to rock a bold brief like this pair from <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/2013/03/aussiebum-spartacus-briefs-trunks/">Aussiebum&#8217;s Spartacus line</a> ($23.71).

<p><strong>Mega Jock</strong>: <em>Jockstrap</em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, you have the body of an Adonis. Maybe you live at the gym, work at a construction site, or are just genetically blessed. (Curse you!) One of the many reasons jockstraps like this one from <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/2012/11/jack-adams-varsity-mesh-jockstrap/">Jack Adams&#8217; Varsity Mesh collection</a> ($21) are perfect for you is the flexibility of the waistband and straps. Whatever you&#8217;ve got, they can take it.</p>

<p><strong>Twink: </strong><em>Low-rider trunks</em></p>
<p>You&#8217;re young, short, slender and, every once in a while, you like to dance on the bar. You&#8217;re a twink—and you embrace it. Tell the world with a pair of low-rise trunks from <a href="http://www.underwearexpert.com/2013/02/2wink-australia-sexyboy-trunks/">2wink Australia&#8217;s Sexyboy</a> line ($24.95 AUD).

<p>&#8220;I’ve been doing this for about six months now, trying to catch interesting things on the subway,&#8221; posted D&#8217;Angelo. &#8220;But I haven’t had any luck so far because I ride boring trains. Today was good, though.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Guy #1: “My wife wants me to get fixed like a dog but I don’t see why she can’t just keep taking the pill.”<br />
</strong>Guy #2:  No more kids for you two?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  No, she figures we’re both getting too old for a baby.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  How is your boy anyway?  Haven’t seen him in awhile.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Oh John’s good, pitching this year varsity.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  He’ll definitely have the girls hanging around him now.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Yeah if he had any time for them.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Focused on baseball?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Focused on boys.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  You’re shittin&#8217; me!<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  I kid you not.  Came out to me and Mary Ann bold as daylight last year.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Well I’ll be damned!  I’m not supposed to know it but I overheard Patrick Jr. tell his sister he might be gay not two months ago.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  We all saw that coming though.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  You’re the second person to say that. How’d everybody see it but me?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  It was just a feeling, Pat.  He was always a little soft, ya know?</strong><br />
Guy #2:  I guess you’re right. But damn Charlie, we both have gay kids. What do we do now?  Both our sons are gay.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  We don’t do anything.  We let em be gay and if some kid calls &#8216;em a faggot we go to their house and raise hell with the parents like normal.</strong><br />
Guy #2:  Well I guess John and Lucinda won’t be getting together like we thought awhile ago.<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  Guess not.</strong><br />
**long pause**<br />
Guy #2:  Hey Charlie, you thinkin&#8217; what I’m thinkin&#8217;?<br />
<strong>Guy #1:  I was for about half-a-second then it got weird and I started thinkin&#8217; about somethin&#8217; else instead.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The future is here, folks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/10/elephant.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-227114" alt="" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/10/elephant.jpg" width="231" height="177" /></a>The <a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-gop-announces-then-renounces-inclusive-platform-20130319/">report that the  Republican party</a> issued this week dissecting its dismal performance in 2012 <a href="http://www.politico.com/tag/rnc">has garnered</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/politics/republicans-plan-overhaul-for-2016-primary-season.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=0">a lot of press</a>. The general drift has been that the party knows it has to get more inclusive or else face an endless string of losses at the national level.</p>
<p>The report was widely seen as a much needed reality check and<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/social-conservatives-figure-out-theyre-screwed.html"> a direct challenge to the social conservative wing</a> of the party. It even prompted  speculation that shifting its opposition to gay marriage was an easy and low-risk move for Republicans to make to signal their new openness.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>First of all, let&#8217;s not over interpret what the report said about gay issues. In fact, it was a fairly brief part of the report, and it focused largely on opposition to gay rights as a barrier to recruiting younger voters. &#8220;For the GOP to appeal to younger voters, we do not have to agree on every issue, but we do need to make sure young people do not see the Party as totally intolerant of alternative points of view,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Already, there is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays — and for many younger voters, these issues are a gateway into whether the Party is a place they want to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides the revealing use of &#8220;gateway,&#8221; which is generally used to describe drugs and not tolerance, what&#8217;s interesting about the passage is that it doesn&#8217;t actually say the party has to change policies. In fact, it explicitly leaves room for disagreement between younger voters and the party. It&#8217;s just that the party has to <em>appear</em> more tolerant. Just to be clear, Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus quickly clarified that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/reince-priebus-gay-marriage_n_2915998.html">party supports traditional marriage</a>.</p>
<p>And that is the problem with the report. It doesn&#8217;t actually offer any new policies or ideas that might actual revitalize the party. In fact, most of the report is<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/compassionate-conservatism-is-back"> a paean to George W. Bush</a>, who remains one of the most unpopular presidents ever. Emulating W is not the way to win the White House.</p>
<p>In fact, the report is the establishment&#8217;s revenge on the wingnuts who control the base. (Why else limit the number of presidential candidate debates and front-load primaries?) But the problem is that the establishment hasn&#8217;t been able to control the wingnuts and <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/289165-gay-marriage-fraught-with-danger-for-2016-gop-field-">is dependent on them for turnout in primaries</a>. Yes, the fringe may have to go, but it&#8217;s going to be a long, bloody fight. Unlike liberals who are unhappy with the Democrats&#8217; self-conscious march to the center, the ultraconservatives are motivated by Biblical belief in the righteousness of their cause. In their black-and-white universe, there is very little room for compromise or just settling for the best you can get. It takes a politician of Ronald Reagan&#8217;s skill to navigate those shoals.</p>
<p>The Republican establishment wants to fast forward to 2016, when it will be a transformed party. But in the interim (and perhaps longer), it faces tremendous internal turmoil. Marriage equality may well be the marker for how the party changes or&#8211;perhaps more likely&#8211;doesn&#8217;t change.</p>

<p>Finally, on Sunday, <em>The Real: San Francisco</em> will re-air. Season three was famous for introducing audiences to gay cast member, Pedro Zamora, and his struggle with AIDS. That season aired in the early days of the epidemic and was helpful in putting a human face on the issue.</p>
<p>The show begins Sunday, March 24, at 8 a.m while the full marathon starts on Friday, March 22, at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Watch part 1 of a part 4 documentary about Pedro&#8217;s life below:</p>

<p>LGBT activist John M. Becker <a href="http://www.johnmbecker.com/2013/03/20/michelle-shocked-audio-emerge/">posted audio of Michelle Shocked&#8217;s recent outburst</a> at Yoshi&#8217;s in San Francisco, and transcribed the important bits.</p>
<p>Shocked <a href="http://www.queerty.com/michelle-shocked-distances-herself-from-anti-gay-stance-i-judge-not-20130320/#ixzz2O7XKVP2f">claims her words were misinterpreted</a> and insists &#8220;I do not, nor have I ever, said or believed that God hates homosexuals (or anyone else),&#8221; but you be the judge.</p>
<p>Shocked&#8217;s message of hate, which came during her encore, starts in at around 4:36 (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote><p>MS: So it’s not too late. You can jump into this Jesus gang anytime you want. But, um, I was in a prayer meeting yesterday, and you’ve gotta appreciate how scared, how <em>scared</em> folks on that side of the equation are. I mean, from their vantage point<strong> — and I really shouldn’t say ‘their,’ because it’s mine, too — we are nearly at the end of time.</strong></p>
<p>And from our vantage point, we’re gonna be, uh, I think maybe Chinese water torture is gonna be the means, the method — once Prop 8 gets, uh, instated, and once, um, <strong>preachers are held at gunpoint and forced to marry the homosexuals,</strong> <strong>I’m pretty sure that that will be the signal for Jesus to come on back</strong><em><strong>.</strong><br />
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>At one point, she seems to dare the audience to call her a bigot (5:40):</p>
<blockquote><p>MS: If someone would be so gracious as to please tweet out, ‘Michelle Shocked just said from stage, God hates faggots.’ Would you do it now?</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-253769" alt="michelle-shocked " src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/michelle-shocked-by-rick-diamond.jpg" width="300" height="225" />She then responds to blogger Matt Penfield, who <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/398934/singer-michelle-shocked-goes-on-anti-gay-rant-during-san-francisco-show-cancellations-follow">live-tweeted</a> the show, about the likelihood that fans were going to talk about her comments.</p>
<blockquote><p>MS: I ain’t scared. I ain’t skeered. This is not a tribunal, this is one woman’s opinion.</p>
<p>And it’s fun. It’s a lot of fun. I am so committed to loving each and every soul in this room tonight that I could not come here and ignore you. I could not come here and pretend that I was above the conversation, and I couldn’t pretend that I was beneath it either. I had to join it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, that&#8217;s the kind of stuff the crazy guy who shouts Bible verses on the N train says to us.</p>
<p>At this point the audience is confused and pissed off. It seems like Shocked might get back to singing, when a woman shouts:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope you get wise, Michelle, and realize that there’s nothing to fear. There’s nothing to fear. Everybody is deserving of your — whoever your God is — his love.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the 7:42 mark, Shocked has gotten angry (Becker says she &#8220;literally hisses&#8221; :</p>
<blockquote><p>MS: I am sick of Christians filled with hypocrisy, hiding behind the symbol of the cross.</p>
<p>Audience member: Come on, show it. Show your true self. Come on!</p>
<p>Audience member: I’m confused. Can you clarify? Say what you mean. Come on, Michelle. What are you so afraid of?</p>
<p>MS: <strong>I believe that the word of God is just what it says it is: the truth.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>By the 8:15 mark, audience members have started walking out, at which point Shocked begins praying in Spanish.</p>
<blockquote><p>MS (16:07): Oh, don’t bother to applaud, it’s not needed. [applause] I don’t think I can handle all the adulation right now.</p>
<p>Audience Member: That’s because you don’t deserve any.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Everyone should get up and leave. That was rotten! That was a horrible thing to say, if that’s what you believe…</p>
<p>Audience Member: Somebody over there thinks she means something different. Maybe you’ve been confusing.</p>
<p>MS (16:31): I’ve got a question for y’all. It’s a sincere question: how are you enjoying reality so far?</p>
<p>Audience Member: It’s not your reality…</p>
<p>MS: Sucks pretty much, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Audience Member: It’s her reality, not ours…</p>
<p>MS (interrupting): You can’t have both.</p>
<p>Audience Member (continuing): Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.</p>
<p>MS: ‘Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.’ Let’s take that note. I just got a tweet, it said ‘Don’t come to San Francisco saying that shit.’ Where do I go to say that shit?</p>
<p>Audience Member: Uh, Arkansas?</p>
<p>Audience Member: Wow, that’s so weird. You’re so weird.</p>
<p>MS: Yeah, it is weird.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Your reality is tweets?</p>
<p>MS (interrupting): This is not my choice.</p>
<p>Audience Member (continuing): Your reality is tweets. According to this show, we spent like 20 percent of the show on tweets, 80 percent was a show, and 40 percent was homophobia.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Get her out of here!</p></blockquote>
<p>And then the Yoshi’s management intervenes (17:18):</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, I’m sorry ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us tonight at Yoshi’s.</p>
<p>MS: You’re pullin’ the plug, you’re givin’ me the hook y’all.</p>
<p>Audience Members: Hell no! Go on! Sing!</p></blockquote>
<p>Shocked tried to continue performing for the remaining audience members, but Yoshi&#8217;s management started shutting the venue down around her. Passing the hat around for donations, she finally ends her swan song by saying, “God bless us, everyone.”</p>
<p>Sorry, Michelle—it&#8217;s kind of hard to misinterpret what you were saying. Shocked has become increasingly erratic and reactionary since being born again some years back. And sadly, as some commenters have suggested, it does seem like she was suffering from some kind of episode that night.</p>
<p>We can have sympathy for that, but to go to the media and defend such statements in the clear light of day? That&#8217;s simply inexcusable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The same council that initially denied gay Boy Scout, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/?s=ryan+andresen">Ryan Andresen</a>, his Eagle award has adopted new principles with the intent of being inclusive of LGBT members. This follows the results of a council-wide survey, which <a href="http://library.constantcontact.com/download/get/file/1103828672481-607/MDSC+Membership+Standards+Review+Committee+Report+Summary+FINAL+%281%29.pdf">found</a> that 65 percent of respondents wanted to change current membership policies and 81 percent LGBT members and leaders in the BSA.</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/glaad-boy-scouts-360x268.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-253758" alt="glaad-boy-scouts-360x268" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/glaad-boy-scouts-360x268.jpg" width="360" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>Now the California council is publicly calling on the national organization to adopt a similar policy. (California is the first state to do so.) The council’s new membership language, which was <a href="http://bit.ly/13bqgvQ">adopted</a> on March 16, now reads:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The results of the MDSC Membership Standards Survey and the discussions of our committee have reaffirmed the role that the Scouting Movement has had and can continue to have in shaping the lives and values of young people. However the current BSA membership policy clearly excludes an entire group based on a presumption of behavior rather than on the actions of individuals. Excluding an entire group of people based on stereotypes and prejudices is inconsistent with the Scout Oath and Scout Law. The current membership policy is of deep concern to many in the Mt. Diablo Silverado Council for its potential to undermine the future vitality of the Scouting movement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chartered Organizations have always and will continue to create Scouting Units that are consistent with their organizational faiths, standards and deeply held beliefs. However, we believe that the national BSA board should not pass this important decision from BSA’s governing body to Chartered Organizations. Rather, we believe that the national board should adopt a standard policy, consistent with the Scout Oath, Scout Law, and he principles documented within this report, which ends the isolation and exclusion of LGBT individuals.”</p>
<p>The BSA is expected to meet in May when it’ll finally make a decision on its discrimination policies. “There are just sixty five days until the May vote, and Mt. Diablo-Silverado Council has shown what’s possible when we come together in friendly, courteous conversation,” said Scouts for Equality founder <a href="http://www.queerty.com/?s=zach+wahls">Zach Wahls</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Olivia was rescued by Florida&#8217;s Kindred Spirits Sanctuary, where she is now thriving,&#8221; <a href="http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2013/03/20/peta-meatout-tribute-ricky-martin.aspx">reveals a statement</a> from the group. &#8220;She spends her days taking dust baths, roosting in trees, and relaxing in the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>PETA Executive Vice President Tracy Reiman praises Martin&#8217;s switch to a meat-free diet, a change he recently tweeted about, and says people who go vegetarian &#8220;boost their energy and cut their risk of heart disease, cancer, and obesity—and they help save animals like Olivia, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement was timed to the Great American Meatout, held every March 20 since 1985, in which participants are asked to go vegetarian for the day.</p>
<p>Oops, too late.</p>

<p>Filmmaker Jon Armendariz <a href="http://www.out.com/entertainment/popnography/2013/03/18/perfect-gay-wedding-video-plaza-hotel">spoke with <em>Out</em> magazine</a> about documenting the first same-sex wedding at the Plaza Hotel in New York. (The video for Jason and Todd&#8217;s sumptuous ceremony, above, first went viral in February.)</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wanted to highlight this family&#8217;s joy of finally making it official,&#8221; says Armendariz. &#8220;I particularly wanted to highlight the reaction of Jason&#8217;s son during the ceremony, which was particularly moving. The sight of a little boy crying tears of joy during the wedding vows is possibly the most visceral reaction I&#8217;ve seen in any wedding film.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh lord, here come the waterworks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-253130" alt="302px-MichelleShockedCrop" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/302px-MichelleShockedCrop-e1363807254477.jpg" width="227" height="331" />Michelle Shocked rocketed back into the news this week when word got out that she <a href="http://www.queerty.com/alt-folk-singer-michelle-shocked-goes-on-homophobic-rant-tells-audience-god-hates-fags-20130318/">went on an anti-gay tirade</a> during a show in San Francisco, leading a mass walkout by the audience.</p>
<p>In the wake of the incident, almost all of the venues on her upcoming tour <a href="http://www.queerty.com/alt-folk-singer-michelle-shocked-goes-on-homophobic-rant-tells-audience-god-hates-fags-20130318/">cancelled her appearances</a>.</p>
<p>Now Shocked has released an open letter that addressed the incident, in which she insists she&#8217;s not intolerant and apologizes that &#8220;I don&#8217;t always express myself as clearly as I should.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not, nor have I ever, said or believed that God hates homosexuals (or anyone else). I said that some of His followers believe that. I believe intolerance comes from fear, and these folks are genuinely scared. When I said &#8220;Twitter that Michelle Shocked says &#8220;God hates faggots,&#8221; I was predicting the absurd way my description of, my apology for, the intolerant would no doubt be misinterpreted. The show was all music, and the audience tweets said they enjoyed it. The commentary came about ten minutes later, in the encore.</p>
<p>And to those fans who are disappointed by what they&#8217;ve heard or think I said, I&#8217;m very sorry: I don&#8217;t always express myself as clearly as I should. But don&#8217;t believe everything you read on Facebook or twitter. My view of homosexuality has changed not one iota. I judge not. And my statement equating repeal of Prop 8 with the coming of the End Times was neither literal nor ironic: it was a description of how some folks &#8211; not me &#8211; feel about gay marriage.</p>
<p>The show, and the rant, was spontaneous. As for those applauding my so-called stance that &#8220;God Hates Faggots,&#8221; I say they should be met with mercy, not hate. And I hope that what remains of my audience will meet that intolerance with understanding, even of those who might hate them.</p>
<p>Folks wonder about my sexuality, but denying being gay is like saying I never beat my husband. My sexuality is not at issue. What is being questioned is my support for the LGBT community, and that has never wavered. Music and activism have always been part of my work and my journey, which I hope and intend to continue. I&#8217;d like to say this was a publicity stunt, but I&#8217;m really not that clever, and I&#8217;m definitely not that cynical.</p>
<p>But I am damn sorry. If I could repeat the evening, I would make a clearer distinction between a set of beliefs I abhor, and my human sympathy for the folks who hold them. I say this not because I want to look better. I have no wish to hide my faults, and &#8211; clearly &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t if I tried.</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Michelle</p></blockquote>
<div id="superlist_2099048_1000391">&#8220;I don&#8217;t always express myself as clearly as I should?&#8221; Aren&#8217;t you a veteran performer whose entire career is based on expressing yourself?</div>
<div>
Perhaps sensing readers might not get her point, Shocked followed-up with another statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe in a God who loves everyone, and my faith tells me to do my best to also love everyone. Everyone: gay or straight, stridently gay, self-righteously faithful; left or right, far left, far right; good, bad, or indifferent. That&#8217;s the law: everyone.</p>
<p>I may disagree with someone&#8217;s most fervently held belief, but I will not hate them. And in this controversy, that means speaking for Christians with opinions I in no way share about homosexuality. Will I endorse them? Never. Will I disavow them? Never.</p>
<p>I stand accused of forsaking the LGBT community for a Christianity which is – hear me now &#8211; anathema to my understanding of faith. I will no doubt take future flack for saying so. I&#8217;m accused of believing that &#8220;God hates fags&#8221; and that the repeal of Prop 8 will usher in the End Times.</p>
<p>Well, if I caused such an absurdity, I am damn sorry. To be clear: I am not now, nor have I ever been, a member of any so-called faith preaching intolerance of anyone. Again, anyone: straight or gay, believers or not: that&#8217;s the law.</p>
<p>That means upholding my punk rock values in the most evangelical enclaves and, in this case, speaking up for the most fearful of fundamentalists in, well, a San Francisco music hall full of Michelle Shocked fans.</p>
<p>As an artist in this time of unbearable culture wars, I understand: this means trouble, and this is neither the first nor last time trouble has come my way. And that&#8217;s fine by me.</p>
<p>I know the fear many in the evangelical community feel about homosexual marriage, as I understand the fear many in the gay community feel toward the self-appointed faithful. I have and will continue speaking to both. Everything else – Facebook, Twitter, whatever – is commentary.</p></blockquote>
<p>For a rambling press statement, this letter is actually <em>very</em> carefully worded: You&#8217;ll notice she doesn&#8217;t make any declarative statements supporting LGBT equality ordenouncing Prop 8, or say anything that would indicate she believes gay people are just as good and decent as straights.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What we get is a lot of &#8220;I&#8217;m not a hater&#8221; jargon. Well, we&#8217;ve all seen anti-gay leaders who insist they&#8217;re not intolerant or hateful because they only want what&#8217;s best for us—to be delivered from the sin of homosexuality.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We had originally considered the incident at Yoshi&#8217;s was actually a PR move on Shocked&#8217;s part—her popularity among both mainstream fans and and the dyke-rock crowd has fizzled, so why not make a Hail Mary play for the religious right? (Just ask Stephen Baldwin and Victoria Jackson for details.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>But it&#8217;s hard to reconcile this kind of watered-down statement with a ploy like that. It&#8217;s also hard to assume it was a mental-health episode, as some had speculated, since this letter was drafted several days later and vetted by her publicist.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whatever Michelle&#8217;s rationale for her comments, we just wish someone would turn her mike off.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253701" alt="kisscam" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/kisscam-360x230.jpg" width="302" height="192" />If you&#8217;ve ever been to a major sporting event, you&#8217;re familiar with <a href="http://www.queerty.com/st-louis-cardinals-keeps-kiss-cam-heterosexual-incestuous-20100920/">the Kiss-Cam</a>, a close-up of a couple encouraged to smooch for the crowd.</p>
<p>The Kiss-Cam has occasionally helped break down barriers, as some arenas zoom in on same-sex couples just as they do straight sweethearts. (It&#8217;s also been the butt of jokes, like when celebrities Jason Bateman and Dustin Hoffman sucked face <a href="http://www.queerty.com/dustin-hoffman-jason-bateman-ruin-a-perfectly-good-heterosexual-basketball-game-20100604/">when the lens was turned on them</a>.)</p>
<p>Now one fan of the NFL&#8217;s  Jacksonville Jaguars is asking management to stop making fun of the LGBT community by pointing the Kiss-Cam at rival teammates.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s not uncommon for the cam to focus in on the two members of visiting team—the joke being, presumably, &#8220;these guys are fags!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dave Uible doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s very funny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I saw it, maybe two years ago,&#8221; Uible, 47, told <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--gay-fan-asks-jacksonville-jaguars-to-end-kiss-cam--joke--210850596.html">Yahoo! News</a>. &#8220;Then I saw it this year. The thing is they have this section at Jags games for honorable kids. Some are definitely going to be gay. It gives a negative angle. I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary. It just seems out of place to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uible wrote Jags owner Shad Khan  about the situation on Monday. &#8220;I just felt that Mr. Khan was new and he would do something about it,&#8221; he explained</p>
<p>In a letter reposted on <a href="http://www.outsports.com/2013/3/19/4121952/nfl-gay-fan-jacksonville-jaguars-owner-shahid-khan-kiss-cam">Outsports.com,</a> Uible wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am gay and I have a lot of gay and lesbian friends who are proud Jaguar season ticket holders. I&#8217;m not sure you are aware, but there is a video &#8216;joke&#8217; called the Kiss Cam that plays at the games.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Often, the bit goes like this: after showing several happy heterosexual couples kissing in the stands, the camera then pans to two opposing male players who are in close proximity and leaning toward each other – insinuating that they may do the exact same (and ostensibly wrong) thing and kiss.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Hilarious, right?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>No, and the message is clear: Jaguars are heterosexual and approved. The opponent is &#8216;gay,&#8217; disapproved and the butt of a crude joke. Really, why is this even at an NFL game?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uible&#8217;s not alone in being irked by the Kiss-Cam. Last year, Oakland A&#8217;s pitcher Brandon McCarthy <a href="http://www.queerty.com/oakland-as-pitcher-thinks-making-two-straight-guys-smooch-for-kiss-cam-is-offensive-20120420/#ixzz2O6ZPRNnY">tweeted against the practice</a>: “They put two guys on the ‘Kiss Cam’ tonight. What hilarity!! (by hilarity I mean offensive homophobia). Enough with this stupid trend.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As originally reported by <a href="http://identitykenya.com/index.php/homepage/featured/1487-gay-man-allegedly-stoned-to-death-in-somalia" target="_blank"><em>Identity Kenya</em></a> (via the gay Muslim group, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/somali.gay.community.worldwide/posts/10152662184270455" target="_blank">Somali Gay Community</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Mohamed Ali Baashi, 18 years old gay boy, was buried in a hole up to his chest and then pelted with rocks by fighters from the rebel Al Qaeda link [sic] group Al Shabaab on Friday March 15 in Barawe, Somalia, about 50 miles from the capital, Mogadishu.</p>
<p>In a scene straight out of the Dark Ages, this Somali young man accused of Sodomy was stoned to death by Islamic thugs while horrified villagers were forced to watch.</p></blockquote>
<p>A rebel judge announced that Baashi, along with an accused murderer, had confessed to their crimes but the murderer received a more lenient punishment. According to the judge, &#8220;the one that kill some&#8217;one [sic] will be shot because homosexuality is more punishable in Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is their day of justice,&#8221; the judge told the hundreds of villagers who had been forced to attend.</p>
<p>Somali Gay Commnity posted <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152662267765455.1073741825.286230935454&amp;type=1" target="_blank">three photos</a> [<em>warning: violent and graphic in nature</em>] of the alleged stoning, though <em>Identity Kenya</em> could not independently verify the group&#8217;s claims nor were they successful in contacting them.</p>
<p>Somalia is one of <a href="http://76crimes.com/76-countries-where-homosexuality-is-illegal/" target="_blank">over 76 countries</a> in which homosexuality is illegal and is punishable by up to three years in prison.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href=" "><img class="alignright" title="Mugabe" alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Mugabecloseup2008.jpg/220px-Mugabecloseup2008.jpg" width="234" height="155" /></a>President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is so detested among human-rights groups that the EU slapped a travel ban on him. But Pope Francis I still invited the longtime despot <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/20/pope-francis-criticised-for-greeting-zimbabwean-president-robert-mugabe/">to his inauguration mass</a>.</p>
<p>In power since 1987, 89-year-old Mugabe has cranked up attacks on the LGBT community to deflect attention from Zimbabwe&#8217;s economic woes. A law passed in 2006 criminalized any actions even <em>perceived</em> as homosexual—leading to arrests for holding hands or hugging—and government operatives have infiltrated gay groups with reports of blackmail, assault and even rape not uncommon.</p>
<p>Mugabe, who has referred to gay people as &#8220;sub-animal&#8230;worse than dogs and pigs,” even had former President Canaan Banana arrested on 11 charges of sodomy and sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>But Italy gave him a temporary reprieve on his travel ban since Mugabe was visiting Vatican City, which has its own jurisdiction.  And, well, because the Pope asked nicely.</p>
<p>&#8220;President Mugabe belongs in the dock at the International Criminal Court, not in the Vatican being feted by the Pope,&#8221; says LGBT rights advocate Peter Tatchell, who was beaten beaten unconscious by Mugabe’s guards when he tried to put the dictator under citizen&#8217;s arrest. “His regime has abused the Christian values of love and compassion [and] stands accused of kidnapping, detention without trial, torture, rape and murder.&#8221; (Throw in child molestation and he could be a bishop.)</p>
<p>Other attendees at yesterday&#8217;s service included Vice President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Argentinian president Cristina Kirchner, who had called out the Pope&#8217;s hateful rhetoric on marriage equality when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>In an address to the masses, Francis said it was the duty of all men and women of good will &#8220;to be custodians of creation and of the design of God inscribed in nature—custodian of others and of the environment.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="Centerpiece by C.J." src="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-1.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="224" /></a>C.J.&#8217;s Brother was invited to a laser tag birthday party at the local open-air mall. It was a Friday night and I left C.J. at home with his dad to take C.J.&#8217;s Brother to the party and hang out &#8212; just the two of us.</p>
<p>We arrived early and walked around the center. It was dark and there were strands of white lights strung high above our heads as a live band played in the crisp air.  CJ&#8217;s Brother walked with his hands in his pockets because he thinks it makes him look like a teenager. Every once in a while he would hold my hand…forgetting that he was trying to look cool.</p>
<p>We were window shopping when he stopped in front of a jewelry store to look at the displays.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for some diamonds to buy for your mom?” I said teasingly, putting my hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“No, I&#8217;m looking for an engagement ring,” he said.</p>
<p>“You are way too young to get engaged, sir.”</p>
<p>“I know. I&#8217;m looking for later, to see what I might want to buy when I want to get engaged, so I can start saving. How much do I have to save anyway?  Like a couple hundred dollars?”</p>
<p><a href="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-25.jpg"><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" alt="photo 2" src="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-25.jpg?w=224" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>“A couple thousand dollars,” I said. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“I really better start saving I guess,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want you to get married. I want you to stay my baby forever,” I said hugging him from behind.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t you want grandchildren?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>He pulled out of my embrace and spun to look at me.</p>
<p>“That is so mean. How can you not want grandchildren?”</p>
<p>His feelings were hurt.  Crap.  I struggled to explain.</p>
<p>“Here&#8217;s the deal, baby. I don&#8217;t expect grandchildren. I don&#8217;t need grandchildren to make me happy. I want you to be happy. If having kids makes you happy then I&#8217;m happy. But, I really try not to project my expectations on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was going over his head a little.  After all, he is only nine years old.</p>
<p>My history was interfering with my present, as it tends to do.  My mom wanted grandchildren her entire life. If she could have had grandchildren without having children she probably would have.  I knew it.  My brother knew. It was one of the hardest things for her to deal with when he came out.  She had to mourn the loss of the grandchildren he&#8217;d never give her.</p>
<p><a href="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-32.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="Runway walk by C.J." src="http://raisingmyrainbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo-32.jpg?w=224" width="224" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve watched it happen over and over at PFLAG.  People look forward to grandchildren and when their child comes out of the closet they assume that they won&#8217;t have grandchildren and it hurts.  I can understand that.</p>
<p>So I decided long ago that I wasn&#8217;t going to look forward to grandchildren until they were nine months away from appearing. I wasn&#8217;t going to count on a future generation for even a fraction of happiness. I was going to spend my energy making the generation that I was responsible for happy. I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought that I was doing us all a favor &#8212; until it hurt my son’s feelings.</p>
<p>“If you have a child I will love it with all of my heart because it will be half you and you are one of my top three favorite people in the world,&#8221; I told C.J.’s Brother. &#8220;I think that you are amazing. I just want you to know that you don’t have to give me grandkids to make me happy. You make me happy all on your own.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said skeptically. I felt like a turd.</p>
<p>My brother and C.J. have taught me that you don&#8217;t always get what you expect when you are expecting.  And that can mess with your head and heart. So I try to let go of expectations and not to expect things or people to conform.  But, every once in a while my oldest, gender conforming boy wants me to expect the norm.</p>
<p>I walked him into the laser tag building and watched him play with his friends and, for a moment, thought about my grandkids.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-253654" alt="luka-magnotta-official11" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/luka-magnotta-official11.jpg" width="346" height="221" />Luka Rocco Magnotta, the Canadian man accused of killing, dismembering <a href="http://www.queerty.com/accused-cannibal-killer-luka-magnotta-pleads-not-guilty-to-murdering-dismembering-lover-20120620/#ixzz2O5rAcC6q">and eating his male lover</a>, fainted in court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During a pre-trial hearing in Montreal, Magnotta <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2295978/Luka-Magnotta-Canadian-cannibal-collapses-court-video-evidence-shown.html">collapsed to the floor of the courtroom</a>, after which the judge suspended the hearing for the rest of the day. “He really doesn’t feel well and he’s not able to continue,” Magnotta&#8217;s lawyer told the judge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s odd that the stress of a trial  would overwhelm someone who could handle murdering and mutilating their boyfriend, making a video of themselves playing with the corpse, and mailing out body parts to various political offices. But that&#8217;s just us.</p>
<p>Magnotta, who has appeared in several gay porn films, was arrested in Germany last June after an international manhunt. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which include first-degree murder in the death of lover Jun Lin, 33, as well as defiling a corpse, threatening the Canadian prime minister and using the mail system for delivering “obscene, indecent, immoral or scurrilous” materials.</p>
<p>He has pleaded not guilty.</p>

America&#8217;s pastime. And being America&#8217;s pastime, it too has a problem with gun control and gay issues.</p>
<p>A survey by <em>ESPN Magazine</em> of 110 anonymous Major League Baseball players revealed some rather interesting facts (via <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/bml/half-of-major-leaguers-own-guns-only-five-percent-know-a-gay" target="_blank">BuzzFeed</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>— Asked &#8220;do you know of any gay players?&#8221; only 5% (six players) said yes. &#8220;Yes, but that&#8217;s as far as I want to go, even if this is anonymous,&#8221; said one National Leaguer.</p>
<p>— 46% said they own a firearm — and these 51 players have a total of 258 guns. &#8220;Let me ask you something,&#8221; says one pitcher. &#8220;If you were rich and famous and your salary was in the newspaper every week, would you worry about your wife and kids? That&#8217;s why I have guns.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So what does this mean? Probably nothing, except that the amount of gays to guns in the MLB is disturbingly disproportionate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-253641" alt="rainbow house" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-20-at-10.47.28-AM-360x245.png" width="360" height="245" />An anti-poverty group has purchased a home across the way from the Westboro Baptist Church compound in Topeka, Kansas, and is planning on painting it the colors of the rainbow flag.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.plantingpeace.org/">Planting Peace</a>, whose mission is to &#8220;providing sustainable initiatives to impoverished areas around the world,&#8221; purchased a small house on SW Orleans Street six months ago for $80,000, and plans to turn it into a drop-in center for LGBT and anti-bullying campaigns.</p>
<p>“It hit me right away,&#8221; said Aaron Jackson, who founded Planting Peace with John Dieubon. &#8220;It would be interesting to own a house across from the Westboro Baptist Church and turn it into something.’ And then, within five seconds: ‘And I’ll paint it the color of the pride flag.’ Perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>A statement on the <a href="http://www.plantingpeace.org">Planting Peace website</a> explains more:</p>
<blockquote><p>For too long, the Westboro Baptist Church has been targeting the LGBTQ community with messages of hate and radicalism. Often, protesting American soldiers’ funerals and organizations that support equality.</p>
<p>This faction preaches extremism in our communities and directly targets our youth. To combat their messages of hate and to support equality and anti-bullying initiatives in schools and in our community, Planting Peace has established the Equality House in Topeka.</p></blockquote>
<p>Planting Peace operates solely through donations, and Jackson is hoping to raise an additional $1 million to support the center. If you want to help, you can donate <a href="http://www.plantingpeace.org/donate_online.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, Madonna needs to be a requirement in all elementary curricula.</p>
<p>You may remember Mr. Avina&#8217;s kindergarten class striking a pose and generally gagging audiences with their <a href="http://www.queerty.com/legendary-children-strike-a-pose-in-vogue-kindergarten-recital-20121221/" target="_blank">class recital to &#8220;Vogue&#8221;</a>—and if you don&#8217;t, stop whatever it is you&#8217;re doing and watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Now.</strong></p>
<p>Well, Mr. Avina and his legendary children are back with a 13-minute film, <a href="http://youtu.be/hY7uTgts3Pc" target="_blank"><em>Miss Nelson Is Missing</em></a>, which includes this rather fitting Madge-ical gem, &#8220;This Used to Be My Playground.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth watching if only for the pint-sized shade being thrown by Miss Thing with the Capri-Sun, referencing that epic moment Madonna urged everyone to look up the meaning of &#8220;<a href="http://s3.favim.com/orig/44/lady-gaga-look-it-up-madonna-reductive-Favim.com-369148.gif" target="_blank">reductive</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congratulations to Mr. Avina since his kids are clearly <em>reading</em> at a college level.</p>
