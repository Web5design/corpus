<p>- Legendary feminist <strong>Gloria Steinem</strong> is no fan of<em> The Real Housewives</em> series, though she finds <strong>Lena Dunham</strong>&#8216;s <em>Girls</em> &#8220;realistic&#8221; &#8212; even if the sex is &#8220;<a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/meganj3/gloria-steinem-blasts-real-housewives-but-likes-girls" target="_blank">silly and boring</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Before she starts 90 days in rehab, <strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong> will make the wise decision to <a href="http://www.dlisted.com/2013/03/24/lindsay-lohan-will-party-brazil-going-rehab" target="_blank">party it up in Brazil</a>. It&#8217;s nice to see that she&#8217;s taking it seriously this time.</p>
<p>- <em>American Idol</em> is continuing its rather rapid decline into irrelevance with some <a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/03/22/american-idol-how-low-will-the-ratings-go/" target="_blank">seriously low ratings</a>.</p>

C&#8217;mon, Carson, show some respect &#8212; her name&#8217;s <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong>.</p>
<p>- Here&#8217;s <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> proving he can hang with the big boys by <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/whitneyjefferson/justin-timberlake-takes-five-shots-of-tequila-in-under-10-mi" target="_blank">taking 5 shots of tequila in under 10 minutes</a>, or as we like to call it, a Tuesday:</p>

<p>Hmm, was mama buzzed from the brownies—or did she perhaps have herself a nice box of wine after seeing her son in the altogether with his cute beau?</p>
<p><strong>The followup post was even more precious:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5f9661f83641b94c4c2a19f95eab56a1/tumblr_inline_mj5zoi0Cwk1qcnum8.jpg" width="475" height="356" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My mom responded to the situation by buying me a door knob with a lock on it—best parental reaction or best parental reaction?&#8221;</p>
<p>You better do right on Mother&#8217;s Day, son.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254432" alt="jenkins smith family" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/jenkins-smith-family.jpg" width="400" height="300" />When Melissa Smith retires from the Navy in April, she should feel pride in praiseworthy career defending our nation. Instead she&#8217;ll feel sadness that the letter of recognition she wrote for her wife won&#8217;t be included in her official retirement ceremony.</p>
<p>T.J. Jenkins finally married her partner, Ship&#8217;s Serviceman Melissa Smith, two months ago in Maryland, where same-sex marriage is legal. But because of DOMA, she can&#8217;t be considered a spouse, according to Smith&#8217;s commanding officer.</p>
<p>That means that while other married servicemembers get to honor their partners &#8216; sacrifices as part of a longstanding Naval tradition, Jenkins efforts won&#8217;t be acknowledged.</p>
<p>She calls the snub &#8220;a slap in the face&#8221; and admits Smith has thought about not attending her retirement at all.</p>
<p>“My wife has served our nation for almost twenty years, and this is the way she is treated by her command?” says Jenkins (middle row, center). “I believe that Captain Geis is being a bully and using DOMA as a shield to hide behind.  He wants to use the terms &#8216;service member’s partner,&#8217; when in fact I’m not her partner, I’m her <em>wife</em>!”</p>
<p>The couple also says they&#8217;ve been told that only Smith&#8217;s two biological children will be acknowledged at the ceremony, not Jenkins&#8217; children that they&#8217;ve raised together. &#8220;They’re just going to give the certificates to two of the children and not the other four?” Jenkins explains. “You know how would that make them feel? Because they’re all sisters and brothers.”</p>
<p>Stephen Peters of the <a href="http://www.MilitaryPartners.org">American Military Partner Association</a> believes the C.O.&#8217;s directive show a real lack of leadership from both him and the entire chain of command: “Certificates of appreciation have been given out repeatedly throughout the Navy to same-sex spouses since the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,&#8221; says Peters. &#8221; It is simply outrageous that this commanding officer is now suddenly trying to use the Defense of Marriage Act as an excuse not to honor the wife of this Sailor at her retirement ceremony.”</p>
<p>Smith was named Navy Cash Sailor of the month in June 2008.</p>

<p>Magnolia Junior High School in Moss Point, Mississippi is under fire from the Southern Poverty Law Center after a former student there accused teachers and classmates of harassment.</p>
<p>Destin Holmes, 16, is now home schooled but attended Moss Point for one semester. During her time there, Destin &#8212; who identifies as a lesbian &#8212; claims she was subject to bullying not only from her fellow classmates, but from teachers and even the principal.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sunherald.com/2013/03/22/4545503/video-gay-student-discusses-being.html" target="_blank">According to Holmes</a>, she was referred to as &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;it&#8221; by staff and refused access to the girls&#8217; bathroom. During one lesson in which boys and girls were divided into teams, she was forced to be by herself.</p>
<p>“[The teacher] told me since she didn’t know what I was, I should be on a team of my own,” <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/03/23/us-mississippi-school-under-fire-for-alleged-bullying-of-lgbt-students-by-staff/" target="_blank">Holmes said</a> at an SPLC press conference. When she tried to report harassment to the principal, she says she was told, “I don’t want a dyke in this school.”</p>
<p>Holmes then wrote a letter to the SPLC, which launched an investigation of its own. The SPLC found widespread evidence of anti-LGBT bullying by staff and students, while victims were reportedly told by school officials to &#8220;suck it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPLC responded with a letter to the school demanding an end to the bullying and threatening a federal lawsuit if no action is taken.</p>
<p>”Students face enough obstacles in school without also enduring violence and abuse for simply being different,&#8221; said SPLC attorney Sam Wolfe. &#8220;They are entitled by law to attend school in an environment where they are not singled out and tormented because of their sexual orientation or gender nonconformity.”</p>
<p>Mass Point School District said in a statement on Friday that it takes &#8220;allegations concerning bullying and harassment very seriously&#8221; though it is &#8220;unable to discuss the allegations at this time due to it being an ongoing investigation.”</p>

<p>Matthew Lannon, 12, a sixth-grader at Wheeler School in Providence, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday evening at the Rhode Island State House in favor of a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>It was a family affair as the bill was sponsored by his aunt, state Sen. Donna Nesselbush, and Matthew&#8217;s two moms were there to lend their support as Matthew articulately urged the Committee to &#8220;choose love.&#8221;</p>

<p>State and local governments pass resolutions honoring all kinds of things, usually with no one paying much mind.</p>
<p>But Georgia state Rep. Matt Ramsey (R-Peachtree City) was so interested in a proposed resolution honoring an LGBT marching band that he&#8217;s apparently trying to block its passage.</p>
<p>Ramsey requested <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/republican-house-member-blocks-freedom-band-resolu/nWzR7/">a delay on voting</a> on a resolution recognizing the <a href="http://www.atlantafreedombands.com/">Atlanta Freedom Marching Bands,</a> which is celebrating its 20th anniversary and gearing up to host the Lesbian And Gay Band Association conference during Atlanta Pride.</p>
<p>His only explanation for the delay was that GOP caucus members had &#8220;some questions&#8221; about it.</p>
<p>Jeez, don&#8217;t folks in marching bands get enough crap?</p>

<p>So now that I’m here and I’ve got a microphone in my hand and about 6,000 people watching me, I need to tell them how I feel.</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance, one big issue in hip-hop is the gay thing. It’s 2013, and it’s a shame that, to this day, that topic still gets people all excited. It’s crazy. And it makes me upset that this topic even matters when it comes to hip-hop, because it makes it seem like everybody in hip-hop is small-minded or stupid — and that’s not the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve got people like Jay-Z. We’ve got people like Kanye. We’ve got people like me. We’re all prime examples of people who don’t think like that. I treat everybody equal, and so I want to be sure that my listeners and my followers do the same if they’re gonna represent me. And if I’m gonna represent them, then I also want to do it in a good way.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254426" alt="united for marriage" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/united-for-marriage.jpg" width="319" height="208" />This week gays and lesbians across America will be holding their collective breath as the Supreme Court hears arguments in to major marriage-equality cases. United for Marriage has helped sponsor 150 rallies, vigils and other events in all 50 states, and Logo TV is getting behind the group in a big way with on-air and online campaigns.</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, the network will broadcast the names of  LGBT couples—along with their home states and years of commitment, &#8220;in an effort to personalize and publicize the scope of the fight for marriage equality,&#8221; according to a statement (Couples interested in participating can register now on the <a href="http://logo.to/16M7EkT" target="_blank">Logo TV Facebook Page</a>.)</p>
<p>The Logo Instagram and twitter feeds will be featuring comments using the official <em>#UnitedForMarriage</em> tag, including quotes from <em>RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race </em>contestants and other personalities.</p>
<p>“As much as advocacy and personal experiences have made change, the media&#8217;s portrayals of real couples have also helped to bring marriage equality to the front lines,” said network president Lisa Sherman. Logo staffers will also be wearing red to work this week in support of the cause.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;know, if we didn&#8217;t blog in the nude we&#8217;d totally be wearing red, too.</p>

<p><strong>PHOTOS:</strong> Jenna Eagleton and Caroline Currie just got one hell of a wedding present: The couple won <em>Real Maine Wedding</em> magazine&#8217;s $100,000 Wedding of the Year contest.</p>
<p>The magazine announced Eagleton and Currie as winners on Sunday <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/gay-couple-wins-100k-maine-wedding-contest-18802116#.UU-JKhl5EzY">at the Maine Wedding Association Bridal Show</a> in Freeport. They&#8217;ve planned to get hitched in October in Kennebunkport—the prize money includes a reception, a wedding dress, tuxedos, rings, flowers and limo service.</p>
<p>Marriage equality passed in Maine in November—Currie and Eagleton planned to get married in 2014, but Currie&#8217;s father has been diagnosed with leukemia.</p>

<p>GLAAD is no longer the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Going forward the organization will <a href="http://www.glaad.org/blog/glaad-affirms-commitment-trans-people-lgbt-community-and-allies-melissa-harris-perry-show" target="_blank">simply be known as</a> GLAAD, the LGBT media advocacy organization.</p>
<p>The name change, announced Sunday on MSNBC&#8217;s <em>Melissa Harris-Perry</em>, reflects GLAAD&#8217;s renewed commitment to incorporate transgender people as well as allies from diverse backgrounds in GLAAD&#8217;s work to shape the media narrative and build public support for LGBT people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a natural progression that reflects the work GLAAD&#8217;s staff is already leading,&#8221; said GLAAD&#8217;s spokesperson Wilson Cruz. &#8220;We respect and honor the full name that the organization was founded with, but GLAAD&#8217;s work has expanded beyond fighting defamation to changing the culture. Our commitment to marriage equality, employment nondiscrimination, and other LGBT issues is stronger than ever, and now our name reflects our work on transgender issues as well as our work with allies.&#8221;</p>

<p>We remember when rock was young: 66 years ago today, Reginald Kenneth Dwight sashayed out of his mother&#8217;s womb in a cloud of glitter, feathers and sequins.</p>
<p>Though he&#8217;s deemed himself <a href="http://social.popsugar.com/Elton-John-believes-he-now-too-old-dress-flamboyantly-1077613" target="_blank">too old</a> to dress &#8220;as flamboyantly as I used to,&#8221; we&#8217;re glad to take that yellow-brick road down memory lane and revisit Elton John&#8217;s greatest fashion &#8220;hits&#8221; in honor of his birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Check out Queerty&#8217;s retrospective of the Rocket Man&#8217;s signature style.</strong><br />
<strong> <a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton_star/" rel="attachment wp-att-254410"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254410" alt="elton_star" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton_star-360x362.jpg" width="360" height="362" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Sir Elton took this rather subtle pantsuit and embellished it with a statement shoulder &#8212; the statement being &#8220;Saturday night&#8217;s all right for gagging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-donald-duck/" rel="attachment wp-att-254418"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254418" alt="elton-john-donald-duck" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-john-donald-duck-360x262.jpg" width="360" height="262" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s style could often be described as &#8220;eccentric,&#8221; but this Donald Duck costume was the work of a quack. Note the absence of his signature glasses, meaning he probably got dressed blind. At least, let&#8217;s hope that was the reasoning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-254416"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254416" alt="Elton-John-1" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Elton-John-1-360x248.jpg" width="360" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>With all these feathers, Sir Elton looks like he&#8217;s about to fly away&#8230;and here we thought the peacock was a flightless bird.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonjohn-balls/" rel="attachment wp-att-254423"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254423" alt="eltonjohn-balls" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/eltonjohn-balls-360x505.jpg" width="360" height="505" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s mum must have been so proud when her little boy took first place at the science fair for his human molecule costume.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonjohn7_468x446/" rel="attachment wp-att-254417"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254417" alt="EltonJohn7_468x446" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/EltonJohn7_468x446.jpg" width="211" height="446" /></a></p>
<p>Here he is giving Julie Newmar/Eartha Kitt/Michelle Pfeiffer/Anne Hathaway a run for their money as Honky Catwoman.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-john-sequins/" rel="attachment wp-att-254419"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254419" alt="elton-john-sequins" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-john-sequins.png" width="320" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton decided to pair this patriotic mohawk with one of Bea Arthur&#8217;s <em>Golden Girls</em> evening gowns for a mash-up of &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; and &#8220;Miami, You&#8217;ve Got Style&#8221; &#8212; America&#8217;s quintessential tunes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-quilted/" rel="attachment wp-att-254421"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254421" alt="elton-quilted" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-quilted-360x306.jpg" width="360" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>Who says you can&#8217;t wear a quilted lamé sofa cover as a jacket? It&#8217;s really an everyday look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-tommy/" rel="attachment wp-att-254422"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254422" alt="elton-tommy" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-tommy-360x464.jpg" width="360" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>He&#8217;s no tiny dancer. Little known fact: these are the actual size of Sir Elton&#8217;s feet, making him quite popular with the gentlemen &#8212; and a few ladies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/eltonbee/" rel="attachment wp-att-254415"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254415" alt="EltonBee" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/EltonBee.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Sir Elton&#8217;s battles with drugs and booze have been well-publicized so you can bet he was more than a little buzzed in this bee costume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/elton-john-birthday-fashion-retrospective-20130325/elton-50/" rel="attachment wp-att-254414"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-254414" alt="elton-50" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/elton-50-360x531.jpg" width="360" height="531" /></a></p>
<p>For his 50th birthday, Sir Elton made an entrance fit for a queen, er, king, serving Louis XIV eleganza  complete with a 15-foot feather train and a 3-foot powdered wig. It&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll repeat this outfit for his 66th, since he now only wears it on laundry day.</p>

<p>We reported on <a href="http://www.queerty.com/physique-magazine-magnate-controversial-bodybuilding-icon-joe-weider-dies-at-93-20130324/#ixzz2OUEmUMSw">the passing of muscle-magazine mogul Joe Weider</a> over the weekend. Starting in the 1940s and 50s, Weider was responsible for publishing some of the biggest physique magazines of the day, which were the pre-Stonewall equivalent of gay porn, even if no one admitted it.</p>
<p>In addition to providing an erotic outlet for gay men, publications <em>Adonis </em>and <em>Body Beautiful </em>allowed men attracted to other men to communicate via &#8220;pen pal&#8221; features. (Think of them as the prehistoric version of social media.)</p>
<p>With that in mind, we&#8217;re posting covers from some of Weider&#8217;s early &#8220;bodybuilding&#8221; publications. Have these kinds of mags been a part of your fantasy repertoire?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfpl/files/201303/Fairness%20Swastika%20Bumper%20Sticker.jpg" rel="nofollow"> <img alt="" src="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wfpl/files/styles/placed_wide/public/201303/Fairness%20Swastika%20Bumper%20Sticker.jpg" width="516" height="385" /> </a></p>
<p>LGBT activists and their allies came to the ACLU KY/Fairness Campaign dinner in Louisville, Kentucky, ready to celebrate Governor Steve Beshear&#8217;s <a href="http://www.queerty.com/ky-governor-vetos-religious-freedom-bill-that-wouldve-legalized-anti-gay-discrimination-20130323/#ixzz2OVGZVvtL">veto of a House Bill 279,</a> which would&#8217;ve allowed individuals to ignore states law that ran counter to their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>But what happened afterward left a bad taste in everyone&#8217;s mouth</p>
<p>When Fairness Campaign director Chris Hartman left the Muhammed Ali Center at about 11:30pm, he found that his <a href="http://wfpl.org/post/fairness-campaign-director-chris-hartmans-car-damaged-defaced-swastika">car had been attacked by vandals</a>. The auto had been sideswiped, with the side mirror broken and dents and scratches along the exterior.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254449" alt="Vehicle Damage 3.23.2013 Hate Crime 1" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Vehicle-Damage-3.23.2013-Hate-Crime-1-360x268.jpg" width="264" height="196" /> The trolls also made sure no one thought it was an accident: Scrawled on Hartman&#8217;s Fairness Campaign bumper sticker was a swastika (above), and a sticker of President Obama&#8217;s face had horns and fangs on it. (&#8220;Fuck you&#8221; was written on another Obama sticker.)</p>
<p>The timing of the incident—right as supporters of the &#8220;religious freedom&#8221; bill are strategizing to overrule Beshear&#8217;s veto—is a <em>little</em> suspicious. But Louisville police discovered the side mirror of the car that struck Hartman&#8217;s not far from the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re investigating the incident as a hate crime but it&#8217;s not clear if the vandals knew the car belonged to Hartman—one of the state&#8217;s preeminent LGBT activists—or just noticed the stickers.</p>
<p>Last April, the Fairness Campaign joined in a protest against a rally by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM) in Frankfort. And in January, two members of the NSM were arrested <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/01/25/kentucky-neo-nazis-charged-in-gruesome-murder-dismemberment/">for murdering a man</a>, dismembering his body, and then tossing the remains in a landfill.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56046817-78/scout-barnes-wingers-chipotle.html.csp"><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em> reports</a> that three restaurants—Winger’s Roadhouse Grill, Utah Sports Lodge and Madeline’s Steakhouse—have stepped in to sponsor the May 4 event.</p>
<p>But Winger&#8217;s—a Western chain affiliated with TGI Friday&#8217;s—is hedging its bet by donating an equal amount to the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/56046817-78/www.utahpridecenter.org/" target="_blank">Utah Pride Center</a>’s annual Queer Prom on April 20.</p>
<p>“We believe in the scouting program and believe it offers life skills to people,” said Winger&#8217;s President Curt Gray. “We believe most of all in non-prejudice and non-discrimination. We’re not trying to take a huge political stand here, but we tell this to our staff often and we thought we should put our money where our mouth is.”</p>
<div id="inlineContent">
<div>Gray commented that both organizations help to support and build leaders. The Center helps young gays, he said, who are &#8220;bullied and too often rejected by family and peers.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rejected, like the way they are by the Boy Scouts?</div>

<p><strong>PHOTOS:</strong> Hundreds gathered in Times Square for a candlelight vigil organized by LGBT advocate David Mizner in advance of next week&#8217;s monumental Supreme Court hearings. “The week of March 24 will be a historic week for the LGBT community, family and friends. For two days on that week, the United States Supreme Court is hearing arguments on both the DOMA and Proposition 8 cases. Rarely has a time called for dignified reflections and ‘giving witness’ to the moment,” said Mixner. “Not acknowledging the importance of those hearings in our lives is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Supporters of equality will continue to rev up for the big days at some 150 vigils, talks visits to Congressional offices and marriage bureaus, and more across all 50 states. For more details visit <a href="http://www.lighttojustice.org/">United for Marriage</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-213558" alt="Mike Huckabee" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2012/07/mike_huckabee-360x240.jpg" width="327" height="218" />Reince Priebus, chair of the Republican National Committee, was quick to distance himself from <a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-gop-announces-then-renounces-inclusive-platform-20130319/">a GOP committee report </a>suggesting the party had to make substantive outreach to LGBT people and other minorities.</p>
<p>Seems like Priebus has his own plan for handling tough social issues: Put Mike Huckabee on them!</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/343723/priebus-huckabee-model-gop-andrew-stiles" target="_blank">interview with the <em>National Review</em></a>, Priebus said the former presidential candidate was a great point person for handling topics like marriage equality and reproductive rights, because he towed the party line while sounding “reasonable” to voters who disagree.</p>
<p>“I always tell people: Listen to Governor Mike Huckabee. I don’t know anyone that talks about them any better,” said Priebus.</p>
<p>But Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister and Fox news bobblehead, is hardly &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; In fact, he&#8217;s spit venom at gays and lesbians with the best of them. Here are some of his greatest hits, courtesy of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org">ThinkProgress:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>* Being gay is a public health risk.</strong> “I feel homosexuality is an aberrant, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1207/7270.html">unnatural, and sinful lifestyle</a>, and we now know it can pose a dangerous public health risk”</p>
<p><strong>* Being gay is a sin.</strong> “Well I believe it would be — <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/12/08/4433947-huck-defends-aids-stance">just like lying is sinful and stealing is sinful</a>. There are a lot of things that are sinful. It doesn’t mean that a person is a horrible person. It means that they engage in behavior that is outside the norms of those boundaries of our traditional view of what’s right and what’s wrong&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>* Same-sex marriage will lead to polygamy. </strong>“If we change the definition to a man or a man and a woman and a woman, why can’t we accommodate <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/02/28/177277/huckabee-polygamy/">a man and two women</a> or a woman and three men.”</p></blockquote>
<p>TP also reminds us Huckabee stood up for Missouri Rep. Todd Akin, backing his claim that women can&#8217;t get pregnant from sexual assaults.</p>
<p>Ugh, we liked it better when the GOP just hated us<em>.<br />

<p>Gender-blending valkyrie Tilda Swinton has fascinated us since we first saw her play both genders in <em>Orlando. </em>Now we can (hopefully) experience her magnificence in person as the ginger actress has put herself on display at the Museum of Modern Art in <a href="http://newyork.gaycities.com">New York</a>.</p>
<p>As part of a performance piece called <em>The Maybe</em>, Swinton will come into <a href="http://gothamist.com/tags/moma">MoMA</a> at various times over the next month and take a nap inside a glass box, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>-style.</p>
<p>Her first unannounced slumber was on Saturday. According to <a href="http://gothamist.com/2013/03/23/photos_tilda_swinton_is_sleeping_in.php">Gothamist</a>, <em>The Maybe</em> was first performed in London in 1995 at the Serpentine Gallery and again at the Museo Barracco in Rome.</p>
<p>Says MoMA:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>An integral part of <em>The Maybe’s</em> incarnation at MoMA in 2013 is that there is no published schedule for its appearance, no artist’s statement released, no museum statement beyond this brief context, no public profile or image issued.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those who find it chance upon it for themselves, live and in real—shared—time: now we see it, now we don’t.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering we&#8217;d buy tickets to watch Swinton dry her nails, you <em>know </em>we&#8217;re gonna be there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254388" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-24 at 2.38.49 PM" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-24-at-2.38.49-PM.png" width="211" height="150" />Joe Weider, who helped popularize bodybuilding as a legitimate sport and launched the career of a young Arnold Schwarzenegger, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/23/joe-weider-dies_n_2941586.html">died of heart failure</a> in his Los Angeles home on Saturday. He was 93.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Joe] was the godfather of fitness who told all of us to be somebody with a body,&#8221; Schwarzenegger tweeted. &#8220;He taught us that through hard work and training we could all be champions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weider, who created t<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-254390" alt="friendly_skies_07" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/friendly_skies_07-360x480.jpg" width="202" height="269" />he Mr. Olympia contest in the 1960s,  developed a media empire that included dozens of bodybuilding magazines—including <em>Your Physique, Adonis, Body Beautiful</em> and <em>Muscle &amp; Fitness</em><em>. </em>He later produced successful lifestyle brands like <em>Shape </em>and<em> Men&#8217;s Fitness, </em>before selling Weider Publications in 2003.</p>
<p>When Weider hit the scene in the 1950s and 60s, so-called &#8220;physique magazines&#8221; were the closest thing to gay porn you could find. Weider—who is survived by his wife, Betty—didn&#8217;t hesitate to encourage his bodybuilding protegees to pose in his magazine to help fund their training.</p>
<p>There were even allegations Weider &#8220;pimped&#8221; his athletes to closeted gay men—but it was all very &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bodybuilder Bob Paris claimed that Weider was furious he had come out as gay, rather than stay in the weight-room closet:  &#8220;The powers that be want so badly to overcome the myth that all bodybuilders are gay, presuming that&#8217;s a negative thing,&#8221; Paris said <a href="http://homeo.tripod.com/bobparis">in an interview in 1998</a>. &#8220;Then you have the top face in the sport evolve into an activist and they don&#8217;t know what to do with that.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>PHOTOS</strong>: Working closely with their spiritual cousins in the National Organization for Marriage, tens of thousands marched through the streets of Paris today in opposition to the government&#8217;s marriage-for-all legislation.</p>
<p><em>La manif pour tous</em>, or &#8220;the demonstration for all&#8221; extended five kilometers from La Defence to the Arc de Triomphe. Protestors were denied access to march along the famed Champs Elysees, though hundreds tried anyway—and were tear-gassed by police.</p>
<p>President Hollande&#8217;s marriage-equality plan has been adopted by the lower chamber of parliament and goes before the Senate in April, when it is expected to be approved.</p>
<p>Opponents maintain addressing civil issues like gay marriage is taking focus away from fixing the economy. Of course, the government wouldn&#8217;t have to spend much time or energy on marriage efforts if these people didn&#8217;t oppose it, so they&#8217;ve kind of created their own problem, <em>n&#8217;est</em>–ce <em>pas?</em></p>
<p>More than 340,000 demonstrators protested <a href="http://www.queerty.com/340000-join-march-against-marriage-equality-at-eiffel-tower-20130114/#8ZMl2yCoS0IMRGBf.99">at the Eiffel Tower in January</a>, and organizers hope today&#8217;s event will match or supersede that number.</p>
<p><strong>You can see live streaming video of the insanity <a href="http://www.lamanifpourtous.fr/Jours-J/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-254337" alt="national org for marriage" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/national-org-for-marriage-670x509.png" width="650" height="493" /></p>
<p>The National Organization for Marriage has posted the route for its March 26 Marriage March—where up to dozens of people will block traffic and cost local police departments thousands in overtime—all in the name of depriving other Americans of the rights endowed to them by their Creator.</p>
<p>In a twitter post, <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/NOMupdate" rel="external">@NOM</a> </strong>even<strong> </strong>suggests yanking your kids out of school for this promenade of prejudice:  &#8220;Make it a road trip by bringing kids, siblings, friends, even co-workers to Tuesday&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/search/%23MarriageMarch" rel="nofollow">#MarriageMarch</a> in DC. Let&#8217;s celebrate <a href="http://twitter.com/search/%23marriage" rel="nofollow">#marriage</a>!&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be a real convocation of haters, including:</p>
<blockquote><p>* San Francisco Archbishop <strong>Salvatore Cordileone</strong> (Let&#8217;s hope he&#8217;s not <a href="http://www.queerty.com/sf-archbishop-cordileone-architect-of-prop-8-arrested-for-drunk-driving-20120827/">driving to the parade</a>)</p>
<p><strong>* Christine Boutin</strong>, president of France&#8217;s Christian Democrat Party (Because who has more right to weigh in on the American legal system than a right-wing French politician?)</p>
<p>* The Ruth Institute&#8217;s <strong>Jennifer Roback Morse, </strong>who demands gays and lesbian <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nom-marriage-expert-endorses-lifelong-celibacy-for-gay-people-20121011/">adhere to lifelong celibacy</a></p>
<p>* State Sen. <strong>Ruben Diaz, </strong>who says <a href="http://www.queerty.com/ruben-diaz-outed-his-lesbian-granddaughter-before-working-against-her-right-to-exist-20110606/">having two gay brothers and a lesbian granddaughter</a> doesn&#8217;t change his feelings that the LGBT community doesn&#8217;t deserve equal rights.</p>
<p>* Iowa Family Leader director <strong>Bob Vander Platts</strong>, who says homosexuality is a health risk on par <a href="http://www.queerty.com/bob-vander-plaats-wants-kids-to-be-taught-straightness-to-avoid-risky-health-style-20110410/">with second-hand smoke</a>.</p>
<p><strong>* Penny Nance </strong>of Concerned Women for America, who <a href="http://www.glaad.org/cap/penny-nance">insists</a> marriage equality will lead to &#8220;wholesale destruction of our society&#8217;s moral foundation&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We&#8217;re not fans of Karl Rove, but the man is a canny strategist: This morning <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/03/karl-rove-i-could-imagine-next-gop-presidential-nominee-supporting-gay-marriage/">on ABC&#8217;s <i>This Week</i></a>, the Sith Lord said he could see Republican presidential candidates supporting marriage equality by 2016.</p>
<p>He also predicted the Supreme Court will vote in favor of marriage equality in the two cases it will hear this coming week, but the their ruling will leave legalization of same-sex marriages up to the states. &#8220;What we may see is a decision here that in essence has, not a 5-4 decision, but a 6-3, 7-2, that says leave it up to the states. In fact we could see an 8-1.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting in a car and driving to another state to have your union recognized may seem unconscionable, but interracial couples dealt with that very situation for decades. So did heterosexual couples looking to elope. (Many would <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkton,_Maryland">head to Maryland</a>, which required neither a blood test nor witnesses.)</p>
<p>Is that a good enough result for you?  Or is the idea of piecemeal equality unconscionable? <strong>Give your ruling in the comments section below.</strong></p>

<p>Leather boys, porn stars and drag queens came out of hibernation for a naughty precursor to one of the most scandalous parties on the gay calendar.  Guests got a closer look at the vendors, entertainers, performers, artists and nocturnal celebrities that go bump in the night.  <strong>Max Ryder</strong>, <strong>Vita Gallo, Adam Killian</strong> and other studs from CockyBoys, Raging Stallion and Lucas Entrtainment mingled with fans and fanatics while exquisite queens like <strong>Sharon Needles, Maddelynn Hatter</strong>, and <strong>Epiphany Get Paid</strong> set the drag bar high. By the time the Hookies  started, we were able to catch up with Sharon, <strong>Robin Byrd, Michael Musto</strong> and the cast of<a href="http://rentboythemusical.com/"> <em>Rent Boy the Musical</em></a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-88517" alt="restroom23980" src="http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2010/03/restroom23980-320x213.jpg" width="272" height="181" />The city of Portland, Oregon, got swallowed up whole by a volcanic fissure. Yup, an area high school converted six bathrooms as gender-neutral, and God swallowed the whole town up whole.</p>
<p>Okay, not exactly: Ulysses S. Grant High, Portland’s largest public high school, re-christened six restrooms as unisex , offering another option for the five to ten trans students on campus—and absolutely nothing happened.</p>
<p>The walls didn&#8217;t bleed, local women didn&#8217;t spontaneously go into labor, and the walls between dimensions didn&#8217;t fracture.</p>
<p><a href="http://is.gd/HDHZVg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>The Oregonian</em></a> reports that four single-person student bathrooms and two faculty lavatories have been opened to all students. “We just need to make sure that all students are safe and comfortable here, and that they have their needs met,” Grant High vice principal Kristyn Westphal said. “If they feel unsafe using the bathroom, that’s a problem.”</p>
<p>Oregon is one of 15 states that offers some protections to trans citizens.</p>

<p>You ever notice how Republican officials have weird names—like Mitt or Newt or Orrin?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/littlejohn4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254313" alt="littlejohn4" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/littlejohn4.jpg" width="500" height="156" /></a></p>
<p>Lucy Meadows, who was the target of <em>The Daily Mail</em> columnist Richard Littlejohn, <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/teacher-due-begin-new-term-1767749" target="_blank">committed</a> suicide this week. According to The New Civil Rights Movement, Meadows was <a href="http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2-trans-woman-commits-suicide-after-being-bullied-by-the-daily-mail/discrimination/2013/03/23/63057" target="_blank">criticized</a> for staying in her post as a primary school teacher after she started presenting as a woman.</p>
<p>In the article, now three months old, Littlejohn went on to ask if &#8221;anyone stopped for a moment to think of the devastating effect all this is having on those who really matter? Children as young as seven aren’t equipped to compute this kind of information.&#8221; The reporter said that the children needed to be protected from Meadows and suggested she was a threat to their innocence.</p>
<p>Even worse, Littlejohn also suggested that Meadows should disappear. &#8220;It would have been easy for him to disappear quietly at Christmas, have the operation and then return to work as ‘Miss Meadows’ at another school on the other side of town in September,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;No-one would have been any the wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Meadows is gone&#8230; The trans-phobic article has since been scrubbed of all references to the teacher. The changes seem to coincide with the recent news of her death.</p>
<p>While there is no direct correlation between Meadows&#8217; death and the article, it would appear that she was a target of media bullying. What&#8217;s worse, is the possibility that she did feel threatened by the article or by others because of the way it was written.</p>
<p>The New Civil Rights Movement goes on to ask: &#8220; Did you ever think about how it would feel to be Lucy Meadows at the moment when your paper chose to label her as forever &#8216;male&#8217; and a threat to her own students? Obviously that didn’t deter you from publishing this disgusting, horrible column in the first place. So why bother hiding your deeds now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Readers what do you think? Did Richard Littlejohn go to far? Should he or the paper be held accountable in any way?</p>

<p>At the LA Gay &amp; Lesbian Center gala, which raised $1 million for homeless LGBT youth, Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal <a href="http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/amy-pascal-asks-hollywood-to-eliminate-gay-slurs-stereotypes-from-movies/" target="_blank">made</a> a call-to-action regarding the depiction of LGBT characters in film and television.</p>
<p><strong>The event&#8217;s honoree explored the negative imagery seen in gay-centric films:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;<em>Brokeback Mountain, Milk, Boys Don’t Cry, Philadelphia, The Hours, Gods and Monsters, The Talented Mr. Ripley, A Single Man, My Own Private Idaho, Cloud Atlas</em> – in all these movies, the main character is murdered or martyred or commits suicide or just dies unhappily. And there are far more pernicious and dangerous images that confront gay kids and their parents: the lesbian murderer, the psychotic transvestite, the queen who is humiliated and sometimes tossed off a ship or a ledge. It’s a big joke. It still happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>But she also praised films that set a positive example of depicting gay characters:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Of course, there are great images, too, like the family in The Kids Are All Right. The way the boy in Perks of Being a Wallflower and the middle-aged man in Hotel Marigold and the 75-year-old man in Beginners come out to a better, richer, more fulfilled life. It’s treated as a celebration.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And real credit has to be given to the filmmakers of ParaNorman, Chris Butler and Sam Fell, who had the first gay character in an animated movie, and he was the football hunk and it was totally incidental to the plot.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>She closed her speech with a challenge to the industry to do more:</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Now it’s time for all of us to take that step. Not every gay character needs to be defined by his or her sexuality. Can’t being gay just be one stitch in the fabric of someone’s life? Can’t we depict men and women who just so happen to be gay – perhaps a lawyer or soldier or business executive or scientist or engineer…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We need to create an atmosphere that encourages people to speak up, so we get this right.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How about next time, when any of us are reading a script and it says words like fag, or faggot – homo – dyke – take a pencil and just cross it out. Just don’t do it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can do better and we will do better. We have to. If we just think about that kid in North Dakota, or their parents, we might just do it a little differently.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>PHOTOS:</strong> On Friday, Colorado Governor Jim Hickenlooper signed into law Senate Bill 11, which legalizes same-sex unions, before a uproarious crowd at the History Colorado museum.</p>
<p>The momentous day was a counterpoint to Election Night 1992, when Colorado voters approved Amendment 2, which blocked extending anti-discrimination protections to gays and lesbians.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t take that defeat sitting down,&#8221; said state Sen. Pat Steadman (D-Denver). &#8220;We were in the streets, and we were in the courtrooms, and we were in the halls of the Capitol building.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the fourth time Steadman and fellow gay legislator and House Speaker Mark Ferrandino sponsored a civil-unions bill, but the first time it didn&#8217;t die in the Legislature. (It&#8217;s also the first time it was put forward since Democrats won the House in November.)</p>
<p>&#8220;John Kelly and I met 20 years ago, wearing our U.S. military uniforms, in American Veterans for Equal Rights&#8217; first color guard for the Denver Pride Parade,&#8221; Jay Chetney, one of the witnesses to the signing, posted on Facebook. &#8220;He was an Air Force medic and I was an Army nurse. For years our unit marched behind the Dykes with Bikes. Today we witnessed the signing of Colorado&#8217;s Civil Union Bill!&#8221;</p>
<p>Steadman joined in that ebullient feeling, but admitted civil unions fall short of full marriage equality: &#8220;It is not an extension of equal rights,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not something that includes us fully and on equal footing with others in society—There is still much to do.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22841921/colorado-civil-unions-hickenlooper-takes-up-pen-sign">The <em>Denver Post</em> reveals</a> Steadman deliberately chose to name the measure Senate Bill 11:</p>
<blockquote><p>His partner, Dave Misner, who died last September after a brief battle with pancreatic cancer, was born on May 11. They had been together 11 years. Some of those who attended the civil-unions signing wore the same purple ribbons they wore at Misner&#8217;s funeral.</p>
<p>After civil unions passed this year, Steadman wrote a poem:</p>
<p><i>11 is a prime number.</i></p>
<p><i>Eleven is a lovely word.</i></p>
<p><i>It&#8217;s binary; a pair of ones.</i></p>
<p><i>It&#8217;s two like things, bound together,</i></p>
<p><i>to make a whole of ones.</i></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An internal survey conducted by the Boy Scouts of America shows that 97% of Boy Scouts and their parents believe that the organization’s anti-gay policy “negatively impacted their loyalty.”</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/03/22/1764441/boy-scouts-97-percent/" target="_blank">ThinkProgress reports</a> that “of the 5,800 survey respondents who commented on the policy, 95% said the &#8220;reaffirmation of the membership policy negatively impacted their loyalty.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-23-at-11.22.38-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-254211 alignright" alt="Screen Shot 2013-03-23 at 11.22.38 AM" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Screen-Shot-2013-03-23-at-11.22.38-AM-360x150.png" width="360" height="150" /></a> For Boy Scouts and their parents, that number jumped to 97%.</p>
<p>In a copy of the results <a href="http://www.scoutsforequality.com/campaign-news/2012-fall-voice-of-the-scout/" target="_blank">obtained by Scouts for Equality</a>, the BSA also learned the organization’s loyalty dropped 11% over the past year – mostly due to the “membership standards policy,” which bans gay members.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/03/22/1764441/boy-scouts-97-percent/" target="_blank">ThinkProgress spoke</a> to a representative of the BSA who commented on the survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of the 9 percent who mentioned this issue, 97 percent of Boy Scout parents and 95 percent of Cub Scout parents had negative views toward the current policy.</p>
<p>Using an open-ended format like this indicates the membership standards policy is a factor, but it doesn’t tell you to what extent the issue impacted loyalty to the BSA, nor does it represent the beliefs of the 91 percent of respondents who did not comment on the issue.</p>
<p>Also, this level of feedback is not unusual. Throughout the years, people involved in Scouting and others who are not related to the program have expressed their disagreement with this single policy in a variety of ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite these results, the BSA continues to uphold it’s anti-gay policy. Over the past year, the organization has lost members and significant <a href="http://www.queerty.com/chipotle-boy-scouts-gay-ban-20130321/" target="_blank">funders</a> and <a href="http://www.queerty.com/carly-rae-jepsen-says-no-to-boy-scouts-yes-to-white-party-20130318/" target="_blank">support</a> because of this. Even <a href="http://www.queerty.com/california-boy-scout-council-calls-for-national-non-discrimination-policy-20130320/" target="_blank">local councils</a> are calling for national change.</p>
<p>The BSA is expected to make a final decision on the ban in May.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-254205" alt="steve-beshear" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/steve-beshear.jpg" width="300" height="232" />Queerty has been dinging the dingbats with our esteemed <a href="http://www.queerty.com/tag/douche-of-the-week/">Douche of the Week </a>award for some time. So we thought it was only fair to honor those who do right by the LGBT community.</em></p>
<p><em>Introducing the</em> <strong>Queerty Badass of the Week.</strong></p>
<p>On Friday, Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky vetoed a bill that would have allowed individuals to ignore any state law that ran counter to their core religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Beshear said House Bill 279 was well-intended but its vague language could have serious unintended consequences.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I value and cherish our rights to religious freedom and I appreciate the good intentions of House Bill 279 and the members of the General Assembly who supported this bill to protect our constitutional rights to practice our religion.</p>
<p>However, I have significant concerns that this bill will cause serious unintentional consequences that could threaten public safety, health care, and individuals’ civil rights. As written, the bill will undoubtedly lead to costly litigation. I have heard from many organizations and government entities that share those same concerns. Therefore, after giving this measure thoughtful analysis and consideration, today I vetoed the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The measure had clear implications for the LGBT community, who would have faced discrimination under the mask of religious tolerance.</p>
<p>Numerous professional, civil-rights and even religious groups supported Beshear&#8217;s veto, including the<br />
Kentucky Equality Federation, Kentucky Commission on Human Rights, Kentucky Education Association, the ACLU of Kentucky, Faith Leaders for Fairness, Gay and Lesbian Services Organization (GLSO) and the Jewish Community Relations Council of Louisville.</p>
<p>All together now: <strong>Good on you!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" alt="Steven Simpson" src="http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01696/Page17_03_1696172a.jpg" width="164" height="211" />A Yorkshire man found guilty of setting fire to a gay teen on his 18th birthday—resulting in the boy&#8217;s death—will only serve 21 months in prison, reports <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/4854123/Thug-who-burned-a-lad-to-death-will-serve-just-21-months-sparking-campaigners-fury.html#ixzz2ON9tvBkr">the <em>Sun</em></a>.</p>
<p>Steven Simpson, who had been diagnosed with Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome and epilepsy, was celebrating his 18th birthday party last June when Jordan Sheard, 20, arrived with some mates and began teasing Simpson.</p>
<p>Sheard stripped Simpson to his underwear and wrote homophobic slurs on his body, which was then covered in suntan lotion.</p>
<p>The bully then held a lighter to Simpson&#8217;s groin, causing the disabled teen to catch fire. By the time a neighbor was able to put the flames out, Simpson had burns on 60% of his body. (A paramedic reported seeing lipstick all over Steven’s face—with the words “gay boy” on his head. )</p>
<p>He died the following day.</p>
<p>Sheard, meanwhile, fled the party as soon as Simpson caught fire—and initially tried to tell police the victim set fire to himself.</p>
<p>He finally admitted he started the blaze but said it was just horseplay gone wrong. Judge Roger Keen accepted Sheard&#8217;s guilty manslaughter plea and sentenced him to 3 1/2 years. But Sheard will be released on parole after just 21 months.</p>
<p>“Any objective observer, given the fluid that had been poured all over him, would have considered that was a dangerous act,” said Keen at sentencing.</p>
<p>A dangerous act? Drinking while pregnant is a dangerous act. This was the dictionary definition of a hate crime, and the judge let him off far too easy. We can only imagine the pain Simpson&#8217;s family is feeling at being so cruelly devastated<em>—</em>twice<em>.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-76981" alt="BW_Newspaper_Stack_0" src="http://www.queerty.com/wp/docs/2009/12/BW_Newspaper_Stack_0-320x240.jpg" width="320" height="240" />A newspaper in Hamlin, West Virginia, has sparked outrage by running a reader&#8217;s comments calling for the extermination of gays, African-Americans, Italians, Jews and Catholics—though not in such polite language.</p>
<p>The <em>Lincoln Journal</em> printed a transcript of a voicemail left by an anonymous caller  responding to a story about a <a href="http://lincolnjournalinc.com/fired-teacher-denies-trying-to-turn-them-gay-p9667-1.htm">lesbian middle-school teacher who was fired</a> after she accused the school board of coercing students to complain she tried to “turn them gay.”</p>
<p>“We were really glad to hear that School Board is getting rid of them queers,” the unnamed local opined. “The next thing is we need to get rid of all the n****rs, the spics, the kikes and the wops.”</p>
<p>“You know even them Catholics, they are wrong as baby eaters,” the voice mail continued. “We need to clear them people out and have good, white, God -fearing Christians and everybody else needs to be put to death for their abominations. We’ll keep Lincoln County white and right. Thank you.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/130320_14747.shtml">WCHS reports</a> that reaction to the letter, and the subsequent controversy, has been mixed: Hamlin resident Leroy Ramey told reporters, “I don’t have to read it all—I already agree with that. Get rid of them.”</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://ads.lincolnjournal.com/MediaGuide.pdf">Journal&#8217;s media kit</a>, the paper has been in print since 1903, and reaches more than 4,000 paid subscribers.</p>
<p>Managing editor Sean O’Donoghue<em> </em>says the voicemail was definitely offensive, but he doesn&#8217;t regret printing its contents: “We felt it was the right call to publish it, given the ongoing story we covered over the past three weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made clear, that while all readers are entitled to their views, we feel pity for people who resort to racial slurs,&#8221; O’Donoghue told <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/22/lincoln-journal-anonymous-rant-west-virginia-paper_n_2933021.html">HuffPost</a>. &#8220;People in the county are not shocked to to hear somebody say that. Locally, there&#8217;s more of an understanding that there are people in our community capable of such hateful things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was O’Donoghue doing the right thing by exposing hatred in the community, or was he fanning the flames of bigotry?</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254171" alt="bus" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/bus-360x231.jpg" width="360" height="231" />London Mayor Boris Johnson was within his rights <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/22/boris-johnson-christian-ad-court">to ban conversion-therapy ads from city buses</a>, according to a ruling by a magistrate today.</p>
<div id="article-body-blocks">
<p>Justice Beverley Lang ruled that Johnson didn&#8217;t abuse his position last April as chairman of Transport for London (TFL) in blocking ads for Core Issues Trust, which claims it can help gay and lesbian Christians &#8220;develop their heterosexual potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lang criticized Johnson&#8217;s actions as being &#8220;procedurally unfair, in breach of its own procedures and [demonstrating] a failure to consider the relevant issues,&#8221; but said the larger issue at stake was the &#8220;risk of prejudice and homophobic attacks,&#8221; the ads presented.</p>
<p>The proposed posters read, &#8220;Not Gay! Ex-Gay, Post-Gay and Proud. Get over it!&#8221; which Johnson said was &#8220;offensive to gays&#8221; and could potentially lead to retaliation against Christians.</p>
<p>Representatives for Core Issues Trust say Johnson&#8217;s ban was aimed at garnering votes from LGBT and progressive voters in the May elections: &#8220;It was clearly a highly charged issue, and the mayor took credit for the highly politically driven decision,&#8221; said Paul Diamond, who claimed his group has only respect &#8220;for people struggling with same-sex attraction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diamond also claimed the proposed ads were a response to gay-positive bus-poster campaign by Stonewall that declared &#8220;Some people are gay. Get over it!&#8221; (At least one Christian bus driver<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.queerty.com%2Fbus-driver-refuses-to-board-bus-with-sign-reading-some-people-are-gay-get-over-it-20121119%2F&amp;ei=yrxMUfXWOvCJ0QHVzYDoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxheqbstIk0G8IkkZ7BiTKCTe4Xg&amp;bvm=bv.44158598,d.dmQ"> refused to drive a coach</a> bearing Stonewall&#8217;s ad.)</p>
<p>Not everyone in London&#8217;s LGBT community think Johnson made the right call, though.  &#8220;They are offensive, said veteran  activist Peter Tachell, &#8220;but being offensive is not a legitimate basis for banning anything—In a free society there is no right to not be offended.&#8221;

<p>A male student initially discovered the cam wedged in the top corner of the lavatory and reported it to the principal on Wednesday. “We do not know that the officer’s intentions were,” Lt. T.J. Smith explained. “That’s an important issue that we’re trying to get to the bottom of.”</p>
<p>Gee, maybe he was just trying to capture some of those nasty trans people <a href="http://www.queerty.com/az-lawmaker-pushing-papers-before-you-pee-bill-to-attack-trans-community-20130322/">who are apparently stalking bathrooms.</a></p>
<p>School officials confirm the surveillance was unauthorized but insist it was an isolated incident: “The principal ordered staff to look at every single bathroom in all of the buildings in Glen Burnie High School, all the locker rooms, all the team rooms, all those places to make sure there were no other cameras, no other recording devices,” said Anne Arundel County Schools Public Information Officer Bob Mosier. “Those sweeps yesterday and this morning turned up nothing.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, a spokesman for the Anne Arundel County Police <a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2013/03/21/officer-accused-of-installing-camera-in-glen-burnie-hs-boys-restroom/">told WJZ TV</a> that the officer, whose name is being kept confidential, is on paid leave pending a criminal investigation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Friday&#8217;s Blind Items are brought to you by the letter C for Closet Case.</p>
<p><strong>*Sex Crime </strong></p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Which teen soap actor in the the UK is on trial for raping another lad?</p>
<p>The actor, then 15, allegedly forced a 14-year-old to perform oral sex on him in London&#8217;s Wimbledon Theatre, and later raped him in front of his girlfriend.</p>
<p>The twisted part is the soap star, who hails from Surrey, allegedly committed the heinous act to prove to his girlfriend that he was bisexual.</p>
<p>The whole mess is in court now, with both the victim and defendant&#8217;s names being kept confidential—for now.</p>
<p>The alleged perpetrator maintains everything was consensual. [<em><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/teen-soap-star-raped-boy-to-prove-he-was-bisexual-court-hears-8539577.html">The Independent</a></em>]</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Our verdict: There are easier ways to convince your girlfriend you&#8217;re bisexual.</em></p>
</div>
<p><strong>*Silver Linings Gaybook</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/blind-items-coffee-and-a-lack-of-sympathy-20130322/coffee-mystery/" rel="attachment wp-att-254152"><img class="alignright" alt="coffee-mystery" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/coffee-mystery.jpg" width="220" height="176" /></a>This A list mostly movie actor and Academy Award winner/nominee has a new male lover. As his custom though, the actor refuses to ever admit that he is gay and instead, kept his boyfriend locked up in a hotel room.</p>
<p>The award-winner ate several times by himself at places while not even allowing his new lover to order room service.</p>
<p>Instead, the actor would bring him back coffee and wraps from Starbucks. Our actor is apparently one of the cruelest guys around when it comes to his partners. Violently so. [<a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/03/blind-item-2_18.html" target="_blank"><em>Crazy Days and Nights</em></a>]</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Our verdict: Kinky, apparently this actor&#8217;s into bondage.</em></p>
<div>
<p><strong>*Sugar Diddy</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This A list celebrity/rapper/mogul and sometime reality star is not a huge drinker. At clubs he will drink and he orders a ton of booze, but he is not like Jay-Z who will actually get hammered.</p>
<p>There are times though that our celebrity does. If you are a 18-22 year old gay male interested in older men and lots of presents, this is your chance. Our celebrity uses his drinking as an excuse to take a night off from being a ladies man.</p>
<p>He heads to a club and finds some willing guys and then for the rest of the night they drive around in a party bus while our celebrity enjoys getting wild with the guys with no one to see and is passing out money and presents and booze and seemingly at his happiest. When the party is over he drops them back off at the club and then pretends it all never happened. Just blames it on the booze. [<a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2013/03/blind-item-5_17.html" target="_blank"><em>Crazy Days and Nights</em></a>]</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Our verdict: We&#8217;d be willing to lie about our age to get some of these alleged gifts.<strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>*Apparently People Still Use Gaydar</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Who is ‘bitchforu18?? The celebrity who was prowling around Gaydar chatrooms on Monday, posting such delightful messages as:</p>
<p>bitchforu18: I NEED SOMEONE TO COME AND NAIL ME</p>
<p>bitchforu18: I’m drunk willing</p>
<p>bitchforu18: im an actor</p>
<p>bitchforu18: well known</p>
<p>bitchforu18: I NEED TO BE F*CKED NOW, IM IN SOHO. IM GOOD LOOKING, DEFINED, 29 AND GOT A FAMOUS FACE. IM ALSO SO F*CKING DRUNK. WHYS IT HARD TO FIND SOMEONE TO BREED ME?? [<a href="http://blindgossip.com/?p=51118" target="_blank"><em>Blind Gossip</em></a>]</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Our verdict: He finally got bred.</em></p>
<p><strong>*Keeping Up with the Kloseted Boyfriend</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This A list reality star apparently caught her A list celebrity boyfriend in way more than just a lip lock with another guy. It does not seem to have slowed down their relationship at all though.

<p><em>Our verdict: Calling someone an A-list reality star is an insult no matter how you phrase it.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>It was not that long ago that this almost A list mostly television actor was still trying to make it look like he dated women. He liked the impression that he was a ladies man and he got that impression by dating woman after woman. He dated so many women because there was never any third date love if you get my drift.</p>
<p>He would just date them until he could not hide it anymore and then move on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, women all over the world would follow each of these changes and hope they would be next. He finally has settled down. Of course the person he settled down with has never actually even pretended to date a guy and everyone was fairly certain she would just come out. She is a B list actress. Mostly movies. I think I am being generous in giving her a B. She might be closer to a C.</p>
<p>The couple claims they fell in love and can&#8217;t be separated from each other. Well, she has a girlfriend so there must be some separation sometime. He is not currently seeing any guys and is extremely hesitant to ever do so except when he is out of the country and in very controlled circumstances. I&#8217;m not sure why they decided to go this route. It is confusing, especially on her part because she was so close to coming out. Publicity? That could be. Her old girlfriend knew a lot about publicity.

<p><em>Our verdict: Sounds like a match made in a very specific circle of hell.<br />
</em></p>
<p><strong>*BrotherlE! Love</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>People are sad over this attractive couple’s split. Let’s clarify a few things about their relationship. First of all, they were never a real couple. However, they really were friends with one another. Secondly, the arrangement worked so well over time, that they actually thought about making it more permanent. Thirdly, they broke up very suddenly, but it was not because of a conflict between the man and the woman. The real conflict was between the man and the woman’s <em>brother</em>. That’s right! The guy didn’t really break up with <em>her</em>. He was actually breaking up with her brother! She was just a casualty of the fallout. Why did they break up? One guy heard that the other betrayed him (we don’t know if  it was true or not). The breakup followed very quickly after that. It was very sudden and very ugly. Finally, all three in this relationship are adults and are professionals in the industry, so we think that there is a zero out of ten chance that <em>any</em> details of their relationship or their breakup will ever be made public.

<p><em>Our verdict: A sham? wow</em>! <em>Secrets, out.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="giantquote">
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254141" alt="Cordileone-030-2-large" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/Cordileone-030-2-large-360x446.jpg" width="262" height="325" />To legalize marriage between two people of the same sex would enshrine in the law the principle that mothers and fathers are interchangeable or irrelevant, and that marriage is essentially an institution about adults, not children; marriage would mean nothing more than giving adults recognition and benefits in their most significant relationship.</p>
<p>How can we do this to our children?</p>
<p>Why has virtually every known civilization across time and history recognized the need to bring together men and women to make and raise the next generation together? Clearly something important is at stake, or human beings of such different cultures, histories and religions would not come up with the basic idea of marriage as a male-female union over and over again.</p>
<p>When we as a culture abandon that idea and ideal, children suffer, communities suffer, women suffer, and men are dehumanized by being told they aren&#8217;t important to the project of family life.</p>
<p>Our bodies have meaning. The conjugal union of a man and a woman is not a factory to produce babies; marriage seeks to create a total community of love, a &#8220;one flesh&#8221; union of mind, heart and body that includes a willingness to care for any children their bodily union makes together. Two men and two women can certainly have a close loving committed emotional relationship, but they can never ever join as one flesh in the unique way a husband and wife do.</p>
<p>Treating same-sex relationships as marriage is the final severing by government of the natural link between marriage and the great task of bringing together male and female to make and raise the next generation together in love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-254126" alt="john kavanagh" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/03/john-kavanagh-360x265.png" width="360" height="265" /><strong>Each week, Queerty picks one blowhard, hypocrite, airhead, sanctimonious prick or other enemy of all that is queer to be the Douche of the Week. </strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Have a nominee for DOTW? E-mail it to us at <a href="mailto:">holla@queerty.com</a>.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In February, Phoenix, Arizona, passed an anti-discrimination law protecting gender expression and identity and ensuring trans citizens had equal access to jobs, housing and public accommodations.</p>
<p>That didn&#8217;t sit right with <a href="http://www.queerty.com/arizona-cuts-off-benefits-for-unmarried-heteros-but-not-gays-20101227/">longtime bigot John Kavanagh</a>, a Republican who represents nearby Fountain Hills.</p>
<p>So Rep. Kavanagh is <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20130319law-governing-transgender-use-restrooms-proposed.html">sponsoring a bill</a> that would make it illegal to use a bathroom that doesn&#8217;t match their biological gender: Under SB 1432, a person would be guilty of disorderly conduct, a Class One misdemeanor, if they used a bathroom or dressing room that didn’t correspond to the birth sex listed on his or her birth certificate.</p>
<p>Get caught and you could face a $2,500 fine and up to six months in jail.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re gonna stop for a second and tell you a story: Last week we had the good fortune to attend the GLAAD Media Awards in New York. When nature called, we ambled over to the restrooms and saw that they had been converted into gender-neutral facilities for the evening. Gussied-up men and women shared a typical public bathroom—one with urinals, stalls, the works.</p>
<p>Aside from a few giggles, no one skipped a beat. People did their business, checked their look in the mirror and moved on. The world didn&#8217;t end.</p>
<p>And laws like SB 1432 laws don&#8217;t just hurt trans people: How many times have we used the women&#8217;s room in a gay club, or happily let our female friends use the men&#8217;s room? Or ducked into a single-person bathroom of the opposite sex when there was no line? Think they wouldn&#8217;t abuse this law to arrest gays? Authorities have used flimsier pretexts.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Kavanagh: He praised his bill yesterday by smearing trans people as a whole. “The city of Phoenix has crafted a bill that allows people to define their sex by what they think in their head,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;It also raises the specter of people who want to go into those opposite sex facilities not because they’re transgendered, [but] because maybe that they’re just weird.”</p>
<p>Where are these armies of perverts just waiting at the starting line to invade the women&#8217;s room? We keep hearing about them from Republican politicians but we&#8217;ve never seen any or heard about them from our female friends. And police chiefs in cities like Albany, which do offer trans protections, have testified that they do not <a href="http://vimeo.com/61225188">increase bathroom assaults</a>.</p>
<p>As our friends <a href="http://www.housingworks.org/advocate/detail/az-rep-proposes-papers-before-you-pee-bill-join-us-in-stopping-rep.-kavanag?utm_source=update_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=ExactTarget&amp;utm_campaign=">at Housing Works</a> put it, Kavanagh has a  &#8220;perverse obsession with what happens behind closed bathroom stall doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>All together now, <strong>what a douche!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
