				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_258544" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 370px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-258544" alt="John Duran" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/whoIAmFeatured-e1366074063456-360x262.png" width="360" height="262" /><p class="wp-caption-text">John Duran</p></div>
<p>A few days ago, West Hollywood City Councilmember John Duran <a href="http://www.wehoville.com/2013/04/15/meningitis-victims-brother-condemns-weho-councilmember-duran/">convened a press conference</a> to warn residents that one of their neighbors had contracted a deadly strain of meningitis, and that the infection could spread.</p>
<p>So far, there&#8217;s one known victim: a well-known and beloved resident named Brett Shaad. Large swaths of the city&#8217;s gay community are currently in a state of collective shock and mourning, recalling Shaad&#8217;s sunny demeanor and devotion to social justice.</p>
<p>Although Duran initially claimed that Shaad had attended the White Party, possibly spreading the illness, that later turned out not to be true. Shaad&#8217;s family lashed out at Duran over his inaccurate claims.</p>
<p>Bacterial meningitis is quite serious &#8212; it can kill in a matter of hours &#8212; but it&#8217;s also fortunately rare, and transmission requires close contact like sharing a glass or kissing. Warning signs include stiff neck, headache, nausea and confusion.</p>
<p>A meningitis outbreak in New York has claimed seven lives in the last three years.</p>
<p>Despite only knowing of one isolated case in WeHo, Duran announced plans to set aside <a href="http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2013/04/14/duran-expected-to-raise-meningitis-vaccine-issue-at-weho-council-meeting-on-monday/">$20,000 for immunizations</a>. He later reported that on the first day of the inoculation campaign, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/John.Jude.Duran/posts/10151604629011796">1,100 people stopped by AIDS Health Foundation pharmacies</a> to roll up their sleeves. You can find out more info on meningitis, including where to get vaccinated, at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/bacterial.html" target="_blank">CDC</a>.</p>
<p><em>But to provide a little perspective &#8212; and maybe bum you out a bit &#8212; here are some other, less &#8220;exciting&#8221; causes of death West Hollywood residents face everyday. Be careful out there, kids.</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Air Pollution</strong></p>
<p>Los Angeles has the most polluted air in the country, and so the simple act of breathing outdoors causes permanent lung scarring and leads to cardiopulmonary disease. The American Lung Association estimates that <a href="http://www.lung.org/associations/states/california/for-the-media/los-angeles-more-than-4200.html">LA&#8217;s sooty air causes 4,230 premature deaths every year. </a></p>
<p><strong>2. Earthquakes</strong><br />
The 1994 Northridge earthquake claimed 57 lives. A Kern County quake in 1952 killed 12 people. And upstate, 3,000 people died in the 1906 San Francisco quake and fire.</p>
<p><strong>3. HIV/AIDS</strong><br />
&#8230;or more accurately, HIV/AIDS-related complications. According to LA county, nearly 100 people are diagnosed with HIV in West Hollywood every year. Although the rate of transmission is in decline, it&#8217;s still ten times the county average.</p>
<p><strong>4. Car crashes</strong><br />
Car-drivers claimed <a href="http://www.city-data.com/accidents/acc-West-Hollywood-California.html">four lives in West Hollywood in 2009</a>, the last year for which data is available. In previous years, the death toll ranged from 1 (in 2007) to 6 (in 1996), generally concentrated around the treacherous Fountain Freeway.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cigarettes</strong><br />
The rate of smoking in WeHo is 5.3% higher than in LA County overall. Despite a recent legislative push to ban smoking at bars, the City Council granted local businesses some wide exemptions to the ban. As a result, after a trip to The Abbey or Revolver, you might come home reeking of smoke and feeling hoarse.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, guess who a major opponent of the cigarette ban? <a href="http://westhollywood.patch.com/articles/wehos-john-duran-blows-off-mayor-of-calabasas-over-smoking-ordinance">West Hollywood&#8217;s very own John Duran.</a></p>

<div class="giantquote">
<p>The official obituaries have been, as often happens, partial in both senses: sympathetic and incomplete. With regard to the divisive effect of her reign, one omission was significant and glaring: Section 28.</p>
<p>Lest we forget, this nasty, brutish and short measure of the third Thatcher administration, was designed to slander homosexuality, by prohibiting state schools from discussing positively gay people and our &#8220;pretended family relations&#8221;. Opposition to Section 28 galvanised a new generation of activists who joined with long-time campaigners for equality. Stonewall UK was founded, to repeal Section 28 and pluck older rotten anti-gay legislation from the constitutional tree. This has taken two decades to achieve.</p>
<p>Pathetically, in her dotage, Baroness Thatcher was led by her supporters into the House of Lords to vote against Section 28&#8242;s repeal: her final contribution to UK politics. She dies too early to oppose Parliament&#8217;s inevitable acceptance of same–gender marriage.</p>
<p>Thatcher misjudged the future when, according to her deputy chief whip, she &#8220;threw a piece of red meat (Section 28) to her right-wing wolves&#8221;. Some of these beasts survive her, albeit de-fanged. When, to take a recent example, a disgraced cardinal delivers anti-gay diatribes, the spirit of social Thatcherism is revealed as barren, hypocritical and now pointless&#8230;.</p>
<p>Now the phone rang: &#8220;This is 10 Downing Street&#8221;. I thought it was a colleague having a joke but no: &#8220;The Prime Minister has been trying to reach you. She has it in mind (so the officialese goes) to recommend that the Queen give you a knighthood.&#8221; Flummoxed, I asked for time to think it over. Then, just as I put down the phone, the big black shiny door opened and the Thatchers emerged, she crying a little. It was if she had kept the world waiting until she knew for sure that I&#8217;d been contacted. Of course not. But nevertheless, I suppose the very last thing Thatcher did as prime minster was to organise my knighthood. Ding dong, maybe, but thanks all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.queerty.com/watch-magic-johnsons-gay-son-is-fabulous-20130402/" target="_blank">latest obsession</a>, Earvin &#8220;EJ3&#8243; Johnson III &#8212; the impossibly fabulous offspring of Magic and Cookie &#8212; had a little kiki with Howard Bragman on the latest episode of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GwistTV?feature=watch" target="_blank"><em>Gwissues</em></a>.</p>
<p>Giving props to Ellen, Anderson Cooper (&#8220;he&#8217;s everything&#8221;) and RuPaul, the NYU junior talks about the aftermath of his public &#8220;outing&#8221; &#8212; basically, haters gon&#8217; hate &#8212; as well as coming into his own and coming out to his parents.</p>
<p>“I told her how I was feeling and she obviously told me that she had known and always would love me anyway. The same thing happened with my dad like a year or so later,” he said. “Everyone has to get used to it. No parent is prepared 100 percent and fully for something like that. We all had to work and move forward.”</p>
<p>EJ also clarifies that when TMZ ambushed him, he was hanging out on the Sunset Strip not with his <em>boyfriend</em> but rather his <em>best friend</em> &#8212; they just like holding hands sometimes, you guys!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/new-zealand-set-to-legalise-gay-marriage-354684" target="_blank">Agence France Presse</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>A bill that amends the 1955 Marriage Act to describe marriage as a union of two people regardless of their sex, sexuality or how they choose to identify their gender will have its third and final reading in parliament late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The proposal is set to pass convincingly after receiving widespread support during two previous debates &#8211; including backing from Prime Minister John Key &#8211; with the most recent vote last month running at 77 votes for and 43 against.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Australia rejected a similar proposal last September, New Zealand stands to be the first Asia-Pacific country to legalize gay marriage. The island nation decriminalized homosexuality in 1985 and has had civil unions since 2005.</p>
<p>Last week Uruguay became the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/uruguay-becomes-12th-country-in-the-world-to-legalize-gay-marriage-20130411/" target="_blank">12th nation</a> to legalize gay marriage, while England and France are steadily making their way down the aisle this year as well. So we&#8217;re going to say what everyone is thinking: global gift registry.</p>
<p>Gay kiwis can start making it officially official some time <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/mps-make-final-vote-gay-marriage-bill-5406392" target="_blank">in August</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-04/" rel="attachment wp-att-258580"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-258580" alt="dragrace e11 04" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-04-670x335.jpg" width="650" height="325" /></a></p>
<p>So when my straight friends (ok, these two straight guys sitting next to me at a diner last week) kept talking about the Final Four, it turns out they weren’t referencing this momentous episode. Their loss. The weeks of sweat, shade, and squirping have narrowed the field to the quarrelsome quartet of Rolaskatox and Jinkx.</p>
<p>Roxxxy spends the first segment establishing herself as the scholar of the group. First, she lays out the cogent argument that she’s here to win, while Coco was on <i>RuPaul’s Settle-The-Drama-With-Your-Ex-Best-Friend Race</i>. It’s an idiotic assessment of the situation, particularly because Alyssa and Coco weren’t aware that they’d be on the show together, but whatever. For her next feat of mental prowess, she suggests that winning will be made easier if she just lights all of Jinkx’s costumes on fire. Sportsmanlike <i>and</i> subtle. Third, she sagely advises Jinkx and Alaska that they can’t possibly take the crown because they haven’t had to lip sync yet! So wait, the key to winning is losing? This outlook explains much of Roxxxy’s past performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-01/" rel="attachment wp-att-258577"><img class="size-full wp-image-258577 alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 01" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-01.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Suddenly, a pheromone is released into the air and the contestants are filled with bloodlust. Luckily, SheMail interrupts before the verbal attacks can turn physical. (Alaska, who proved last week that she has Slayer Strength, would probably have welcomed this gladiator-style showdown.) The mini-challenge that follows is a repeat of the season 4 puppet show: each queen is asked to mock a felt mock-up of another competitor. Roxxxy is thrilled because <i>this</i> is her opportunity to make fun of Jinkx (I mean, she’s really been holding back), but her inability to mask her disdain with even a thin layer of humor ends up tanking her skit. The win goes to Alaska, whose mini-Andrews is like a fabulous military drone that drops layers and catchphrases instead of bombs.</p>
<p>Victory earns her fifteen extra seconds of candy shopping for the week’s main event, the Sugar Ball. Ru demands three separate looks: Super Duper Sweet Sixteen, Sugar Mama Executive Realness, and Candy Couture Edible Eleganza. As a former fat kid, I had trouble watching four people fill baskets with free sweets knowing that most of it wouldn’t even get eaten. Like, sure, everyone will nibble here and there, but mostly those delicious treats are going to get crammed into sweaty armpits and plastered over tucked wangs. It makes me want to pour out a Yoo-hoo for my fallen homies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-02/" rel="attachment wp-att-258578"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258578" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 02" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-02.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>As construction begins, everyone immediately pounces on Jinkx’s antlers as ridiculous, because the rest of them are just <i>regular</i> men impersonating women by covering themselves in sugary snacks. Ru, on the other hand, is more concerned with her plan to serve a vintage look after the judges have so often asked for something contemporary. Roxxxy also gets questioned during the workroom visit and makes her first smart move of the day (of the season?) by taking the feedback and demolishing the whole look on the spot. If Ru doesn’t like it today, she’s not gonna like it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Since the girls are all scrambling to turn their confections into costumes, Ru thinks it’s a good moment to throw down one last, teeny little request: she’d like for them to weakly perform a crappy number that neither its participants nor its audience will enjoy. Just to make sure that coffin is good and nailed shut, she hands choreography responsibilities to Alaska, who has the innate grace of a swan duct taped to a cinder block. Are you excited yet?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-03/" rel="attachment wp-att-258579"><img class="size-full wp-image-258579 alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 03" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-03.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Rehearsal is, of course, a mess. Everyone’s already mad at Jinkx for having made so much noise during sewing time, but no one had the guts to say anything while she was holding a hammer. (Those arson comments might not have been jokes; she needed to arm herself.) But now that the only weapon available is a cardboard lollipop, Roxxxy is perfectly comfortable firing off a few choice barbs. There’s precious little dancing being done, and any sane or merciful person would do us all a favor and let this song die a peaceful, private death. No such person exists on the <i>Drag Race</i> editing staff, apparently.</p>
<p>Guest judge Bob Mackie deserves better than the limpid pageantry they eventually devise. (I’m less worried about subjecting Marg Helgenberger to such a display. What is she even doing here?) At least it’s over with merciful speed so that we can get to the ball already. Cinderella&#8217;s fairy godmother gave her until midnight, but Logo&#8217;s cutting us off at 10pm Eastern, so let&#8217;s move it right along, shall we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-05/" rel="attachment wp-att-258581"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258581" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 05" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-05.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Despite a rail thin frame suggesting that she never eats sugar, or anything else for that matter, Alaska sets the bar impressively high. Her teenage look is simple but accurate; her stash of Party City props lends hard hat realness to her short-haired executive ensemble; and her cotton candy couture earns praise for being the only dress of the night that was obviously made from sweets. Though her creation was literally falling apart backstage, it propels her to another win.</p>
<p>Jinkx, unfortunately, is like a cancer-causing artificial sweetener before a panel of FDA evaluators. Her pubescent garb gets clocked as practically menopausal (though, to be fair, she was warned about that), while her McQueen aspirations are undercut by her McDonald’s budget. She’ll be joined in the bottom two by Detox, who is too consistently bitter to integrate candy into her outfits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-07/" rel="attachment wp-att-258583"><img class="size-full wp-image-258583 alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 07" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-07.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected RuPaul to choose an Yma Sumac song for her girls to perform, but it happens and it is glorious. The lip sync is almost too close to call because both of the queens on the chopping block are known for their offbeat stylings and each commits fully to selling the space opera shenanigans. In the end, though, you just can’t out-crazy a narcoleptic, aquaphobic, Broadway-bound MILF. The show finishes Detox and begins its commitment to sobriety. One day at a time, y’all.</p>
<p>To celebrate this victory over addiction, let’s hand out some <b>Award Awards</b>!</p>
<p>Bob Mackie deserves top honors in all settings, but tonight he wins the <b>Marilyn Milian Sass-Judgin’ Guff Gavel</b> for offering up the season’s most spectacular quote: “From the crotch down, she’s a star.” Never has someone been simultaneously praised and eviscerated with such efficiency.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/the-rupauls-drag-race-recap-cavity-search-20130416/dragrace-e11-06/" rel="attachment wp-att-258582"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258582" style="margin: 10px;" alt="dragrace e11 06" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/dragrace-e11-06.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>To Jinkx Monsoon, I present a <b>Lifetime Supply of Jell-O Pudding Pops</b>, because those were some Cosby-grade facial contortions she was throwing down, <i>ya see</i>?</p>
<p>And lastly, I give Detox the <b>Willam Memorial Maxed-Out Credit Card</b> for her ability to buy nice clothes. Shouldn&#8217;t have wished quite so hard for that sewing challenge, huh?</p>
<p><b>ON UNTUCKED:</b> You’re not going to believe this, but Roxxxy threw shade at Jinkx! I know, take a moment to collect yourself. Then everyone played with puppet renditions of the panel regulars. Then they all said what they value about each other (not always convincingly). The end.</p>

And yesterday&#8217;s bombing at the Boston Marathon is no different.</p>
<p>At 2:30 Monday afternoon, two explosions went off near the end of the annual marathon, the world&#8217;s oldest, which had gathered some 23,000 runners this year alone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/us/boston-marathon-explosions/index.html" target="_blank">According to CNN</a>, three people &#8212; including an 8-year-old boy &#8212; were killed, while at least 144 were hospitalized. Of those, 17 are in critical condition, 25 are in serious condition and at least eight of the patients are children. Numerous victims had to have their limbs amputated.</p>
<p>Police have no suspects in custody, but federal authorities are classifying it as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will get to the bottom of this,” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/explosions-reported-at-site-of-boston-marathon.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">President Obama said</a>, speaking from the White House. “We will find who did this, and we will find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups will feel the full weight of justice.”</p>
<p>In response, the WBC <a href="https://twitter.com/WBCSays" target="_blank">filled their Twitter feed</a> with the vitriol we have all come to expect and know by now that is best to simply ignore. Just a taste of their specific brand of hate:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>In light of today&#8217;s events, I must again ask: How is that fag marriage idea working out for you, America?!?! <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23oops">#oops</a>! <a title="http://twitter.com/WBCsigns/status/323973590942904321/photo/1" href="http://t.co/jPlKTHgl7P">twitter.com/WBCsigns/statu…</a></p>
<p>— Westboro Baptist (@WBCSays) <a href="https://twitter.com/WBCSays/status/323974850521726977">April 16, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boston Pride chose a different route and sent <a href="http://www.bostonpride.org/2013/04/boston-pride-sends-its-thoughts-to-the-boston-marathon-community/" target="_blank">a message</a> of hope and support to those affected by the explosion:</p>
<blockquote><p>As members of a community that loves and cherishes the city of Boston, our thoughts are with those impacted by today’s tragedy at the Boston Marathon – those who were injured or killed, the runners, the Boston Athletic Association, residents, spectators, and others. If you are looking for someone that was at the Boston Marathon you can call The Mayor’s Hotline at 617.635.4500. Also, if you saw something or have any information that could help please call the TIP LINE at 1.800.494.TIPS (8477).</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people have <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/boston-marathon-tragedy-met-with-amazing-acts-of-kindness" target="_blank">opened up their homes</a> and are offering help anyway they can, including Google, which has set up a <a href="http://google.org/personfinder/2013-boston-explosions/" target="_blank">Person Finder</a> for those looking for or having found someone lost in the resulting confusion.</p>
<p>Westboro can continue their neverending diatribe against &#8220;fag marriage&#8221; but their calls fall on increasingly deaf &#8212; and frankly, fed-up &#8212; ears.</p>
<p>Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of the bombing.</p>

<p>Calvin Harris returns with a new music video for the song, &#8220;I Need Your Love&#8221;, featuring vocals by Ellie Goulding. While the video is pretty basic &#8211; shots of a luxurious beach town, people on motorcycles, Ellie rolling around in a bed &#8211; it&#8217;s the shots of Calvin that are a nice surprise. He continues to look good with the adorkable sensibility.</p>

<p>A teenage girl was <a href="http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/teenage-girl-injured-in-attack-by-teen-boys-at-new-brighton-bus-stop-1.1236067" target="_blank">attacked</a> by a group of boys in what is being treated by the police as a possible hate crime. The girl, whose identity is being withheld at her family&#8217;s request, was punched and kicked while getting homophobic slurs shouted at her. The victim suffered several injuries include a cuts on her face and a black eye that has swollen shut.</p>
<p>The crime took place in New Brighton, a neighborhood in Calgary.</p>
<div>
<p>&#8220;(I’m) pretty shaken up, it&#8217;s hard not to be scared,&#8221; the victim <a href="http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/teenage-girl-injured-in-attack-by-teen-boys-at-new-brighton-bus-stop-1.1236067" target="_blank">tells</a> CTV News. &#8220;This is my neighborhood and I’ve always felt safe in it and now I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly this is the not the first time she&#8217;s been the target of abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had people throw things at me and play ‘pick on the lesbian on the bus’, and put gum in my hair but nobody has physically assaulted me until now,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Local authorities and the CPS Hate Crimes Unit are investigating the attack.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/student-studying.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-258497" alt="student-studying" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/student-studying-360x239.jpg" width="360" height="239" /></a>In an effort to provide financial aide to college students struggling with a lack of familial support, The University of Missouri Kansas City offers a unique need-based scholarship—the PRIDE Empowerment Scholarship—for gay <i>and</i> straight students who have been &#8220;experiencing financial difficulty due to loss of support from family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eight students have been awarded the scholarship since it was announced four years ago, and this year, Caleb-Michael Files, 21, is one of the lucky few to receive it. &#8220;Gay students, especially, have issues with coming out and support,” he said. “My parents aren’t in the picture. My guardians aren’t in the picture.”</p>
<p>Files also says without the help of the scholarship, he may have been forced to sacrifice his education to working 60-80 hour weeks in order to support himself.</p>
<p>Every student eligible for the new scholarship is assessed individually, and 2013 unsurprisingly brought in <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/04/15/us-university-sets-up-scholarship-to-support-gay-students-and-straight-allies/">the highest number</a> of applicants in the program&#8217;s four-year lifespan. &#8220;This year was the greatest need we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Assistant Vice Chancellor for Diversity Kristi Ryujin. &#8220;We have a long way to go still.&#8221;</p>
<p>We can only imagine the thousands of gay youth in America desperately in need of a scholarship program like this. How long will it take before other universities start following suit?</p>

<p>Last night at the MTV Movie Awards, RuPaul showed up with some surprising arm candy: <a href="http://www.queerty.com/4-potential-covers-for-alyssa-edwards-memoir-20130407/" target="_blank">Alyssa Edwards.</a> The queen was eliminated a few weeks ago but she <a href="http://www.queerty.com/drag-queens-logos-newnownext-awards-20130414/" target="_blank">popped</a> up at both MTV&#8217;s award show and Logo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.queerty.com/rupaul-newnownext-20130415/" target="_blank">NewNowNext Awards</a> (airing after <em>RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race</em>) over the past weekend.</p>
<p>On Twitter, a fan asked why Ru had chosen to walk the red carpet with the former Miss Gay America. Ru <a href="https://twitter.com/RuPaul/status/323792075256627201" target="_blank">responded</a> that she was the executive producer of her new spin-off show. Reps at LOGO and VH1 did not confirm whether or not this information was true. So the mystery remains, at least for now, if the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/rupauls-drag-race-non-recap-the-alyssa-edwards-super-post-20130326/" target="_blank">girl who gives all the face</a> will be seen on TV again.</p>

Is it possible she&#8217;s getting her own show? What would it be about &#8211; her on the pageant circuit, a dissection of all her faces, an odd couple show with Coco? And more importantly, would you watch?</p>

<p>Andrew Rannells was looking dapper in Calvin Klein at Logo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newnownext.com/andrew-rannells-talks-getting-naked-on-girls-logo-newnownext-awards/04/2013/">NewNowNext Awards</a> this weekend. Though the red carpet seemed to be a chaotic whirlwind of legit celebrities, <i>Drag Race</i> alum Willam Belli managed to snatch him for a couple minutes to chat about his on-screen ass debut in <i>Girls</i>, and whether or not he plans on returning to Broadway.</p>
<p>Not sure why Andrew&#8217;s behind is a &#8220;triumph for our community,&#8221; but we&#8217;ll take it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/01/pat-brady.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-240714 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/01/pat-brady.png" width="280" height="195" /></a>Illinois GOP party chair Pat Brady can say that being a Republican official who supports marriage equality won&#8217;t get you fired. Unfortunately, he can probably also say goodbye to his job in any case.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, conservatives infuriated at Brady&#8217;s marriage  position <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-13/news/chi-illinois-republicans-fail-to-oust-party-chairman-over-gay-marriage-20130413_1_party-chairman-brady-state-central-committee">tried desperately to get him removed as head of the state party but failed</a> to get the three-fifths majority they needed.</p>
<p>After the three hour closed-door session, Brady told reporters, &#8220;I&#8217;m still here,&#8221; but for how much longer is an open question.</p>
<p>This is the second time conservatives moved to get rid of Brady, specifically because of <a href="http://www.queerty.com/chairman-of-illinois-repulican-party-supports-state-gay-marriage-bill-20130103/">his support for marriage equality</a>. This time, however, the party apparatchiks set up a planning succession committee, which is a nice way of saying to Brady &#8212; there&#8217;s the door, and you know how to use it.</p>
<p>The failure to remove him gives Brady a chance to say he won and <a href="http://capitolfax.com/2013/04/15/brady-retained-but-will-likely-step-down/">then resign on his own terms</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s about addition and not subtraction,” Brady told reporters, “and if we come off as mean-spirited or angry or too dogmatic, then we don’t attract people to the party.”</p>
<p>Just to prove Brady&#8217;s point about fifty right wingers banged on the doors of the meeting and chanted &#8220;We are the party.&#8221; It&#8217;s a party we&#8217;re glad we missed.</p>

<p>Props to <a href="http://deadspin.com/will-johnson-responds-to-alleged-gay-slur-with-gorgeous-472926863">NBC Sports</a> for catching this douchebag in action, because without video proof, there probably wouldn&#8217;t have been consequences.</p>
<p>Gordon was later escorted off the field to the locker room (for an unrelated reason), and didn&#8217;t get to see the incredible game-winning goal scored by Johnson later in the night.</p>
<p>This is the second time gay slurs have been directed at Johnson on the filed (most likely because his teammates can&#8217;t handle <a href="http://static.foxsports.com/content/fsc/img/2011/05/29/ucl_streak_over_pi_rf_052811_2011052902205319_660_320.JPG" target="_blank">his <em>sexiness</em></a>), the first time resulted in a three-game suspension for Seattle Sounders&#8217; Marc Burch.</p>
<p>Gordon <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/04/15/san-jose-earthquakes-forward-alan-gordon-issues-statement-regarding-alleged-">responded</a> to the incident, issuing a half-assed apology that&#8217;ll make you yawn:</p>
<p id="paragraph3">&#8220;I sincerely apologize for what I said in our game tonight. Although I said it in the heat of the moment, that language has no place in our game. That is not my character, but there is still no excuse for saying what I said. I made a mistake and I accept full responsibility for my actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tossing &#8220;faggot&#8221; around is not in your character, <i>why</i> did you say it in the first place?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s episode of Marriage News Watch: we&#8217;re a quarter of the way through the year, and it looks like Delaware and Rhode Island could be the first two states to cross the marriage-equality line in 2013.</p>
<p>Both states are rocketing towards a vote on marriage equality bills &#8212; it could happen as soon as next week. Polling looks good in both states &#8212; plus, yet another national poll shows an increase in support.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s a bunch of big international news: Uruguay became the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/uruguay-becomes-12th-country-in-the-world-to-legalize-gay-marriage-20130411/" target="_blank">12th nation</a> to legalize gay marriage while France is <a href="http://www.queerty.com/french-senate-passes-gay-marriage-couples-to-wed-by-summer-20130412/" target="_blank">sooooo close</a> and Colombia&#8217;s quickly catching up.</p>

<p>The rainbow crosswalk, installed on Sydney&#8217;s Oxford Street to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the city&#8217;s annual Mardi Gras gay pride festival <a href="http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/rainbow-crossings-look-set-go-ahead-sydneys-gay-village030113">back in January</a>, cost the city approximately AU$75,000 to install and AU$30,000 to destroy. It&#8217;s no coincidence the most expensive sidewalk in the Eastern hemisphere also happened to be <i>extremely</i> <em>gay</em>.</p>
<p><i>Gay Star News</i> <a href="http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/guerrilla-rainbow-crossings-appear-all-over-sydney140413">reports that</a> Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore wasn&#8217;t aware of the crosswalk&#8217;s scheduled demise, though it has most likely been removed due to it&#8217;s hazardous status. Duncan Gay, New South Wales Minister for Roads and Ports, claims the colorful road strip became problematic when &#8220;people had stopped to photograph themselves on the crossing when traffic was stopped at the lights.&#8221; See what you&#8217;ve done, tourists? You ruined it for everyone!</p>
<p>In true Aussie fashion, locals have begun painting their own makeshift rainbow ways across the town, sparking a movement <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DIYrainbowcrossings">on Facebook</a> reaching countries as far as Africa and North America.</p>
<p>The page, which now has over 15,000 &#8220;likes,&#8221; encourages fans to paint their own &#8220;DIY Rainbow Crossings&#8221; and share photos. Here are some of our favorites:</p>

<p>News of Gorley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-man-arrested-at-hospital-after-refusing-to-leave-bedridden-partner-20130411/" target="_blank">arrest</a> last week after refusing to leave his partner&#8217;s side at Kansas City, Missouri&#8217;s Research Medical Center quickly turned to outrage as <a href="http://www.queerty.com/more-details-emerge-about-gay-mans-arrest-at-hospital-20130412/" target="_blank">more</a> details <a href="http://www.queerty.com/watch-men-involved-in-kansas-city-hospital-arrest-discuss-incident-20130413/" target="_blank">emerged</a> regarding the incident.</p>
<p>Hospital workers allegedly refused to recognize Gorley&#8217;s power of attorney and he was forcibly removed from the premises following an altercation with Mansell&#8217;s brother, Lee, resulting in physical injury.</p>
<p>With a goal of $5000, so far the fund has raised a little over $1,800 from 39 people in the past 3 days. Brown explained the idea behind the fund to <a href="http://thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/new-details-on-extent-of-injuries-in-missouri-police-brutality-of-man-visiting-husband-in-hospital/news/2013/04/14/65179" target="_blank">The New Civil Rights Movement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are going to use the money to fund Roger and Allen’s legal defense. Any money left over will be split among the LGBT organizations that have helped us during this traumatic injustice. We only want the hospital to apologize for what they did, re-educate their staff as to the proper procedure, educate their staff, including security, as to the current laws in place to protect individuals/ couples who identify within the LGBTQQIAA movement, and on a national level ensure every police department and medical establishment educates their staff as to what their regulations are and how they need to coincide with the current laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Research Medical Center has yet to issue an apology or admit to any wrongdoing, while federal officials have <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-officials-aim-for-speedy-response-to-missouri-hospit" target="_blank">launched an investigation</a> into the incident.</p>
<p><em>You can donate to Roger and Allen&#8217;s legal fund <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/2kofr8" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>- For some of us, MTV&#8217;s <em>Undressed</em> was the closest thing to getting laid while in high school.

<p>- Speaking of MTV, their other, less music-y celeb humpfest masquerading as an awards show was last night, hosted by the inimitable <strong>Rebel Wilson</strong>. <em>The Avengers</em> won movie of the year so that should give you an idea of the <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2013/winners.jhtml" target="_blank">caliber of winners</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/can-you-be-fired-for-being-gay-in-one-of-these-states-20130415/fired-for-being-gay-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-258371"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258371" alt="fired-for-being-gay-1" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/fired-for-being-gay-1.jpg" width="500" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>According to this map, you can be fired for being gay in any one of these 29 states, however, the situation is a bit more complicated than that. Okay, a lot more.</p>
<p>While the 29 states in red lack statewide laws protecting employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, employers can&#8217;t necessarily go around firing folks for being L,G,B or T.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/sexuality/firedforbeinggay.asp" target="_blank">Snopes.com</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of those red states have laws which protect public (i.e. government) employee from sexual orientation discrimination (but not those who work in the private sector), some of those states have laws at county or city levels which protect employees in those local areas from such discrimination, and some of those states protect public employees from employment discrimination through means other than laws (e.g., executive orders, administrative orders, personnel regulations).</p></blockquote>
<p>Maps like these paint a more accurate, and colorful, picture of how employment discrimination works in the U.S.:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.queerty.com/can-you-be-fired-for-being-gay-in-one-of-these-states-20130415/fired-for-being-gay-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-258373"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-258373" alt="fired-for-being-gay-2" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/fired-for-being-gay-2-670x547.png" width="585" height="477" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/can-you-be-fired-for-being-gay-in-one-of-these-states-20130415/fired-for-being-gay-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-258374"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258374" alt="fired-for-being-gay-3" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/fired-for-being-gay-3.jpg" width="557" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>And they might also explain why gay marriage may be <a href="http://www.queerty.com/five-reasons-why-marriage-equality-is-easier-to-support-than-enda-20130409/" target="_blank">easier to support</a> than the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, since there are fewer colors to wrap your head around:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/can-you-be-fired-for-being-gay-in-one-of-these-states-20130415/states-gay-marriage/" rel="attachment wp-att-258375"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258375" alt="states-gay-marriage" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/states-gay-marriage.jpg" width="554" height="619" /></a><span style="font-size: x-small;">Source: Freedom to Marry</span></p>
<p>Of course, if everything was all one color &#8212; the color of freedom &#8212; we&#8217;d all be better off. The color of freedom, by the way&#8230;is <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/goodbye_bafana/" target="_blank">a film</a> no one bothered to see from 2007.</p>

<div class="giantquote">In December, Scalia <a href="http://www.queerty.com/scotus-judge-antonin-scalia-equate-gays-with-murderers-20121211/" target="_blank">spoke at Princeton University</a>, where I am a freshman, and I asked him about language he used in past decisions involving gay rights — language that I, as a gay man, found extraordinarily offensive&#8230;.I hadn&#8217;t really expected Scalia to apologize for his language. He has been remarkably consistent over his judicial career. Still, I had hoped, and continue to hope, that my question might lead Scalia to think about the language he uses in the soon-to-be-decided cases of U.S. vs. Windsor and Hollingsworth vs. Perry, which will determine the fates, respectively, of the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California&#8217;s Proposition 8. I know from personal experience that poisonous language like Scalia&#8217;s can be devastatingly hurtful.&#8221;</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/ireland-gay-marriage-approved-constitutional-convention-20130415/gay-shamrock/" rel="attachment wp-att-258356"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-258356" style="margin: 10px;" alt="gay-shamrock" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/gay-shamrock.jpg" width="300" height="206" /></a>Over two years after Ireland legalized civil partnerships, a constitutional convention consisting of one-third politicians and two-thirds ordinary citizens has voted in favor of extending marriage rights to same-sex couples.</p>
<p>Of the <a href="www.rte.ie/news/2013/0414/381286-constitutional-convention/" target="_blank">nearly 100 participants</a>, 79 voted in favor of gay marriage, 19 against and the rest expressing no opinion. The convention has recommended a referendum to the government, which has promised to hold a debate and issue a response within four months.</p>
<p>According to <em><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/constitutional-convention-backs-extension-of-marriage-rights-to-same-sex-couples-1.1359910" target="_blank">The Irish Times</a>, </em>the convention also recommended that the government pass laws &#8220;incorporating changed arrangements in regard to the parentage, guardianship and the upbringing of children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s LGBT advocacy groups hailed the convention&#8217;s vote as &#8220;an historic step&#8221; in a joint statement by Marriage Equality, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN) and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a major milestone on the remarkable journey to full constitutional protection for lesbian and gay people and families in Ireland,&#8221; said GLEN director Brian Sheehan. &#8220;It builds on the extraordinary progress we have achieved over the last 20 years, and clearly demonstrates that Ireland is ready to take the next step to complete that remarkable journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Irish Catholic Bishops Conference, however, warned that same-sex marriage would make the roles of mothers and fathers completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the result of the constitutional convention is disappointing, only the people of Ireland can amend the constitution,&#8221; a spokesman for the Catholic Communications Office said. &#8220;The Catholic church will continue to promote and seek protection for the uniqueness of marriage between a woman and a man, the nature of which best serves children and our society.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-nba-exec-rick-welts-rebounds-from-phoenix-suns-with-new-gig-20110928/" target="_blank">Openly gay</a> former Phoenix Suns executive and current Golden State Warriors president Rick Welts <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-11/gay-pro-athletes-get-backing-from-nike-to-nhl-as-sponsors-await.html" target="_blank">told Bloomberg</a> that Nike is ready to just do it with the first athlete to come out.</p>
<p>“They made it clear to me Nike would embrace it,” Welts said. “The player who does it, they’re going to be amazed at the additional opportunities that are put on the table, not the ones that are taken off.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to Bob Witeck, 61, a gay-marketing strategist and corporate consultant, the first openly gay team-sport athlete &#8212; provided he’s a recognizable name &#8212; would earn millions in endorsements and speaking engagements from companies seeking to capture more of a U.S. lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender adult population whose annual buying power he pegs at almost $800 billion.</p>
<p>“We’ve passed the tipping point to where national advertisers are no longer afraid of the gay market,” said Mark Elderkin, chief executive officer of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Gay Ad Network.</p></blockquote>
<p>Former NBA player John Amaechi, who came out four years after retiring, said that <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nfl-forms-partnership-to-invite-gay-athletes-not-just-tolerate-them-20130412/" target="_blank">teams and leagues</a> are embracing the gays not (just) because it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but rather because it makes dollars and cents.</p>
<p>“Teams are not interested in diversity as a warm and fuzzy concept,” he explained. “It’s about winning. The business angle is the important angle.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Header_Main.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258281" alt="Header_Main" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Header_Main.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>Last week, Toronto-based graphic designer, Michael DePippo, <a href="http://michaeldepippo.com/?p=3131" target="_blank">posted</a> pictures of his beautiful marriage to his husband, Shaun Robinson. The theme of their wedding was &#8216;Love At First Flight&#8217; due to the fact that they met each other at the Toronto Pearson Airport on Christmas Eve. They planned and designed the entire wedding themselves with the help of a few friends and family. The result was a unique, very DIY-chic, and memorable event.</p>
<p><strong>The Invitations</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_3623.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258282" alt="MG_3623" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_3623.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The invites included a postcard and an airline ticket. Part of the postcards read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Unlike most love at first sight tales, ours began at an airport one Xmas eve. We each were traveling alone, set to see our families. We shared a few glances. An introduction. Then somewhere between poor weather conditions, fate and a cancelled flight, we found ourselves seated side-by-side as the plane took off. And that’s how we plan to stay.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The Logo</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MVDSSR_Logo3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258283" alt="MVDSSR_Logo3" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MVDSSR_Logo3.jpg" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Michael designed a logo based on the couple&#8217;s initials. Keeping with the theme, they look like airport codes.</p>
<p><strong>The Venue</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0177.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258284" alt="IMG_0177" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0177.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>They had an intimate ceremony inside the Market Kitchen located inside the St Lawrence Market in Toronto. On each seat was a custom designed airsickness bag in case anyone experienced &#8220;(e)motions.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_42394.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258285" alt="MG_42394" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_42394.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Ceremony</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1062.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258289" alt="MG_1062" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1062.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The couple&#8217;s officiant came dressed in a full pilot uniform and even customized the speech to stick with the theme of the wedding.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome aboard. I am your Captain, Daniel Brereton and on behalf of Shaun, Michael and the rest of the crew here at Love at First Flight airlines, I want to welcome you aboard flight 09/03/13 service from St. Lawrence Market in downtown Toronto to Who Knows Where! We are currently flying at about 249 ft above sea level, however our ultimate cruising altitude will depend on you….and how much you enjoy yourselves this evening.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Food</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0049.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258286" alt="IMG_0049" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/IMG_0049.jpg" width="500" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>Each guest was handed an inflight meal and Michael&#8217;s sister decorated the cupcakes.</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-14-at-12.23.22-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258287" alt="Screen Shot 2013-04-14 at 12.23.22 PM" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Screen-Shot-2013-04-14-at-12.23.22-PM.png" width="499" height="323" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Decorations</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_4665.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258288" alt="MG_4665" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_4665.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>To save on money, the couple bought greenery from IKEA and replanted them in mason jars. They also stacked old suitcases around the venue and created handcrafted paper flowers made of street maps.</p>
<p><strong>The Reception</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/header-Group.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258291" alt="header-Group" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/header-Group.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The reception included a passport station and a surprise appearance by Katinka Kature.</p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1529.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258293" alt="MG_1529" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_1529.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Wedding Favors</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_4357.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258290" alt="MG_4357" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/MG_4357.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>The favors included their favorite treat with a personal note.</p>
<p>It sounds like everyone had an amazing night including the happy couple. Michael goes into more detail about everything on his <a href="http://michaeldepippo.com/?p=3131" target="_blank">website</a>, which also includes information about their suits and their cat Abbey. (All photos by <a title="Toy Piano" href="http://toypianowedding.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Toy Piano</a>, images courtesy of Michael DePippo.)</p>

<p>The New Kids On The Block singer recently opened up to <a href="http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/" target="_blank"><em>Gay Times</em></a>, in which he talks about being outed by popstar and former beard, Tiffany. &#8221;I felt stupid having to make a public statement,&#8221; he says in the <a href="http://www.afterelton.com/2013/04/renault-jonathan-knight-new-kids-on-the-block-cher" target="_blank">new issue</a>. &#8220;Even when the band got back together in 2008, New Kids fans knew I was gay. Everyone did.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he may have lived an open life, it wasn&#8217;t quite public knowledge. And former outing king, Perez Hilton, was one of the ones that was determined to break the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perez tried to out me many times and I hate that guy for doing that. I was already gay and living a gay lifestyle but he wanted me to talk about it. Why? My brother and the rest of the guys don&#8217;t go on interviews saying &#8216;I&#8217;m straight&#8221; etc. so why do I need to just because I&#8217;m gay? People like him want me to talk about it to make themselves feel better. They think &#8216;I&#8217;m gay so I want to make sure everybody knows I&#8217;m not the only one out there.&#8217; I hate that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether or not that&#8217;s a misguided sentiment, we are happy that Jonathan is &#8216;officially&#8217; out and back in the music game. The group is currently on <a href="http://www.ticketnetwork.com/ticket/nkotb-events.aspx?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;gclid=CODPk8y-yrYCFUyY4Aod-UQAgg" target="_blank">tour</a> with Boyz II Men and 98 Degrees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after a West Hollywood attorney was declared brain dead after he exhibited symptoms of bacterial meningitis, residents of West Hollywood, Calif. have become increasingly concerned about a spread of the outbreak of the potentially deadly bacterial infection.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-258261 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="Brett_Shaad" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Brett_Shaad-360x384.jpg" width="252" height="269" /></p>
<p>On Friday Brett Shaad (pictured), a 33-year-old lawyer based in West Hollywood, was declared brain dead just days after friends described him as fit and healthy.</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brian Shaad, the brother of Brett Shaad, issued the following statement regarding the family’s decision to remove Brett from life support Saturday night:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight our family made the incredibly difficult decision to remove my brother Brett from life support. He died peacefully surrounded by our family and friends.</p>
<p>“Brett was an extraordinary person. He was a loving son, brother and grandson, an attorney with a deep passion for social justice, and a dear friend to so many people. We cannot believe that this wonderful person is gone. We love you Brett.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brett was being treated at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Beverly Hills, CA. He was removed from life support tonight at 6:24 pm and passed away at 6:42 pm.</p></blockquote>
<p>A spokesperson for the family, Elizabeth Ashford, issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Shaad family asks for privacy at this painful time, which has been made more devastating by irresponsible and inaccurate reports on the circumstances of Brett’s death. The family wants, and will pursue, answers for how and why this happened.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Queerty previously wrote:</p>
<p>As several media outlets have reported, Shaad attended the White Party in Palm Springs, Calif. during the weekend of March 30, but there has been no definite confirmation that he contracted the bacteria during that event.</p>
<p>The disturbing news comes a month after the New York City Department of Health, responding to a number of reported cases, <a href="http://www.queerty.com/nyc-dept-of-health-warns-gay-men-of-terrifying-meningitis-outbreak-urges-vaccination-20130309/" target="_blank">urged men who have intimate contact with other men</a> to get vaccinated against the bacteria. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/after-meningitis-death-in-los-angeles-gay-activists-urge-vigilance.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a> reports &#8220;at least 22 men have contracted meningitis in New York since 2010, 13 of them this year, and 7 have died.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a press conference on Friday, Dr. Maxine E. Liggins, with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, advised residents to be look for early signs of meningococcal meningitis. These include a severe headache and stiff neck. If detected early the disease, an infection of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord, can be treated with antibiotics. She noted that  it can also intensify quickly.</p>
<p>John Duran, a West Hollywood city councilman and one of the few openly H.I.V.-positive elected officials in the country, says in a statement: “The lesson we learned 30 years ago in the early days of H.I.V. and AIDS is that people were not alerted to what was going on and a lot of infections occurred that didn’t need to occur. So even with an isolated case here, we need to sound the alarms, especially given the cases in New York.”</p>
<p>News of Shaad&#8217;s infection has shaken residents of West Hollywood, who quickly mobilized to use forms of social media to raise awareness of the potential epidemic while city officials plan to partner with gay advocacy groups to post notices in West Hollywood gyms.</p>
<p><a href="http://lgbtpov.frontiersla.com/2013/04/12/bret-shaads-death-from-meningitis-causes-alarm-in-the-lgbt-community/" target="_blank">LGBTPOV</a>&#8216;s Karen Ocamb reports Duran as being concerned about the availability of sufficient vaccine to prevent the spread, if requested by people at risk. “We’re going to be working with our partners at the Gay and Lesbian Center, as well as the pharmacies in town, to make sure we have – if necessary – enough vaccines to get it out there to prevent the spread of meningitis,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>According to Huffington Post, Duran plans to introduce an urgency item on Monday to appropriate $20,000 for vaccines, for those who can&#8217;t afford them otherwise. &#8221;I think the county health department is dragging its feet and we don&#8217;t have the luxury of waiting,&#8221; he said. The vaccine will prevent invasive meningococcal disease from taking root but does not treat the disease if a person is already infected.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Queerty <a href="http://www.queerty.com/gay-man-arrested-at-hospital-after-refusing-to-leave-bedridden-partner-20130411/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Roger Gorley had been arrested and forcibly removed from the hospital room of his partner, Allen Mansell, following an altercation with Mansell&#8217;s brother Lee. The incident was widely reported as a gay rights issue, but now Lee says he is not homophobic and only wanted the best treatment for his brother, who suffers from severe depression.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/incident-at-research-medical-goes-viral-full-story-of-man-removed-from-sick-partners-beside" target="_blank">Kansas City&#8217;s KSHB</a> interviewed both Lee Mansell and Gorley about the incident, which began when Lee, unable to reach his brother, phoned 911 and had transported to Research Medical Center.</p>
<p>The two men began to argue over who had the rights to make medical decisions for Allen. Roger insists he wasn&#8217;t being disruptive, but objected to Lee having had Allen admitted to the hospital.&#8221;That would be like me going over to his house and taking his wife and hauling her off to the hospital without talking to him,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Gorley also says that during his heated discussion with Mansell, hospital security became violent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospital security came, and it started to hit me on my wrist&#8221; while he was holding onto Allen&#8217;s bed, Gorley says. &#8220;(They) hit me &#8230; because I was holding on, and they kept hitting and kept hitting and kept hitting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee Mansell says he&#8217;s not homophobic and loves Gorley as his own brother. He also reveals he&#8217;s received death threats since news of the incident went viral. &#8221;I&#8217;ve been called everything from a homophobe to things you can&#8217;t even say on TV,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had physical threats since someone was nice enough to post my email address online.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/anderson_cooper_01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-258245 alignright" style="margin: 10px;" alt="anderson_cooper_01" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/anderson_cooper_01-360x459.jpg" width="252" height="321" /></a><br />
It&#8217;s tough out there for a talk show host, but Anderson Cooper has an idea that might have saved his daytime program. While reflecting on <a href="http://www.queerty.com/anderson-coopers-daytime-talk-show-cancelled-20121031/" target="_blank">the demise of <em>Anderson Live</em></a> Cooper says he&#8217;s had fun developing a new set of skills, but he&#8217;d have been more comfortable emulating the format of <em>Live With Kelly and Michael</em>, rather than hosting solo a la Oprah.</p>
<p>As the show struggled for ratings, it was given a makeover during its second season, including a name change and a new set. In an unfortunate coincidence the series was cancelled just as it began to hit its stride when Cooper enlisted close pals such as Andy Cohen and Kathy Griffin to guest as co-hosts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really wanted a sidekick from the get-go,&#8221; Cooper tells <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-cooper-end-his-talk-436870?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20thr%2Fnews%20%28The%20Hollywood%20Reporter%20-%20Top%20Stories%29" target="_blank"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>. &#8220;That was something I really regret and we kind of realized early on, but you know, we weren’t able to make the change until the second year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the <a href="http://www.queerty.com/photos-madonna-anderson-cooper-smash-snooki-and-more-at-glaad-media-awards-20130318/" target="_blank">recent GLAAD Award-winner</a> describes the experience was &#8220;absolutely worthwhile,&#8221; adding, &#8220;I like learning new things and I like developing new skill sets and I like challenging myself in different ways, and I think the daytime show has done that, you know?&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can add Harrison Ford&#8217;s name to the list of celebrities wondering why the battle for same-sex marriage has been so lengthy and divisive. The superstar actor, best-known for blockbuster franchises such as the <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> films, is currently in movie theaters in <em>42</em>, the hit film which depicts the story of Jackie Robinson, the pioneering athlete responsible for integrating professional baseball.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-258239 alignright" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; cursor: default; border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;" alt="images" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/images1.jpeg" width="154" height="210" /></p>
<p>While promoting the film, Ford discussed parallels between Robinson’s struggle and the current battle for marriage equality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think there’s a metaphor you can reach for, according to your own interests and your own understanding and your own issues,&#8221; the actor <a href="http://www.metro.us/newyork/entertainment/2013/04/11/harrison-ford-opens-up/" target="_blank">tells Metro</a>. &#8220;But trying to create the best expression of the ideals — the most equal society, the best-regulated society, the best-behaving society — depend on attending to equality and inequity whenever it rears its ugly head. Certainly the marriage issue conveniently falls into that category.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ford also notes how public opinion on the issue has been rapidly changing over the past few years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things do change quickly at a tipping point, as it builds and it builds and it builds until there’s a moment where the balance of opinion, the weight of experience and the understanding comes to a point where the scales tip in the other direction,&#8221; he suggests. &#8220;We’re getting there, we’re getting there. You know, you would hope that it would have happened with less resistance. You would have hoped that everyone would get the point at the same time, but life’s not like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, come on, who would ever argue with Indy?</p>

<p>Matt R. Salmon, the gay son of <a href="http://www.queerty.com/az-congressman-with-gay-son-is-still-against-same-sex-marriage-20130331/" target="_blank">antigay Arizona Congressman Matt Salmon</a>, tells Anderson Cooper he still has a loving relationship with his parents and says, &#8221;I couldn&#8217;t expect my parents to fully accept me unless I accept them in their views.&#8221;</p>
<p>The younger Salmon stopped by <em>Anderson Cooper 360</em> says he hopes his father changes his position. I hope to get married some day and I hope I have his support,&#8221; he adds.<a href="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Salmon.png"><img class=" wp-image-258221 alignright" alt="Salmon" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Salmon-360x291.png" width="288" height="233" /></a></p>
<p>He also shares that he helped proofread a constitutional amendment written in part by his mother that stated marriage is between a man and a woman  because he was going through reparative therapy at the time and hoped to change to straight. &#8220;For me, it wasn&#8217;t really an issue,&#8221; says.</p>
<p>Asked by Cooper about a message for other young people whose conservative families don&#8217;t support their sexual orientation, Salmon says his family is a great example.</p>
<p>&#8220;My big hope is that people can look at my relationship with my parents and see that families can be conservative and have gay members and it doesn&#8217;t have to be this big ordeal. It doesn&#8217;t have to be fights and anger and hatred,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Salmon also reveals that he&#8217;d have no problem introducing his family to a boyfriend and that he thinks they&#8217;d be OK with meeting him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/lost-gay-bars-of-san-francisco-20130413/bandstand/" rel="attachment wp-att-258215"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-258215" alt="Bandstand" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Bandstand-670x447.jpg" width="650" height="433" /></a></p>
<p><strong>PHOTOS</strong>: There was a time when men &#8212; and some women &#8212; wore suits while drinking 35-cent whiskeys in bars with names such as Connie&#8217;s &#8220;Why Not?&#8221;, Cissy&#8217;s Saloon and The Purple Pickle. That time was San Francisco some 50, 60 years ago &#8212; before Ellen, before Elton, before Stonewall.</p>
<p>Mike Stabile from the <a href="http://queermuseum.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Pop-Up Queer Museum</a> set about mapping out these bars after pouring over the withered pages of defunct gay rags like <em>Vector</em>, <em>After Dark</em> and <em>David</em>, resulting in the <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=204308129084127659047.0004ae197e7ef9d21644a&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;ll=37.758844,-122.42642&amp;spn=0.094288,0.052295&amp;source=embed" target="_blank">Lost Gay Bars of San Francisco</a>.</p>
<p>While we certainly don&#8217;t yearn for the impromptu police raids and a life lived in the shadows, there&#8217;s something to be said about the gay old times depicted in these ads and photos from that &#8220;lost&#8221; era.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s also something to be said for this drink menu:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.queerty.com/lost-gay-bars-of-san-francisco-20130413/black-cat-menu-1950/" rel="attachment wp-att-258214"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258214" alt="Black-Cat-Menu-1950" src="http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2013/04/Black-Cat-Menu-1950.jpg" width="576" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>Those kids must have known how to party back then because a dollar and some change could probably get you <em>wrecked</em>.</p>

<p>Campana had unsuccessfully attempted suicide and was taken off life support last August.</p>
<p>According to his mother, Nancy, she was asked about his sexual activity including questions about whether or not he was gay and if he was sexually active or had a partner.</p>
<p>After confirming that he was both, Trillium Gift of Life said that they could not accept his organs.</p>
<p>Although upsetting, the decision didn&#8217;t violate Health Canada&#8217;s rules. In 2007, it had changed donation rules for sexually active gay men and injection drug users.</p>
<p>According to Health Canada policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gay man who had practiced abstinence for five years prior to organ donation would be considered an acceptable donor.</li>
<li>A heterosexual man who has had a single sexual encounter with a male within the past five years would not be considered an acceptable donor.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are similar to similar to donating blood, which limits who can donate to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV.</p>
<p>While Rocky&#8217;s friends understood the situation, Nancy found the news to be a shock.</p>
<p id="yui_3_4_1_2_1365808435018_46">&#8220;When I got off the phone to relay that to both [Rocky's father] Rob and a lot of Rocky&#8217;s friends &#8230; many of them broke down,&#8221; she <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/story/2013/04/12/wdr-rocky-run-organ-donation.html" target="_blank">told</a> CBC. &#8220;The gay ones said, &#8216;Nancy, we can&#8217;t donate blood; they&#8217;re not going to take our organs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Though not all are planning to let the rules stand. According to the CBC, petitions are being developed to challenge the new policies to make it easier for gay men to donate.</p>
