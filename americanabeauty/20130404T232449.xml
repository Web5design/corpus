<p>******</p>
<h1>Living in an RV</h1>
<p><em>originally posted October 2, 2012</em></p>
<p>You asked, and finally I deliver.</p>
<p>We have video upon video about towing the trailer, setting it up for travel, setting up utilities at the campground, and a tour of the space.</p>
<p>Go make some popcorn, this is going to take a while.<br />
I&#8217;ll wait. Go ahead.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re likely thinking, &#8220;How long could this really be?&#8221; Thirty minutes &#8211; seriously. It takes me nearly an hour to set up and another to pack up &#8211; for every leg of the trip. So consider yourself lucky with this abridged version. Another thing to be grateful for: while the film quality is feeble, YouTube has a magical &#8220;stabilize&#8221; button &#8211; otherwise you&#8217;d also be sea-sick.</p>
<h3>Hitching the Trailer to the SUV</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s truly incredible that 1. a single hitch tows 5,000 pounds of weight, and 2. that I can do all of these connections. At the beginning it took <em>forever</em> to undo a single clasp &#8211; now, it&#8217;s easy peasy.</p>
<p>I bought a gardening cushion, thinking I would sit on that vs the ground. Ha! A waste of money. Maybe if I encounter mud, but now I can do this without having to sit. Progress.</p>
<p>Now that it&#8217;s no longer 100 degree days, I don&#8217;t &#8220;glisten&#8221; quite as much as I did during set-up. But since I have to do this twice in one day: leaving campground A and going to campground B, I don&#8217;t shower that morning. Too much information? If you got grimy and your hands looked like a mechanic&#8217;s, you would wait, too.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qgp87-_0f8I?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>Bringing Civilization to Camping</h3>
<p>Each and every campsite has hookups for potable water, electricity, and plumbing. Glory be!</p>
<p>Plus you need to stabilize the trailer &#8211; think of adding training wheels to a bike. Otherwise the trailer would be a rockin&#8217; and no would come a knockin&#8217; when all you&#8217;re doing is washing dishes.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/VuXsrLyPqCo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Curious about the Mummenschanz reference? <a title="Mummenschanz" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lPHYpiR4JuM#!" target="_blank">Watch here.</a></p>
<h3>Prepping the Trailer for Towing</h3>
<p>Stuff goes flying when on the road. Think about exits off the highway that are round. There are signs (that you likely ignore) calling for 25mph. I follow those signs now. Tipping, shifting &#8211; these are not good words.</p>
<p>Railroad tracks: I hate them. Road construction with unfinished roads: not only are they cruel to my bladder, they also make things bounce in the trailer.</p>
<p>So before a trip, batten down the hatches. After one, look to see what fell and put it away. This is why I use plastic dishes &#8211; they can&#8217;t break.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/OpDA5ZO-Lkg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>More Room with the Touch of a Button</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s enough to tow 19 more feet; I don&#8217;t also need a &#8220;wide load&#8221; scenario. Enter the slide room. It&#8217;s compact for driving and when extended, adds much needed space.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/9KCv7ThwwG4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>Living in 184 Square Feet</h3>
<p>It feels much more spacious than that &#8211; perhaps because of the convex roof, the excellent use of storage, or pure denial.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/OUCuRBQCFGQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>Trailer Sweet Trailer</h3>
<p>There you have it! It&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s worth it. You commute, I pack up to tow. You wear fancy clothes, I have the option not to shower. You live in blissful ignorance about plumbing, I am unfortunately intimate with mine.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How does this reality fit with what you had in your imagination?<br />

<p>****</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s a Jewish Girl Like You Doing in a NASCAR Place Like This?</h1>
<p><em>originally posted June 12, 2012</em></p>
<p>It’s mandatory to visit something NASCAR when in Charlotte. My friends who live here weren’t aware of this rule, but I gleaned it from the tourism website that fixated on the sport.</p>
<h3><strong>NASCAR According to Paula</strong></h3>
<p>It’s admittedly odd that I chose to spend the day exploring the <a title="NASCAR Hall of Fame" href="http://www.nascarhall.com/" target="_blank">NASCAR Hall of Fame</a> and <a title="Charlotte Motor Speedway" href="http://www.charlottemotorspeedway.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte Motor Speedway</a>.</p>
<p>First of all, because I’m interested in sports about as much as I am in cultivating roach colonies.</p>
<p>And secondly, because my understanding of NASCAR is this: people drive super fast around an oval before massive crowds. Some fans are infield, where they can’t see anything but don’t care because they’re drunk. The drivers make gobs of money because they have cluttered sponsor stickers on their cars and jumpsuits. Women like this sport more than any other, and many have a crush on someone named Junior.</p>
<p>So why am I here? When in Rome… and Americana, baby!</p>
<h3><strong>It Doesn’t get more Americana than Moonshine</strong></h3>
<p>During Prohibition, folks made their own alcohol. No shock there. In the South it was called &#8220;moonshine&#8221; and the men who drove it to destinations and (hopefully) evaded police were &#8220;bootleggers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A successful bootlegger had to modify his car to be fast. Eventually the idea was borne to hold races among the bootleggers&#8230;the origins of NASCAR.</p>
<h3>The Thrill of the Race</h3>
<p>Forty-three cars drive 1.5 miles for 200 laps. The majority of the time they&#8217;re going 200 mph, then slow down to zero at the pit stop for 10 tire changes and re-fuels per race and rev back up again. The pit stop: 12.5 seconds. My average pit stop: 15 minutes. Unless of course, I have to<a title="When Putting Air in your Tires Becomes a Herculean Feat" href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/when-putting-air-in-your-tires-becomes-a-herculean-feat/" target="_blank"> put air in my tires.</a></p>
<p>Some intentional hits of other cars (boys will be boys), but mostly incredible maneuvering on a track that alternates between flat and pitched at an angle of 24%&#8211;three stories high. We drove that pitch in a Chevy van going 80 mph with no one else on the track. It was a rush, it was sideways, it would be insane with others on the track, too.</p>
<h3>How does this Apply to the Real World?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not good at math. Anyone surprised? No?</p>
<p>I have vivid memories of high school where I&#8217;d wonder how some formula or parabola would apply to the real world. NASCAR is a perfect example of how math does. The physics, geometry, and pure algebra are visible everywhere.  If only schools would find examples that fit interests, we could learn math so much better.</p>
<p>The car doors and the track walls are both made of Styrofoam so the cars bounce instead of absorb energy on a hit. Fewer casualties and injuries. Physics, anyone?</p>
<p>Cars go faster with less air in the tires, but too little air and there&#8217;s a blowout. You have to consider air pressure when cold vs hot&#8211;both of the tire in use and of the air temperature. Formulas.</p>
<p>Math at work in the real world.<br />
Where have you been impressed to find math in places you wouldn&#8217;t have thought it to be?</p>
<h3>Boom Town</h3>
<p>Concord NC, host to the Charlotte Motor Speedway, becomes the state&#8217;s third largest city on race day. The influx of staff and spectators is that significant! 160,000 people come to watch.</p>
<p><a href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0001.jpg"><img title="Charlotte Motor Speedway" alt="Charlotte Motor Speedway" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0001-1024x684.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em> Thank you to the friends and their colleagues who facilitated my complimentary ticket to the NASCAR Hall of Fame.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m officially on <a title="Sabbatical from my Sabbatical" href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/sabbatical-from-my-sabbatical/" target="_blank">Sabbatical</a>. BUT there were three experiences still to share. This is the last one&#8230; Up next: retro posts revisted.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Not a U2 fan, I hoped that <a title="Joshua Tree National Park" href="http://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm" target="_blank">Joshua Tree National Park</a> would still hold relevance for me. It did. Phew!</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s in a Name?</h3>
<p>For starters, it&#8217;s not a tree or a cactus&#8211;it&#8217;s a yucca.</p>
<p>Why named for Joshua? Mormons came upon the &#8220;tree&#8221; in the desert, with arms held high, and thought of the Biblical Joshua who went to Canaan at Moses&#8217; request to scout the land for settling after the 40 years awander in the desert. The tree looked like it was praying, as Joshua did, and now we have a name.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4132" alt="joshua tree arms raised" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/joshuas-arms-raised.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>Enjoy some more pretty Joshua Trees. Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>
[[Show as slideshow]]
<p>This flora reminds me of a muppet. As the yucca grows, the leaves on the trunk and branches dry out, leaving a crispy, shaggy texture.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4134" alt="joshua tree as muppet" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tree-as-muppet.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>I&#8217;ll See You Where the Deserts Meet</h3>
<p>Within the National Park, two deserts meet: the Colorado, which is dry and full of cacti; and the Mojave, which is where the Joshua Trees grow. Interesting to think about deserts having boundaries and merging with each other. But I suppose bodies of water do, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_4130" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4130 " alt="desert progression at joshua tree national park" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desert-progression.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Watching the desert landscape evolve throughout the park. Cacti and barren and then forests of Joshua Trees.  </em></p></div>
<div id="attachment_4135" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4135 " alt="yucca bloom" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/yucca-bloom.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Cactus blooms!</em></p></div>
<h3>What Big Boulders You Have!</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4128" alt="boulders at joshua tree national park" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/boulders.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>These boulders basically erupted from the ground! Molten liquid oozed up while the Earth&#8217;s crust moved and now there are clusters of rocks that appear&#8230;right there. They&#8217;re massive and daunting, and Flinstone-esque.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KIC7a-s1UyQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4131" alt="flintstones" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/flintstones.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>The regular ole rocks that litter the mountains remind me of the movie <em>The Neverending Story</em>. Think this is where pop culture drew inspiration?</p>
<div id="attachment_4133" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4133 " alt="joshua tree boulders and neverending story" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/neverendingsotyr_flickr.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of Flickr</em></p></div>
<p>I was excited to see the Joshua Trees, but didn&#8217;t know anything about the boulders. I actually enjoyed them more&#8211;for their variety and grandeur.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Which nature experience reminds you of a pop culture reference?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m officially on Sabbatical. BUT there were three experiences still to share. This is number two&#8230;</p>
<p>****</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4100" alt="DSC_0135" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0135.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p><a title="Saguaro National Park" href="http://www.nps.gov/sagu/index.htm" target="_blank">Saguaro National Park</a> is dedicated solely to one magnificent species of cactus.</p>
<p>Pollinated by bats and doves (intriguing), they&#8217;re also inhabited by woodpeckers and owls. The woodpeckers abuse the plant until it heals itself with a liquid that the birds turn into a hardened cocoon. Once the woodpeckers abandon the nest, owls roost in the holes!</p>
<div id="attachment_4095" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4095" alt="bird nest in saguaro" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bird-nest.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Left: a woodpecker hard at work; Middle: context for height; Right: postcard of an owl setting up home. </em></p></div>
<p>The largest cactus in the U.S., the saguaro takes a looooong time to grow. They start as seeds the size of a poppyseed. The odds are against them, though. In a 150-200 year lifetime, one plant might produce 40 million seeds. Nature is against the seeds, with only ONE likely to live to maturity!</p>
<p>To help that seed along, &#8220;nurse plants&#8221; protect from the elements and the critters. At some point it gets a little crowded.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4104" alt="nurse plant" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Slide13.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>Thirsty little suckers, they can absorb 200 gallons of water in a single rainfall&#8211;which satiates all year. That&#8217;s quite prudent since the desert only gets 12 inches of rain a year. The accordion pleats let the plant expand with water. By the time they&#8217;re 50 feet tall (as tall as they get), the reality of consisting of 85% water means that they can weigh 16,000 pounds!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4098" alt="up close look at a saguaro cactus" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/up-close.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>The spines do more than protect from predators&#8211;they also shade the saguaro&#8217;s skin!</p>
<div id="attachment_4101" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4101" alt="DSC_0153" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_0153.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Roots expand as far as the tree is tall.

<p>How long does it take to grow?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">1 year = 1/4 inch</span></li>
<li>15 years = 12 inches</li>
<li>30 years = flower and fruit (local American Indians consider the fruiting as the beginning of their new year)</li>
<li>50 years = 7 feet and it starts to grow arms (more surface area for photosynthesis and flowers, more flowers means more seeds)</li>
<li>100 years = 25 feet</li>
<li>150 years = 50 feet and 16,000 pounds</li>
<li>200 years = oldest they live</li>

<p>One in 200,000 saguaros grow in a curly fan. Scientists don&#8217;t know why, but know that it&#8217;s from sort of damage. I think they&#8217;re rather pretty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m officially on Sabbatical. BUT there were three experiences still to share. This is number one&#8230;</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Where do military planes go to die? Tucson Arizona. Specifically, the <a title="Airplane Boneyard" href="http://www.pimaair.org/view.php?pg=16" target="_blank">airplane boneyard</a> at Davis Monthan Airforce Base.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to come here ever since seeing the 1987 &#8220;hit movie&#8221; <a title="Can't Buy Me Love" href="http://youtu.be/taS5VBhF7J4" target="_blank"><em>Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love</em></a>.</p>
<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
<p>After WWII, the government faced a quandary: what to do with all the planes? One bomber came off the plant every 30 minutes and now they were back home.</p>
<p>Enter a storage facility in Arizona: chosen for the weather and soil. The hard-packed clay is rich with calcium, which means the planes can sit on the desert floor.  At its peak, the facility housed 6,000 planes after Vietnam.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4088" alt="airplane boneyard" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1662_499188661_o.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>Life in the Boneyard</h3>
<p>With 3,800 crafts on site, they&#8217;re here for three purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Flyable Hold&#8211;20% of the planes here will fly again. They&#8217;re simply in storage. The Vipers will be sent to <a title="A Most Terrifying Museum" href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/a-most-terrifying-museum/" target="_blank">White Sands Missile Range</a> and the Gulf of Mexico, transitioned to drones for &#8220;blank&#8221; missiles to have target practice. </span></li>
<li>Parts Reclamation&#8211;stripped as needed to repair operational planes.</li>
<li>Disposal&#8211;once fully stripped, they&#8217;re cut into parts. Those parts are melted and used to make circuit boards! The military base used to sell the carcass to nearby scrapyards, but policies changed after 9-11 and now they&#8217;re disassembled on-site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Protection from the Elements</h3>
<div id="attachment_4086" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4086" alt="cover seems" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cover-seems.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Spray latex protects against the sun, wind, and rodents. All seams are covered. </em></p></div>
<h3>Military Precision</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly well organized, and beautiful in the patterns and repetition. The planes are parked with precision&#8211;valets would be very happy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4087" alt="airplane boneyard from the sky" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/from-the-sky.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>A star on a plane indicates that the crew shot down an enemy aircraft. Earn five stars and you&#8217;re called an &#8220;ace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The planes are gorgeous and terrifying. Some sleek, some massive. Some slow, some <em>stealthy, </em>flying 15 miles above ground, at night, undetectable. It&#8217;s a sea of grey with sports of color, stars, and patriotism. Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>What Do Aircraft Do?</h3>
<p>Transport and bomb, test and train, search and destroy. Each plane has a letter that tells you its mission.</p>

<p>Have you ever been to a junkyard or boneyard? What did you learn?</p>
<p>Disclosure: these photos are from Flickr. My tour wasn&#8217;t allowed to leave the bus, I had an aisle seat, and the windows were shaded with an appliqué that still had air bubbles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now I know what it feels like to be a celebrity. Well, kinda.</p>
<p>I used to be annoyed by actors who &#8220;need&#8221; to take a year off after back-to-back films, or singers who &#8220;require&#8221; extended R&amp;R after a tour. I mean come on&#8211;we all work hard but celebrities have assistants to cook and run errands. I don&#8217;t have assistants, do you?</p>
<p>So when I reached a place of exhaustion&#8211;<em>from traveling</em>&#8211;it felt indulgent. My wise friends helped me identify what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I&#8217;ve been on the road 9.5 months and have driven over 18,000 miles.</span></li>
<li>90% of these days were spent exploring. While that&#8217;s gorgeous, fun, and inspiring, I&#8217;m over-stimulated.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">My skills now include way more plumbing tricks than I ever aspired to. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I&#8217;ve worked 30 hours/week on writing and photography&#8211;in addition to driving, cooking, cleaning, and adventuring.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>More than a Vacation</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s time to take a sabbatical from my sabbatical. It is not, however, time to return to Atlanta&#8211;there&#8217;s still so much to see, still some money, and still a desire to explore. I just need  a little R&amp;R.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m taking a month in the Los Angeles area. No sightseeing, no writing, no moving around. With a spot near the beach, I&#8217;ll rest, read, and recoup. Plus, a bounty of friends live here, and while they&#8217;re certainly strange, they&#8217;re not campground strangers.</p>
<h3>What about the Blog?</h3>
<p>Fret not, loyal readers. In the interim, I&#8217;ll post on MWF, re-running content from the beginning of this trip and the explorations that came before. It&#8217;ll keep you entertained and keep me in the search engines.</p>
<h3>Female Seeking Mail</h3>
<p>Even though &#8220;real life&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have interesting mail, I miss going to the mailbox every day. So&#8230;.if you reply in the comments and ask for my address, and if I personally know you, we can be pen pals through mid-April. If you send to me, I&#8217;ll send to you&#8211;I give good postcard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a friend asks if you want to go to the <a title="Ostrich Festival" href="http://www.ostrichfestival.com" target="_blank">Ostrich Festival</a>, the answer is always yes. A resounding yes!</p>
<p>So off went Susan, a floormate from freshman year of college, her two kids, and me. Chandler AZ&#8211;look out! We&#8217;re here to have some fun!</p>
<p>Rides that prove your age by how nauseous they make you, food that proves your age by how nauseous it makes you, and sideshows. Ahhhh, sideshows. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways&#8230;.</p>
<h3>Animals Were Meant to Race?</h3>
<p>I consciously quelled concerns about what these poor creatures endure in order to race for human enjoyment. And frankly, it was quite enjoyable. Mostly because emus, donkeys, and ostriches don&#8217;t want to go in a straight line, nor do they want to have humans on their backs, so there&#8217;s bobbing-and-weaving, falling-and-clamboring. And watching a man fall off the back of an ostrich is truly a site to behold! Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3>Trick Cowboy, Show Me Whatcha Got!</h3>
<p>Well, aside from a substantial belt buckle, this man has skills! He even has the sequin-adorned gun holster to prove it: he&#8217;s a champion pistol twirler (or some such thing), and his assistant is the 2012 world champion knife thrower. Shazzam. Now, do you think the festival circuit is what world champion knife throwers dream of? Maybe&#8230;.?</p>
<p>Lassos and rope tricks, cracking the whip (it breaks the sound barrier, that&#8217;s why it &#8220;cracks&#8221;) to cut down a piece of plastic held in a woman&#8217;s mouth, gun twirls, bits with a horse (pun), and knife throwing while she&#8217;s strapped onto a board and spinning, then he tosses water balloons and upside and rotating she shoots both of them.  I mean really!</p>
<p>This was exactly what I hoped it would be! Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3>A Freakshow, but not THAT kind of Freakshow</h3>
<p>No bearded ladies or people with genetics that insensitive people find funny. Nope&#8211;this was men wearing eyeliner and a woman doing unconscionable forms of acrobatics. And a lot of  things that look unduly painful. Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>
[[Show as slideshow]]
<h3>Why Ostriches?</h3>
<p>No clue. There&#8217;s an Ostrich Farm an hour down the road, so maybe that has something to do with it? Let&#8217;s not fret the details and just enjoy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4082" alt="ostrich" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_00071.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>Ostrich facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">They have two toes, vs all other birds who have three or four. </span></li>
<li>An ostrich will live to 50-75 years old!</li>
<li>An ostrich egg weighs the same as two dozen chicken eggs.</li>
<li>The egg hatches in 42 days.</li>
<li>The chick grows one foot per month until it&#8217;s 7-8 months old</li>
<li>Co-parenting: mom sits on the egg during the day, dad at night</li>
<li>There are 2 million ostriches worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to belief, they do not bury their heads in the sand. Let&#8217;s look to Wikipedia for insight into why we think that they do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This myth likely began with <a title="Pliny the Elder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (AD 23–79), who wrote that ostriches &#8220;imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed.&#8221; This may have been a misunderstanding of their sticking their heads in the sand to swallow sand and pebbles, or, as <a title="National Geographic Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society">National Geographic</a> suggests, of the defensive behavior of lying low, so that they may appear from a distance to have their head buried.<sup id="cite_ref-NationalGeog_38-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich#cite_note-NationalGeog-38"><br />
</a></sup></em></p>
<p>****</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best festival sideshow you&#8217;ve seen?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sedona AZ comes by its reputation as a groovy town quite rightfully. See, there are energy vortexes connected to four of the red rock formations.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4077" alt="setting" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/setting.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>1. they call them voretxes, not vortices. Just go with it.</p>
<p>2. much like a vortex of wind or water (or time), powerful&#8211;but invisible&#8211;forces are at play.</p>
<p>3. and although a vortex innately has strength, the Sedona energy forces are considered &#8220;subtle.&#8221; Evident throughout town in a general way, they are most profoundly felt at the specific spots.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>People connect with the Sedona energy because &#8220;the vortex energy is very similar to the subtle energy operating in the energy centers inside each person. If you are at all a sensitive person, it is easy to feel the energy at these vortexes.&#8221;*</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-g4Esc8x4u8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>What Happens?</h3>
<p>You access masculine, feminine, and m-f balanced energies. <a href="http://lovesedona.com/01.htm" target="_blank">Learn more. </a></p>
<h3>Maybe X Does Mark the Spot?</h3>
<p>Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t walk the whole trail. Again, no hat or water. But curious me wanted to see what others find. And they find spirals made of rocks, and cairns (stacks of rocks). Perhaps that&#8217;s the spot?</p>
<p>Click the pic to advance the slideshow. Photos courtesy of Flickr.</p>
[[Show as slideshow]]
<h3>Getting Closer</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s said that Juniper trees in particular respond to the vortex energy.  The stronger the energy in a given place, the more the branches twist. Not all that familiar with Juniper trees and their natural state vs energized, I went to Flickr and Bing. See for yourself.</p>
<div id="attachment_4075" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4075" alt="not sedona trees" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/not-sedona-trees.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Regular Juniper trees elsewhere in the world. Photos courtesy of Bing.com</em></p></div>
<div id="attachment_4076" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4076" alt="sedona trees_FLICKR" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sedona-trees_FLICKR.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Juniper trees around the Sedona Red Rocks and close to the vortex locations. Photos courtesy of Flickr. </em></p></div>
<h3>Snarky or Uneasy?</h3>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve written a rather questioning post about the vortexes. And yet&#8230;I did feel something. Calm and encompassing.</p>
<p>If I can consider <a title="Mt Ranier" href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm" target="_blank">Mt Ranier</a> or the<a title="Photos of Jerusalem Shuk" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/plonde/sets/72157628165062581/" target="_blank"> shuk in Jerusalem </a>my holy places for the way they make me feel, why<em> can&#8217;t</em> there be energy in Sedona?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Have you ever felt connected to a place? Uplifted by it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s stunning; plain and simple. And a surprisingly small <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm">National Park</a>. Out of the way, depending on which way you&#8217;re going, but worth the time.</p>
<h3>The Painted Desert</h3>
<p>Can&#8217;t be more appropriately named!</p>

<p>While gorgeous, it was also brutal the day I was there: not desert sun, but 33 degrees and incredibly strong wind. Out of the car, oooh, ahhh, take a picture, back in the car.</p>

<h3>The Petrified Forest</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s in the same place, and surprising in its own right. The trees lived in the Late Triassic Period, roughly 225 million years ago. Since then, they&#8217;ve colored and crystallized.</p>
<p>Signs, a movie, and guards at entrance-and-exit warn and ask you about taking the rocks-that-were-trees. They&#8217;re right there&#8211;it&#8217;s easy to understand the temptation. Slivers abound.  And so do ethics.</p>
