				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I&#8217;m officially on Sabbatical. BUT there were three experiences still to share. This is number one&#8230;</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Where do military planes go to die? Tucson Arizona. Specifically, the <a title="Airplane Boneyard" href="http://www.pimaair.org/view.php?pg=16" target="_blank">airplane boneyard</a> at Davis Monthan Airforce Base.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wanted to come here ever since seeing the 1987 &#8220;hit movie&#8221; <a title="Can't Buy Me Love" href="http://youtu.be/taS5VBhF7J4" target="_blank"><em>Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love</em></a>.</p>
<h3>In the Beginning</h3>
<p>After WWII, the government faced a quandary: what to do with all the planes? One bomber came off the plant every 30 minutes and now they were back home.</p>
<p>Enter a storage facility in Arizona: chosen for the weather and soil. The hard-packed clay is rich with calcium, which means the planes can sit on the desert floor.  At its peak, the facility housed 6,000 planes after Vietnam.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4088" alt="airplane boneyard" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_1662_499188661_o.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>Life in the Boneyard</h3>
<p>With 3,800 crafts on site, they&#8217;re here for three purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Flyable Hold&#8211;20% of the planes here will fly again. They&#8217;re simply in storage. The Vipers will be sent to <a title="A Most Terrifying Museum" href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/a-most-terrifying-museum/" target="_blank">White Sands Missile Range</a> and the Gulf of Mexico, transitioned to drones for &#8220;blank&#8221; missiles to have target practice. </span></li>
<li>Parts Reclamation&#8211;stripped as needed to repair operational planes.</li>
<li>Disposal&#8211;once fully stripped, they&#8217;re cut into parts. Those parts are melted and used to make circuit boards! The military base used to sell the carcass to nearby scrapyards, but policies changed after 9-11 and now they&#8217;re disassembled on-site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Protection from the Elements</h3>
<div id="attachment_4086" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4086" alt="cover seems" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cover-seems.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Spray latex protects against the sun, wind, and rodents. All seams are covered. </em></p></div>
<h3>Military Precision</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly well organized, and beautiful in the patterns and repetition. The planes are parked with precision&#8211;valets would be very happy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4087" alt="airplane boneyard from the sky" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/from-the-sky.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>A star on a plane indicates that the crew shot down an enemy aircraft. Earn five stars and you&#8217;re called an &#8220;ace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The planes are gorgeous and terrifying. Some sleek, some massive. Some slow, some <em>stealthy, </em>flying 15 miles above ground, at night, undetectable. It&#8217;s a sea of grey with sports of color, stars, and patriotism. Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>What Do Aircraft Do?</h3>
<p>Transport and bomb, test and train, search and destroy. Each plane has a letter that tells you its mission.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4090" alt="aircraft abbreviations" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Slide1.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Have you ever been to a junkyard or boneyard? What did you learn?</p>
<p>Disclosure: these photos are from Flickr. My tour wasn&#8217;t allowed to leave the bus, I had an aisle seat, and the windows were shaded with an appliqué that still had air bubbles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now I know what it feels like to be a celebrity. Well, kinda.</p>
<p>I used to be annoyed by actors who &#8220;need&#8221; to take a year off after back-to-back films, or singers who &#8220;require&#8221; extended R&amp;R after a tour. I mean come on&#8211;we all work hard but celebrities have assistants to cook and run errands. I don&#8217;t have assistants, do you?</p>
<p>So when I reached a place of exhaustion&#8211;<em>from traveling</em>&#8211;it felt indulgent. My wise friends helped me identify what&#8217;s going on:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I&#8217;ve been on the road 9.5 months and have driven over 18,000 miles.</span></li>
<li>90% of these days were spent exploring. While that&#8217;s gorgeous, fun, and inspiring, I&#8217;m over-stimulated.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">My skills now include way more plumbing tricks than I ever aspired to. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I&#8217;ve worked 30 hours/week on writing and photography&#8211;in addition to driving, cooking, cleaning, and adventuring.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>More than a Vacation</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s time to take a sabbatical from my sabbatical. It is not, however, time to return to Atlanta&#8211;there&#8217;s still so much to see, still some money, and still a desire to explore. I just need  a little R&amp;R.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m taking a month in the Los Angeles area. No sightseeing, no writing, no moving around. With a spot near the beach, I&#8217;ll rest, read, and recoup. Plus, a bounty of friends live here, and while they&#8217;re certainly strange, they&#8217;re not campground strangers.</p>
<h3>What about the Blog?</h3>
<p>Fret not, loyal readers. In the interim, I&#8217;ll post on MWF, re-running content from the beginning of this trip and the explorations that came before. It&#8217;ll keep you entertained and keep me in the search engines.</p>
<h3>Female Seeking Mail</h3>
<p>Even though &#8220;real life&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have interesting mail, I miss going to the mailbox every day. So&#8230;.if you reply in the comments and ask for my address, and if I personally know you, we can be pen pals through mid-April. If you send to me, I&#8217;ll send to you&#8211;I give good postcard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Any questions? <img src='http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a friend asks if you want to go to the <a title="Ostrich Festival" href="http://www.ostrichfestival.com" target="_blank">Ostrich Festival</a>, the answer is always yes. A resounding yes!</p>
<p>So off went Susan, a floormate from freshman year of college, her two kids, and me. Chandler AZ&#8211;look out! We&#8217;re here to have some fun!</p>
<p>Rides that prove your age by how nauseous they make you, food that proves your age by how nauseous it makes you, and sideshows. Ahhhh, sideshows. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways&#8230;.</p>
<h3>Animals Were Meant to Race?</h3>
<p>I consciously quelled concerns about what these poor creatures endure in order to race for human enjoyment. And frankly, it was quite enjoyable. Mostly because emus, donkeys, and ostriches don&#8217;t want to go in a straight line, nor do they want to have humans on their backs, so there&#8217;s bobbing-and-weaving, falling-and-clamboring. And watching a man fall off the back of an ostrich is truly a site to behold! Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3>Trick Cowboy, Show Me Whatcha Got!</h3>
<p>Well, aside from a substantial belt buckle, this man has skills! He even has the sequin-adorned gun holster to prove it: he&#8217;s a champion pistol twirler (or some such thing), and his assistant is the 2012 world champion knife thrower. Shazzam. Now, do you think the festival circuit is what world champion knife throwers dream of? Maybe&#8230;.?</p>
<p>Lassos and rope tricks, cracking the whip (it breaks the sound barrier, that&#8217;s why it &#8220;cracks&#8221;) to cut down a piece of plastic held in a woman&#8217;s mouth, gun twirls, bits with a horse (pun), and knife throwing while she&#8217;s strapped onto a board and spinning, then he tosses water balloons and upside and rotating she shoots both of them.  I mean really!</p>
<p>This was exactly what I hoped it would be! Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>

<h3>A Freakshow, but not THAT kind of Freakshow</h3>
<p>No bearded ladies or people with genetics that insensitive people find funny. Nope&#8211;this was men wearing eyeliner and a woman doing unconscionable forms of acrobatics. And a lot of  things that look unduly painful. Click the pic to advance the slideshow.</p>
[[Show as slideshow]]
<h3>Why Ostriches?</h3>
<p>No clue. There&#8217;s an Ostrich Farm an hour down the road, so maybe that has something to do with it? Let&#8217;s not fret the details and just enjoy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4082" alt="ostrich" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSC_00071.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>Ostrich facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">They have two toes, vs all other birds who have three or four. </span></li>
<li>An ostrich will live to 50-75 years old!</li>
<li>An ostrich egg weighs the same as two dozen chicken eggs.</li>
<li>The egg hatches in 42 days.</li>
<li>The chick grows one foot per month until it&#8217;s 7-8 months old</li>
<li>Co-parenting: mom sits on the egg during the day, dad at night</li>
<li>There are 2 million ostriches worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to belief, they do not bury their heads in the sand. Let&#8217;s look to Wikipedia for insight into why we think that they do.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This myth likely began with <a title="Pliny the Elder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> (AD 23–79), who wrote that ostriches &#8220;imagine, when they have thrust their head and neck into a bush, that the whole of their body is concealed.&#8221; This may have been a misunderstanding of their sticking their heads in the sand to swallow sand and pebbles, or, as <a title="National Geographic Society" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society">National Geographic</a> suggests, of the defensive behavior of lying low, so that they may appear from a distance to have their head buried.<sup id="cite_ref-NationalGeog_38-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich#cite_note-NationalGeog-38"><br />
</a></sup></em></p>
<p>****</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best festival sideshow you&#8217;ve seen?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sedona AZ comes by its reputation as a groovy town quite rightfully. See, there are energy vortexes connected to four of the red rock formations.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4077" alt="setting" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/setting.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>1. they call them voretxes, not vortices. Just go with it.</p>
<p>2. much like a vortex of wind or water (or time), powerful&#8211;but invisible&#8211;forces are at play.</p>
<p>3. and although a vortex innately has strength, the Sedona energy forces are considered &#8220;subtle.&#8221; Evident throughout town in a general way, they are most profoundly felt at the specific spots.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>People connect with the Sedona energy because &#8220;the vortex energy is very similar to the subtle energy operating in the energy centers inside each person. If you are at all a sensitive person, it is easy to feel the energy at these vortexes.&#8221;*</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/-g4Esc8x4u8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<h3>What Happens?</h3>
<p>You access masculine, feminine, and m-f balanced energies. <a href="http://lovesedona.com/01.htm" target="_blank">Learn more. </a></p>
<h3>Maybe X Does Mark the Spot?</h3>
<p>Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t walk the whole trail. Again, no hat or water. But curious me wanted to see what others find. And they find spirals made of rocks, and cairns (stacks of rocks). Perhaps that&#8217;s the spot?</p>
<p>Click the pic to advance the slideshow. Photos courtesy of Flickr.</p>

<h3>Getting Closer</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s said that Juniper trees in particular respond to the vortex energy.  The stronger the energy in a given place, the more the branches twist. Not all that familiar with Juniper trees and their natural state vs energized, I went to Flickr and Bing. See for yourself.</p>
<div id="attachment_4075" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4075" alt="not sedona trees" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/not-sedona-trees.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Regular Juniper trees elsewhere in the world. Photos courtesy of Bing.com</em></p></div>
<div id="attachment_4076" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 624px"><img class=" wp-image-4076" alt="sedona trees_FLICKR" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sedona-trees_FLICKR.jpg" width="614" height="461" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Juniper trees around the Sedona Red Rocks and close to the vortex locations. Photos courtesy of Flickr. </em></p></div>
<h3>Snarky or Uneasy?</h3>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve written a rather questioning post about the vortexes. And yet&#8230;I did feel something. Calm and encompassing.</p>
<p>If I can consider <a title="Mt Ranier" href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm" target="_blank">Mt Ranier</a> or the<a title="Photos of Jerusalem Shuk" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/plonde/sets/72157628165062581/" target="_blank"> shuk in Jerusalem </a>my holy places for the way they make me feel, why<em> can&#8217;t</em> there be energy in Sedona?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Have you ever felt connected to a place? Uplifted by it?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s stunning; plain and simple. And a surprisingly small <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm">National Park</a>. Out of the way, depending on which way you&#8217;re going, but worth the time.</p>
<h3>The Painted Desert</h3>
<p>Can&#8217;t be more appropriately named!</p>

<p>While gorgeous, it was also brutal the day I was there: not desert sun, but 33 degrees and incredibly strong wind. Out of the car, oooh, ahhh, take a picture, back in the car.</p>

<h3>The Petrified Forest</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s in the same place, and surprising in its own right. The trees lived in the Late Triassic Period, roughly 225 million years ago. Since then, they&#8217;ve colored and crystallized.</p>
<p>Signs, a movie, and guards at entrance-and-exit warn and ask you about taking the rocks-that-were-trees. They&#8217;re right there&#8211;it&#8217;s easy to understand the temptation. Slivers abound.  And so do ethics.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have never felt mortal fear like this. Not when rappelling and I fell and hit the rock face; not when hang-gliding 2,000 feet in the air; not when whitewater rafting over six-foot waves—in a <i>river</i>.</p>
<p>This fear was awakened in a museum—and ultimately confirmed by two more. New Mexico is as much the land of bombs as it is the Land of Enchantment. Welcome to nuclear history, testing the Atomic Bomb, and utter fright for the state of the world.</p>
<h3>Recording History</h3>
<p><a title="White Sands Missile Museum" href="http://www.wsmr-history.org" target="_blank">White Sands Missile Range Museum</a> (Alamogordo). You get here after passing through the White Sands Missile Testing Range. My hackles were raised.</p>
<p><a title="Nuclear Museum" href="http://nuclearmuseum.org" target="_blank">The National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</a> (Albuquerque) is the only Congressionally chartered museum in its field. It’s a Smithsonian Affiliate, which lured me in the first place. They assert that they show both the history of nuclear development and how it’s now used peacefully. They should also say that it’ll scare the crap out of you and you won’t understand the majority of the scientific language, which scares you even more.</p>
<p>I don’t know which is worse: that I don’t understand the children’s exhibits, or that children’s exhibits exist at a nuclear museum.</p>
<p><a title="Manhattan Project Museum" href="http://www.lanl.gov/museum/index.shtml" target="_blank">Bradbury Science Center</a> (Los Alamos) showcases the Manhattan Project—that’s the code name for building the Atomic Bomb.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Nuclear Weapons</h3>
<p>Pearl Harbor. Germany was working on nuclear weapons. And Einstein wrote a letter to FDR urging the need for priority research in this area. America “needed a device to end a war.”</p>
<p>Los Alamos, “the town that never was,” became a central location for working on nuclear weapons. Instead of the dispersed research at nine universities and 11 labs across the country, the scientists came together in New Mexico. They kicked out the locals (seriously), and had censored contact with the outside world. They lived in a utopia, were it not for their serious work, with no unemployment, no in-laws, no rich, no poor, no jail, no garages, no sidewalks, no paved roads. All mail went to PO Box 1663 in Santa Fe. Even birth certificates had the same address. And there were many birth certificates, because what else was there to do when not building a bomb to destroy the world?</p>
<p>“The gadget,” as the bomb was called, was tested in White Sands.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='614' height='376' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/AcmxLVGd4wE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>White Sands continues to be a missile testing site, consuming a significant part of the state.</p>

<h3>What’s the Difference between a Bomb and a Missile?</h3>
<p>Missiles are programmed to attack a specific place. Bombs are dropped, hopefully with accuracy, and ultimately under the responsibility of the pilot.</p>
<p>Click the pic to advance the slideshow. These are missiles on display at the White Sands Museum.</p>
[[Show as slideshow]]
<p>Today’s missiles are as smart as a third grader.</p>
<p>Bombs and missiles have so many safeguards and breakpoints for acceleration and space, etc., that working on them is considered quite safe. There’s “only” a one-in-a-billion chance that it’ll explode before it’s supposed to.</p>
<p>For clarification, bombs don’t hit the ground and explode—they disperse at a certain height, sending out all their atomic goodness, and that causes the impact.</p>
<h3>My Own Private PTSD</h3>
<p>Seeing these missiles, thinking about building a bomb to end war (and a country?), I can readily understand <a title="PTSD" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001923/" target="_blank">PTSD</a>. I was in shock merely from going to a museum. Imagine working with these daily.</p>
<p>The President carries the weight of the briefcase with the red button. After learning about these arsenals, I wondered why anyone would want to be President. What a massive burden. What incredible guilt. What unfathomable power. And perhaps the latter is the reason.</p>
<h3>The A-Bomb and Japan</h3>
<p>Why did America employ such a drastic measure? Why open the world to the use of nuclear weapons?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the Japanese were aggressively consuming territory and people, building an unwilling empire with violence and vile.</li>
<li>The Japanese would not surrender. Think of the kamikaze mindset—that comes from generations of indoctrination, and extended from the government to the people. After the first bomb on Hiroshima, the US government told Japanese leaders that another bomb would come if they didn’t accept the <a title="Potsdam Declaration" href="http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/P/o/Potsdam_Declaration.htm" target="_blank">Potsdam Declaration</a>. The leaders couldn’t/wouldn’t gather to discuss. This is <i>after</i> one bomb was already dropped.</li>
<li>People were dying—civilians and military. There were people in Japan and those interred in taken territories. There were the American soldiers. It was deemed better to kill some with a bomb, than so many more without it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conscientious Actions</h3>
<p>Staff at the Manhattan Project and military leaders had conflicting feelings, even within each organization: there’s no choice, and what will we start?</p>
<p>The U.S. War Department delivered leaflets to warn the Japanese people of the impending bomb.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4058" alt="japanese leaflet" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/japanese-leaflet.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>Still today people have a lot to say. At the Los Alamos museum there’s the opportunity to leave comments. When I was there, they were on book 46. Notice how much one person had to write, and how another says a lot with few words: “history is written by the winners.” I’m making no judgments on what they wrote, simply sharing the impact it had on me.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4059" alt="Los Alamos comment book" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Los-Alamos-comment-book.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<h3>Nuclear War as Souvenirs?!</h3>
<p>I was disgusted to learn of 1940&#8242;s-era lunch boxes that said they were radioactive. And even more disturbed to find tshirts in the gift shop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4060" alt="pop culture" src="http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pop-culture.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></p>
<p>BTW, a Darth Vader helmet was given to the White Sands Missile Testing Range&#8211;a thank you for letting sound engineers record missile launches to use in the beloved Star Wars films.</p>
<h3>Unicorns, Teddy Bears, Rainbows, Chocolate</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important that these museums exist, disturbing as they are. Not everything in life is sunshine and roses, and we need to be reminded.</p>
<p>My eyes were opened to a world of burden and responsibility and violence that I both wish I didn&#8217;t know about and am enlightened for being aware.</p>
<p>Being President absolutely calls for duties in addition to Commander in Chief. But I think a TV show about this kind of reality would inform voters far more than personality and domestic policy. And no, the news doesn&#8217;t suffice&#8211;it needs to be edu-tainment.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>What have you learned about the &#8220;ways of the world&#8221; that distressed&#8211;or even better, comforted&#8211;you?</p>
<p><a title="Disclosure Policy" href="http://americanathebeautiful.org/about/disclosure-policy/" target="_blank">Disclosure</a>&#8211;thank you to the <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org" target="_blank">Albuquerque Tourism Bureau</a> for the complimentary ticket.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Full-time travel is NOT like vacation. Plus, don&#8217;t you always feel the need for vacation when you get home from vacation? You&#8217;re tired, you&#8217;ve experienced a lot, and still have chores and projects to do. Plus gobs of laundry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where I am right now&#8211;in need of NO stimulation.</p>
<h3>Slow Down There, Missy</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the road nearly nine months and have driven just over 17,000 miles. That road warrior state of mind is long gone. When I first started the trip, I was afraid of not seeing enough before snowfall. What&#8217;s &#8220;enough&#8221;?  It&#8217;s not like if I miss a place on this trip I can&#8217;t visit it later.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;ve made peace with the fact that I likely won&#8217;t accomplish 50 states on this trip. To be clear, I&#8217;m not trying to visit all 50 in this year-ish, but to achieve my remaining five. I started the trip with nine to go, so I feel great about the four that were added.</p>
<p>Plus, stays are much longer than before. Previously, I was in and out in a matter of days. Add the constant writing and photo editing, and I was working until midnight and starting again at 8:00 am. Now I linger. To find out what wasn&#8217;t already on my itinerary. To dedicate days to writing and others to chores. This lets me stop working at a reasonable hour, watch tv (when there&#8217;s reception), read, sleep.</p>
<h3>A Gluttony of, well, Everything</h3>
<p>Exploring America is incredible. The dots of history are connecting, and making new patterns&#8211;so many realities I never conceived.</p>
<p>The art is compelling&#8211;whether it compels me to think or moves me to my core.</p>
<p>The whimsy is everywhere.</p>
<p>The natural beauty gives me breath as often as it takes it away.</p>
<p>The people are kind and funny and fascinating. And admittedly I haven&#8217;t taken the time to meet enough of them.</p>
<h3>Regular Life</h3>
<p>It continues, try as I might to avoid it. Taxes and broken eyeglasses. Common ailments that the internet convinces me are cancer.</p>
<p>My spectacular need to start ridiculous and consuming projects remains. Organizing my music. Listening to every song ever recorded by an artist who&#8217;s new to me. Finding the perfect system for capturing my flood of ideas and to-dos.</p>
<h3>Fight for My Rights</h3>
<p>No one takes my money. Look out world!</p>
<p>When the computer died at one year, I fought for a reimbursement and got it. Ditto for the printer. When the camper had <em>water, water everywhere</em> from both the kitchen sink that exploded and the input valve that seeped, I got warranty to cover both. I&#8217;m on my third internet provider in nine months. When the transmission blew (and I didn&#8217;t tell Mom and Dad bc they would worry), guess who got it covered under warranty plus got the rental car reimbursed because this faulty transmission pump is a known problem.</p>
<p>This is exhausting and time consuming. But it&#8217;s also a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Car and Camper Troubles</h3>
<p>Just had an accident with a woman who was DWI, with three children in the car, and blew .17&#8211;you&#8217;re considered legally drunk at .08. I&#8217;m fine. The SUV is fixed. And I&#8217;ll tell the whole tale once insurance is final.</p>
<p>A tire pulled and should be covered under warranty. The dealer wasn&#8217;t having it. So I called my tire guy at home, he called the dealer, and poof, no more cheating a woman. Ditto with the transmission above: the mechanic back home advised me on what to say and gave me a glossary so I would know what they were saying.  These men are on my Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The things that connect the roof of my camper to the body were recalled. Awesome.  The thing that protects the wheels from rocks literally blew off while driving. Awesome. Water freezes overnight so I bought a $150 heated hose specific for potable water.</p>
<h3>And then We Have the Passions</h3>
<p>Writing. What a gift to have time, motivation, and content to write daily. But see, I&#8217;m writing DAILY. It takes as much out of me as it gives. Saw a quote that &#8220;choosing to be a writer means you always have homework.&#8221; Yup.</p>
<p>Photos. So much to see. So much to capture. So many pictures to edit. 200 pics a day is average. Now cull and retouch and sort. It&#8217;s a LABOR of love.</p>
<p>Add contests and guest posts&#8211;which are plentiful and I&#8217;m so thankful. Add editing a friend&#8217;s book&#8211;which is clever and will go far. Add engaging in social media and studying best practices to promote my bog.</p>
<h3>And That&#8217;s Why I NEED a Vacation</h3>
<p>Blessed with good (and free) internet, I spent an entire day watching Downton Abbey. Then the next two days watching Scandal.</p>
<p>Not enough.</p>
<p>I reached out on Facebook for ideas in Vegas or a cruise. Neither suits me, both would still be stimulating, and I&#8217;d feel compelled to write.</p>
<p>Other full-time travelers and dear friends validated my need for time off.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;Any way of life can get monotonous.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Too many of anything necessitates some of other things. <img src='http://americanathebeautiful.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8221;</li>
<li>&#8221; [Get] a pitcher of margaritas. Short-term solution, but it [works].&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;What about a retreat? I hazard a guess that travel and sight seeing could be over-stimulating and you may enjoy something quiet and calm and serene&#8230;.?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h3>So What Did I Do?</h3>
<p>Stay at a campground that unbeknownst to me has no TV or phone service. Because it&#8217;s in a canyon, with a creek. Not such a bad thing.</p>
<p>Schedule one treatment a day at a local spa, so I could spread out the exultation and use them for their amenities. A shower with an unlimited supply of hot water? I&#8217;ll take two&#8230;in one day. Sauna, hot tub, nap, water with fruit in it. And two services I&#8217;ve never had before: Reiki and an Ayurvedic treatment. They were far from massage, and far more relaxing. Plus no soreness the next day.</p>
<h3>Did it Work?</h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Plus I need to continue to slow down. That&#8217;s not a new revelation&#8211;I&#8217;ve always over-committed. Even if I&#8217;m over-committing to sightseeing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What do you do when you&#8217;re over-stimulated?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never really understood the point of postcards when you&#8217;re on a week-long vacation. &#8220;Wish you were here&#8221; isn&#8217;t always true, let&#8217;s be honest. And I&#8217;ll be home before the mail arrives and we can talk about the trip then.</p>
<p>Well, with my extended travel, I&#8217;m obsessed with postcards.  And brochures, and tourism rack cards, and funny bags from buying said postcards.</p>
<h3>Supplies</h3>
<p>I started with a handful of envelopes: #10 and catalog size. They were quickly consumed. I bought a modest supply. They, too, were gone in a minute. So I broke down and bought 100 of each, and added padded envelopes and packing tape to the repertoire. It&#8217;s incredibly less expensive to buy in bulk than getting the small bundles. But where do you store an inventory in a trailer? Under the seat. Truly. And they&#8217;re getting full.</p>
<h3>Return Address</h3>
<p>That takes up precious space on a postcard. Dad insists that the nonprofits haven&#8217;t found me yet and aren&#8217;t sending return address labels in exchange for a donation, so I bought my own Avery labels and made some.</p>
<p>I love the smell of office supplies in the morning.</p>
<h3>Feeling Connected</h3>
<p>At the risk of aggrandizing myself, I give good mail (minus my handwriting). It makes me feel connected to people I love. Hunting for the the thing they collect focuses me in a way beyond the concentration of the experience. Looking for the joke and perspective that only they will get adds to the blog and makes it personal to them&#8211;and to me.</p>
<p>One gas station stop yielded the purchase of six postcards! Three of which were exactly about the topics I had just discussed with my Dad during a driving-education session that&#8217;s par for the course when I&#8217;m migrating. I see something, I clearly can&#8217;t go online, so Dad gets a call and I get an education.</p>
<h3>Saving the USPS</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m doing what I can. Sorry it wasn&#8217;t enough to keep delivery on Saturdays&#8211;perhaps more people should travel.</p>
<p>BTW, when do I get that Medal of Honor for helping your bottom line?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning, exploring, adventuring, writing, photographing&#8230; Amazing.</p>
<p>Babysitting my laundry, having six gallons of hot water for a shower, not knowing where to find good Chinese for the, err, required monthly consumption&#8230; Less than amazing.</p>
<h3>You&#8217;re Traveling, Get Over It!</h3>
<p>Indeed, I&#8217;m traveling. And it&#8217;s wonderful.</p>
<p>But that glee minimizes, not eliminate, realities. These are some of mine.</p>
<h3>Big Brother Really IS Watching</h3>
<p>As part of the family-sanity-plan established at the start of the trip, my parents and brother have the ability to track my phone. They can go online and see where my phone is. If it matches where they think I am, they&#8217;re (presumably) happy.</p>
<p>It seems that my brother checks daily, if not multiple times a day. Sweet. Spooky. Stalkerish?</p>
<p>He emailed the other day to say the service was wonky and wanted to make sure I&#8217;m ok. On a different day, I emailed him before starting a hike where I presumed I would be alone. He immediately called and said, &#8220;you&#8217;re in the Rio Grande. IN it! Is everything alright?&#8221; Surprisingly, I had cell service in a canyon, on the Rio Grande, but not below the boulders &#8211; good to know.</p>
<p>His vigilance is both creepy and comforting.</p>
<h3>How Fast Can YOU Shower?</h3>
<p>With only six gallons of hot water, you&#8217;ll shower damn fast.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Goldilocks moment where it&#8217;s too hot (scorching), so I adjust and it&#8217;s too cold (freezing), and finally it&#8217;s just right. It&#8217;s a race against time. Six gallons is not a luxurious shower, people.</p>
<p>Forget about shaving my legs. First, the stall is so small the water instantly removes the lather. Second, gotta save the hot water. So I turn off the water and shave with a bowl. Really. Add that in the winter, when the cold affronts through the ceiling vent, and I give up. I&#8217;m less feminine than I would prefer, but all in the name of adventure.</p>
<h3>Babysitting Laundry is&#8230;Yawn</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to risk other people touching my clothes. So I sit with my laundry and wait for the cycles to end.</p>
<p>Now, presumably the people are clean since they&#8217;re washing clothes&#8230;but I still don&#8217;t want them touching my clothes. And I don&#8217;t want to touch theirs. It&#8217;s rude to leave the laundry room and hold a machine hostage by your absence.</p>
<p>So I bring a book or my computer. Most laundry rooms and laundromats haven&#8217;t figured out that comfortable chairs are a bonus, and that a table would be nice. So I&#8217;m adding injury to insult.</p>
<h3>Sanity Check on Aisle Four</h3>
<p>No two Targets or Walmarts have the same layout. Why? For love of all that is holy, why would they change the way you shop based on location? Add grocery stores which may or may not carry a preferred brand, and erranding becomes, well, a chore.</p>
<h3>Guilt</h3>
<p>My Dad handles my mail, which means he tosses, scans, or sends via UPS. He won&#8217;t tell me how much it costs to send things, so every few months I just send a check.</p>
<p>Multiple times I&#8217;ve sent both he and my Mom on a quest into the basement to look in &#8220;THE box&#8221; where I left all important documents. Sometimes the grail is there, and sometimes Mom turns it into an un-fun scavenger hunt and opens other boxes at random. That stresses me out.</p>
<p>What am I doing in return for these services? Consuming one-third of of their basement with my belongings. Sending postcards. And on a constant hunt for a gift that illustrates my gratitude.</p>
<h3>RV Plumbing&#8230;Grrr.</h3>
<p>Losing count of how many times you&#8217;ve snaked a drain is worse than losing count of your sexual partners.</p>
<p>I am in this situation. To be clear, the former, not the latter.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll just leave it at that.</p>
<h3>Are These Travel-Specific?</h3>
<p>Actually, no. In some fashion these woes exist no matter your situation. And if this is the worst that&#8217;s going on, then things are good indeed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In what ways does your family stalk you?</p>
