Obama joined the call at one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli prime minister's office said Netanyahu "apologised to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to the loss of life". Erdogan accepted the apology, White House officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the "first step" between normalisation of relations between the two countries, US officials said, and had been the subject of talks between Obama and Netanyahu in Jerusalem this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement from Netanyahu's office said: "The two men agreed to restore normalisation between Israel and Turkey, including the dispatch of ambassadors and the cancellation of legal steps against IDF soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prime Minister Netanyahu … expressed regret over the deterioration in bilateral relations and noted his commitment to working out the disagreements in order to advance peace and regional stability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added: "The prime minister made it clear that the tragic results regarding the Mavi Marmara were unintentional, and that Israel expresses regret over injuries and loss of life. In light of the Israeli investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational errors, Netanyahu apologised to the Turkish people for any errors that could have led to loss of life and agreed to complete the agreement on compensation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has been deeply concerned about the deterioration between its two key allies in the region since the flotilla debacle in May 2010. Nine Turkish activists were killed when Israeli commandos boarded the Mavi Marmara in an operation to prevent it and other ships in the flotilla from reaching Gaza. The bloody confrontation was met with a wave of international condemnation, and Israel was forced to ease its stringent blockade of the tiny Palestinian enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement released in Obama's name on Friday afternoon said: "The United States deeply values our close partnerships with both Turkey and Israel, and we attach great importance to the restoration of positive relations between them in order to advance regional peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am hopeful that today's exchange between the two leaders will enable them to engage in deeper cooperation on this and a range of other challenges and opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel will now move ahead on existing plans to pay up to £4m in compensation to the dead activists' families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel's former hardline foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman was a key opponent of Israel issuing an apology to Turkey. Last July, he told reporters: "[The Mavi Marmara mission] was a clear provocation, and it was our right to protect the lives of our soldiers. Frankly speaking, Israel has no reason to apologise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Lieberman is currently out of the Israeli government pending his forthcoming fraud trial. Netanyahu has held the foreign minister's position open for him if he is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey cut all diplomatic ties with Israel following the deaths of the nine citizens. In Gaza, which has been ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas for almost six years, Turkey was hailed as a champion of Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A United Nations report released in September 2011 said that Israel's naval blockade was "a legitimate security measure". It said that Israeli forces had faced "organised and violent resistance" on board the Mavi Marmara, but the use of force by Israel was "excessive and unreasonable". Turkey rejected its conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/turkey"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/binyamin-netanyahu"&gt;Binyamin Netanyahu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-peace-talks"&gt;Middle East peace talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gaza"&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gaza-flotilla"&gt;Gaza flotilla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Witnesses reported seeing the mother and child walk on to the tracks at the suburban station before being hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambulance teams and Metropolitan police officers attended, but the woman and child – believed to be a toddler – were declared dead at the scene. Before the impact a commuter was heard screaming: "There's a body on the track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Transport Police (BTP), who have launched an investigation, were called to the incident at around 8.20am. Police refused to comment on reports that the woman laid down in the path of the oncoming train, but they do not believe anyone else was involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commuter Paul Camlett said he had arrived at the station just before 8.30am He said: "The station master rounded everyone up and ordered them off the platform. Everyone was oblivious to what had happened. A woman screamed 'there's a body on the track'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm in complete shock. People were crying. They were in complete shock. The woman who screamed just could not speak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commuters on the train affected were eventually allowed to leave their compartments at 10am, more than 90 minutes after the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BTP spokeswoman said: "BTP officers were called to Riddlesdown rail station in Purley on Friday 22 March after a report that a woman and a child had been struck by a train. The incident was reported to BTP at 8.29am and was also attended by Metropolitan police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Medics from the London Ambulance Service also attended, but a woman and a child were declared dead at the scene. Inquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances, and a file will be prepared for the coroner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The station was temporarily closed while the emergency services dealt with the incident and the police investigation got under way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BTP Detective Chief Inspector Simon Taylor said: "Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of the woman and child involved in this tragic incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Officers are continuing to work to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident, although early indications show that no one else was believed to have been involved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Members of the Communication Workers Union will walk out for 24 hours after backing industrial action by almost nine to one. The union said up to 4,000 workers will be involved at 373 Crown offices, the larger sites usually located in high streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action is in protest at plans to close or franchise more than 70 Crown offices, as well as changes to pay and jobs. Picket lines will be mounted outside the offices, which handle around a fifth of Post Office business. A number of Crown offices have already been franchised to firms such as WH Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The union said Post Office staff have not received a pay rise since April 2011. Dave Ward, the union's deputy general secretary, said: "With Post Office management refusing to negotiate, and with such a huge vote in favour of strike action, we have had no choice but to serve notice for strike action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This dispute is about protecting jobs and services as well as securing a fair pay increase for our members. We're saying to the public: 'If you value your post office, support these workers on Easter Saturday and beyond'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post Office said it was "disappointed" that strike action was being taken, adding that the union had refused to understand the need for "critical change" across the Crown network, which is losing £40m per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the strike would do nothing to change the need to implement its transformation strategy, aimed at building a "profitable, modern and commercially viable" Crown network not reliant on government funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Post Office said it had offered a series of cash payments of up to £3,400 to be paid before April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contingency plans are in place to ensure that any disruption to customers is kept to an "absolute minimum". Kevin Gilliland, network and sales director at the Post Office, said: "The CWU is ignoring the harsh commercial realities being faced by the Post Office and other retailers across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Post Office is transforming its network to improve customer experience and, in turn, bring in new business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to the Post Office remaining a key part of UK high streets and our plans ensure this will happen. They mean that for 70 of our Crown branches – less than 1% of our network – we will be looking to partner with a suitable retailer, whilst at the same time we will invest £70m in the remaining 300 Crown branches to modernise and grow services to ensure their long-term viability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/post-office"&gt;Post Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tradeunions"&gt;Trade unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As a result of the unanticipated change in the weather, Obama extended his third meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to more than two hours while Israeli police blocked roads to allow the presidential convoy to pass through south Jerusalem to Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will have had a close view of the imposing wall which snakes for miles between the biblical cities. Palestinians say its construction has strangled Bethlehem's economy and obstructed access to family, jobs and places of worship in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president's visit to the fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on what is believed to be the site of Jesus's birth, lasted around 30 minutes. He was greeted by the Greek Orthodox patriarch, Theophilos III, who said: "We welcome you as a messenger of peace and reconciliation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vera Baboun, the first female mayor of Bethlehem, said Obama's visit was an opportunity to learn of the obstacles facing her city. "It's important that President Obama comes and sees, as a president, and listens, because we need acts," she said. "Enough is enough, I think. We waited a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After meeting other Christian leaders in the company of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, the presidential convoy left for Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv to fly to Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama and Netanyahu had a final round of talks before departure, but a farewell ceremony was cut short because of the adverse weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the president laid wreaths at the graves of Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, and the assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. He &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/barack-obama-holocaust-victims-memorial" title=""&gt;spent an hour at Yad Vashem&lt;/a&gt;, Israel's Holocaust memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit, Obama's first to the Holy Land since becoming president, appeared to have succeeded in its principal aim of reassuring Israel of the "unbreakable alliance" between the two allies and recalibrating the hitherto frosty relationship between its leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, told reporters at the end of the trip that Israel thanked America for the special bond between the two countries. "President Obama's words were warmly appreciated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Obama's call for a renewed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Netanyahu had made clear his government's commitment "to a historic compromise that will end this conflict once and for all", said Regev. The president's visit had provided "new impetus" to move the process forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both sides had to play a part, he added. "It is a two-way street. It's not for one side to make demands and the other side to make concessions." Talks should begin as soon as possible without preconditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, John Kerry, who accompanied Obama on the trip, is to return to Jerusalem on Saturday for a further meeting with Netanyahu. "We look forward to continuing our discussions with the Americans," said Regev. "I think we'll see immediate follow-up through the activities of the secretary of state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With songs such as &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2011/04/Send_Me_A_Cruise.mp3" title=""&gt;Send Me a Cruise (Missile)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2011/04/Make_Jihad_with_me.mp3" title=""&gt;Make Jihad with Me&lt;/a&gt;, the Alabama-born Hammami's notoriety has led to the US state department putting &lt;a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2013/03/us_state_department_offers_up.html" title=""&gt;a $5m (£3.3m) bounty on his head&lt;/a&gt;. Not that Hammami – also known as al-Amriki, or "the American" – is letting it get him down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abumamerican/status/314938281005568001" title=""&gt;he took to Twitter to joke&lt;/a&gt;: "As I'm a bit low on cash, how much is my left leg going for? I figure Shamil Basayev [leader of the Chechen rebel movement] did the one-leg jihad thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammami, 28, went to Somalia to join the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabaab group in 2006 and the state department said he began recruiting for the jihadist cause through his English-language rap songs and videos. His voice has been described as &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/jihadi-rap-ghostwriter/" title=""&gt;"a deep Barry White growl"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not just his music that has riled the US authorities. Hammami is believed to have fought for al-Shabaab in Somalia against the US-backed government. &lt;a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2012/11/former_daphne_resident_omar_ha.html" title=""&gt;He was added to the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists in November&lt;/a&gt; last year, the agency &lt;a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/copy_of_omar-shafik-hammami/view" title=""&gt;describing him as "armed and dangerous"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, he was charged in Alabama with providing material support to terrorists. Two years later new charges were filed against him for leaving the US to join al-Shabaab, which was labelled a foreign terrorist organisation by the state department in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year Hammami released his autobiography, The Story of an American Jihadi, which, like his music, received less than flattering reviews. &lt;a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2012/0521/American-jihadi-in-Somalia-writes-an-autobiography" title=""&gt;The Christian Science Monitor described it&lt;/a&gt; as a "strange mixture of childish humour (he writes "ha ha" a lot to indicate something he found funny) and deadly serious description of his life with al-Shabaab".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theriskyshift.com/2012/12/a-somali-soap-opera-al-shabaabs-split-with-omar-hammami/" title=""&gt;Hammami spilt from al-Shabaab last year&lt;/a&gt;, with the terror group denouncing his statements and actions as motivated by the "narcissistic pursuit of fame and … far removed from the reality on the ground". Amid the fallout, he was also accused of possibly the worst crime a rapper can be accused of, aside from terrorism: &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2013/02/jihadi-rap-ghostwriter/" title=""&gt;that of not writing his own rhymes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Shabaab now wants to kill him, but Hammami seems relaxed at the prospect of having groups on each side of the "war on terror" after his head. On Friday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abumamerican/status/315038808888459264" title=""&gt;he joked on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: "If being wanted dead by both US and Shabaab has something to do [with] my patchy beard, fake beards are something negotiable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rap"&gt;Rap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/urban"&gt;Urban music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/hip-hop"&gt;Hip-hop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alabama"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/somalia"&gt;Somalia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/haroonsiddique"&gt;Haroon Siddique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But the new binational survey – produced for YouGov-Cambridge, the polling company's academic thinktank – finds US voters opposed to the idea of supplying munitions by a 29-point margin: 45% against to 16% in favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identical questions were posed in Britain, where David Cameron has, with the French president, François Hollande, recently tried and failed to persuade the EU to lift its arms embargo. But the British public emerges as even more strongly against: 57% oppose arming the rebels and 16% are in favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both the UK and the US, opposition to arming the rebels is marked on the right as well as the left of the political spectrum: 52% of American Republicans and 63% of British Conservatives are against supplying arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any thought of sending western troops into Syria would also be badly received – especially in the UK. By a 32-point margin (55%-23%) Britons reject the idea of sending in UK and allied troops to protect civilians. The anti-intervention lead rises to 59 points (68%-9%) if the aim were "overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US too, proposals to put boots on the ground would run up against public opinion. Americans lean 33%-27% against sending in troops "to protect civilians", and are more decisively against directly enforcing regime change, splitting 42%-16% against. Although more Republicans (22%) than Democrats (14%) would be prepared to support the latter, the partisan difference are not as great might have expected given the continuing divisions over the war to topple Saddam Hussein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade on from the invasion of 2003, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/feb/15/iraq-war-10-year-anniversary-poll" title=""&gt;YouGov reaffirms the verdict of other pollsters&lt;/a&gt; and finds a rough two-to-one (53%-27%) balance of Britons saying that the war launched by George Bush and Tony Blair was wrong rather than right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US opinion is more evenly divided, with those who believe the war was right holding a slim 41%-38% edge. And whereas in Britain, opposition is consistent across supporters of different parties, in the US the political divide is stark. Democrats judge the war a mistake by a 53%-23% margin, but Republicans remain even more convinced that it was right, splitting 72% to 12% in favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no political faction in either Britain or the US is comparably belligerent in connection with Syria, the mood is not isolationist either. There are strong majorities in favour of the official policy on both sides of the Atlantic, of providing the rebels with "non-lethal support".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US the Obama administration has concentrated on softer support, such as food and medical supplies, but the question's wording also referred to "armoured vehicles and body armour", the sort of harder-edged interpretation of "non-lethal" supplies being emphasised by London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the proposition put in these terms, Americans split 45%-24% in favour of providing the supplies, a 21-point margin. In Britain, the 57%-22% pro-intervention majority on this count is even more emphatic, at 35 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For pro-intervention hawks, such as Senator John McCain in the US and increasingly Cameron himself in Britain, there is another encouraging finding. Respondents on both sides of the Atlantic are in favour of "enforcing a no-fly zone over Syria so the Syrian air force cannot attack rebels or civilians". In the UK that proposition wins public support by a 43-point margin, with 61% in favour and 18% against. In the US there is a 50% to 18% majority behind the same proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these results point to mixed public attitudes to Syria, YouGov-Cambridge's detailed analysis on the legacy of Iraq also defies easy characterisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britons are disinclined to believe the conflict made the world a safer place – only 14% say so, as against 38% who judge it has made the world more dangerous and 40% who say it made little difference. They are likewise disinclined to believe the invasion made the lives of ordinary Iraqis better (only 24% think so), and by 71% to 12% they also believe Iraq will remain "permanently unstable" as opposed to becoming a "peaceful democracy". Americans are somewhat more sanguine on all these counts, in line with their less hostile overall verdict on the war, but in the United States, too, a clear majority of 56% believes Iraq is set for permanent instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When memories of Saddam Hussein are invoked, however, the picture changes: by 41% to 21% Britons judge that despite the suffering of war Iraqis would have been even worse off under the rule of Saddam, and in the US opinion leans the same way, by 46% to 17%. These final results seem out of kilter with the UK's anti-war sentiment in particular. It could be that some respondents are reasoning that while Iraqi life would have been worse under Saddam he might by now have been brought down by other means – or it could be that people give different answers to similar questions phrased in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov-Cambridge surveyed 1,684 British adults online on 10 and 11 March and a further 1,962 on 13 and 14 March, and 1,022 American adults online from 12 to 14 March. The figures have been weighted and are representative of British and American adults aged 18 or over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/foreignpolicy"&gt;Foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tomclark"&gt;Tom Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Neonicotinoids, the world's most widely used insecticides, are also facing the prospect of suspension in the European Union, after the health commissioner pledged to press on with the proposed ban &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/15/bee-harming-pesticides-escape-european-ban" title=""&gt;despite opposition from the UK and Germany&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have demonstrated time and time again over the last several years that the EPA needs to protect bees," said Peter Jenkins, an attorney at the Centre for Food Safety who is representing the coalition. "The agency has refused, so we've been compelled to sue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"America's beekeepers cannot survive for long with the toxic environment EPA has supported," said Steve Ellis, a Minnesota and California beekeeper and one of the plaintiffs who filed the suit at the federal district court. "Bee-toxic pesticides in dozens of widely used products, on top of many other stresses our industry faces, are killing our bees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement: "We are working aggressively to protect bees and other pollinators from pesticide risks through regulatory, voluntary and research programmes. Specifically, the EPA is accelerating the schedule for registration review of the neonicotinoid pesticides because of uncertainties about them and their potential effects on bees." However, even the accelerated review will not be completed before 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pesticides named in the lawsuits are clothianidin, manufactured by Bayer, and thiamethoxam, made by Syngenta. Neither company chose to comment on the lawsuit, but industry group Crop Life America (CLA) is representing some of the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The CLA fully supports and trusts the rigour of EPA's review process for crop protection products, including neonicotinoids," said Ray McAllister, senior director of regulatory affairs at CLA. "This class of product represents an important component of modern agriculture that helps farmers protect their crops. Neonicotinoids are thoroughly tested and monitored for potential risks to the environment and various beneficial species, including honeybees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/crop-pesticides-honeybee-decline" title=""&gt;high-profile scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; in the last year have increasingly linked &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/22/bees-pesticides" title=""&gt;neonicotinoids to harmful effects in bees&lt;/a&gt;, including huge losses in the number of queens produced, and big increases in "disappeared" bees that fail to return from foraging trips. Disease and habitat loss are also thought to be factors in the recent declines in populations of bees and other pollinators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A proposal to suspend the use of three neonicotinoids across the EU ended in a hung vote on 15 March. But Tonio Borg, the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, said this week he would take the proposal to appeal. If member states maintained their positions, the insecticides would be suspended. "The health of our bees is of paramount importance," said Borg. "We have a duty to take proportionate yet decisive action to protect them wherever appropriate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit against the EPA argues that, via "conditional registrations", the regulator rushed the neonicotinoids into the market without sufficient examination and since that time has failed to take account of new information. "Pesticide manufacturers use conditional registrations to rush bee-toxic products to market, with little public oversight," said Paul Towers, at Pesticide Action Network, part of the coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action by the coalition, which also includes the Sierra Club and the Centre for Environmental Health, follows an emergency petition in March 2012 which demanded the EPA suspend the use of clothianidin but was not acted upon. Also issued this week was a &lt;a href="http://www.abcbirds.org/abcprograms/policy/toxins/Neonic_FINAL.pdf" title=""&gt;report from the American Bird Conservancy&lt;/a&gt;, which said the "EPA risk assessments have greatly underestimated [the risk to birds], using scientifically unsound, outdated methodology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bees"&gt;Bees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/insects"&gt;Insects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pesticides"&gt;Pesticides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/farming"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/epa"&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/damiancarrington"&gt;Damian Carrington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They believe Johnson was "politically driven" when he intervened to block the ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad posters earmarked for the sides of the capital's buses read: "Not Gay! Ex-Gay, Post-Gay and Proud. Get over it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson condemned the "gay cure" ad as "offensive to gays" and said it could lead to retaliation against the wider Christian community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the high court, Justice Beverley Lang ruled on Friday that TfL's process in introducing the ban "was procedurally unfair, in breach of its own procedures and demonstrated a failure to consider the relevant issues".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she said that was outweighed by factors against allowing the ad to be published on buses across the capital. Lang said it would "cause grave offence" to those who were gay and was perceived as homophobic, "thus increasing the risk of prejudice and homophobic attacks".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge revealed her concern about the issues raised by the case by giving Core Issues permission to appeal to the court of appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said that, although she did not think an appeal would succeed, there were "compelling reasons" to allow an appeal to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lang added that the case "concerns interference with the right to freedom of expression, which is a matter of such fundamental importance that it merits consideration by the appellate court".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core Issues had asked the judge to rule that the charity was unlawfully denied the freedom to express its views on homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Diamond, appearing for the charity, said the ban was imposed "very close" to the mayoral election on 3 May, when Johnson defeated his political opponent Ken Livingstone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond said: "It was clearly a highly charged issue, and the mayor took credit for the highly politically driven decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mayor was strongly of the view this advertisement should not run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diamond said the Core Issues Trust had nothing but "utter respect for people struggling with same-sex attraction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He denied that it was attempting to offer a "gay cure" and said the ads were a response to a bus poster campaign by the gay rights group &lt;a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/christian-bus-driver-refuses-to-use-1440407" title=""&gt;Stonewall, which carried the message: "Some people are gay. Get over it!"&lt;/a&gt; Diamond contended the trust was equally entitled to express its view on the sides of buses, and to have its right to freedom of expression protected under article 10 of the European convention on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TfL refused to carry its ad on the grounds that it was "likely to cause widespread or serious offence to members of the public", and it contained "images or messages which relate to matters of public controversy and sensitivity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/boris"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/advertising"&gt;Advertising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights"&gt;Gay rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality"&gt;Sexuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Here is a selection of readers' tales of sorrow, embarrassment, time wasted and love left unexpressed. Also, a psychologist who works with families reveals the top five regrets cited by parents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/22/top-five-parenting-regrets"&gt;What are parents' top five regrets?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The spaghetti incident&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of all the hundreds and thousands of things I've done for my kids: lifts, birthday parties, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, ironing, parents' evenings, financial support – the list is endless – why do they always remember the one bad thing I did as a parent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have our off days – mothers too. When my youngest daughter was three and refusing to finish her dinner, I picked up her bowl which contained&amp;nbsp;remnants of cold spaghetti bolognese – realising even as I did it that I'd be the one to clean up the mess – and placed it upside down on her head. My four children were misbehaving and I'd reached boiling point. The food&amp;nbsp;was cold and there wasn't much of it, but this desperate, if relatively mild, act of maternal rage is brought up regularly in company when&amp;nbsp;my kids want to have a laugh at my expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years the story has become more and more exaggerated. The bowl has grown bigger, the spaghetti hotter and more plentiful. This small act of aggression eclipses everything kind, loving and maternal I've ever done. Maybe it's a lesson in life – you can lead an exemplary existence but if you put one foot wrong that's probably what you will be remembered for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish in retrospect that I'd left the room and counted to 10 instead. But my daughter appears not to have been too traumatised. Although, come to think of it, she did grow dreadlocks when she was 18 … &lt;em&gt;Alison Clink &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher and Harry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My son Christopher was entirely in thrall to Harry Potter, the boy wizard, and his epic struggle against "He who must not be named". Over the years, as each book in the series came out, Christopher would make sure that I read several chapters to him each bedtime, only agreeing to let me stop reading when his mum shouted up the stairs that it really was time he went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2007, Christopher and his mum, Julie, older brother Jonathan and I were on holiday at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest when the last in the series, &lt;a href="http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408810606" title=""&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&lt;/a&gt;, was published. Now 14, Christopher, of course, had no desire for me to read to him any more and, as I recall, hid himself away in his chalet room for a day or so and devoured the book in more or less one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2009, Christopher fell ill. His condition worsened as the week went on, so we took him to hospital. On arrival at A&amp;E, Christopher collapsed and had to be rushed to the crash room. He never recovered and died from a rare streptococcal infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now regret not having read that last Harry Potter book to Christopher and how I wish that Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore could once again get together and perfect the ultimate spell that would bring Christopher and his beautiful smile back to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richard Salmon &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ruined Christmas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family was sitting at the table, chatting after Sunday dinner, within the Twelve Days of Christmas. The tree was still twinkling – cards, holly, bells and baubles everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't still believe in Father Christmas, do you?" I said. Without a word, Elizabeth, the youngest, aged eight, got down from the table and left the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the washing up, I went to find Elizabeth. She was in her room, decorated with paper chains from school, snowflakes she had made at Brownies, Christmas cards from her friends. But the room was bare. She had taken down her decorations and thrown them in the bin. She was heartbroken, and so was I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, we still followed the custom of hanging up their stockings, and putting out sherry for Father Christmas and a carrot for Rudolph. But with Elizabeth at junior school, her big brother, 11, and her older sister, 13, both at secondary school, I'd assumed that they or her schoolfriends would have laughed her out of the idea of Father Christmas by now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was wrong and had carelessly shattered her belief in Father Christmas; the first test of faith for a child. I hoped and prayed she'd still believe in Jesus and the reason for Christmas. &lt;em&gt;Rosemary Brockbank &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish I'd had a routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two words. Just a name, but enough to strike terror into the heart of many parents – Gina Ford. Her methods have won her a loyal following, but others find her slavish devotion to routine at odds with caring for the tiny alien whirlwind that has just arrived in their lives. I was firmly in the latter camp. How I wish I'd listened to Ford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My son, Niko, arrived by emergency caesarean on 12 April 2010 and weighed only 5lbs. From his first day, he struggled to hold up his head, straining his neck, determined to take in the world around him. The first few days lulled me into a false sense of security. He slept a lot. Despite the post-op pain, I was happy. This is easy, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I took him home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sleepless nights began. It was hard, but don't all parents complain about sleepless nights? But it was every hour for months on end. Was this normal? So I did what I always do when I need to learn about something. I bought books. The author everyone recommended was Gina Ford, the mistress of routine. But I couldn't understand how you could make a little person adhere to set patterns and dismissed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My son is nearly three. He's a happy, curious, contented little toddler. He has slept through the night precisely three times. I'm 40 but look about 10 years older. How I wish I'd listened to Gina Ford. &lt;em&gt;Suzanne Lightfoot &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing the love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My four-year-old grandson clutches my knees and hugs me: "I love you, Granny." I bend down and put my arms around him: "I love you too, Ben."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm filled with a depth of emotion that is impossible to put into words because I never gave my four children what my grandson has just given me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never told them how much I loved them. I was a stay-at-home mum and my husband and I tried our best to make their lives full of fun and interest. We loved them and I hope they felt loved but this is my regret: I never put that love into words to my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love them still and I hope they still feel loved. I want to hold each one in turn in my arms and say: "I love you, James; I love you, Jenny; I love you, Naomi; I love you, Tom." But I think it's probably too late to do what my grandson has just taught me to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anji Dawkins &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much, too young&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret not waking my seven-year-old son to see his dead father before he left the house 20 years ago. I woke my older son, Robert, who was 12, and we said goodbye together as the coroner's officer took his body away. But I thought Andrew was too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband looked asleep and peaceful then. When I took both boys to see his body at the funeral parlour, he looked completely different, not like my husband at all. Andrew has subsequently said that he wished he had seen his father, and I think he might have coped with his death better if he had. &lt;em&gt;Glynis Platt &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embarrassing silence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the cinema watching a film. My daughter is 11 and I am a relatively old mother, enjoying this outing hugely. Such a treat, to take your child to see a new film – we do this often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, 20 minutes or so into the showing I am beginning to feel irritated. There is a gang of teenagers directly in front of us, chatting and laughing loudly. This continues. I grow yet more annoyed. These young people are not only interfering with my enjoyment but blatantly breaking cinema rules. I am a secondary school teacher and the instinct to take action is just too powerful to resist. I lean forward and say, in lowered tones of course, "Shush! Please be quiet!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works. The teenagers fall silent and remain so. I am very aware that I could have fallen foul of the kind of creative verbal abuse only adolescents have the skill to invent, but no – they obey, clearly cowed by my teacherly authority. I feel smug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daughter throws me a look that says, "I want you to die, right here and now." She is mortified beyond endurance and sits rigidly in her seat for the remainder of the film. Her body language radiates an inarticulate blend of shame and fury. When it ends, she turns and hisses, "I will never, ever go to see a film with you ever again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is now 21 and has remained true to her word. &lt;em&gt;Jayne Greenwell &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still my little boy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret making my son the "big boy" as soon as his sister was born. When she arrived, my son seemed so big, so grown-up, a real big brother. He was kind and gentle with her, giving her careful kisses and cuddles. As the&amp;nbsp;elder, I think I expected too much&amp;nbsp;of him. I expected him to understand that when I needed to put&amp;nbsp;his sister down for a nap it was easier if he played in the lounge rather&amp;nbsp;than in the bedroom with me. I forgot that until his sister arrived, he hadn't had the luxury of having mummy at home. Instead, he was at nursery while I worked. I forgot that he needed time with mummy too; forgot that everything had changed for him with his sister's arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now my daughter is just a bit older than he was then – and she seems so little. I regret that in my head he became the big boy overnight when really he was still my little boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alison Willis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tales of the riverbank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret not teaching our boys to fish. My father first took me fishing when I was two. He taught me respect for and wonder at the natural world and I grew to know his wisdom through his gentle patience. When my father died, the first book I turned to was about fishing – The Deepening Pool by Chris Yates – hoping to secure his presence through familiar stories of barbel and chub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sons are now 14 and 16 and, as with all teenage boys, they believe that their father's a fool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will never have the opportunity to watch a water vole swim two feet in front of their wellington boots or marvel at the iridescence of the kingfisher hunting in the rays of a midsummer sunrise. They won't have a chance to plead for one last cast in that liminal realm where all possibilities coalesce between daytime's end and the gathering gloom of night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days we walk the riverbanks of the Peak District. I feed bread to the trout while my wife and the boys humour me and look on with patronising resignation. I am entranced by the magic of water. I regret they will never be drawn towards such mysteries. I regret that, for them, water will always be merely H2O. &lt;em&gt;Steve Brooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A sense of loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my elder son left for university I set about cleaning and redecorating his abandoned bedroom. But the makeover only left me grieving for the unholy mess he used to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The familiar fug of unaired room with top notes of Lynx surrendered to malodorous gloss paint. I close my eyes to desperately try to recall&amp;nbsp;the old multi-coloured walls, topped with a nursery frieze of circus elephants marching incongruously above posters of death metal bands, a dartboard and noticeboards crammed with ticket stubs for festivals and concerts, party invitations and photos of drunken, gurning teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Floor space that used to be covered in Lego blocks, toys, discarded clothes, odd socks, and, more recently, crisp packets, cans, empty bottles and laptops is back to visible carpet. Adrian&amp;nbsp;Mole, Harry Potter and Stephen Fry used to sit amicably alongside science fiction and college textbooks piled on shelves. Towers of zombie DVDs, CDs and computer games leant perilously against the chest of drawers&amp;nbsp;covered in football stickers and cup stains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the pristine room somehow looks smaller and the self-righteous satisfaction I should have felt after my hard work is tainted by feelings of guilt and regret that I didn't photograph his teenage world before the sterile uniformity of magnolia paint reclaimed&amp;nbsp;it for the rest of the house. Euphoria has unexpectedly given way&amp;nbsp;to an overwhelming sense of loss for the material evidence of his childhood, which I have obliterated. &lt;em&gt;Diane Evans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I cannot cope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I regret adopting you. Importing a baby from a distant and troubled country into a fragile family unit was not a good idea. In retrospect, many years later, it seems madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose you because you seemed likely to be the one who would always be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were the silent one in a room of crying babies; sullen, indifferent and distant. Even then, at less than a year old, you looked as if you had had enough of life. Unable to walk or talk, you turned your head to the wall and refused – I was told – to even cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back home, slow development became special needs and then, with great speed, dysfunctional and alarming behaviour. I loved you despite it all, because of it all – at the expense of the rest of the family who felt excluded and ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You watched: the rows you had caused, the disruption you created with that blank, uninterested look I first saw and felt pity for all those years ago. Even now I don't know what you feel or if you feel anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it guilt, love or just despair I feel now looking at you? My family is fractured and despite my indulgent love, my tough love, my frustrated love, I have to finally admit that my overwhelming feeling is one of regret that we ever met, that I thought I could give you a better life. At last I have to admit, I cannot cope. &lt;em&gt;Anonymous &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My choice, my guilt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, 29 February 2004, the best thing ever happened to me – my pride, my reason, my son was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regret is: right son, wrong dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel a deep sense of guilt and regret that my son has been lumbered with an absent father because of my poor choice. &lt;em&gt;Anonymous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not an optimal time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest regret was allowing my sons to sell their original die-cast Optimus Prime Transformers. Now 27 and 29, they've never forgiven me. &lt;em&gt;Christine Proudlock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish I had iron will&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had done less ironing. Shell-shocked by a colicky newborn, I was rather dominated by my then mother-in-law who believed that only women who ironed tea towels possessed moral fibre. I ironed when I should have slept. I ironed in a frenzy to keep a semblance of order in the chaos of new motherhood. I ironed in a desperate and misguided attempt to be a good housewife and mother. I look back now and cringe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later, and the colicky baby is a 6ft-tall charmer of a rugby player. Two girls followed; they are now 11 and eight. The years passed; a divorce and a house move. I no longer iron. The flick and hang method produces great results and most creases vanish with a little body heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could sit my younger self down with a large gin and tonic and ask: is this what you would like your children to be doing when they are grown up and have their own babies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unclench, yield to the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspiring to fit in with someone else's views of how family and home life should be leads to unhappiness. My mother-in-law ironed tea towels because she took pleasure in "things being nice". She is bitterly full of regret at the paths not taken in life; a stack of precision ironing eases this inner tension. My version of things being nice is different. It consists of letting go a little, breathing out, realising that we have so little control in our lives really. It's just an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents don't have all the answers; just being human is good enough. &lt;em&gt;Anonymous &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting"&gt;Parents and parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/bereavement"&gt;Bereavement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/adoption"&gt;Adoption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/harrypotter"&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But the end came all too soon for Senesh, who was executed behind enemy lines in 1944 while trying to rescue Hungarian Jews, and for six million Jews who died in the Nazi death camps and whose lives and deaths are commemorated at Yad Vashem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president's hour at the Jerusalem memorial, set in a forest on the western edge of the city, was a powerful consolidation of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/21/obama-strong-call-israel-palestinian-peace" title=""&gt;principal message of his three-day visit&lt;/a&gt;: that America stands with the Jewish state as an unyielding friend and staunch ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was his second visit, he said after the ceremony. "Nothing equals the wrenching power of this sacred place," he said. "If you come here a thousand times, each time our hearts will break. For here we see the depravity to which man can sink, the barbarity that unfolds when we begin to see our fellow human beings as somehow less than us, less worthy of dignity and life; we see how evil can, for a moment in time, triumph when good people do nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes earlier, in the dim Hall of Remembrance, Obama – wearing a white yarmulke – stepped forward to rekindle the Eternal Flame and laid a wreath on a stone crypt containing the ashes of Holocaust victims, crouching close to the stone for a moment's contemplation. Then, flanked by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and president, Shimon Peres, the president stood with clasped hands and bowed head as Cantor Asher Hainowitz concluded the 10-minute ceremony with El Maleh Rachamim, a prayer for the souls of martyrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama also visited the unforgettable Children's Memorial, where the names and ages of 1.5 million Jewish youngsters are intoned in darkness relieved only by pinpricks of light; the Hall of Names, where the details of 4.2 million Holocaust victims are recorded; and the Museum of Holocaust Art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks after the ceremony, Obama said Yad Vashem was also a testament to man's capacity for good as well as evil, citing "the rescuers, the righteous among nations, who refused to be bystanders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memorial, he said, was "in the end a source of hope. For we are never powerless. In our lives we always have choices – to succumb to our worst instincts or to summon the better angels of our nature; to be indifferent to suffering wherever it may be, whoever it may be visited upon, or to display empathy that is at the core of our humanity.

He also praised the Walthamstow jobcentre – which is at the centre of the allegations – for its success in getting record numbers back to work. A leaked email from a jobcentre official referred to a "league table" of benefit sanctions in which Walthamstow was 95th out of 109.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iain Duncan Smith added that the order not to employ targets had gone out to jobcentre staff on innumerable occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told MPs in a debate on the budget: "The email is an incredibly serious matter. The email states Walthamstow is 95th in the league table out of 109." He pointed out that the employment minister Mark Hoban had assured the Commons earlier in the week under repeated questioning that this was not happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the discrepancy between the ministerial assurances and the reality on the ground required him to seek fresh commitments from the government that the independent review into the sanctions regime would get to the bottom of every sanction issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said she was very disappointed by the response of the work and pensions secretary, adding that the email clearly showed jobcentres were running league tables on imposing sanctions on claimants. She said of Duncan Smith: "Who does he think he is, putting together these league tables, and applying this pressure down to our own jobcentre to put the staff under the pressure to find reasons to sanction people in our community not because of their behaviour, but simply to meet a target. Who does he think is doing this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/iain-duncan-smith"&gt;Iain Duncan Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The charity said the figure equated to 567 children taking up the habit each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost one in three (27%) of under-16s have tried smoking at least once, the charity found after &lt;a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/lung/smoking/#children" title=""&gt;analysing data from surveys of children on their smoking habits conducted in 2010 and 2011&lt;/a&gt;. It urged the government to commit to putting all cigarettes in plain standardised packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last April, the government launched a consultation on plans to introduce mandatory standardised packaging for tobacco products. Health campaigners have welcomed the proposal, but opponents claimed it would lead to increased smuggling and job losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information generated by the consultation, which closed in August, is still being analysed by health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information at Cancer Research UK, said: "With such a large number of youngsters starting to smoke every year, urgent action is needed to tackle the devastation caused by tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Replacing slick, brightly coloured packs that appeal to children with standard packs displaying prominent health warnings is a vital part of efforts to protect health. Reducing the appeal of cigarettes with plain, standardised packs will give millions of children one less reason to start smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These figures underline the importance of sustained action to discourage young people from starting. Smoking kills and is responsible for at least 14 different types of cancer. Standardised packaging is popular with the public and will help protect children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We urge the government to show their commitment to health and introduce plain, standardised packs as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Australia became the first country in the world to put all tobacco products in standardised packs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cigarette packets and other products are all sold in a standardised colour, with only the brand name and graphic warnings visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/smoking"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople"&gt;Young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Through this deal with West Ham we are defying the gloomsters who predicted this landmark would become a dusty relic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Newham Mayor Sir Robin Wales insisted its £40m investment would "benefit Newham residents, London and the nation as a whole".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The east end club will leave their Upton Park home and move into the £429m stadium in time for the 2016-17 season, but the decision has already sparked a wide ranging debate about whether an asset built with public money should be effectively handed to a Premier League football club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both West Ham, who will pay £15m upfront towards conversion costs of at least £150m and an annual rent of £2m, and the London Legacy Development Corporation argue that the deal offers the best chance of a viable future for the stadium. West Ham have agreed a 99-year lease on the stadium with the LLDC, which is expected to unveil detailed plans for the new design on Friday, and will now embark on a concerted campaign to sell the scheme to fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Warner, the UK Athletics chairman, who said earlier this year that the process was becoming a "Stratford farce", said he was "excited that athletics will be a central part of a vibrant year-round solution to this iconic venue". The world athletics championship will take place in the stadium in 2017 and track and field is guaranteed 20 days use per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long running, often tense, negotiations between the club and the LLDC have resulted in a deal that both parties are understood to be happy with. For West Ham, it will give them a new, state of the art stadium at marginal upfront cost and expand their capacity to 54,000 as well as making the club an attractive investment opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the LLDC chairman Boris Johnson, who has long been convinced that a Premier League football team offers the best chance of success for the stadium, it will mean the reopened Olympic Park will have a guaranteed focal point and global profile. In addition to football and athletics, the stadium will also be used for pop concerts and other sporting events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson wanted a clause in the contract ensuring that the public purse would be protected if West Ham was sold in the next 10 years. David Gold and David Sullivan, who between them own two-thirds of the club, have insisted that it is not for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Ham say that they will offer 100,000 free tickets per season to local children and remain committed to "affordable family football".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeds from the sale of Upton Park for redevelopment will be used to help pay down the club's £70m debt. All the club's bank debt must be cleared by the time it moves to the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season as it will no longer have an asset to secure it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversion of the stadium to make it suitable for both football and athletics, with retractable seats and a new cantilevered roof to cover them, will cost at least £150m. Of that, the majority will come from the public purse including a £40m loan from Newham Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier deal to award the stadium to West Ham, following a bitter battle with Tottenham Hotspur, had to be abandoned when it became mired in "legal stasis" following challenges in the High Court and the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyton Orient owner Barry Hearn has vowed to press on with his judicial review of the process, claiming it will "crush" his club if it is not allowed to share the stadium with West Ham. But he has also conceded that he is ultimately unlikely to be successful and is drawing up alternative plans to move to Essex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, said: "I thought there was a really obvious end to this, which was going to be a multi-use stadium with football at its heart. I always suspected that would be the way to get the stadium best used."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was confident a way could be found to accommodate matches for the 2015 rugby World Cup in the stadium, despite the complication of having to pause construction work to host them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/westhamunited"&gt;West Ham United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympic-stadium"&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/boris"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson"&gt;Owen Gibson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"The situation is unpredictable and dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occasional isolated violence involving Burma's majority Buddhist and minority Muslim communities has occurred for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violence in Meikhtila was the latest sectarian unrest after clashes between Rakhine Buddhists and Muslim Rohingya last year in western Rakhine state left more than 200 people dead and 100,000 homeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also the latest challenge for the government as it tries to keep peace in the country and navigate the transition from military rule to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

All the rivers flow into it, the Fleet and the Tyburn and the Neckinger, carrying all the filth and scum and waste, the bodies of cats and dogs and the bones of sheep and pigs down into the brown water of the Thames, which carries them east into the estuary and from there into the North Sea and oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is raining in London. The rain washes the dirt into the gutters, and it swells streams into rivers, rivers into powerful things. The rain is a noisy thing, splashing and pattering and rattling the rooftops. If it is clean water as it falls from the skies it only needs to touch London to become dirt, to stir dust and make it mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody drinks it, neither the rain water nor the river water. They make jokes about Thames water killing you instantly, and it is not true. There are mudlarks who will dive deep for thrown pennies then come up again, spout the river water, shiver and hold up their coins. They do not die, of course, or not of that, although there are no mudlarks over fifteen years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman does not appear to care about the rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She walks the Rotherhithe docks, as she has done for years, for decades: nobody knows how many years, because nobody cares. She walks the docks, or she stares out to sea. She examines the ships, as they bob at anchor. She must do something, to keep body and soul from dissolving their partnership, but none of the folk of the dock have the foggiest idea what this could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You take refuge from the deluge beneath a canvas awning put up by a sailmaker. You believe yourself to be alone under there, at first, for she is statue-still and staring out across the water, even though there is nothing to be seen through the curtain of rain. The far side of the Thames has vanished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then she sees you. She sees you and she begins to talk, not to you, oh no, but to the grey water that falls from the grey sky into the grey river. She says, "My son wanted to be a sailor," and you do not know what to reply, or how to reply. You would have to shout to make yourself heard over the roar of the rain, but she talks, and you listen. You discover yourself craning and straining to catch her words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My son wanted to be a sailor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I told him not to go to sea. I'm your mother, I said. The sea won't love you like I love you, she's cruel. But he said, Oh Mother, I need to see the world. I need to see the sun rise in the tropics, and watch the Northern Lights dance in the Arctic sky, and most of all I need to make my fortune and then, when it's made I will come back to you, and build you a house, and you will have servants, and we will dance, mother, oh how we will dance...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what would I do in a fancy house? I told him. You're a fool with your fine talk. I told him of his father, who never came back from the sea – some said he was dead and lost overboard, while some swore blind they'd seen him running a whore-house in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all the same. The sea took him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When he was twelve years old, my boy ran away, down to the docks, and he shipped on the first ship he found, to Flores in the Azores, they told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's ships of ill-omen. Bad ships. They give them a lick of paint after each disaster, and a new name, to fool the unwary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sailors are superstitious. The word gets around. This ship was run aground by its captain, on orders of the owners, to defraud the insurers; and then, all mended and as good as new, it gets taken by pirates; and then it takes shipment of blankets and becomes a plague ship crewed by the dead, and only three men bring it into port in Harwich...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My son had shipped on a stormcrow ship. It was on the homeward leg of the journey, with him bringing me his wages – for he was too young to have spent them on women and on grog, like his father – that the storm hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was the smallest one in the lifeboat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said they drew lots fairly, but I do not believe it. He was smaller than them. After eight days adrift in the boat, they were so hungry. And if they did draw lots, they cheated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gnawed his bones clean, one by one, and they gave them to his new mother, the sea. She shed no tears and took them without a word. She's cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some nights I wish he had not told me the truth. He could have lied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They gave my boy's bones to the sea, but the ship's mate – who had known my husband, and known me too, better than my husband thought he did, if truth were told – he kept a bone, as a keepsake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they got back to land, all of them swearing my boy was lost in the storm that sank the ship, he came in the night, and he told me the truth of it, and he gave me the bone, for the love there had once been between us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I said, you've done a bad thing, Jack. That was your son that you've eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sea took him too, that night. He walked into her, with his pockets filled with stones, and he kept walking. He'd never learned to swim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I put the bone on a chain to remember them both by, late at night, when the wind crashes the ocean waves and tumbles them on to the sand, when the wind howls around the houses like a baby crying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rain is easing, and you think she is done, but now, for the first time, she looks at you, and appears to be about to say something. She has pulled something from around her neck, and now she is reaching it out to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Here," she says. Her eyes, when they meet yours, are as brown as the Thames. "Would you like to touch it?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to pull it from her neck, to toss it into the river for the mudlarks to find or to lose. But instead you stumble out from under the canvas awning, and the water of the rain runs down your face like someone else's tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Supported by the national lottery through &lt;a href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/"&gt;Arts Council England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/short-stories"&gt;Short stories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/original-writing"&gt;Original writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/fiction"&gt;Fiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/neilgaiman"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Like Lewis Carroll's original, this cartoon Alice is curious about the world – "she gives up her cash to fly around rash" – but the moral here is that this twentysomething Singaporean is so busy being "wild and reckless" that she stands to lose her chance at starting a family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to adult marriage and fertility education, Singapore-style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alice" is just one of 15 fairytales revamped for a new government-backed scheme to encourage Singaporeans to get married and start having babies earlier. Faced with a rapidly ageing society, skyrocketing housing prices, low birth rates and a population that works the longest hours in the world, this country of 5.3 million people has made various attempts over the years to encourage its citizens to marry and procreate, from government-funded speed-dating schemes to educational flyers on how to flirt. Now, however, it is changing tactics in search of a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aimed at 21- to 30-year-olds, the "&lt;a href="http://thesingaporeanfairytale.com/index.html" title=""&gt;Singaporean Fairytale&lt;/a&gt;" was created by four final-year university students who wanted to "find an interesting way to connect with young adults … on what it takes to start, live and be a family in Singapore", says the project manager, Chan Luo Er, 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fairytales are very accessible, as almost everyone grew up with a fairytale or two – our little poem on a woman's declining fertility as she ages ties in quite nicely with the Golden Goose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fairytales – which have been distributed by leaflet to universities around Singapore – include versions of Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel and Snow White, each involving a reworked "tale" that relates to fertility, sex or marriage, and a resulting "moral". The lesson with "careless" Alice, for example, is that "the extended adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women" and ends with a stark warning: "After 40, [fertility] drops 95%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scheme has proved popular on both its website and Facebook page among students who appreciate its attempts at creative humour. But it comes at a time of widespread disillusionment with the government's efforts to boost population figures. Just last month, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/15/singapore-crisis-immigration-financial-crisis" title=""&gt;parliament passed a controversial white paper&lt;/a&gt; that will see the island increase its population by a third by 2030, in effect granting citizenship to more foreigners and squashing the native population to just over half the total, in order "to remain a key node in the network of global cities". .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more tellingly, the fairytale initiative raises the question of what exactly the "Singaporean fairytale" is – a notion that both the government and the public have been debating in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we were much younger, I think many of us were exposed to the idea of obtaining the five Cs: cash, car, condo, country club and credit card," says Chan. "But we think times are changing … For us, the Singaporean fairytale is about living life the way that it makes you happy – so it could either be setting up your own business or even starting a family early."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists and critics say too much stress is placed on Singapore's TFR – total fertility rate – when the city-state really needs to assess its work-life balance instead. They say such government schemes fail to account for women who choose to be single, don't want babies, or are in non-heterosexual relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These fairytales barely begin to scratch the surface of the overwhelming decisions Singaporeans face when considering [life's] trade-offs and do little to provide them with the information they need to help them with that," &lt;a href="http://conventionally.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/the-singaporean-fairytale-a-critical-reading/" title=""&gt;wrote Fikri Alkhatib&lt;/a&gt; in response to the group's notion that "[Singaporeans] can have it all, if only you choose to".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Singaporeans aren't just 'choosing' not to have it 'all'. That's pretty extraordinarily insulting. They either cannot, or they choose to reject the idea of your 'all'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics point to other government-backed schemes promoting conventional themes about women's roles in society as proof that Singapore is simply out of touch. In the &lt;a href="http://dazzlingchong.com/singapore-events-author-writer/singapore-dating-guidebook-for-singles/#.UUqzIltHg5g" title=""&gt;Singapore Dating Guidebook&lt;/a&gt;, the modern-day, corporate woman is called a "Singapore New Independent Princess" (SNIP) and is offered dating advice such as: "If he lets you pick up the tab or worse – expects payment-in-kind – RUN!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It entrenches all the stereotypes and it's terrible that it's supported by the government," says Corinna Lim of Singapore's Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) of such advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an old-fashioned way of trying to solve this problem. It's going backwards when going forwards would be what Scandinavian countries are doing – making it easier for women to have babies and allowing men to take part [through paternity schemes], instead of pressuring women by saying they're not married yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government recently passed a £1bn parenthood and fertility package that will fund assisted reproduction and finally give fathers one week of paternity leave. It has also released a &lt;a href="http://app.sdn.sg/ChristmasCartoon.aspx" title=""&gt;series of educational cartoons&lt;/a&gt; for those looking for love, with tips such as: "Look out for a favourite topic your date has, or anything that your date has mentioned – this gives the feeling that you are interested in your date," and: "Scout your surroundings for possible chat topics, or comment on an interesting accessory your date is wearing" to avoid awkward conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the mere fact that the government feels it has to teach its citizens how to flirt may alone prove why the population isn't higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lim says: "It's all just an indication that our education system has really failed in giving us life skills, because we are all kind of one-dimensional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/singapore"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/fertility-problems"&gt;Fertility problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/ageing"&gt;Ageing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kate-hodal"&gt;Kate Hodal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But amid talks on the crisis in Syria and uncertain prospects for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, there is embarrassment over indiscreet comments by King Abdullah II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president is spending just over 24 hours in Jordan but the trip is being billed as a boost for a conservative monarch shaken by the events of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2011/mar/22/middle-east-protest-interactive-timeline" title=""&gt;Arab spring &lt;/a&gt;and alarmed by the escalating conflict between Bashar al-Assad and western-backed rebels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king's public position on Syria has hardened. &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/ap-interview-jordan-king-warns-syria-could-become-jihadist-state-says-assads-days-numbered/2013/03/20/f032d3f4-9167-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story.html" title=""&gt;On Wednesday, he warned&lt;/a&gt; that Assad's fall was inevitable because so much blood had been shed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But publication of &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/04/monarch-in-the-middle/309270/?single_page=true" title=""&gt;less carefully scripted royal remarks in a US magazine&lt;/a&gt; article caused irritation and red faces in Amman this week. According to Jeffrey Goldberg, writing in the Atlantic, Abdullah attacked Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, as having "no depth", ridiculed Assad for not knowing the meaning of "jet lag" and described the Muslim Brotherhood as a "masonic cult" and "wolves in sheep's clothing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdullah also had harsh words for devout Muslims, members of his own family and the powerful Mukhabarat secret police. Perhaps worse, he described loyalist but restive East Bank tribal leaders as "dinosaurs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel, said the king, may have to choose between "apartheid and democracy". In 1994, Jordan became the second Arab country after Egypt to sign a peace treaty with the Jewish state – one of the principal reasons for its close relationship with the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The royal palace called the article "inaccurate and dishonest" and suggested that there was confusion between the king's words and the journalist's "personal analysis and opinions". Goldberg said he was standing by his 10,000-word story and noted that his quotations, from recorded conversations, had not been denied. Naseem Tarawnah, a respected Jordanian blogger, &lt;a href="http://www.black-iris.com/2013/03/20/the-atlantic-article-on-king-abdullah-one-jordanians-perspective/" title=""&gt;called it "the most candid and in-depth interview we've ever seen involving the king&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts see Obama's visit to the Hashemite kingdom as a gesture of support because of the burden of hosting some 450,000 Syrian refugees. Abdullah is also thought to be quietly backing efforts to arm the anti-Assad rebels after initial caution in the face of pressure from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, though he publicly opposes any foreign military intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The king, clearly hoping for US financial support, said the Syrian refugees were equivalent to 30 million refugees flooding into the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human Rights Watch has, meanwhile, asked Obama to urge Jordan to stop rejecting Palestinian refugees, single males, and undocumented people seeking asylum at its border with Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdullah, king since 1999, has pledged to accelerate reforms in response to sporadic protests that began in 2011 and have been exacerbated by hefty fuel price rises. Unlike in other Arab countries, demonstrations have been overwhelmingly peaceful and security forces have acted with restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parliamentary elections in January went ahead after a partial boycott by Islamists. Still there has been little action to limit the king's monopoly on power while he faces an old guard of conservatives. The reform process is on Obama's agenda but he is unlikely to make any public criticism of the pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdullah is among the few foreign leaders who have addressed a joint session of the US Congress. Jordan has received more than $13bn in assistance since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Obama is also scheduled to visit the ancient rock-cut site of Petra, immortalised as the "rose-red city half as old as time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/king-abdullah"&gt;King Abdullah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianblack"&gt;Ian Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We've got to keep the pressure up so the government realises this is an issue close to people's hearts. We have to keep banging on about it so the government knows it is important to people, and that there are votes in it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smiths, who run independent bookshops in Warwick and Kenilworth, &lt;a href="http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/amazonuk-pay-corporation-tax-in-the-uk?utm_source=guides&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=petition_week_one" title=""&gt;launched their petition on Change.org&lt;/a&gt; on learning of the accusations against Amazon in November, and support has now hit a level they never foresaw. Calling on people to support their stance, the Smiths write in their petition that businesses like theirs have already been pushed "to the brink" by the huge discounts offered by online retailers, but that "what's even worse is that Amazon, despite making sales of £2.9bn in the UK last year, does not pay any UK corporation tax on the profits from those sales".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a level playing field and leaves independent retailers like us struggling to compete just because we do the right thing," say the Smiths. "As independent booksellers, we are happy with competition in the market but it must be on level terms and by dodging corporation tax in this way, Amazon start with an unfair advantage. As they grow bigger it's inevitable that shops like ours will be under even more pressure. That's bad for customers, bad for the high street and bad for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Amazon may be obeying the letter of the law – but they're certainly not being fair. Last year Starbucks announced that they had caved to public pressure and would look at their tax affairs in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online retailer defended their tax arrangements in a statement which declared: "Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within." The company serves "tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages dispatching products to all 27 countries in the EU," the statement continued. "We have a single European Headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already 100,989 people have signed up to the notion that these arrangements are unfair. Higson, author of the Young Bond series of novels, is one of them. "My position is that Amazon is convenient and cheap, but at the expense of traditional bookshops that have to pay the full tax rate. How can anyone else possibly hope to compete?" he said. "There has to be a level playing field. I would be bereft if we lost all our bookshops and all book sales were in the hands of one single retailer that sells books for next to nothing. For a company to barge in, hoover up all sales of everything online and not pay UK tax appears to be bordering on the criminal. And for the government to have let them set up in this way is also bordering on the criminal, it's certainly very stupid, but then what do I know about EU tax laws?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was updated at 9.30am on 22 March 2013, when the petition topped 100,000 signatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksellers"&gt;Booksellers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/amazon"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/efinance"&gt;E-commerce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonflood"&gt;Alison Flood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Watering down ratios will threaten quality. Childcare may be cheaper but children will be footing the bill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting out the results she expects from cutting staff numbers, she said: "The difference will be too few adults with too many little children; too few moments in the day for a toddler to have uninterrupted time with their key person, and too few early years practitioners to talk and work with parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Who will suffer most? The youngest, most vulnerable children. Their parents, who will know that their little children will get less attention, less conversation, less holding, than they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And with them, their early years practitioners who – though they may be well-qualified – are unable to provide the best that they can because they have had their greatest resource (their time for children) reduced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said policy mistakes would have knock-on effects for years to come, warning ministers: "Young children must not bear the costs of government getting this wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutbrown said many nursery staff wrongly believed the EYT qualification would give them parity of status with school teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yet again, those who work with younger children are offered a lesser status (and we should realistically anticipate, poorer pay and conditions that those who work with older children) but a title that makes them appear to have the same role and status," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Nutbrown's letter, Sharon Hodgson, the shadow children's minister, said: "The government's own expert adviser has echoed the concerns of parents and nursery staff that the quality of care for babies and toddlers is being undermined by this government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said David Cameron and the education secretary, Michael Gove, needed to "listen to Professor Nutbrown" and the government plans were "a serious threat to childcare quality and child safety".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experts say they won't do anything to drive down costs. Since these plans were announced, Labour has been calling on ministers to think again – it's time they listened," Hodgson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Education spokesman said: "Professor Nutbrown's review provided a valuable contribution to the development of our proposals for early education and childcare. We have taken forward several of her important recommendations but we recognise that reforms and improvement need to go much further if we are to give parents a proper choice of high quality childcare and early education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the evidence shows that quality and safety are linked to high-quality staff. Our reforms mean that only high-quality providers will be able to have this additional flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our preliminary work suggests providers will be able to attract quality staff: using the new ratios could enable nurseries to pay staff up to £3,000 more per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/earlyyearseducation"&gt;Early years education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/childcare"&gt;Childcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland has already reported road closures because of stranded vehicles on the A8 near Newtownabbey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Wilby, a forecaster for Meteogroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: "It is really just nasty conditions across most of the UK. The snow will fall from the M4 northwards, quite lightly in the south but heavily in the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Along with the heavy rain and flooding in the south-west, there will no doubt be a lot of disruption for the UK today. The heavy rain, snow and strong winds will continue into the weekend, with the heavy snow spreading south to East Anglia and Bristol tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I'm sorry to say that there is no sign of things getting any better next week. It's going to remain cold and bleak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/warnings/#?tab=map" title=""&gt;Met Office has issued a number of severe weather warnings&lt;/a&gt; urging the public to be prepared for "severe disruption" to transport and energy services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency has 18 flood alerts in place along the south-west coast warning of expected flooding, with a further 80 alerts issued to areas at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 4cm and 6cm (1.6in-2.4in) is set to fall over southern Devon and Cornwall on Friday, and up to 10cm (4in) on exposed southern slopes. Last night Cornwall council set up a designated control room to handle calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman, Dave Owens, said the county's fire and rescue service had received more than 50 calls, and eight properties had flooded. He said: "The main problem still appears to be surface water flooding which is continuing to affect a number of areas across Cornwall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports of flooding across the west of the county, including around Newlyn and Penzance, as well as in Mevagissey in mid-Cornwall – a community still recovering from the impact of last year's torrential downpours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency spokesman Ben Johnstone said: "We strongly urge people to sign up to flood warnings on the Environment Agency website, keep a close eye on local weather forecasts and be prepared for possible flooding. We also ask that people stay safe and not try to wade or drive through any deep water."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darron Burness, the AA's head of special operations, said: "It's going to be a real witch's brew of driving wind, rain and snow, which will inevitably cause disruption on the roads. Drivers should be well prepared as even short journeys can quickly turn bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Local Government Association said council gritting and ploughing teams would be out in force to try to ensure main roads remained passable where snow and freezing temperatures had been forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said hundreds of thousands of tonnes of salt had been spread this winter, but hundreds of thousands more tonnes were available in council depots and new deliveries were coming in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he said: "Council staff will be out and about over the next few days checking in on the people they know to be vulnerable and delivering hot meals and portable heaters, collecting prescriptions, defrosting pipes, fixing frozen boilers and making sure they have what they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also urged residents with elderly or vulnerable family or neighbours to check in on them to make sure they were coping with the latest freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leeds Bradford international airport has suspended all flights due to "adverse weather conditions" and a number of schools have already closed across the Bradford, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Huddersfield areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/flooding"&gt;Flooding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The scepticism extended to the head of the Downing Street policy unit, Sir John Hoskyns, who voiced the fear of making "almighty fools of ourselves" and worried that an essentially minor issue could precipitate &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2013/mar/21/thatcher-papers-1982-falkland-downfall" title=""&gt;the downfall of the Thatcher government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoskyns also told her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, that it was "rather unwise" to talk about the islanders' wishes being paramount, and criticised the public tone being struck: "If we talk about it as a combination of Stalingrad and Alamein we risk looking absurd. This is not a battle for our homeland and civilisation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfson made an explicit proposal in a note to Thatcher on 22 April 1982 to avoid war by way of buying off the Falklanders. He suggested that the "bribe" of a US-backed index-linked guarantee of $100,000 per family and lifetime guarantees allowing residents to settle in Britain, Australia or New Zealand with full citizenship, be offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the bribe which would have to convince Galtieri that they would vote for Argentine sovereignty," he told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters records in his private diaries made public today that he proposed his compensation scheme on 6 April, four days after the Argentinians had seized the islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I sent PM a memo saying we should get Argentina to pay compensation to the Falklanders – objections from John Coles [her foreign affairs adviser] that PM would through [sic] it out – need some blood first for credibility to H/C [House of Commons] and to Argentine – I doubt it. This Jingo mood will pass but JH [Hoskyns] thinks she will miss the change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's private secretary, Michael Scholar, said the PM had already considered a number of similar ideas but concluded that "it would mean the end of the government to pursue them now".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters did not give up however. Sir Geoffrey Howe, chancellor at the time, told him two days later that the compensation scheme was logical but would be taken as a sell-out. But her monetarist guru persisted with the idea throughout the crisis. He even revived the notion in a 1995 article for an Argentinian paper suggesting that they offer the islanders £475,000-a-head to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This March, the Falkland islanders voted by 1,513 to three to retain their status as an overseas territory of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argentinian president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, this week urged Pope Francis, (the former archbishop of Buenos Aires) to intervene against the "militarisation of Great Britain in the South Atlantic".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of the 1982 personal papers by the&lt;a href="http://www.margaretthatcher.org/" title=""&gt; Margaret Thatcher Foundation&lt;/a&gt; also show that the prime minister's chief whip, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2013/mar/21/thatcher-papers-1982-constituents-blood" title=""&gt;Michael Jopling, was warning her &lt;/a&gt;about the deep divisions of the Conservatives in the Commons that went well beyond her battle with the traditional Tory "wets".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular image of the Conservative party was defined at the time by reports of a belligerent meeting of the backbench 1922 committee, held on 3 April, as the taskforce set sail; the Foreign Office was sharply criticised and the meeting triggered Lord Carrington's resignation as foreign secretary the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the taskforce arrived off South Georgia on 21 April the chief whip had outlined six groups of MPs, ranging from the hardline "no surrender" group headed by Alan Clark, to more than a dozen MPs who thought not a single shot should be fired in anger or that the Falklands were not worth the effort and that it was dangerous to go on describing the islanders' views as paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jopling quotes one blunt Scots Conservative peer, Lord Drumalbyn, who told him: "I think the government are mad. We do not want the place, in any case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Tory MP, Marcus Kimball, said: "Let the Argentinians have the Falklands with as little fuss as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tory "wet" Sir Ian Gilmour said: "We are making a big mistake. It will make Suez look like commonsense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the distinguished political historian and MP, Robert Rhodes James, was reported to be "hopelessly defeatist, depressed and disloyal".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Clarke, later a cabinet minister under Thatcher, was bracketed with Sir Timothy Raison in the chief whip's note as hoping "that nobody thinks we are going to fight the Argentinians, we should blow up a few ships but nothing more".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Patten, later party chairman, rather more opportunistically offered to "write a supportive article in the press once the situation is clearer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another future cabinet minister, Stephen Dorrell, was described as being "very wobbly" and reportedly would "only support the fleet as a negotiating ploy; if they will not negotiate we should withdraw".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even dry-as-dust Thatcherite ministers outside Downing Street, such as Jock Bruce-Gardyne at the Treasury, sent Thatcher personal letters telling her that compromise "should not, one feels, be beyond the wit of man", posing the question that "more spectacular solutions may appeal to the gallery, but would they last?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to warn that failure "would involve irreparable damage to the government out of all proportion to the significance of the islands".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one MP, West Devon's Peter Mills, said: "My constituents want blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers, which are stored at the Churchill Archive Centre, in Cambridge, include a letter from John Murray, a close family friend of the Thatchers, sent after the UK's Falklands victory. It suggested it was time to re-open talks with Argentina and for the islanders to be moved on "perhaps with our assistance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of all this internal criticism appears to have driven Thatcher ever deeper into the heart of the Whitehall machine and made her rely only on a handful of her most senior ministers and officials, and military and intelligence chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was this isolation that perhaps led her to declare that she "never had any doubt about the rightness of the decision" and then to tell journalists to "rejoice, just rejoice" over the recapture by the British forces of South Georgia on 25 April 1982. There was one sequel when Thatcher made some unscripted remarks in a speech to Scots Conservatives on 14 May when she said: "What really thrilled me … is that when it really came to the test was being able to serve a great cause, the cause of liberty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These remarks led the seasoned war correspondent, James Cameron, to reflect in the Guardian: "I wish Mrs Thatcher a long and happy life, but I wish she could know what it is like to be on a landing craft getting her thrills first-hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/falklands"&gt;Falkland Islands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alantravis"&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
