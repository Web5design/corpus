Osborne said there may be a need to use "unconventional monetary instruments" in additional to quantitative easing – electronic printing of money – under which £375bn has already been pumped into the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pledged to cut corporation tax to 20% from April 2015 – to show Britain was "open for business" – and crack down on tax avoidance to bring in £4.6bn over the next five years. Stamp duty on AIM companies – smaller listed stock market companies – is to be axed. Tax-free childcare would also entice people back to work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow state of the housing market was shown before he started speaking by data showing that mortgage lending fell in February compared with January. Data released earlier also showed unemployment rose for the first time in 12 months – by 7,000 to more than 2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his fourth budget, Osborne said the forecast for growth in 2013 had been cut to 0.6% from the 1.2% that the Office for Budget Responsibility had expected at the time of the autumn statement in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne conceded that his target debt-as-percentage of GDP will now not fall until 2017/18 – two years later than he had hoped when he came to office in May 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor blamed the downturn in the eurozone, currently gripped by a new crisis in Cyprus which is trying to agree a €17bn bailout. Cyprus, he said, was "further evidence that the crisis is not over and the situation remains very worrying".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will be straight with the country – another bout of economic storms in the eurozone would hit Britain's economic fortunes hard," said Osborne as he said the OBR now expected the eurozone to show no growth this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth next year was cut to 1.8% compared with the 2% forecast at the time of the autumn statement. The OBR also predicted GDP growth in 2014 of 1.8% down from a forecast of 2% three months ago, then back on course for the December forecasts to 2.3% in 2015, 2.7% in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today I'm going to level with people about the difficult decisions we still face. It is taking longer than anyone hoped," Osborne said. "This is a budget for people who aspire to work hard and get on," Osborne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a budget for those who aspire to own their own home; who aspire to get their first job; or start their own business; … a budget for our aspiration nation," the chancellor said in a noisy House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband responded, saying: "All he offers is more of the same – higher borrowing and lower growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A more of the same budget from a downgraded chancellor. He is the wrong man in the wrong place at the worst possible time for the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne promised fiscal and supply side reforms to help the nation in a "global race" for jobs and businesses. Lindsay Hoyle, the deputy speaker, called on MPs, particularly the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, to be quiet as Osborne set out his growth plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor said that inflation – which has been above the 2% target since December 2009 – would remain the key focus but that the MPC would be able to provide additional guidance to the markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut the rate of corporation tax – which had been 28% at the time of the election – again, describing it as a "tax cut for jobs and growth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut to 20% from April 2015 was intended to "send a message to anyone who wants to invest here … that Britain is open for business".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure banks did not benefit from the lower corporation tax rate, he hiked the bank levy on balance sheets to 0.142%. This had already been rising to ensure that it brought in its target of £2.5bn a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/government-borrowing"&gt;Government borrowing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/office-for-budget-responsibility"&gt;Office for Budget Responsibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I am confident in declaring that our alliance is eternal, is forever," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short speech before Israeli parliamentarians, religious leaders, military figures and other dignitaries, Obama said: "We will never lose sight of the vision of an Israel at peace with its neighbours." The Palestinians were not mentioned by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air Force One touched down at about 12.30pm local time in glorious spring sunshine that prompted the president to discard his jacket shortly after the end of the ceremonials. His visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories is scheduled to last 50 hours before the 600-strong entourage departs for Jordan on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip has been billed primarily as a listening exercise by the White House, which has been anxious to set low-to-zero expectations of tangible outcomes. Talks between Obama and the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, are expected to focus on Iran, Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The president will also travel to Ramallah to meet Palestinian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama, Netanyahu and the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, wore broad smiles and matching blue ties as they strode along the red carpet. In his welcoming remarks, Peres thanked America for its unshakeable support and said "a world without your friendship would invite aggressions against Israel".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We long to see an end to the conflict with the Palestinians. To see the Palestinians enjoying freedom and prosperity in their own state. We extend our hand in peace to all the countries of the Middle East."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu said Israel sought peace with its Palestinian neighbours, and the need for the US-Israel alliance was "stronger than ever".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leaders spoke, Palestinian activists set up a protest camp consisting of about 15 tents on highly sensitive land near Jerusalem known as E1. They said their action was "to claim our right as Palestinians to return to our lands and villages".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar protest village in the area, named Bab al-Shams, was forcibly removed by Israeli security forces. The Israeli military may be reluctant, however, to deploy bulldozers and teargas against protesters during Obama's visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli air space was closed for about an hour for the arrival of Air Force One. Following the airport ceremonials, Obama inspected an Iron Dome mobile missile defence unit – largely funded by the US – that had been brought to Ben Gurion airport. He then flew to Jerusalem by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's schedule is dominated by at least five hours of talks between Obama and Netanyahu. Despite the lack of personal warmth between the two leaders, it will be the tenth time the pair have met face to face since both took office in early 2008. No other world leader has clocked up as many meetings with Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian nuclear programme is top of the agenda for Netanyahu, closely followed by the deteriorating security situation in neighbouring Syria. The stalled "peace process" with the Palestinians will also be discussed, along with Israel's regional relationships, principally with Turkey and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some US and Israeli officials say the trip is also aimed at recalibrating the tetchy relationship between the two leaders at the start of their second terms, and building trust on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has said it is a "chance to connect with the Israeli people" – who are largely distrustful of Obama. A poll published last week in the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv showed that 10% of Israelis had a favourable attitude towards Obama, and 17% defined their attitude towards the US president as "hateful".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his overture, Obama will deliver his keynote speech of the visit to an invited audience of Israeli university students at the international convention centre in Jerusalem on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will travel to Ramallah to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and prime minister, Salaam Fayyad. The seven-mile journey will be made by helicopter, thus avoiding crossing by land the seven-metre-high concrete separation wall that snakes through Jerusalem, cutting off much of the east of the city and the West Bank. The president will have a birds-eye view of the barrier and some of the 130-plus Jewish settlements that punctuate the West Bank landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Palestinians are hostile towards Obama, believing he failed to live up to early pledges to halt Israeli colonisation of the West Bank and tried to obstruct their quest for recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations. On Tuesday scuffles broke out between anti-Obama protesters and police near the Muqata, the presidential compound in Ramallah where Thursday's meeting is due to take place. Many posters bearing Obama's face have been torn or painted over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Palestinian Authority, 3,000 police officers will be on duty in the city alongside US security personnel. Five thousand Israeli police will be stationed in Jerusalem for each day of Obama's visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Israelis and Palestinians are sceptical about the chances of any real movement on the decades-old conflict. A poll &lt;a href="http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Post-poll-Obama-still-lacks-support-among-Israelis-306889" title=""&gt;published in the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; suggested that eight out of 10 Israelis did not believe that Obama would succeed in brokering a peace deal in the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian legislator, criticised the stated goal of the Obama visit of listening to both sides. "The issue is not about listening, but realising the reality of the situation and dealing with it," he told reporters in Ramallah. "The passivity of the United States is dangerous at a time when the whole notion of the two-state solution is at risk. Passivity is unacceptable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emerged that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, who has stated his commitment to trying to rekindle peace talks between the two sides, is to return to Jerusalem at the weekend to follow up on Obama's visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidential entourage leaves Israel for Jordan on Friday afternoon, and Kerry will head back on Saturday for further talks over dinner with Netanyahu. He had not been expected to return to the region until next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Kerry warned US senators that the chances of achieving a Palestinian state alongside Israel were diminishing. If a way forward was not found, he said, "the door, or window, or whatever you want to call it, to the possibility of a two-state solution could shut on everybody and that would be disastrous in my judgment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's itinerary for his 50-hour visit includes visits to the Israel Museum to view the Dead Sea Scrolls, Israel's haunting Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, and the graves of Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, and the assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will make a second trip – again by helicopter – to the Palestinian territories on Friday to visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. His entourage has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/israel-president-obama-visit" title=""&gt;taken over the historic King David hotel&lt;/a&gt; that overlooks the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The talks ended at about 4pm Moscow time and Sarris cancelled a planned press conference because of the lack of results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday the Cypriot parliament &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/20/cyprus-talks-avert-financial-meltdown" title=""&gt;rejected a plan&lt;/a&gt; to impose a levy on bank deposits in order to raise €5.8bn toward a €10bn bailout offered by the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus turned to Russia for a lifeline, seeking a five-year extension on a €2.5bn loan granted in December 2011 that is due to mature in 2016. It has also asked Russia to refinance the loan and lend an additional €5bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a very good first meeting, very constructive, very honest discussion," Sarris said after meeting Siluanov. "We've underscored how difficult the situation is." However, he said there were "no offers, nothing concrete".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarris said he would stay in Moscow until a deal was reached. "We'll now continue our discussion to find the solution by which we hope we will be getting some support," he said. Asked by reporters whether that meant simply renegotiating a loan, Sarris said: "No, we are looking at things beyond that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian banks and businesses are believed to have more than $30bn held in banks in Cyprus, the country's favoured offshore tax haven. The proposed levy would have forced rich Russians as well as not-so-wealthy Cypriots to contribute to the EU bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin was one of the loudest critics of the plan, calling it "unfair, unprofessional and dangerous". Russian officials expressed dismay that they were not informed of the proposal in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in its role as potential saviour, the Kremlin is believed to be haggling for shares in Cypriot banks and gas fields in exchange for the requested loan, the Russian press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday the Cypriot government denied reports that Cyprus Popular Bank, the country's second biggest bank, was being sold to Russian investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy minister, George Lakkotrypis, who oversees commerce, industry and tourism, was also in Moscow on Wednesday, although Cypriot officials said he was visiting a tourism exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His appearance in Moscow has fuelled speculation that the state monopoly Gazprom was seeking exploration rights over gas fields recently discovered off Cyprus's Mediterranean coast. Gazprom has denied the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"There's no two ways of looking at it - they would have known the budget is today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She warned Barclays that its tactic was likely to misfire. "They can't hide it from you thinking you're going to be too busy writing about the budget to notice it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays declined to comment on why it had chosen to release the information on budget day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person close to the company said the date of the release had been planned long before the budget. George Osborne set today as budget day on 11 December . The person close to Barclays said the bank only realised its bonuses release would clash with the budget "within the last few days".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson said corporate governance rules require Barclays to make the release at least 21 days before its &lt;a href="http://group.barclays.com/about-barclays/investor-relations/private-shareholders/annual-general-meetings" title=""&gt;annual meeting on 25 April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could have released it yesterday, they could've done it tomorrow. They could have done it last week," she said. "They didn't have to do it today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hunter, a policy member of the UK shareholder association, which aims to protect the rights of private shareholders, said Barclays' decision to release the bonus figures on Wednesday was "sneaky".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are trying to bury bad news," he said.

It is well above the $7.6bn profit the association estimated had been hit in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian airlines account for the largest single continental share, generating net profit of $4.2bn. Iata revised up profit forecasts for the region on the back of an expected higher demand for air freight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For European airlines, the association predicted profits of £533m for 2013, an improved figure but one it described as "barely different from breakeven".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Tyler, the Iata director general, said it was "a small step in the right direction" but considerable risks remain. "European Central Bank commitments with respect to the eurozone crisis and the slow economic recovery in the US should be pointing us towards a durable, if weak, upswing. But we have had two false starts already," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Improving conditions in early 2011 and 2012 disintegrated as the Eurozone crisis intensified. And it could happen again. The impact of the unfolding situation in Cyprus is a risk factor that cannot be ignored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler said airlines were dealing with unpleasant "curve balls" from governments, including European proposals for passenger rights legislation, US budget cuts to air traffic management, and anticipated increases to air passenger duty in the UK next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airline revenues are forecast to hit $671bn this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry"&gt;Airline industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/international-consolidated-airlines-group"&gt;International Airlines Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gwyntopham"&gt;Gwyn Topham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said the company would be supporting him throughout the legal process. "We will not prejudge the outcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a bid to boost morale at the paper where 24 staff have been arrested following the handing over of internal emails to the police, he said: "Producing Britain's most popular paper is a daily challenge, let alone in such difficult conditions, I am grateful to all of you for resilience and dedication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webster was arrested last February, along with four other Sun employees – one of whom, chief reporter John Kay, has already been charged. The CPS said it was making no further announcements on Tuesday on charging decisions in the remaining three cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One charge Webster faces relates to a Ministry of Defence official for whom payment of £6,500 was allegedly authorised by him on behalf of another Sun journalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan police have expanded their Operation Elveden investigation into alleged bribes paid to public officials. The Met is now investigating the passing of "confidential" information to journalists where no money is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webster is the fourth Sun journalist to be charged since the Elveden investigation was launched following the decision by News International owner News Corporation to co-operate with the police and hand over 300m internal emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the paper's former editor Rebekah Brooks, who was in charge between 2003 and 2009, and Kay were charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. Kay pleaded not guilty to the offence earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the paper's defence editor, Virginia Wheeler, was also charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's announcement brings the number of people charged under Operation Elveden to 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Appearing alongside the ballet's principal dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze, Volochkova alleged that the practice was "a lot worse" than when the company fired her 10 years ago for being overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2011/02/russias-black-swan.html" title=""&gt;Volochkova has repeatedly made similar claims in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but on Sunday's programme for NTV she said, "Girls are invited each in turn by the administrator, who explains that they are going to a party, with dinner and a follow-up, in bed and going all the way." She went on to assert that ballerinas were required to sleep "with certain oligarchs, some of them are members of the board of trustees or just the person organizing the party".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to rejecting Volochkova's claims outright, Iksanov also criticised Tsiskaridze for stating during the debate that he was ready to take over as general director. At a press conference held at the Bolshoi building in Moscow yesterday, Iksanov called on Tsiskaridze – who can't be fired by the company – to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy comes at a time of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2013/mar/13/russian-ballet-wars" title=""&gt;huge turmoil for Russia's leading dance company&lt;/a&gt;, following the acid attack on its artistic director Sergei Filin on 17 January. While dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has been detained after confessing to organising the attack, &lt;a href="http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2013/mar/12/bolshoi-acid-attack-members-support-dancer" title=""&gt;more than 300 company members&lt;/a&gt; have signed an open letter to President Vladimir Putin rejecting the notion that the soloist was responsible as "absurd".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/bolshoi"&gt;Bolshoi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre"&gt;Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/dance"&gt;Dance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/mariinsky-ballet"&gt;Mariinsky Ballet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/ballet"&gt;Ballet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-trueman"&gt;Matt Trueman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The GRA represents more than 13,000 Irish rank-and-file officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of deepening tension between the GRA and the government, off-duty gardaí held up placards stating "Taoiseach says it's fair. Senators lose €600. Garda loses €2,000. Fair?", referring to a cost-saving deal between the coalition and the trade union movement from which the GRA was excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GRA's general secretary, PJ Stone, said his members were not offered a seat at recent national wage negotiations between public sector unions and the Fine Gael-Labour government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said gardaí had been "sidelined" in an updated deal, first hammered out in Croke park stadium several years ago, that would save billions in public sector pay and pensions in return for no redundancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone said: "It is a disappointment to the GRA to learn that the government were now intent on extending the Croke park deal to facilitate savings to the magnitude of €60m over three years from the pension and pay of members of An Garda Síochána.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we are to look at the deal now being voted upon by the trade union movement, we see that it is blatantly unfair. How our taoiseach can see this as fair is simply baffling. Any public servant working nine to five and earning €65,000 per year will not have their pay reduced; while a garda earning €38,000 per year will suffer a pay cut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the GRA passed a vote of no confidence in Ireland's justice minister, Alan Shatter, after he and the cabinet pressed forward with plans to cut Garda pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row over pay cuts in Ireland's police force has reached the point where some branches of the GRA across the republic have already voted for a national "blue flu" day – a de facto police strike when officers would fail to turn up for duty claiming they were ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last "blue flu" strike in Ireland took place in May 1998 when large numbers of gardaí took sick leave in protest over pay and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The then Garda commissioner, Pat Byrne, described it as a "black day" for the force, but within weeks a pay increase had been negotiated with the unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald"&gt;Henry McDonald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A planned rise in fuel duty, due to take place in September, may be delayed or even scrapped altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Treasury braces itself for a grim outlook, amid signs that the Office for Budget Responsibility will again downgrade growth forecasts, the chancellor will move to show that he is committed to stimulating the economy by announcing new capital spending projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne and his Liberal Democrat deputy, Danny Alexander, told the cabinet on Tuesday that they will direct an extra £2.5bn over the next two years into capital projects after imposing a new 1% cut on some Whitehall departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid criticism that the Tories blundered in the Eastleigh byelection, by failing to focus on the challenge of the rising cost of living, the chancellor aims to turn the focus in his budget statement to support for hard pressed families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures on the personal allowance and fuel duties are carefully balanced to satisfy both sides of the coalition. This follows the disastrous handling of last year's budget, which Osborne blamed on the Lib Dems after they allegedly leaked detail of his key measure, to cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lib Dems made raising the personal tax allowance to £10,000 the first pledge in their general election manifesto. A source said: "Reaching the £10,000 figure will represent a major coup for the Lib Dems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action on the fuel duty increase will be warmly welcomed by Tory MPs in marginal constituencies. Robert Halfon, the MP for Harlow, who has led a lengthy campaign against fuel duty increases, told the Guardian: "I am very hopeful this will be a cost of living budget and that the chancellor is listening regarding fuel duty being a toxic tax and one of the biggest breaks on people getting back on their feet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian McBride, Gordon Brown's former press secretary, tweeted: "I bet the 2015 Tory posters are already written: 'Fuel duty frozen for 5 years'. Potent stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor will also scrap a planned 6p rise, due next month, on the price of a pint of beer and will do away with the beer duty escalator, according to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Treasury source said: "This will be a budget that is going to help people who want to work hard and get on. It will continue with the painstaking work of putting right what went so badly wrong in the British economy. While it is a tougher road than anyone hoped, and while there are no easy answers, we are making progress and the budget will keep Britain on the right track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plan to offer childcare support of £1,200 per child for families where both parents are earning up to £150,000 each was criticised by the Mothers at Home Matter charity for discriminating against stay-at-home mothers. Campaigners seized on an internal treasury document, accidentally published on its website, which said that families where both parents want to work, but cannot afford to, "are in greater need".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row prompted a call by Tory MPs for the introduction of a married tax allowance. Robert Buckland, MP for Swindon South, said: "The best way to deal with this is to advance what was the Conservative agenda to have a transferable tax allowance that would benefit the family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor's move on departmental spending served notice of tough times when he told the cabinet that a series of Whitehall departments will face an extra 1% cut over the next two years to allow him to divert £2.5bn towards capital spending and to put £1.2bn aside for the next spending period in 2015-16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move showed the success of the so-called "National Union of Ministers", who have been resisting further cuts to their departments, after a trio of Tory cabinet ministers emerged largely unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Eric Pickles, whose departmental budgets are not ringfenced, have managed to ensure that key spending areas will escape the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor told ministers there would be a further 1% cut a year on all "unprotected departmental resource budgets" over the next two years. The three budgets that will remain immune from the cuts are health, schools and international development, though the last will be adjusted downwards if Britain's gross national income (GNI) shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence will benefit from what the prime minister's spokesman described as "exceptional flexibility", allowing £1.6bn of its underspend to be "rolled over" into 2013-14 and 2014-15. Police grants will not be affected by cuts for 2013-14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks a significant victory for May, the home secretary, because the police budget accounts for two-thirds of the total Home Office budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Leslie MP, the shadow Treasury minister, said: "An increase in capital spending of just £2.5bn compares to deep cuts of £12.8bn to infrastructure investment in the last three years on the plans George Osborne inherited. If this is the only additional investment in infrastructure in the budget it will be a huge disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business groups, the IMF and even Vince Cable have all said now is the right time to invest, at record low interest rates, in building homes, road and schools to create jobs now and strengthen our economy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The test for the budget is whether it delivers bold action to kickstart our flatlining economy and significant tax cuts for middle and low-income families, not a £3bn tax cut for the very richest and more of the same failing policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement by Osborne over the weekend that he will bring forward the single-tier pension by one year to 2016 will give the exchequer a windfall of £5.5bn as contracting out is ended. This will lead to increased national insurance contributions (NICs). But £4.3bn of this will be used to fund the costs of long-term social care or be used to compensate government departments facing increased employer NIC payments. This leaves the chancellor little room to raid these funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2013/mar/20/budget-2013-live-blog-osborne" title="Budget 2013 - live"&gt;Follow Budget 2013 live coverage here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/fuel-duty"&gt;Fuel duty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/tax"&gt;Tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/petrol-prices"&gt;Petrol prices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/incometax"&gt;Income tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"The reunification of German anglers was long overdue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His western counterpart, Peter Mohnert, president of the VDSF, said German anglers had finally been forced to face the fact that the two organisations needed each other, "otherwise angling and fishing in Germany is going to sink into insignificance".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The east's 170,000 anglers, 650,000 from the west, plus an additional 2 million independent anglers, could have far more of an impact lobbying together on environmental and economic issues than if they remained apart, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many anglers agree that they might have continued existing separately for years had it not been for the increasing pressures their hobby faced in recent years, most notably from new environmental legislation and water access restrictions. "It's quite simple: we need a strong lobby," said Markstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real challenges are yet to come. There is talk of the differing so-called &lt;em&gt;fischereiphilosophie,&lt;/em&gt; or fisheries philosophy, of the DAV and VDSF, which will have to be overcome if the two bodies are to work together successfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communist East Germany, DAV members viewed themselves as sportsmen and women who thrived on competition. Regulation was also more liberal and whoever paid the 10&amp;nbsp;ostmark membership fee had free rein to fish whenever and wherever he or she liked, and even received train-ticket discounts to enjoy the pursuit throughout East&amp;nbsp;Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison, West German anglers were obliged to observe a nighttime ban, were restricted to certain waters and viewed fishing as more of an ecological than competitive pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While talk about a union has been going on for years, more serious discussions were stalled by a range of issues. West German anglers accused East Germans of co-operating closely with the communist secret police, the Stasi – indeed, former Stasi members remained active in the DAV – while East Germans accused the west of being overbearing and restrictive, and planning a hostile takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real goodwill breakthrough came when the two sides agreed to join forces to vote for a "fish of the year". They united over the freshwater lamprey – a scaleless vertebrate, not dissimilar to an eel, that sinks its teeth into other fish and sucks their blood. A metaphor for the years of strife, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DAFV's new president, Christel Happach-Kasan, has said that she is determined to make the merger work, despite sceptics who say the differences, after decades of division, are too great to overcome. But that is what some critics said about German reunification and that, arguably, has come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happach-Kasan, a biologist and politician from the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, has said the union "must work", adding that the endeavour is helped by the fact that, along with her passion for fishing, she is "completely untainted by a previous history in either of the two associations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's important now is to combine our interests and to present a united front to the outside world," she added, calling on members to show "more mutual tolerance and respect".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers have remarked that the newly merged associations could set an example for motor sport and archery – the only other sports in Germany still split along eastern and western lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/fishing"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kateconnolly"&gt;Kate Connolly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Click here to view video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea is investigating a suspected cyber-attack that paralysed systems at major media and banks on Wednesday, amid speculation that the North could be responsible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The computer networks of three broadcasters - KBS, MBC and YTN - and two banks, Shinhan and Nonghyup, froze at around 2pm local time. Shinhan said its ATMs, payment terminals and mobile banking in the South were affected. TV broadcasts were not affected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warnings reportedly appeared on some computer screens from a previously unknown group calling itself the "WhoisTeam", showing skulls and a message stating it was only the beginning of "our movement".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A presidential aide said it had not been determined whether North Korea was involved, &lt;a href="http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/03/20/40/0301000000AEN20130320008000315F.HTML"&gt;state news agency Yonhap reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South's communications watchdog raised its alert level on cyber-attacks to level three on a five-tier scale, tripling the number of staff monitoring the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police official told Reuters: "We sent down teams to all affected sites. We are now assessing the situation. This incident is pretty massive and will take a few days to collect evidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defence minister Kim Kwan-jin covened an emergency security meeting and raised the military's cyberattack readiness level from three to four on the five-tier system, Yonhap reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks have since restored their operations, but the television stations could not say when they would be able to get their systems back up. Some workers at the stations could not boot their computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development comes amid high tensions on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang reacted furiously after the United Nations Security Council &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/08/north-korea-rages-un-sanctions"&gt;tightened sanctions&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month because of its latest nuclear test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week it accused the United States and South Korea of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/15/north-korea-usforeignpolicy"&gt;staging cyber attacks against it&lt;/a&gt; following a two day internet outage that disrupted its main news services and websites. Access to the internet is restricted to a tiny proportion of the North's population, perhaps a few thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Bangkok-based Loxley Pacific, the broadband internet provider for North Korea, told the Associated Press on Friday that the origin of that attack was unclear. The South denied involvement and the US military declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinkston, north east Asia project director for the International Crisis Group, said the timing of today's problems was interesting given Pyongyang's accusations of US cyber-attacks, and said that there were ongoing concerns about North Korea developing its hacking capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the top US commander in the region &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-28/north-korea-s-cyberwarfare-strength-grows-general-says.html"&gt;told a Congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt;: "North Korea employs sophisticated computer hackers trained to launch cyber infiltration and cyber attacks." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Thurman, the commander of US Forces Korea, suggested they were "increasingly employed against a variety of targets including military, governmental, educational and commercial institutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the South has been previously targeted by hackers from the North. Anti-virus firm McAfee said it believed a 10-day denial of service attack in 2011 &lt;a href="http://blogs.mcafee.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/McAfee-Labs-10-Days-of-Rain-July-2011.pd"&gt;originated from the North&lt;/a&gt; and suggested it was an attempt to test the South's computer defences in preparation for potential future conflicts. Another attack on a newspaper last year was also blamed on North Korean hackers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's got to be a hacking attack," Lim Jong-in, dean of Korea University's Graduate School of Information Security, told the Associated Press. "Such simultaneous shutdowns cannot be caused by technical glitches."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warned that it would take months to determine the source of the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/cybercrime"&gt;Cybercrime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/hacking"&gt;Hacking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Late on Tuesday night, the eurozone governments said despite the vote Cyprus would still need to raise a third of the proposed €17bn bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finance minister, Michael Sarris, is in Moscow amid mounting speculation that the Kremlin could step in with a rescue plan to safeguard high levels of Russian deposits in Cypriot banks. Sarris said he would stay in Russia until a deal was reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus has asked Russia for a five-year extension of an existing loan of €2.5bn that matures in 2016, and a reduction in the 4.5% interest rate. Sarris told reporters in Moscow: "We're hoping for a good outcome, but we cannot really predict."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades spoke with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday night. Moody's ratings agency estimated Russian banks had extended up to $40bn in loans to companies in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Cyprus does not find the money to secure a bailout and satisfy officials in the eurozone and the IMF, its biggest banks could fail. Banks remained closed across the island on Wednesday to avert a potential bank run. They had been scheduled to reopen on Thursday but it is possible they will remain closed for the rest of the week, or until a deal can be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On German TV, the finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, warned Cyprus that the biggest crisis-stricken banks might never be able to reopen if Cyprus rejected bailout terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 56-member Cypriot parliament rejected the bank tax by 36 votes, with 19 abstentions (one MP was absent), even though the proposal had been tweaked to remove any levy on savings less than €20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounts holding €20,000-€100,000 still faced a 6.75% levy, and any account with more than €100,000 would be hit by a tax of 9.9%, despite calls by Cyprus's eurozone partners not to tax accounts below €100,000 – the level at which an EU-wide guarantee kicks in if a bank in the bloc goes bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return for the levy, savers would be given shares in Cypriot banks and possibly a share in domestic gas reserves – but only once the country is back on its feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the no vote was announced, the euro had slumped to its lowest level in four months on Tuesday after speculation that Sarris had resigned. The finance minister later texted Reuters from Moscow to deny the rumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the crisis escalating, an RAF flight carrying €1m in low-denomination notes landed in Cyprus to provide cash for 3,000 British service personnel based there. With local banks shut since Friday and electronic transactions halted, although cash machines are working, the Ministry of Defence said the euros had been flown in as "contingency measure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2,000 of the military staff, typically posted to the island for 18 or 24 months, have their salaries paid into local accounts. The MoD said it was approaching personnel to ask if they want their March and future months' salaries paid into UK bank accounts, rather than Cypriot accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marios Mavrides, an MP and former finance minister, raised the prospect of Cyprus becoming the first to leave the euro. He told BBC2's Newsnight: "If we cannot come up with the €5.8bn in a few days then I think we will go to the Cyprus pound. That will be the end of Cyprus in the eurozone. We're going to exhaust all other possibilities, but what can we do? If we have no other solution we cannot leave the people without money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the government was trying to renegotiate the deal with the Eurogroup, which had left open the option of Cyprus finding the money it needs to keep its banking system afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some ideas. We are thinking of nationalising the pension funds and provident funds of the state employees," Mavrides said. "That is about €2bn-€3bn, and we do have some other ideas which will come up in the next few days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/angeliquechrisafis"&gt;Angelique Chrisafis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This will put pressure on teachers to rely on rote learning without understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Inappropriate demands will lead to failure and demoralisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This curriculum betrays a serious distrust of teachers, in its amount of detailed instructions, and the education secretary has repeatedly ignored expert advice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The academics urge teachers and parents to respond to the consultation, due to end in April, calling for a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new draft curriculum contains plans for pupils to memorise their times tables up to 12 by age nine, multiply and divide fractions by age 11 as well as learn topics such as geometry, long division and multiplication and decimals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comes in the same week that two teaching unions announced a series of strikes starting this summer in a continuing row over pay, pensions and workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools across the country are likely to be affected by the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/mar/18/teaching-unions-announce-summer-strikes?CMP=twt_fd" title=""&gt;rolling programme of walkouts&lt;/a&gt;, along with a national strike before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move, announced by England's two biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT, is an escalation of a continuing dispute with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove"&gt;Michael Gove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/curriculums"&gt;Curriculums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching"&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The president will also travel to Ramallah to meet Palestinian leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli air space will close for about an hour for the arrival of Air Force One. Obama will be greeted by Netanyahu, who was sworn in this week as leader of the new Israeli government; President Shimon Peres; other senior politicians and dignitaries; a contingent of Israeli soldiers; and a military orchestra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president's first task is to inspect an Iron Dome mobile missile defence unit – funded by the US – that has been brought to Ben Gurion airport. He will then fly to Jerusalem by helicopter, though most of his entourage of 600 will travel by road, requiring the closure of the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day will be dominated by at least five hours of talks between Obama and Netanyahu. Despite the lack of personal warmth between the two leaders it will be the tenth time they have met face to face since both took office in early 2008. No other world leader has clocked up as many meetings with Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian nuclear programme is top of the agenda for Netanyahu, closely followed by the deteriorating security situation in neighbouring Syria. The stalled peace process with the Palestinians will also be discussed, along with Israel's regional relationships, principally with Turkey and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some US and Israeli officials say the trip is also aimed at recalibrating the tetchy relationship between the two leaders at the start of their second terms and building trust on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has said it is a "chance to connect with the Israeli people", who are largely distrustful of Obama. A poll published last week in the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv found that only 10% of Israelis had a favourable attitude towards Obama, with 17% defining their attitude towards the US president as "hateful".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of his overture, Obama will deliver his keynote speech of the visit to an invited audience of Israeli university students at the International Convention Centre in Jerusalem on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will travel to Ramallah to meet the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the prime minister, Salaam Fayyad. The seven-mile journey will be made by heliicopter, thus avoiding crossing the 24ft-high concrete separation wall that snakes through Jerusalem, separating off parts of the east of the city and the West Bank. However, the president will have a bird's-eye view of the barrier and some of the 130-plus Jewish settlements that punctuate the West Bank landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Palestinians are hostile to Obama, believing he failed to live up to early pledges to halt Israeli colonisation of the West Bank and tried to obstruct their quest for recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations. On Tuesday, scuffles broke out between anti-Obama protesters and police near the Muqata, the presidential compound in Ramallah where Thursday's meeting is due to take place. Many posters bearing Obama's face have been torn or painted over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Palestinian Authority, 3,000 police officers will be on duty in the city alongside US security personnel. Five thousand Israeli police will be stationed in Jerusalem for each day of Obama's visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Israelis and Palestinians are sceptical about the chances of any real movement on the decades-old conflict. A poll &lt;a href="http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Post-poll-Obama-still-lacks-support-among-Israelis-306889"&gt;published in the Jerusalem Post on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; suggested eight out of 10 Israelis do not believe that Obama will succeed in brokering a peace deal in the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian legislator, on Tuesday criticised the visit's stated goal of listening to both sides. "The issue is not about listening but realising the reality of the situation and dealing with it," he told reporters in Ramallah. "The passivity of the United States is dangerous at a time when the whole notion of the two-state solution is at risk. Passivity is unacceptable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it emerged on Tuesday that the secretary of state, John Kerry – who has stated his commitment to trying to rekindle peace talks between the two sides – is to return to Jerusalem at the weekend to follow up on Obama's visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presidential entourage leaves Israel for Jordan on Friday afternoon but Kerry will head back on Saturday for further talks over dinner with Netanyahu. He had not been expected to return to the region until next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Kerry warned US senators that the chances of achieving a Palestinian state alongside Israel were diminishing. If a way forward was not found, he said, "the door, or window, or whatever you want to call it, to the possibility of a two-state solution could shut on everybody and that would be disastrous in my judgment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's itinerary for his 50-hour visit includes visits to the Israel Museum to view the Dead Sea Scrolls, Israel's haunting Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, and the graves of Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism, and the assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will make a second trip – again by helicopter – to the Palestinian territories on Friday to visit the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His entourage has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/18/israel-president-obama-visit"&gt; taken over the historic King David hotel&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The ANI website is frequently used by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) to post messages. It was not possible to independently verify the claim and the French foreign ministry had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANI quoted a man who identified himself as Ghairawani , a spokesman for Aqim, as saying Verdon was killed on 10 March "in response to the French military intervention in the north of Mali". Verdon and another Frenchman had been kidnapped from their hotel room in eastern Mali in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French troops launched a campaign in January to help the country's government drive Islamic militants out of northern Mali.

"The rescue operation is difficult because huge amounts of rocks have to be removed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no contact with the trapped miners because the cave-in cut communication lines, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mine is in the Silesia region, near Poland's borders with Germany and the Czech Republic. It has been in operation since 1974. The state-controlled KGHM is Europe's second-biggest copper producer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland has large numbers of mines, mostly in the heavily industrialised Silesia region. In 2006 a gas explosion at a coal mine in the region killed 23 workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/poland"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The banks have been shut since Friday and electronic transactions halted, although cash machines are still working and the Ministry of Defence said the euros were being flown in as "contingency&amp;nbsp;measure".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 2,000 of the military staff, typically posted to the island for 18 or 24 months, have their salaries paid into local accounts. The MoD said it was "approaching personnel to ask if they want their March, and future months' salaries paid into UK bank accounts, rather than Cypriot accounts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the no vote was announced, the euro had slumped to its lowest level in four months after speculation that the Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, had resigned. Sarris, who was in Moscow ahead of his meeting with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday, was forced to text-message Reuters to deny rumours that he had quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also reports that the banking arm of the Russian energy company Gazprom might pump cash into Laiki, Cyprus's second largest bank, which is in urgent need of a capital injection. Gazprom officials insisted this was not being planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has already lent €2.5bn to Cyprus and has close ties to the country after its nationals flooded the island's banks with cash to take advantage of high interest rates and a lax approach to account vetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 56-member Cypriot parliament rejected the bank tax by 36 votes with 19 abstentions (one MP was absent) even after the proposal had been tweaked during the day to remove any levy on savings below €20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accounts holding €20,000 to €100,000 still faced a 6.75% levy, and any account with more than €100,000 a tax of 9.9%, despite calls by Cyprus's eurozone partners not to tax accounts below €100,000 – the level at which a European Union-wide guarantee kicks in if an EU bank goes bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return for the levy, savers would be given shares in Cyprus's banks and possibly a share in the nation's gas reserves – once the country is back on its feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cypriot MPs had called the levy blackmail and a disaster for Cyprus, and the president, Nicos Anastasiades, had been promising to discuss a possible plan&amp;nbsp;B even before the no vote, which had appeared inevitable ever since the bailout terms were revealed on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marios Mavrides, a government MP and former finance minister, raised the prospect of the country becoming the first to leave the euro. He told BBC2's Newsnight: "If we cannot come up with the €5.8bn in a few days then I think we will go to the Cyprus pound. That will be the end of Cyprus in the eurozone. We're going to exhaust all other possibilities but what can we do? If we have no other solution we cannot leave the people without money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite what is now seen as a botched decision to try to confiscate the funds of savers with less than €100,000, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and chair of the eurogroup, issued a terse statement demanding that the Cypriot pledge at the weekend be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany sought to contain any damage from the Cypriot debacle. "We've taken adequate precautions to ensure that today's decision in Cyprus will have no negative effect on the rest of the eurozone," said Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were calls for another emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers as the dangerous brinkmanship between Nicosia and the rest of Europe escalated.Before the vote, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the Nicosia parliament chanting "No" and holding banners such as "Cyprus today, who's next tomorrow?" in reference to eurozone partners such as Spain and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Brussels insist the Cyprus savings tax will be a one-off and the guarantee stands across the rest of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative ruling party aligned to Anastasiades had attempted to postpone the bill to another day but opposition MPs insisted on a vote. The 19 members of the president's party abstained even though the government had signed up to Saturday's bailout to release €10bn of eurozone funds and raise €7bn through a combination of the bank levy and new austerity measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia has expressed its anger about the levy, which would hit its nationals, 30 of whom are reported to have been granted Cypriot citizenship after either depositing at least €17m into local banks, making investments of €30m or registering businesses on the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Chizov, Russia's envoy to the EU, likened the levy to a "forceful expropriation" that could wreck Cyprus's financial system. "When the banks open, people will rush to withdraw their deposits – that's another threat – and then the whole banking system can collapse," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials also moved to avert concerns that its own banks could face difficulty if the taps remained turned off in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratings agency Moody's estimated that Russian banks had extended up to $40bn in loans to companies in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markets will now be looking to the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide crucial liquidity lifelines to the Cypriot banking sector, which has expanded to eight times the size of the nation's €17bn economy as a result of the Russian cash deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ECB spokesperson said: "The ECB takes note of the decision of the Cypriot parliament and is in contact with its troika partners [the EU and the IMF]." Alex White, analyst at JP Morgan Chase, said: "If it is not ultimately reversed, we think the treatment of Cyprus will come to look like a watershed for the region. The objective in this case is to remove the implied support for the Cypriot banking system, so it can no longer function as a large offshore financial centre while receiving a European backstop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yields – a measure of the cost of borrowing – on Italian government bonds edged above 5% on Tuesday, a sign of potential tensions in the eurozone while yields on British government bonds, gilts, fell to their lowest levels in 2013 of 1.82% as the UK appeared a relative safehaven. Brent crude dropped by $2 to €107.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mavrides said that the government was trying to renegotiate the deal with the Eurogroup, which had left open the option of Cyprus itself coming up with the money it needs to keep its banking system afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some ideas.

Instead care homes or parents will be asked to carry out some checks on where the child is, and the absence will be recorded and monitored to identify patterns of concern which a police missing person co-ordinator can take up with the care home, social services and other agencies involved in safeguarding the young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers will still attend reports of "missing" people – where the absence is out of character or suggests a possible crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changed police approach comes after pilot schemes in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Staffordshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geenty rejected criticism that this handed sole responsibility for checking on the whereabouts of absent children to care and social workers who had singularly failed to protect young people in cases like Rochdale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the moment we have a system which does not protect them as well as it should do," said Geenty. "We have had to change it for this reason. The new approach means we will be able to focus resources to protect the children that we need to protect. If the care home is not doing its job then the missing persons co-ordinators will go in and raise the concerns to safeguarding boards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geenty said it was not a matter of cutting budgets, but focusing resources. "This is not about saving money, it will not save any money," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The police are often the first agency to take a missing person report and our aim is to ensure we get the best possible response to those most at risk of harm. This means identifying these cases early so that policing resources go where they are most needed. Both police and partners agree on the need to move beyond a 'one size fits all' response."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Tucker, head of policy at the NSPCC, said there were serious concerns about the new approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very concerned that the new definition of 'missing persons' will put vulnerable children at risk of being groomed and sexually exploited," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The length of time a child goes missing is irrelevant because they can fall into the clutches of abusers very quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucker said all professionals including the police must respond to every case of children going missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Children go missing for a variety of reasons: they may be bullied, abused, or are generally unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But whatever the reason, this problem must be taken seriously. We expect all professionals including the police to invest the right amount of time and take the necessary action to protect all children as soon as they go missing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Rochdale, Greater Manchester police and social workers did not act after dozens of warning signs about vulnerable young girls going missing from children's homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine men were jailed in 2012 for sharing around five girls and using them for sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victims were raped, physically assaulted and forced to have sex with several men in a day, several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some agencies had understood that the teenagers were victims of abuse, rather than consenting young adults, and referred potential victims to the Rochdale children's social care department. But the response of social workers in case files showed they often considered such young people to be "making their own choices" and "engaging in consensual sexual activity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police and prosecutors apologised for failing to bring the case to court when one of the victims went to them for help in August 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Independent Police Complaints Commission is supervising an investigation into why GMP did not pursue the investigation in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sandralaville"&gt;Sandra Laville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
