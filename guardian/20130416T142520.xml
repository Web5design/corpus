The panel also reduced him in rank to private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay, 24, pleaded guilty last month to attempted espionage and other counts. A sentencing panel of male military members heard testimony on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Military prosecutors said Millay was a white supremacist who was fed up with the army and the US, and was willing to sell secrets to an enemy agent even if that would cost his fellow soldiers their lives. Defence attorneys said Millay was an emotionally stunted attention-seeker and was a candidate for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay's attorney, Seattle-based Charles Swift, said he understood and accepted the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he said: "We do intend to seek further clemency as this case goes forward for the reasons that were set forth in the trial: his mental state, his emotional age, and the motivation for it, and the circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday's proceedings were like a mini-trial conducted in front of the sentencing panel, with each side calling two witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special Agent Derrick Chriswell said Millay came to the FBI's attention in the summer of 2011 through an anonymous tipoff after Millay sent an email to a Russian publication seeking information about the military and made several calls to the Russian embassy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a concern for national security," Chriswell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI, working with military intelligence agencies, conducted the investigation. On 13 September 2011, an FBI undercover agent called Millay and set up a meeting the next day at an Anchorage hotel restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chriswell testified that during the first meeting with the agent that day, Millay "expressed his disgust with the US military". They then moved to the agent's hotel room, where audio and video recording devices were in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay said he would work for the Russian government, and if they made it worth his while he would re-enlist for a second five-year stint. He also said he had confidential information on the Warlock Duke jamming system the US military uses to sweep roadside bombs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after that meeting, Millay reported to his commander that he had been contacted by a Russian agent. He was later interrogated by military intelligence officers and the FBI, but prosecutors say Millay was merely trying to throw off suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chriswell said Millay withheld information during the interrogation that officials already knew from the recordings. That included a claim that he did not know why a Russian agent would contact him, his claim to the agent that he had access to social security numbers of people on base because of his police job and that he had sent an earlier text claiming he had more information on the jamming system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, after Millay came off a month-long leave, he told the agent he was willing to sell information using a confidential drop at a park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 21 October 2011, he dropped off a white envelope with information about the F-22s and the jamming system in a rubbish bin. That envelope was later collected by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay was told to drive to a hotel, where he collected $3,000 (£2,000) and a disposable cell phone from a pickup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent contacted Millay afterwards to complain her superiors wanted information that was not on the internet. Millay assured her that the information on the jamming system – about a paragraph's worth – was not available. That was later confirmed by military personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was arrested on 28 October. A search of his barracks found two handguns, detailed instructions on how to use a Russian internet phone service and literature from the white supremacist organisation the National Socialists Movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chriswell also testified that Millay had two Nazi SS thunderbolt tattoos under his biceps and spider web tattoos, which he said were common among racists in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He branded himself in their symbols of hate," the military prosecutor Captain Stewart Hyderkhan said in his closing statement, arguing for a sentence of at least 25 years in prison. "He had hate for the army. He had hate for the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift, Millay's attorney, argued that the Nazi movement and Russia did not have much in common, and that Millay had once been married to a Filipina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defence witness Dr Veronica Harris, a psychiatrist, testified that Millay had the emotional capability of a five-year-old and suffered from low self-esteem, mild depression, alcoholism and narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay offered an unsworn statement to the court, in which he said: "This has destroyed me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know I've made a terrible mistake," he said, fighting back tears. "I'm a US soldier, and that piece of me I'm proud of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millay spoke of his demon within. "It has taken me three years to come to grips with who he is," he said. "He's my worst enemy; my worst enemy is myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyderkhan said that was not remorse, especially since prison recordings showed he threatened to continue to divulge secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift, in his closing statement, argued that eight years was punitive enough and would provide time for rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/espionage"&gt;Espionage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It is the biggest earthquake in Iran for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the area is largely desert and mountains, there are several major cities, including Zahedan, 125 miles away, which has more than half a million inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Iranian told the Guardian that the small town of Hiduj, which had a population of around 1,000 according to a 2006 census, had been badly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian semi-official news agency Fars quoted Tehran University's geophysics centre as saying the quake had hit the south-eastern city of Saravan in Sistan and Baluchistan province, at 3.14pm local time and reported that it had killed at least 40 people, according to some of their sources. At least seven villages near the city had been affected, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Fars also quoted Fariborz Rashedi, the head of medical emergencies for Sistan and Baluchistan, as saying the situation in his province was "normal", with only three people injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Pakistan side, the situation seemed just as confused. "We have reports of three deaths near the Pakistan-Iran border in MashKhel area of Panjgore district," said a local government official, requesting anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official added that around 40 people had been injured when wooden roofs and mud walls collapsed. The sparsely populated district is one of Pakistan's most underdeveloped, with minimal telecommunication and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no official announcement of a death toll by Pakistan's disaster management authority. However, a police officer in the Kalat district, near the provincial capital of Quetta, said they are assessing the damage in towns along to the Iranian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are reports of panic in Karachi where residential buildings and government offices have developed cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saleh Mangi, from the NGO Plan International, said he was in a meeting with staff in their office in Thatta, around 65 miles from the port city, when they felt the ground shake. "It was horrible – we felt the movement in the chairs and even the cupboards were shaking. This is the strongest quake I have felt since the 1980s. And this is an area prone to earthquakes and cyclones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sounded our emergency alarm and emergency alarms were going off in the houses around us. Everyone was pouring out of their homes and offices. People were afraid and didn't know what was happening. People are afraid to go back to their homes and the government is telling fishing communities [on the coast] not to go into the sea as that would be very dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close to 8 magnitude means an extremely powerful quake, on a level with the one that killed an estimated 68,000 people in Sichuan province, China, in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Iranian citizen in the southern city of Shiraz, about 650 miles from the epicentre, said the quake was felt there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was concern that facilities associated with Iran's controversial nuclear programme might have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A witness in Saravan told BBC's Persian service: "The earthquake was felt gravely across the city and the old part of the city as well as its main sport centre have been destroyed but thanks God because it could be worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahmad-Reza Shajiee, the deputy head of Iran's Red Crescent, told the state Irna news agency that there was a complicated emergency situation in affected areas in Sistan and Baluchistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Soon after we received the news about the quake, a crisis meeting was held and a group of rescuers from the Red Crescent society were dispatched to Sistan and Baluchistan province," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Bushehr nuclear power plant was not damaged, said an official at the Russian firm that built the plant. The official at Atomstroyexport, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had spoken to a colleague at the plant after the quake and that no damage was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bushehr, Iran's sole nuclear power plant, is near the Gulf coast in western Iran. There was no immediate independent confirmation of his statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Delhi, India, more than 1,500 miles from the suspected epicentre, office workers evacuated buildings as fittings shook and windows rattled. Tremors lasted for around 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very frightening. Everything started moving. I ran into the street," said Ghautam Menon, an office worker in the south of the Indian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, a major quake near the Iranian city of Bam, not far from Tuesday's epicentre, killed 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran experiences earthquakes frequently. A week ago, a 6.1-magnitude quake hit near Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf coast, killing at least 37 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/earthquakes"&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/natural-disasters"&gt;Natural disasters and extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jasonburke"&gt;Jason Burke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/saeedkamalidehghan"&gt;Saeed Kamali Dehghan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Four years into a weak recovery, policy makers may therefore need to worry about the risk of over-burdening monetary policy because it is being relied on to deliver more than it traditionally has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the world economy as a whole, the Fund marginally cut its 2013 growth forecast by 0.2 percentage points to 3.3%, but said its prediction of an acceleration to 4% in 2014 remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said growth continued to be powered by emerging markets, with the developed world continuing to struggle. Olivier Blanchard, the Fund's chief economist, said that within the developed world there was a contrast between the United States, expected to grow by 1.9% in 2013 and 3% in 2014, and the eurozone – which will contract this year and experience only 1.1% expansion in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent good news about the United States has come with renewed worries about the euro area. Given the strong interconnections between countries, an uneven recovery is also a dangerous one," Blanchard said. He noted that some risks to the global economy, such as the UK falling off the fiscal cliff or a breakup of the euro, had diminished, but that it was "not time for policymakers to relax".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanchard told a press conference in Washington that the IMF would hold talks with the UK government in the coming months, to "see what can be done" about the pace of deficit reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the face of very weak private demand it is time to consider adjustment to the original fiscal plan," Blanchard explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fund said that some central banks – including the Bank of England — would find it difficult to remove the huge stimulus provided over the past four years, warning that some could face "significant trade offs" between fighting inflation and preventing a tightening of policy leading to fresh outbreaks of financial instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such risks are particularly relevant for central banks that have been purchasing large amounts of debt securities with long maturities, such as the (US) Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, which recently adopted continued monthly asset purchases, or the Bank of England."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fund said it was difficult to make banks safer while at the same time encouraging them to lend more, unless governments were prepared to pump more money into weak but viable institutions or to subsidise lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Examples of the latter are Japan's loan support programme and the UK's funding for lending scheme. Although it is still early days, so far the FLS's impact has been limited, encouraging mortgage lending more than lending to small and medium-size businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HM Treasury spokesperson said: "Today's report from the IMF highlights the risks that continue to face economies around the world. Though the UK is forecast to have stronger growth than either France or Germany in 2013, difficulties in the euro area are still creating economic headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, as the chancellor said at the budget, we are slowly but surely fixing this country's economic problems. The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private sector jobs have been created and because of the credibility the government has earned, families and businesses are benefiting from near-record low interest rates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf"&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/budget-deficit"&gt;Budget deficit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/larryelliott"&gt;Larry Elliott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It is facing a rebellion on the issue from Tory MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, who told the Today programme on Tuesday it would "guarantee disputes between neighbours … and seems like bad, clumsy politics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shadow communities secretary, Hilary Benn, described it as an "ill-conceived scheme to allow unregulated and potentially unsightly development without scrutiny".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government claims both moves will boost the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is poised to cut red tape around housing standards to "free up developers and councils to get on with the job of building". Opponents fear it could exacerbate the phenomenon of "rabbit-hutch Britain" – the average UK home is already smaller than one in France, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Australia or the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Foster, the communities minister, announced the reform of housing standards late last year "to remove unnecessary burdens and bureaucracy imposed on developers to get much-needed new homes built, and support economic growth". He said the purpose was to "establish what the unnecessary measures are that we can cut out of the system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The country is in the grip of the worst housing crisis in decades and there is an urgent need to provide more affordable, quality homes," said Angela Brady, president of Riba. "In their rush to build, the government must avoid the temptation to reduce current standards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social housing built using government money is currently subject to mandatory space standards to ensure sufficient room for family life, furniture and household equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government's Homes and Communities Agency, which is spending £4.5bn to fund 150,000 new social housing units, confirmed that the minimum space rules it uses are part of the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In London, all new housing funded through public or private money has to meet minimum sizes. A one-bedroom flat for two people must have at least 50 sq metres of internal floor area, while a three-bedroom house occupied by five people needs 96 sq metres. Across the rest of the country private houses can be of any size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday night Riba published a survey showing 80% of the population support minimum space standards for homes. The Ipsos Mori poll of 700 people revealed that high energy bills as well as lack of space and natural light are the most cited causes of dissatisfaction with current homes. It has also launched a campaign to urge ministers to maintain rules on housing standards which is being backed by Kevin McCloud and Alain de Botton, the TV presenter and author &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/may/09/alain-de-botton-modernist-houses" title=""&gt;who have both become housing developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is almost no political issue more important than the quality of where we live," said De Botton. "For too long, house builders have been conning the public into buying hugely overpriced rubbish, the architectural equivalent of the turkey twizzler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2009 survey of attitudes towards new homes found that 58% of people living in fully occupied homes said there was not enough space for furniture they owned or would like to own, and 69% said there was not enough storage for their possessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The setting of space standards in new housing is one of a range of issues being considered as part of the housing standards review," said a spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government. "The government is determined to support developers and councils to get on with the job of building the high-quality new homes the country needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's biggest housebuilders have been asked to submit ideas for simplifying the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are opposed to space standards," said Steve Turner, a spokesman for the Home Builders Federation, the lobby group which represents Barratt Homes, Taylor Wimpey and others. "The objective of all this is to cut red tape and reduce standards, not the other way round. If you increase space standards it takes more land; that will increase the cost of the housing and will reduce the number of people that can afford it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/planning"&gt;Planning policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/architecture"&gt;Architecture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Health officials and ministers have warned that more people will catch the highly infectious disease as they attempt to bring the outbreak under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are stepping up pressure on parents across Wales to ensure their children are vaccinated with the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health Wales said it was "just a matter of time" before a child died or was left with serious or permanent complications such as eye disorders, deafness or brain damage. Five thousand children in the Swansea area alone are said to remain at risk and children between 10 and 18 have been most affected so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a measles outbreak in north-east England is also getting worse with a more than 10% rise in suspected cases over a week. In all, 214 cases have been laboratory confirmed and another 220 suspected since numbers began to rise last September. Nearly a third of all cases have involved children aged 10 to 14 and nearly one in six of all those affected have need hospital treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Welsh outbreak, Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "Plenty of opportunities are being offered to parents to vaccinate their children against measles, but parents need to make sure they take these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can't bring this outbreak to an end unless the parents of unvaccinated children either arrange vaccination with their GP, call in to one of the weekend drop-in sessions or ensures that if their child attends a school where vaccinations are being offered, they have signed a consent form for them to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Children who do not have signed consent forms cannot be vaccinated so it is crucial that parents ensure they have given their consent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest attack rate was in children aged 10 to 18. "These are the children who may not have been vaccinated because of concerns about the safety of MMR in the late 1990s. The vaccine is safe, effective and the only protection against a potentially fatal disease," said Lyons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the outbreak is at present affecting the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Powys and Hywel Dda health board areas, we have cases of measles in every health board area in Wales and we have no way of knowing where the outbreak might spread. As children return to school after the Easter holidays, the opportunities for measles to spread increase. Now is the time to vaccinate your children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although nearly 3,700 children were given catch-up jabs at special clinics over the past two weekends, and hundreds more pupils will be immunised at schools and GP surgeries in Swansea and across Wales, Mark Drakeford, the health minister, said: "It is vital we build on the progress made so far and bring the outbreak under control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drakeford said in a written statement to the Welsh assembly in Cardiff: "It is encouraging parents are continuing to bring their children forward but the numbers need to be higher to bring the outbreak under control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He anticipated the numbers of cases would continue to rise over the coming weeks until vaccination uptake reached levels where "the continuing circulation of measles in the community can be interrupted".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drakeford said: "It is important for us all to remember measles is not a trivial illness. In a minority of cases, it can lead to serious complications and it can be fatal. Regrettably, the more the disease continues to spread, the more likely these outcomes become."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said figures for Wales from the end of last year showed that uptake of the MMR vaccine for the first of two jabs was now 94.3% of two-year-olds, whereas uptake of the second dose at five had reached 89.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While more infants are having the vaccine now, efforts must be focused on those children who missed out for whatever reason in the past so that they are offered catch-up vaccinations to provide maximum protection to the community as a whole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Wales are only releasing reported numbers as they try to get the vaccination message across.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All new cases reported in the outbreak in north-east England come from the Teesside area, but public health doctors there say the risk of measles across the region remains high. Last month they asked all schools on Teesside to send letters to parents alerting them to the increase in measles cases and asking them to check their children had been immunised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mmr"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Critics have branded it as "pre-emptive arrests", which threaten the ancient right to protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said a small number of people planning protests had contacted them and they urged those wanting to demonstrate to get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Jones said: "Every operation that we deliver is based upon a thorough assessment of the potential risks and threats, and we plan the most effective ways to mitigate against them. We wish to deliver our operation in a way that protects public safety within the context of a broader security operation – as with many ceremonial London events." Roads will be closed and sterile areas will be set up where the public cannot enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said: "The right to conduct peaceful protest is a tenant [sic] of our democracy, however, that right is qualified in that protest does not stray into acts of crime or violence or the instigation of crime or violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue to review our intelligence and evidence picture, and although to date no arrests connected to the ceremonial funeral have yet been made, should the need arise to arrest those who are committing acts of crime or violence, or conspiring to do so, we will respond accordingly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as any implications from the Boston attack, security officials will take account of a series of challenges ranging from dissident Irish republican terrorists, the threat of al-Qaida-inspired violence, through to activists on the far left who may use the funeral to show their contempt for Thatcher through violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/metropolitan-police"&gt;Metropolitan police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vikramdodd"&gt;Vikram Dodd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Family, MPs and peers, will be able to attend a short private service for her at 4pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seats in the chapel have been offered to members and staff of both houses who knew or worked closely with her, or who served her in some personal capacity; for example, housekeepers who looked after her office in the houses of parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her body will rest in the chapel until the funeral on Wednesday. While the former prime minister had herself decreed she did not want a formal lying-in-state open to the public, after Tuesday's service the chapel will be open from 5pm until 9pm in order that members of both houses and parliamentary staff holding permanent passes may pay their respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Speaker's chaplain, the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, will keep vigil in the chapel though the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Commons debate on the decision to cancel prime minister's questions on Wednesday, triggered by leftwing Respect MP George Galloway, is scheduled to begin at 7pm while the former Conservative leader's coffin lies nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galloway, who claimed he would have "a lot to say" about the "wicked and divisive" former prime minister, objected to planned changes to the Commons' sitting times on Wednesday to allow for Thatcher's grand ceremonial funeral at St Paul's Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also criticised Commons Speaker John Bercow's decision to silence the bell of Big Ben during the funeral – a move welcomed by Thatcher's children, Sir Mark Thatcher and his twin sister Carol, as "a great honour". The last time the chimes of Westminster's Great Clock were halted in this way was for the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street said the former US vice-president Dick Cheney and ex-secretary of state Henry Kissinger were to attend the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the US president, Barack Obama, has announced a presidential delegation led by former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker III will attend the funeral. Both served as secretary of state during Thatcher's leadership – Schultz to Ronald Reagan and Baker to George Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security for the funeral is under scrutiny in the aftermath of the&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-explosions-investigation" title=""&gt; devastating Boston marathon blasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPs were given the chance to pay tribute to Thatcher last week when prime minister David Cameron recalled parliament. But Galloway, MP for Bradford West, and Labour veteran Dennis Skinner objected to a business motion which would see PMQs cancelled so that Cameron and MPs could attend the funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair's cry of "object" mean the proposed change in sitting time will now have to be voted on after a debate lasting up to three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Holyrood debate on her legacy has been moved to Thursday to avoid a clash with her funeral. As rehearsals were due on Tuesday at St Paul's, the cathedral's dean, the Very Rev Dr David Ison, who will play a central role in the funeral, was reported as saying that Britain has not yet come to terms with the "hurt and anger" felt in some parts of society as a result of Thatcher's policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ison said people should ask themselves why the UK's first female prime minister was still such a controversial figure 23 years after being forced out of office, in remarks said to have been made in an interview with CNN International, to be broadcast on Tuesday, the Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ison made the comment when asked if the funeral of Thatcher, who died last week at the age of 87, was a historic occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's emblematic of a particular point in British society," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to ask yourself the question: why it is, 23 years after she left government, Margaret Thatcher is still such a controversial figure and I think part of the answer is we still haven't come to terms with the hurt and anger many parts of society have felt because of the legacy of her policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ison, previously Dean of Bradford since 2005, took up his St Paul's post in May after his predecessor resigned after the row over anti-capitalist protesters camped outside the London landmark. He is also reported to have linked Thatcher's policies with those of the coalition, saying: "The memory of those [policies] is being revived by the current policies that the current government has got in terms of trying to address the deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And there is some real work to be done here about what's the relationship between the rich and the poor in our society and how we can work together instead of being opposed to one another. That's a particular agenda that I think that this funeral will be throwing up and highlighting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/houseofcommons"&gt;House of Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgegalloway"&gt;George Galloway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies"&gt;Caroline Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But in the immediate aftermath there are no arrests, no credible claims of responsibility and little information from police about who might have carried out the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the investigation continued, more witness accounts emerged of the moment the blasts struck, just before 3pm local time on Monday, when most of the 23,000 runners had completed the course of the world's oldest continually run marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eight-year-old boy was among the dead. A nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old and another child aged two were among the injured at Boston children's hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-bloody-chaos" title=""&gt;Witnesses told of horrific injuries&lt;/a&gt; with a number of people suffering severe leg injuries. Graphic photographs circulated online showed one man who appeared to have lost both lower legs. Other images showed the blood-stained pavement beside the marathon finish line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the explosions, led by the FBI, appeared to be centred on a residential building in nearby Revere, early on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities including FBI agents and local police descended on the 13-storey Ocean Shores Tower on Ocean Avenue in the neighbourhood at about 11pm on Monday. Reports suggested an &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/law-enforcement-searches-boston-apartment/" title=""&gt;apartment on the fifth floor was being searched&lt;/a&gt;. A panel in the lobby showed the building's elevators remaining on the fifth floor for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police sporadically entered and left the building but would not answer questions. At about 2am a group of officials emerged from the building and walked swiftly towards vehicles in the forecourt. One man carried a large black plastic bag which he placed in the back of a grey saloon before driving off at speed. A sign that read: "Official FBI business" could be seen on the dashboard of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts state police confirmed that a search warrant related to the investigation into the explosions had been served in the suburb, but provided no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Tuesday morning, police officers had questioned two male Saudi Arabian students in the lobby of the building. Speaking beforehand, one of the men told the Guardian he was there to meet a friend who lived on the fifth floor. Police examined the men's passports and appeared to make telephone calls before escorting them into the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of downtown Boston remained cordoned off on Tuesday morning as police continued to search the area for clues. Officials had earlier appealed for video footage from the finishing line, hoping it would help shed light on the explosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavily armoured vehicles circulated around the city centre, while Boston's hospitals were protected by police armed with assault rifles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 29 patients were treated at Massachusetts general hospital, eight of them in a critical condition. Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon at the hospital, said many of the seriously injured patients had suffered bone, soft tissue and vascular damage to their legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a lot of shrapnel injuries," Fagenholz told reporters outside the hospital. He said there had been several amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A number of patients will require repeat operations tomorrow and serial operations over the next couple of days," Fagenholz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some news agencies had reported on Monday evening that a suspect in the explosions was under guard at a hospital in the city, but Boston police commissioner Edward Davis said the reports were not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnesses used social media to document the explosions, with footage emerging of a "runner's eye-view" of one of the blasts – apparently recorded by a participant in the race. The video was uploaded to YouTube by NekoAngel3Wolf and shows the person bearing the camera &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIAfyYQzZaM&amp;feature=player_embedded" title=""&gt;approaching the finishing line&lt;/a&gt;, only to be rocked back by the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a video my mom recorded of the explosion," the description of the video read. "We are so lucky we got out of there when we did. My mom didn't finish the race but we are all safe and that's what matters. My heart goes out to victims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters said the devices used gunpowder as the explosive and were packed with ball bearings and other shrapnel to maximise injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news agency said the description came from a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two devices that caused the carnage had detonated without warning at 2.50pm ET on Tuesday, Davis told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether the city was under a terrorist attack, he replied: "We're not being definitive about this right now, but you can reach your own conclusions based on what happened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No group has claimed responsibility for the incident. The Pakistani Taliban – which has previously threatened attacks in the US and claimed responsibility for a failed car bombing in Times Square in New York – has denied any involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as two unexploded bombs were also found near the end of the 26.2-mile course as part of what appeared to be a well co-ordinated attack but they were safely disarmed, a senior US intelligence official told Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of the explosions were felt elsewhere, with authorities implementing heightened security measures in New York and Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a White House briefing after the attack, President Barack Obama cautioned against appropriating blame without full information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still do not know who did this or why," he said. "And people shouldn't jump to conclusions before we have all the facts." He referred to "any responsible individuals, any responsible groups".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt"&gt;Adam Gabbatt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That is the highest since last May and in line with economists' forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics said the biggest upward pressures last month came from price rises for newspapers, books and digital cameras - including the effect of dearer ebooks, a new item in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/12/inflation-basket-ebooks-champagne" title=""&gt;basket of goods used to calculate inflation&lt;/a&gt;. There was only muted relief from fuel prices which rose by less than a year ago and some easing in food price inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury welcomed the steadying in headline inflation, and economists said &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/apr/16/eurozone-crisis-growth-markets-oil-price" title=""&gt;recent falls in the oil price and other commodities&lt;/a&gt; could mean the rate will not rise as much as previously feared in coming months. But most still expect it to tick higher from here, as does the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New Bank governor Mark Carney will be welcomed by inflation that is likely to have breached 3% on his appointment in the summer alongside – perhaps most worrying – rising inflation expectations," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With wage growth running at little more than 1% on average, the headline inflation rate is expected to squeeze consumer spending power and dampen growth prospects in coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation has been running above the Bank of England's 2% target for the past four years and the central bank believes it will rise further to around 3% during 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes from the BoE's latest policy meeting will be published on Wednesday, revealing to what extent its nine-member monetary policy committee remains split over whether to inject more electronic cash to stimulate the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury sought to play down the pressure on households and noted inflation was now almost half its peak of 5.2%. A spokesperson added: "The government has taken continued action to help households with the cost of living, including increasing the tax-free personal allowance and freezing fuel duty for nearly three and a half years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some support for the view that inflation will be kept in check over coming months from separate official data showing prices at the factory gate posted their smallest annual rise since last July, helped by a drop in the price paid for crude oil. Output price inflation was in line with City forecasts at 2% in March, &lt;a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ppi2/producer-price-index/march-2013/stb-producer-price-index--march-2013.html" title=""&gt;the ONS said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, outlined several factors that could raise headline inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Upward pressure on inflation is still likely to come from sterling's sharp drop in the early months of this year pushing up import prices, as well as from recently increased energy tariffs and still elevated food prices. In addition, water bills will go up shortly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/inflation"&gt;Inflation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/katieallen"&gt;Katie Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One television station showed pictures of a handful of protesters burning a portrait of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small counter-protests by South Koreans calling for dialogue with the North were also held, media reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has threatened nuclear attacks on the US, South Korea and Japan after new UN sanctions were imposed in response to its latest nuclear arms test in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has also been angry about annual military exercises between US and South Korean forces, describing them as a hostile act. The US dispatched B52 and B2 stealth bombers from their bases to take part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Tuesday, the North's KCNA did not threaten the US, reserving its anger for what it calls South Korea's "puppet" government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It even mentioned the possibility of dialogue, suggesting it was not really about to launch war in response to routine protests by at most a few dozen people in Seoul, despite the anger they raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the puppet authorities truly want dialogue and negotiations, they should apologise for all anti-DPRK hostile acts, big and small, and show the compatriots their will to stop all these acts," KCNA cited the North's military as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A South Korean foreign ministry spokesman later told a briefing the North Korean ultimatum was not worth a response and South Korea was waiting for the North to make a "wise decision".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the South's president, Park Geun-hye, offered talks but the North rejected the overture as a "cunning" ploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park will meet the US president, Barack Obama, at the White House on 7 May to discuss economic and security issues, including "countering the North Korean threat", the White House said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has offered talks with the North, but on the pre-condition that it abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions. North Korea deems its nuclear arms a "treasured sword" and has vowed never to give them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, ending a trip to the region dominated by concern about North Korea, on Monday stressed his interest in a diplomatic solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day earlier Kerry had appeared to open the door to talking without requiring the North to take denuclearisation steps in advance. Beijing, he said, could be an intermediary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests but it was not believed to be near weapons capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missile launches and nuclear tests by North Korea are both banned under UN security council resolutions that were expanded after the North's February test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the North's aggression, analysts say, is to bolster the leadership of Kim Jong-un, the 30-year-old grandson Kim Il-sung, or to force the US into talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US has 28,000 troops in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A US military helicopter crashed in a region near the border with North Korea on Tuesday with 14 people on board, all of them US soldiers, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of injuries and the cause of the accident, which happened when the helicopter was landing, was being investigated, Yonhap said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kim-jong-un"&gt;Kim Jong-un&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kim-jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nuclear-weapons"&gt;Nuclear weapons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His lawyers have resisted his removal since then in a series of appeals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although in other extradition cases the ECHR had not found that conditions in ADX Florence facility in Colorado were unacceptable, it deemed that Aswat's case was different because of his mental health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its judgment, the court said it had given "full consideration to the submissions of the US department of justice&amp;nbsp;… and observed, in particular, that it could not be determined with certainty in which detention facility or facilities Mr Aswat would be placed if extradited to the USA, either before or after trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was also unclear how long he might expect to remain on remand pending trial. As for his detention following a possible conviction&amp;nbsp;… although Mr Aswat would have access to mental health services regardless of which prison he was be detained in, his extradition to a country where he had no ties and where he would face an uncertain future in an as yet undetermined institution, and possibly be subjected to the highly restrictive regime in ADX Florence, would violate article 3 of the convention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 3 of the European convention on human rights prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment. Last year, the ECHR allowed the extradition of Babar Ahmad and four other suspects to US federal supermax prisons where inmates can spend 22 or 23 hours a day in solitary confinement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of wrangling, Hamza was also finally extradited to the US to face terrorism charges. Aswat was told by Hamza to help set up the camp in Oregon in 1999, US officials believe. Aswat and another man, it is alleged, visited the proposed site of the camp in Bly that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Home Office spokesman said: "We are disappointed that the European court of human rights found that extradition to America would breach Haroon Aswat's human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The judgment does not become final for three months and we will consider as a matter of urgency all the legal options which are available to us. This includes whether we request a referral of the case to the court's grand chamber."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate ruling, the court of appeal in London quashed the indeterminate sentences given to three members of an al-Qaida-inspired terror group that plotted to bomb the London Stock Exchange and build a terrorist training camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court instead imposed "determinate" custodial sentences of 17 years and eight months in the case of one of them and 16 years in relation to the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Islamist extremists had originally received the indeterminate sentences for public protection at London's Woolwich crown court in February last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECHR last year ruled as "arbitrary and unlawful" the operation of indeterminate sentences for the protection of the public (IPPs), currently being served by more than 6,000 prisoners in England and Wales. The IPP sentence is being replaced by a new extended determinate sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohammed Shahjahan, now 29, was last year ordered to serve a minimum of eight years and 10 months, while fellow Stoke-on-Trent-based radicals Usman Khan, 22, and Nazam Hussain, 27, were ordered to serve at least eight years behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing their sentence appeals, Lord Justice Leveson, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Sweeney, ruled that Shahjahan now has to serve 17 years and eight months, and Khan and Hussain 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three received extended sentences meaning that each will have to spend an extra five years on licence after their release. The trio were originally sentenced along with six others - four of the nine were from Stoke, three from Cardiff and two from London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal judges said that having reduced the three sentences by removing the sentence for public protection, they had come to the conclusion that it was right to make a marginal adjustment to the term imposed on another appellant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They knocked six months off the five-year sentence given to Mohibur Rahman, now 28, from Stoke-on-Trent, for possessing two copies of the online al-Qaida magazine Inspire for terrorist purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges also dismissed a sentence appeal by Omar Latif, 29, from Cardiff, who was jailed for 10 years and four months, with an extended period on licence of another five years, for attending meetings with the intention of assisting others to prepare or commit acts of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/european-court-of-human-rights"&gt;European court of human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/court-of-appeal"&gt;Court of appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott"&gt;Owen Bowcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vikramdodd"&gt;Vikram Dodd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Karl Marx Street runs parallel to Lenin Street. Soviet-era buses&amp;nbsp;ferry workers to and fro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Wednesday morning the eyes of the Russian elite – from ministers to Kremlin critics – will be on an unassuming courthouse in the centre of this city, where Alexey Navalny, Vladimir Putin's loudest foe, will go on trial charged with embezzlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/13/alexei-navalny-trial-russia" title=""&gt;Few doubt the trial is motivated by political revenge&lt;/a&gt;. Navalny, a 36-year-old lawyer, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/jan/15/alexei-navalny-profile-vladimir-putin" title=""&gt;anti-corruption crusader and popular blogger&lt;/a&gt;, has spent the last year labelling Putin a crook and calling for the powerful president to be jailed, and has uncovered corrupt schemes by some of Putin's closest associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirov is 500 miles north-east of Moscow but a world away. Its nearly half a million residents make an average wage of 17,000 roubles (£350) a month; many still work in the Soviet-era factories that line the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirov was meant to be a showcase of liberal co-operation with an unwavering Kremlin. In 2009, Putin's protégé, Dmitry Medvedev, then president and now prime minister, appointed opposition politician Nikita Belykh to the governor's post. Despite criticism from his anti-Putin cohorts, Belykh took the job, arguing that it was possible to transform the system from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were big hopes for the governor's team," said Yana Strauzova, spokesman for the city government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquainted with Navalny from Moscow opposition circles, Belykh called the young lawyer in as an adviser. It was then, prosecutors argue, that Navalny conspired to embezzle 16m&amp;nbsp;roubles (£333,000) from a state-run timber firm called Kirovles. Two previous investigations were closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was reopened and Navalny was charged in July, not long after he uncovered secret property owned in the Czech Republic by Alexander Bastrykin, a close Putin ally and head of Russia's investigative committee, a powerful body that has been likened to a political police. Navalny faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belykh, his one-time ally, has declined to comment. On Monday, the governor took to his blog to address the many journalists and supporters descending upon Kirov. He would not be in town, he said, but provided a list of tourist sites to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance that Navalny will be acquitted is minuscule. Konstantin Zaytsev, head of the court that will try Navalny, said a guilty verdict was "probable but not inevitable". The&amp;nbsp;presiding judge, Sergei Blinov, has never issued a not-guilty verdict. Zaytsev himself said he has issued one not-guilty verdict in his decades-long career – and it was overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The system works in such a way that those who would be found not guilty get filtered out before the case reaches court," Zaytsev explained. Russia's conviction rate is over 99%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny has accused Putin of personally ordering the case against him&amp;nbsp;and has called the charges absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most provincial towns around Russia, Kirov is far from the hustle and bustle of Moscow's political life. Rocked by months of street protests early last year, the capital has settled into a state of constant, low-level tension. Dozens have been arrested for a protest that turned violent on 6 May and a series of repressive laws keep opposition anger afloat, if hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny was the most public face of those protests. Yet according to recent research by the Levada Centre, an independent poll group, only 37% of Russians had heard of the opposition activist. At the height of Russia's protest season, around the time of a 4 March presidential election that swept Putin back into the Kremlin, 3,000 people turned out in Kirov – something local activists considered a runaway success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All I've heard about Navalny is what they say about him," said Margarita Trufakina, a 22-year-old swimming instructor. "He presented himself as a fighter for justice – and proved to be otherwise." Many more had heard nothing of Navalny or the case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but barred from appearing on state-run television, the opposition activist has taken to the internet to win a following. Yet in a country marred by ubiquitous corruption, the case has already tarnished his reputation among some who once looked upon him with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In such cases, one can't be 100% sure of anything," said Ivan, 21. "Maybe they're trying him because he really stole something, or maybe it's because he wanted to change something in Russia. Anything is possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of supporters from around the country have promised to make their way to Kirov for the trial, aiming to raise awareness among locals, counter state propaganda and keep the attention on a case far from the media-heavy capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirill Osipov, 26, hitchhiked seven hours from the city of Kazan to arrive in Kirov on Monday morning. "If we don't show the government our position, they will never listen to us," Osipov said. "The same thing can happen to any of us. That Navalny is against the system is a positive thing for us." He said he planned to stay up to a month in the city. Anna, a 21-year-old activist, drove 12 hours from the southern city of Volgograd and said she planned to stay for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny's associates have set up a headquarters to host the flood of activists and Moscow-based reporters expected to descend upon Kirov for the trial. In a basement office they were scrambling to set up an internet connection and make sure there was enough tea and coffee in stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The office stands near the end of a long, pot-holed road lined with crumbling pre-revolutionary homes and empty new constructions. At the opposite end, on Lenin Street, stands the grandest building in Kirov – a red-and-white castle featuring balconies and gargoyles, and topped with two sculptures of Russia's national symbol, the double-headed eagle. The building does not host the local government, the mayor's office or a court. It is the city's headquarters for the Federal Security Service, the main successor agency to the KGB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vladimir-putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He will visit the BBC's New Broadcasting House in central London later on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harding said in a statement: "The BBC's newsroom strives to be the best in the world, trusted for its accuracy, respected for its fairness and admired for the courage of its reporting. I am honoured to be a part of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC said Harding's salary would be £340,000 and that his appointment followed an open recruitment process. His basic salary is the same as his predecessor, Boaden, but taxable benefits took her total income up to £354,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian revealed in February that the new BBC director general, Tony Hall, was talking to Harding about a role in news – and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/15/james-harding-next-bbc-news-chief" title=""&gt;the move was all but confirmed late on Monday night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said: "I am delighted that James will be joining as the new director of BBC News and Current Affairs. High quality journalism sits right at the heart of the BBC making this is an absolutely critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"James has a very impressive track record as a journalist, editor and manager. I believe he will give BBC News a renewed sense of purpose as it moves away from what has been an undeniably difficult chapter. As an organisation, the BBC will also benefit from his external perspective and experience which he will share as a member of the BBC's executive team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

They said the names would not be formally released until identification had taken place, but last night, the youngsters were named locally as Levina, three, Addy, two, and an 11-month-old baby boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends said the woman had recently split up with her boyfriend the and father of her children, Craig McLelland, and had complained that she needed help from social services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Det Supt John Brocklebank of the Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team said: "We are in the early stages of a large investigation into what has happened. It is too early to be able to come up with a definitive explanation and we will be keeping an open mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, from our initial inquiries, we do not believe there is any threat to the wider community. Our priorities now are to establish the circumstances behind the woman's death and how it may be related to the deaths of the three children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking outside the terraced house where the children were discovered, friend Karligh Smith, 20, said: "It's devastating – she was the most lovely mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She had asked social services for help because she had three kids, another on the way, and she had to do all that by herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Craig is devastated too. He came here to pay his respects this afternoon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Suffolk police said: "An area of Lowestoft was closed off this morning, Monday 15 April, after a woman was found with severe head injuries. Police attended the incident in Gordon Road just after 8am. It is believed she fell from a car park. Ambulance and air ambulance attended. However, the woman, who is believed to be in her 20s, was pronounced deceased on scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Inquiries into the incident led police to an address in London Road South, Lowestoft, where the bodies of three children were discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The children are all believed to be infants aged three, two and 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Police are treating their deaths as suspicious and they will be taken to the James Paget Hospital at Gorleston for post-mortem examinations by a Home Office pathologist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Facebook page belonging to Fiona Anderson but under the name Fiona Chisolm appeared to show a picture of the children with their father. In the last post made from the profile on Monday, a picture was uploaded of an ultrasound scan showing a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another post made last night read: "Levina addy kyden evalie mummy will keep you safe. Mummy loves you. Mummy will keep you safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• For confidential support call Samaritans on 08457 909090.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterwalker"&gt;Peter Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Diane Abbott criticises ceremony and senior Tory says the Queen has been placed in an invidious position&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bells of Big Ben and the Great Clock at Westminster are to be silenced as a mark of respect during Wednesday's ceremonial funeral for Lady Thatcher, the Commons Speaker has announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As unease about the scale of the funeral spread across political parties, John Bercow told MPs that silencing the bells was the most fitting tribute to the late prime minister following a number of representations. It is thought the bells were last silenced as a mark of respect during the funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the statement by Bercow came as Diane Abbott, the shadow health minister, became the first member of the Labour frontbench to criticise the funeral, which will involve more than 700 military personnel from the three armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One senior Tory is planning to boycott the funeral on the grounds that the Queen, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/11/thatcher-funeral-pomp-concerns-palace" title=""&gt;whose aides are understood to have raised concerns about associating a divisive prime minister with the military on such a large scale&lt;/a&gt;, has been placed in an invidious position. It is understood that a number of Tories blame Gordon Brown for pushing for such a large scale funeral for Thatcher when he was prime minister, giving the palace no choice but to accept an invitation for the Queen on the grounds that the ceremony has cross-party consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Wallace, the Tory MP for Wyre and Preston North who is ministerial aide to Kenneth Clarke and who served in the Scots Guards, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/connect" title=""&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: "Most of funeral planned in 2008."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of organising Thatcher's funeral – Operation True Blue – has also come under fire amid accusations that he is planning to conceal the event's true costs from the public by omitting the wage bills of police officers and service personnel. Maude said the money paid to uniformed officers should not be included when calculating the overall costs to the public purse, an accounting manoeuvre that breaks with precedent. Calculations of the costs of the Queen Mother and Princess Diana's funeral included the costs of paying police and the armed services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour MPs described the move by Maude as "indefensible". But Bercow said parliament would pay another tribute to the late prime minister when Big Ben is silenced during her funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Speaker told MPs: "I have received a number of representations, direct and indirect, formal and informal, concerning how the house and parliament as an institution might best mark this occasion. I have considered all of these, but concluded that the most appropriate means of indicating our sentiments would be for the chimes of Big Ben and for the chimes of the Great Clock to be silent for the duration of the funeral proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have therefore made the necessary arrangements to achieve this. I believe that there can be a profound dignity and deep respect expressed in and through silence and I'm sure that the house will agree."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maude welcomed the Speaker's announcement. He told the Commons: "I am confident that this will be seen as a very dignified and respectful gesture on the part of parliament and I am very grateful to you. I am confident that Lady Thatcher's family will take it very much in that spirit and be hugely appreciative of what you have decided."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Ben is the main bell of the Great Clock atop Elizabeth Tower – named after the Queen in her diamond jubilee year in 2012 – which sounds every 15 minutes. It has occasionally failed to sound since it first chimed in 1859. But it was intentionally silenced for two years during the first world war when the clock was darkened to deter German Zeppelins, &lt;a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31002198/#.UWxFFb9uOUN" title=""&gt;according to a report by the Associated Press in 2009&lt;/a&gt; marking Big Ben's 150th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, was highly critical of the announcement. "I imagine [Lady Thatcher] wouldn't be too happy with this. The Luftwaffe couldn't silence Big Ben so I wouldn't have imagined she'd be at all in favour. But personally I am not bothered because it doesn't cost anything. My concern is all this money that is being spent on the funeral. No politician should be receiving a state funeral or semi-state funeral now or in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mann's remarks were echoed by Abbott, who criticised the arrangements for Thatcher's funeral. Her coffin will be drawn on a gun carriage of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery from St Clement Danes church – the church of the Royal Air Force in the Strand – to St Paul's Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shadow public health minister told BBC London: "It goes against all protocol … Winston Churchill was different. He led a national government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labour MP John Healey, the former housing minister who boycotted last week's parliamentary tributes to Thatcher, said military personnel and policing costs were likely to be a large part of the taxpayers' bill. "The public have a right to see a full account of the costs of the funeral. Any attempt to cover up part of the costs of this funeral is indefensible and likely to be unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a state funeral in all but name without the consent of parliament for funding and without the consent of the people. Churchill, who was the only PM over the past 100 years to have a state funeral, unified the country, while Margaret Thatcher divided it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers have responded by accusing Labour MPs of failing to maintain the tone of their leader, Ed Miliband, who was widely praised for his Commons statement on Thatcher. A government source said: "We are surprised that Labour are trying to play politics over a ceremonial funeral for a former prime minister, particularly given that the outline of the funeral was agreed under Gordon Brown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maude told Radio 4's Any Questions programme on Friday that reports that the funeral will cost £10m had mistakenly included the costs of police and soldiers who would be working anyway. "There are costs which are people doing their ordinary jobs which are costs which are being borne in any event. We have not hired more soldiers, we haven't hired more police. There is no one who has been hired who would not be doing their ordinary jobs which they would not be doing in any event. We are not hiring more police."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Galloway, the Respect MP, is due to try and force a commons vote to prevent the cancellation of prime minister's questions to allow MPs to attend the funeral. He told BBC2's Daily Politics: "We're spending £10m on the canonisation of this wicked woman, this woman who laid waste to industrial Britain, to the north, to Scotland, to south Wales. We've already had the recall of parliament last week, with MPs being paid up to £3,700 to fly back from the Caribbean holiday that they were on and then fly back to start their holiday again, for a totally unnecessary fawning over this woman. And now they want to cancel prime minister's questions. It's absurd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian understands that more than 3,000 police officers had leave cancelled and will be informed on Tuesday if they are needed to help secure the route of the cortege amid plans for mass protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale and the cost to the taxpayer of the funeral has been criticised by public figures including the Bishop of Grantham, Lord Prescott and George Galloway. It has been widely reported that the event will cost £10m. Previous ceremonial funerals have included "opportunity costs", which would have been incurred anyway if staff were assigned to other operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queen Mother's funeral – the last grand ceremonial funeral in Britain – cost £8.16m to the public purse, according the Guardian's calculations. Policing cost the Metropolitan Police £4.3m of which £2.3m was defined as "opportunity costs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday night the White House announced that Barack Obama had asked former secretaries of state George Shultz and James A Baker III to lead what might be seen as a low-key delegation to Thatcher's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shultz served as secretary of state to President Ronald Reagan and Baker to President George HW Bush. Both served in the position while Thatcher was in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House said other delegation members would be Barbara Stephenson, the charge d'affaires at the US embassy in London, and Louis Susman, the former US ambassador to the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said he was sending three Republican members of Congress: Marsha Blackburn, Michele Bachmann and George Holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/diane-abbott"&gt;Diane Abbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rajeev-syal"&gt;Rajeev Syal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photographs showed the area along Boylston Street covered in injured people, with security guards and emergency workers scrambling to give first aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnesses said they had seen victims who had lost limbs. "There were a lot of people down," said Frank Deruyter, who was running the marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An eight-year-old boy was among the dead. At the city's Children's Hospital a nine-year-old girl, a seven-year-old boy, a 12-year-old and another child aged two were among the injured, &lt;a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/15/explosions-rock-boston-marathon-finish-line-dozens-injured/yLhfDT1XC3HXSa8wPiVijL/story.html"&gt;according to the Globe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on Tuesday morning the Guardian witnessed FBI investigators entering and leaving a building in the Boston suburb of Revere, at one stage taking away a black plastic bag. The Associated Press said Massachusetts state police had confirmed that a search warrant related to the investigation into the explosions was served on Monday night in Revere but authorities provided no further details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as two unexploded bombs were also found near the end of the 26.2-mile (42km) course as part of what appeared to be a well co-ordinated attack but they were safely disarmed, a senior US intelligence official told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two devices that caused the carnage had detonated without warning at about 2.50pm ET on Tuesday, the Boston police commissioner Ed Davis told reporters at a media briefing. Asked whether the city was under a terrorist attack, he replied: "We're not being definitive about this right now, but you can reach your own conclusions based on what happened." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Reuters news agency said the devices used gunpowder as the explosive and were packed with ball bearings and other shrapnel to maximise injuries. Reuters said the description came from a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of injured people were taken to local hospitals where some remained in a critical condition on Monday evening. The Associated Press put the number of injured at more than 130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police wearing camouflage uniforms and carrying assault rifles guarded the main entrance of Massachusetts General Hospital on Monday evening. Inside were 29 people injured in the blasts, including eight who were in a critical condition and undergoing surgery. Dr Alasdair Conn, the hospital's chief of emergency services, said at least four of them had arrived with traumatic amputations, meaning their limbs had been blown off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Obama, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/obama-statement-boston-marathon-explosions"&gt;at a briefing at the White House&lt;/a&gt;, said: "The American people will say a prayer for Boston tonight. Michelle and I send our deepest thoughts and prayers to the families of the victims in the wake of this senseless loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said he had spoken with the FBI director and the Department of Homeland Security, who were co-ordinating the federal response. He stopped short of using the word "terrorism" to describe the explosions but vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will find out who did this and we will hold them accountable," he said. "Make no mistake, we will find out who did this and why they did this, and the groups or individuals responsible will feel the full weight of justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A White House official, speaking off the record, said the attack was being treated as an act of terrorism. But at a press conference on Monday night the FBI special agent who has taken control of the inquiry, Rick DesLauriers, said it was a "criminal investigation and potential terrorism investigation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He refused to comment on reports that a "person of interest" was being treated at Brigham and Women's hospital in the city. The police commissioner flatly denied reports there was a suspect at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis described the loss of life as "horrendous", adding: "This cowardly act will not be taken in stride. We will turn every rock over to find the people who are responsible for this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, said the city would be open on Tuesday "but it will not be business as usual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blasts came at the climax of what should have been a day of great celebration for Boston and for marathon runners from around the world. The 26.2-mile race, which started in 1897 and is one of six World Marathon Majors, has almost 27,000 participants and attracts up to 500,000 spectators, making it a massive security operation for the local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event takes place on Patriots' Day, a Massachusetts state holiday to mark the first battles of the revolutionary war against Britain. Monday is also "Tax Day" in the US, the deadline for individuals to file their tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the explosions the city went into high alert. All off-duty police officers were brought back on the job and told that a maximum alert would remain indefinitely. Tests and controlled explosions were carried out on scores of parcels and backpacks that had been left strewn along the parade line in the panic that followed the blasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A no-fly zone was imposed in the immediate zone of the incidents and flights into local airports were suspended briefly. Boston residents and visitors to the marathon were advised to return home or stay in their hotel rooms, and to avoid congregating in public spaces. "People should be calm but they should understand this is an ongoing event," the police chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'A loud boom ... then glass everywhere'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wounded people were taken to the medical tent that had originally been set up to treat weary runners. One of the victims included a Boston police officer seen being wheeled away from the scene with a bleeding leg. Cherie Falgoust, who was waiting for her husband to finish the race, said: "I was expecting my husband any minute. I don't know what this building is … it just blew. Just a big bomb, a loud boom, and then glass everywhere. Something hit my head. I don't know what it was. I just ducked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Crowley, the founder of social media company Foursquare, was running in the race. He used Twitter to reassure family and friends that he was safe. His cousin witnessed the explosion and was "shaken but OK. FYI no one at mi 26 has any idea what's happening," he tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowley said cell phone service had been swamped by worried callers, mobile batteries were running out and runners were struggling to get through to their friends and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors treating the 29 patients brought to Massachusetts General Hospital after Monday's blasts were seeing "a lot of shrapnel injuries", said Peter Fagenholz, a trauma surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the most seriously wounded had sustained damage to their lower limbs, he said. Several of the patients had traumatic amputations and at least one patient had a shattered eardrum, Fagenholz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was too early to say "how everybody is going to do" and a number of the patients would need repeated surgery in the coming days. Fagenholz added: "They're pretty brave, you know? It's a terrible thing and most patients' attitude is just 'Do what you have to do and try to make me better.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the White House said the administration was in contact with state and local authorities, with White House officials instructed to provide whatever assistance was necessary in the investigation and response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security was stepped up in New York City, with the NYPD's critical response vehicles being deployed, though it was not clear whether the move was a routine precaution or based on any specific intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Boston there were accounts that the windows of a local restaurant were blown out. Security was stepped up in hotels and public buildings throughout the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Cassidy, a reporter with the Boston Herald who was taking part in the marathon, said he saw two explosions, accompanied by a loud bang and then smoke rising. "I kept running and I heard behind me a loud bang. It looked like it was in a trash can or something. That one was in front of Abe and Louie's. There are people who have been hit with debris, people with bloody foreheads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the injured was Dean Smith, who had been standing close to the second blast site to watch his 27-year-old son finish the race. Both he and his son suffered minor injuries. "It felt like it was right there," he told the Guardian as he left hospital on Monday night, pointing to his car two feet away. "It was really close. My wife said I flew five feet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith sustained a minor shrapnel wound to his right calf. His back was also injured and both his eardrums burst, he said. His son was expected to make a full recovery, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaan Gandhi, a medical student at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the hospital was working flat out to take care of the injured. "It's supposed to be a really happy day," he said. "It's supposed to be a really quiet day and then this all happens."&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He said he had seen a patient with severe leg injuries. "We were just trying to stop the bleeding as much as possible and try to save his life," Gandhi said. "I've never seen something like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's Boston Marathon, the 177th annual race in the city, was being staged in commemoration of the Newtown school shooting, in which 20 young children and six educators were killed in December. The finishing mile was dedicated to the victims of Newtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions"&gt;Boston marathon explosions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe"&gt;Dominic Rushe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-lovering"&gt;Daniel Lovering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt"&gt;Adam Gabbatt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Just like Boko Haram, it is not a single organisation but different faces and shadows all using the same name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mend has appeared increasingly fragmented in recent months. The group behind the current threat against Muslims is believed to comprise disgruntled militants who have turned against the amnesty agreed between Mend and the Nigerian government in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mend no longer exists in the way it has done in the past," said Ken Henshaw from the Niger Delta-based group Social Action. "They key characters from Mend who really had the capacity to unleash mayhem have all accepted amnesty and handed in their arms. I can't think of anyone left who can carry out the same level of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I don't think this threat should be handled lightly. At the moment Nigeria is so volatile, things are getting out of control," Henshaw added. "Here is a group threatening to kill other people, it must be taken seriously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been a series of attacks or threats against Muslims by Christians in Nigeria in recent years. In 2011 a group called Akhwat Akwop – which it claimed was the Christian equivalent of the name Boko Haram – began distributing leaflets in northern Nigeria threatening terrorist attacks against Muslims, claiming it would emancipate Christians in the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January there were attacks against Muslims in Rivers state in the Niger Delta, although Mend did not claim responsibility for those attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is some precedent for attacks against Muslims in southern Nigeria," said Adunola Abiola, founder of Think Security Africa. "And although there are real questions about whether Mend have the capability and the networks to carry out the attacks they are threatening now, it's worth remembering that this is not just a group confined to the Niger Delta – they have operated in Lagos and Abuja before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month the Mend leader Henry Okah was sentenced to 24 years in jail after a South African court convicted him of terrorism over twin car bombings in Nigeria's capital city, Abuja, in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was speculation that the threat from Mend was at attempt to coerce the government into negotiating for Okah's release. "The timing of this sentence suggests to me that this might be intended as some sort of proxy conflict with the federal government," said Abiola. "But at this point in time and given the unpredictable turn of events in Nigeria, that anything is possible and they shouldn't be ignored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria"&gt;Nigeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boko-haram"&gt;Boko Haram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/afuahirsch"&gt;Afua Hirsch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Its limits were tested in New Zealand last year by a 36-year-old Kiribati man who &lt;a href="http://tcktcktck.org/2012/09/man-from-drowning-pacific-island-of-kiribati-denied-climate-refugee-status/31067" title=""&gt;argued before an immigration tribunal&lt;/a&gt; that he should not be deported because he feared for his own future and that of his children's because of the effects of climate change in his country, barely two metres above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tribunal rejected his claims and confirmed his deportation order after holding that the Refugee Convention gave no protection to those claiming to be endangered by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the president of the partly public-funded Refugee Council of Australia, Phil Glendenning, who was in &lt;a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/paradise-submerged-a-nation-going-under/590/" title=""&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt; in March, says Australia needs to formally recognise climate change refugees because there's "a big chance" that climate change in the Pacific would force large numbers of people from their homelands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glendenning says Australia should prepare to cater for thousands of climate change refugees over and above the 20,000 refugees it admits from war-torn nations every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are people who are not suffering from persecution because of their beliefs, race or because they belong to a particular group. So they don't meet the Refugee Convention criteria but, nevertheless, there will be a need for people to be resettled because they have been displaced by climate change," says Glendenning. "This is a new cohort of people who are emerging, the rest of the world needs to pay attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia's Labor government – trailing massively in opinion polls and facing an election in September at which the increased numbers of asylum seekers is expected to be a hot issue – is unlikely to agree to increase its refugee intake before the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition, a Liberal-National coalition that is expected to unseat Julia Gillard, has vowed to cut Australia's intake by 6,000 places upon coming into office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glendenning, however, says he has raised the need for a special category of climate change refugees in talks with senior officials in the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is beginning to emerge as an international issue ... the Department of Immigration didn't rule it out, of course. It didn't get a negative hearing, it's [a proposal] very much in its infancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiribati, formerly part of the British-administered Gilbert and Ellice Islands, straddles the equator. Its 33 tiny atolls and islands – many of which are uninhabited – extend for 5,000 kilometres across the Pacific Ocean. Most are extremely low-lying and the country's main atoll of Tarawa is now dangerously overcrowded as more people from outer islands flock to Tarawa seeking work and protection from climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising sea levels and more intense storms have inundated low-lying coastal land within Kiribati, contaminating vital fresh water supplies beneath some atolls, killing food plantations and shrinking the available land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiribati's president, Anote Tong, a graduate of the London School of Economics, has told his people that many should prepare to leave under a policy he terms "migration with dignity". Last month he announced that Kiribati would purchase 3,000 hectares of agricultural land in Fiji to grow food and as an investment. He has denied that he plans to send people there to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Tong, who has long campaigned for greater international recognition and aid for his country's plight, told the Global Mail that despite frantic efforts within Kiribati to stem the effects of climate change – by building sea walls and protecting fresh water supplies – his people would have to migrate to survive. He says Kiribati will increase its efforts to train and educate its young people so that they have a greater chance of making a new life in a different country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate," says president Tong. "Either we can wait for the time when we have to move people en masse or we can prepare them – beginning from now ..."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Bernard Lagan's full report on Kiribati &lt;a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/kiribati-a-nation-going-under/590/" title=""&gt;is published on The Global Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/climate-change-a-line-in-the-sand/591/"&gt;See The Global Mail's photo essay on Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/sea-level"&gt;Sea level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/refugees"&gt;Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kiribati"&gt;Kiribati&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/water"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/least-developed-countries"&gt;Least Developed Countries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

China faced "multiple and complicated security threats" despite its growing influence, the ministry of defence said in its annual white paper, adding that the US strategy meant "profound changes" for the region.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;"There are some countries which are strengthening their Asia-Pacific military alliances, expanding their military presence in the region and frequently make the situation there tenser," the ministry said in the 40-page document, in a clear reference to the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such moves "do not accord with the developments of the times and are not conducive towards maintaining regional peace and stability", ministry spokesman Yang Yujun told reporters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official People's Liberation Army Daily went further, saying in a commentary on Monday that China needed to beef up its defences to deal with a hostile west bent on undermining it. "Hostile western forces have intensified their strategy to westernise and split China, and employed every possible means to contain and control our country's development," it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Kerry defended the reorientation of US foreign policy towards Asia as he ended a trip to the region dominated by concerns about North Korea's nuclear programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While China has been angered by North Korea's behaviour, including staging its third nuclear test in February, it has also made clear it considers US displays of force in response to Pyongyang's behaviour to be a worrisome development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is North Korea's most important diplomatic and financial backer – the two fought together in the 1950-53 Korean war – although Yang would not be drawn on the subject aside from repeating a call for peace and dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's own military moves have worried the region, too. China unveiled another double-digit rise in military expenditure last month, to 740.6bn yuan (£77.8bn/$119bn) for 2013 and is involved in protracted and often ugly disputes over a series of islands in the East and South China Seas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the issues concerning China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, some neighbouring countries are taking actions that complicate or exacerbate the situation, and Japan is making trouble over the Diaoyu Islands issue," the white paper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute with Japan over the uninhabited islands, which China calls Diaoyu and Japan calls Senkaku, has escalated in recent months to the point where China and Japan have sent fighter jets and patrol ships to shadow each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The waters around the islands in the East China Sea are rich fishing grounds and have potentially huge oil and gas reserves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines also have conflicting claims with China in parts of the South China Sea. China lays claim to almost the whole of the sea, which is crisscrossed by crucial shipping lanes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US shift comes as China boosts military spending and builds submarines, surface ships and anti-ship ballistic missiles as part of its naval modernisation. It has also tested emerging technology aimed at destroying missiles in mid-air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China has repeatedly said the world has nothing to fear from its military spending, which it says is needed for legitimate defensive purposes in a complex and changing world, and that the sums spent pale in comparison with US defence expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By taking action to reduce asthma triggers, we can prevent asthma attacks that can lead to hospitalisation and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, more still needs to be done to prevent attacks, which kill three people each day in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, added: "This is important new research that further demonstrates how the smoking ban has dramatically improved people's lives and made smokers more aware of the harm smoking does to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But another 207,000 young people are still starting smoking every year in the UK, and 100,000 people are still dying earlier than they should because of smoking-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly a third of a million GP appointments each year are caused by children who are the victims of passive smoking. These horrendous figures show the scale of the problem we are still facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is why the government, if they are serious about saving lives, must now introduce legislation in the Queen's Speech on 8 May to bring in plain packaging and ban smoking in cars with children present."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/asthma"&gt;Asthma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/smoking"&gt;Smoking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
