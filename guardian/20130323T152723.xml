In the chapel where they prayed together, Benedict offered Francis the traditional kneeler used by the pope. Francis refused to take it alone, saying "We're brothers," and the two prayed together on the kneeler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the villa, the main piazza of Castel Gandolfo was busy on Saturday with well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of history: two popes eating together and discussing the future of the Catholic church. They chanted "Francesco! Francesco!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican spokesman, Rev Federico Lombardi, said he understood Benedict offered his pledge of obedience to the new pope, while Francis thanked Benedict for his ministry. He said they both wore white, though Benedict was in a simple cassock without the traditional sash and cape worn by Francis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedict has been living at the papal summer villa since he resigned on 28 February, the first pope to step down in 600 years. He has said he plans to live out his final years in prayer and remain "hidden from the world".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vatican said Benedict was at the helipad in the villa gardens to welcome Francis, and that the two were meeting in Benedict's library and having lunch together. Francis was due to return to his temporary home at the Vatican hotel later on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a few months in Castel Gandolfo, Benedict is to return to the Vatican to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens, just a short walk from St Peter's Basilica and the shrine devoted to the madonna where Francis went to pray on one of his first walks as pope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-francis"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-benedict-xvi"&gt;Pope Benedict XVI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-papacy"&gt;The papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cyprus must raise â‚¬5.8bn (Â£4.9bn) before Monday to qualify for the â‚¬10bn EU bailout it needs to prevent the collapse of its banks and a potential departure from the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of raising money through a one-off levy on bank deposits was criticised in Cyprus, Russia and elsewhere and was unanimously rejected by the Cypriot parliament earlier this week, but is being reconsidered after negotiations with Russia to find alternative finance did not achieve a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/cyprus-bailout-deal-mps-vote" title=""&gt;the Cypriot parliament passed nine bills&lt;/a&gt;, including three that would see ailing banks restructured, starting with Laiki, Cyprus's second-largest bank, a "national solidarity fund" and capital controls that would prevent large withdrawals from the country. A decision on the controversial bank savings levy and how it would be applied is due on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Cypriot politcians discussed a smaller bank levy of 1% which would be aplied to all accounts. The debate is divided between those that want the levy to be borne only by the wealthy which includes a high percentage of Russians who hold â‚¬30bn in Cypriot banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eurozone ministers are scheduled to meet on Sunday to decided how to help Cyprus avoid economic chaos. The European Central Bank has threatened to cut off funding from Monday and the banks face a run of investors withdrawing money when they re-open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot parliament will meet after the meeting of the eurozone ministers on Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Vassiliou, the former president of Cyprus, told the Guardian on Friday that it was imperative that the banking system was not allowed to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have developed a unique service sector based on confidence in the banking system. If that confidence is lost then you have nothing left. Everything that has been created will be destroyed with formidable repercussions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks in Cyprus have been closed since Monday and many businesses have been accepting only cash payments. The Foreign Office has advised Britons travelling to Cyprus to take enough euros to cover the cost of their trip and to guard their cash carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joadetunji"&gt;Jo Adetunji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was found in a vehicle on the main road between Enniskillen and Dublin in County Fermanagh on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissident republicans have murdered two soldiers, two police officers and a prison guard in attacks in Northern Ireland since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week ago the Police Service of Northern Ireland discovered a mortar-type device aimed towards New Barnsley police station in north Belfast. Also last week three officers escaped injury when an explosive device detonated within metres of them as they patrolled a coastal path on the outskirts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month two men were arrested after police intercepted a van carrying four mortar bombs which were primed and ready to fire at a station in Londonderry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pauline Shields, of the PSNI, said: "The people responsible for this have no regard for the lives of anyone in our community. It is fortunate that no one was killed or seriously injured as a result of this reckless act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although investigations are at an early stage it is our assessment at present that this vehicle was destined for Lisnaskea PSNI station."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/uksecurity"&gt;UK security and terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Four Democratic senators facing tough re-election campaigns in 2014 joined all the Senate Republicans in opposing the measure, which seeks to raise nearly $1tn in new tax revenues by closing some tax breaks for the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate budget, which reflects Democratic priorities of boosting near-term job growth and preserving social safety net programs, will square off in coming months against a Republican-focused budget passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of the non-binding blueprints has a chance of passage in the opposing chamber, leaving Congress no closer to resolving deep differences over how to shrink US deficits and grow the economy. But they give each party a platform from which to tout their respective fiscal visions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats' plan, from Senate Budget Committee chairman Patty Murray, aims to reduce deficits by $1.85tn over 10 years through an equal mix of tax increases and spending cuts. The Republican plan, from House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan, seeks $4.6tn in savings over the same period without raising new taxes. It aims to reach a small surplus by 2023 through deep cuts to health care and social programs that aid the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray said after the vote that she would try to work with Ryan on a path toward compromise. "While it is clear that the policies, values, and priorities of the Senate budget are very different than those articulated in the House budget," she said, "I know the American people are expecting us to work together to end the gridlock and find common ground, and I plan to continue doing exactly that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passage of a stop-gap government funding measure on Thursday lowered the temperature in the budget debate by eliminating the threat of a government shutdown next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to get a breather here. Congress will let things cool off a bit and there'll be other issues that come to the forefront in the spring," said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research Group, a firm that advises institutional investors on Washington politics. These issues include legislation on gun control, immigration reform and initial work on simplifying the tax code, which is particularly important to Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Republicans in opposing the Democratic budget were Democratic senators from conservative-leaning states: Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Voting for a budget that raises tax revenues could increase their vulnerability in congressional elections next year and put Democrats' thin majority at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the Senate vote early on Saturday morning, the body considered more than 100 largely symbolic, non-binding amendments to the budget aimed at scoring political points and staking out positions. Among notable amendments, the Senate signaled strong support for allowing states more authority to collect sales taxes on internet purchases, for approval of the controversial Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline and for repealing a tax on medical devices imposed by President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. The Senate also voted 99-0 to end policies that subsidized large banks considered "too big to fail" but came out against imposing taxes on industrial carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan's plan aims to reach a small surplus with no tax increases by 2023 through deep cuts to social safety net programs. This enables Republicans to claim that they are more responsible by balancing the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The House budget changes our debt course, while the Senate budget does not," said Senator Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a taste of the ideological debates to come, Murray claimed that the Senate budget was more "balanced" because it emphasized job growth and offered an equal amount of revenue increases and spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate had not passed a budget resolution since 2009, because of fiscal policy disputes with House Republicans that forced Congress to turn to numerous stop-gap spending measures to avoid government shutdowns. To protect their thin Senate majority, Democrats avoided exposing their members to potentially damaging votes to raise taxes ahead of 2012 elections, arguing that a 2011 budget deal set spending levels for several years and made the non-binding budget legislation unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this year, under the February debt limit increase law, members of both the House and Senate faced pay suspensions if their chamber had failed to pass a budget by 15 April. Although lawmakers in both parties have called for a return to normal budgeting procedures after years of stop-gap spending bills and high-pressure deadlines, there is little chance that they can work out differences between the two budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of conferencing them is kind of a joke. You would expect that if there were a chance of success, they wouldn't have planted flags on completely different planets," said Sean West, US policy director at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it may take another 11th-hour deal between president Barack Obama and congressional Republicans to set a fiscal path forward as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling, West said. The US Treasury is expected to exhaust its borrowing capacity around late July or early August.&lt;br /&gt;In 2011, a similar fight over the debt limit shook financial markets and cost the United States its top-tier credit rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/house-of-representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-taxation"&gt;US taxation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usdomesticpolicy"&gt;US domestic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/montana"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alaska"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/northcarolina"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arkansas"&gt;Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"George Osborne is saying there is going to be another five years of low growth and borrowing, with living standards being squeezed. The danger is that people become despairing, that they think there is no change that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the next election, the biggest opponent will be the sense that no one can sort out this problem. Our challenge is not to let people succumb to fatalism and think nothing can be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labour leader's comments come as ratings agency Fitch said it was putting the UK on "rating watch negative" because of rising debt and stagnant growth, which raises the prospect that it too, like Moody's, could downgrade the UK from AAA status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should be investing in infrastructure and housing ... [The Tories] are borrowing more because of a lack of growth. Borrowing would be lower if you followed the right economic strategy ... if you have a failing economic strategy, you just don't say I am going to plough on regardless," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband said he was prepared to pay a mansion tax on his house, believed to be worth at least Â£2m. "The difference between Cameron and me is that he's cutting taxes for himself, I might be raising them for myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got food banks all around the country. These are dire circumstances for a lot of people. The notion that it's right to take money off the poorest people but the rich can't get by is just wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as looking at the status of non-domiciles, the Labour leader said he also wanted to name and shame companies that paid too little tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband was also unwilling to commit to matching the government's spending plans. "I can't make spending decisions without knowing the economic circumstances of 2015," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Miliband will speak to the Labour party's people's forum in Bimingham. He will also accuse the chancellor of missing a chance to change course in the budget, which signalled more spending cuts and tax rises after 2015. Instead he will set out the Labour policies he claims will pull the UK back, including a 10p rate of income tax funded by a mansion tax and using money raised from the 4G mobile phone licences sale to build new homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joadetunji"&gt;Jo Adetunji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Almost 16,000 fewer British students started postgraduate courses at UK universities in 2011-12 compared with the previous academic year â€“ an 8% drop, according to data released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year the Observer revealed how &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/jan/19/oxford-university-st-hughs-sued-student-fees" title=""&gt;Damien Shannon, 26, was suing St Hugh's college for "selecting by wealth"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that the college, founded in 1886, was &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/21/suing-oxford-university-students-wealth" title=""&gt;discriminating against the poor&lt;/a&gt; by asking students to prove that they had liquid assets sufficient to cover Â£12,900 a year in living costs, in addition to potentially tens of thousands of pounds in tuition fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the university-wide policy the college refused to take into account projected earnings from students who planned to do paid work during their course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement agreed between Shannon and the college, they jointly announced they had "resolved the dispute between them, and that the court proceedings in Manchester county court are at an end with immediate effect".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: "St Hugh's College has advocated successfully for the University of Oxford, supported by the Conference of Colleges of the University, to carry out a review of the present financial guarantee policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On completion of the review, recommendations will be put to the university's council and the Conference of Colleges for consideration. It is anticipated that the process will be completed by September 2013."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parties agreed to pay their own costs. Shannon has been offered a place on the MSc in Economic and Social History course, for which he originally applied last March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St Hugh's, whose alumni include the home secretary, Theresa May, had initially hired Peter Oldham QC to fight its case at court at a potential cost of at least Â£60,000, according to documents seen by the Observer. At the time, friends of Shannon said that, should he lose the case and have to pay full costs, it would probably force him to declare himself bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St Hugh's claimed in court papers that the test of a student's financial health was in place to ensure students were able to complete their courses without suffering financial difficulty and anxiety. It said in its defence that the inability to meet the financial guarantee, which was formalised across the university in 2010, did not fall "disproportionately within" the lower socio-economic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the director of graduate admissions at Oxford University had to apologise to the judge hearing the case after erroneously claiming that other universities had the same admissions practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understood negotiations between Shannon and the university's lawyers and admissions office started last month and were finalised on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hazel Blears, the former Labour cabinet minister and Shannon's constituency MP for Salford and Eccles, said she was delighted by the development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damien has worked incredibly hard in pushing for this because, like me, he believes that insisting students must prove they have Â£13,000 towards living costs is deeply unfair, especially for those from poorer backgrounds," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It means that hugely intelligent men and women who have been offered places on academic merit are being denied the chance to make the most of their potential. Our country as a whole also misses out if their talent is not nurtured and the university must cease making proof of living costs a condition of entry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blears said she hoped the university would now install a fair policy and establish means-tested scholarships for students from less affluent backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As revealed by the Observer earlier this year, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2013/jan/26/postgraduates-poor-oxford-wealth-test" title=""&gt;around 1,000 students a year turn down postgraduate places won at Oxford because of the financial demands of study there&lt;/a&gt;. This amounts to 15% of the 7,500 students offered a place, according to the admissions office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, leaders at 11 universities told of their concerns about the socially divisive impact of rising tuition fees in response to teaching grant cuts and a lack of finance for prospective postgraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blears said she would continue to push for a national system of support and loans for postgraduate students, as recommended by the former Labour cabinet minister Alan Milburn, who is leading an independent review of social mobility, and by the Higher Education Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/oxforduniversity"&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/postgraduates"&gt;Postgraduates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/students"&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/socialexclusion"&gt;Social exclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/daniel-boffey"&gt;Daniel Boffey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A fashion show as part of Belfast fashion week was about to take place by candlelight on Friday night until power was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara McClintock, a spokeswoman for Northern Ireland Electricity, said: "The storm continued throughout the night and so conditions on the ground remain atrocious in many areas. Access to network faults is extremely difficult with up to 6ft of snow drifts. Emergency crews are struggling to get through even in 4x4 vehicles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also power cuts in parts of Scotland and Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flights were cancelled at airports in Northern Ireland and Leeds Bradford international airport suspended all flights due to adverse weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drivers had to contend with snow, strong winds and floods, with trees falling across a number of roads. Scotland, Cumbria, Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Lancashire all had road problems, as well as Wrexham, north Wales, Cornwall, West Sussex and Dorset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AA issued warnings to motorists that even short journeys could be difficult. Darron Burness, the AA's head of special operations, said: "It's going to be a real witch's brew of driving wind, rain and snow, which will inevitably cause disruption on the roads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the railways, First Great Western train services were affected after flooding made a house unstable close to the line near Looe in Cornwall, and no alternative transport could be provided because of poor road conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were also delays near Hatton in the West Midlands, Ilkley station in West Yorkshire, and in Shrewsbury and West Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the south-west is expected to be spared the heavy downpours and flash flooding it suffered on Friday, more than 90 flood risk alerts remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A landslide and floodwater in Cornwall, thought to have been triggered by torrential rain, caused a building to collapse on Friday. Emergency crews found a woman's body after picking through debris at the Veronica flats in Looe. The body is believed to be that of Susan Norman, who is in her 60s and police said was unaccounted for, having not been heard from since returning to the flat on Thursday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Met Office said more disruption was expected on Saturday and Sunday as the snow moved south. "There are yellow warnings in place, although the snow is weakening as it drifts further south. The most affected areas will continue to be Northern Ireland, the Pennine area, the north and west Midlands. We could have 2-5cm of snow as far south as Essex and Kent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temperature was 2C colder than normal, he said, but there was evidence to suggest temperatures were record breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/conalurquhart"&gt;Conal Urquhart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Fire and rescue service said a body had been found in the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neighbour, Pete Temlett, said he was roused by a resident at about 5am and feared the building "could collapse at any moment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The windows were popping out and you could see the house was moving. My immediate thought was for the safety of the woman who lives in the bottom flat, but I couldn't go in there. I thought if I open a door it could collapse and cause her more injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornwall fire and rescue spokesman Dave King said a body was recovered from the property at about 6pm. He was unable to say if it was that of the missing woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dozen flood warnings were in place in the south-west of England on Friday night, as well as 80 lower-level flood alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further north, the problems centred around snow and heavy winds, the combination of which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/22/power-cut-northern-ireland-snow" title=""&gt;left about 44,000 homes in Northern Ireland without electricity&lt;/a&gt; after power lines collapsed in Counties Antrim and Down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Police Service of Northern Ireland issued an unprecedented plea for motorists to stay at home. In Belfast, power had been restored to most areas after an earlier near total blackout. The snow &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/22/weather-inspection-northern-ireland-world-cup" title=""&gt;caused Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifying game against Russia&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled for Friday evening at Windsor Park in Belfast, to be postponed until Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, with more than 20cm of snow falling in some areas, students and parents faced the disruption of a sudden day off school, not a common event immediately before the Easter holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 200 schools were closed in north Wales, with 400 shut in the West Midlands and Staffordshire, and others affected in Derbyshire and Yorkshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, 10,000 homes lost their power in Argyll, while snow also affected Dumfries and Galloway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather caused a partial shutdown of the Sellafield nuclear power plant in Cumbria after many staff were sent home early. Scores of roads were closed, with driving organisations urging caution â€“ the AA said even brief journeys could be treacherous and warned drivers could end up stuck in their cars. The weather disrupted some rail lines, notably in Wales, and closed Leeds Bradford airport for a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further south, high water levels in the river Thames forced the cancellation of the &lt;a href="http://www.pooh-sticks.com/" title=""&gt;World Pooh Sticks championships&lt;/a&gt; in Oxfordshire, an RNLI fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With temperatures in many areas barely above freezing, and strong winds making it feel considerably colder, there was no respite in prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snow is expected to ease, but temperatures are not predicted to improve noticeably even by the middle of next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasters say March could be the coldest for more than 50 years. John Lee of MeteoGroup said the average in central England so far this month had been 3.8C, against the expected 6C. "It's provisionally going to be the coldest March in 50 years, although that can't be confirmed until the end of the month." The average of 2.8C in 1962 would "take some beating", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street dismissed reports that gas supplies would run out next month, meaning expensive imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time last year, much of the UK basked in unseasonal heat. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelBratley/status/315080591844442112" title=""&gt;much-relayed item on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; showed the temperature map for Friday next to that for 22 March last year, with a maximum of 21C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Maskell, from the University of Reading's Walker institute for climate system research, said: "The low temperatures we've experienced this March would have seemed quite normal to people over the first half of the 20th century, but we've seen a gradual rise in typically March temperatures, particularly over the last 30 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/northernireland"&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterwalker"&gt;Peter Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paulowen"&gt;Paul Owen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald"&gt;Henry McDonald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But at 58, he's ready to be taken seriously&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his compelling new television drama, &lt;a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/boss" title=""&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001288/" title=""&gt;Kelsey Grammer&lt;/a&gt; plays the (fictional) mayor of Chicago, Tom Kane, as a cross between Richard III and Richard Nixon: a&amp;nbsp;ruthless, rage-filled gangster so hollowed out by&amp;nbsp;the getting and keeping of power that there's no one he won't betray. In one memorable early scene, alone in his kitchen at night, Kane opens a&amp;nbsp;gift-wrapped package to discover the bloody, severed ears of a businessman who's been obstructing his plans. He drops them into the garbage-disposal unit, then nonchalantly goes to&amp;nbsp;tell his wife (estranged, of course, though they live in the same house) that they'll need to call a&amp;nbsp;plumber. But watching all this, it's hard to avoid the thought that Mayor Kane's true target â€“ the man he'd really like to finish off with a swift bullet&amp;nbsp;to the head in some dark Chicago alley â€“ is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.co.uk/title/tt0106004/" title=""&gt;Dr Frasier Crane&lt;/a&gt;. Counting his appearances in&amp;nbsp;both &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.co.uk/title/tt0083399/" title=""&gt;Cheers&lt;/a&gt; and Frasier, Grammer played the&amp;nbsp;pompous yet essentially lovable psychiatrist&amp;nbsp;for two decades, from 1984 to 2004, the longest-running job in sitcom history, and none of his roles since has come close to dislodging the public perception that Grammer is Crane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new show, as Grammer explains when we&amp;nbsp;meet at a Beverly Hills hotel, was the result of&amp;nbsp;a conscious decision to make as radical a&amp;nbsp;departure as possible: "It's good to say, 'By the way, in case you hadn't figured it out, I can &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; do&amp;nbsp;this.'" He is a towering, loping presence; at 58, he seems finally to have attained the middle age that he exuded, as Frasier Crane, from his early 30s onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only storyline that has repeatedly threatened to overshadow Grammer's best-known screen role is that of his personal life: from&amp;nbsp;his vigorous pursuit, in the 1980s and 1990s,&amp;nbsp;of as much alcohol as he could feasibly consume, and many drugs besides, leading to &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-17/local/me-412_1_kelsey-grammer" title=""&gt;a&amp;nbsp;month's jail time for drink-driving&lt;/a&gt; and a&amp;nbsp;conviction for cocaine possession; to his vocal support for the Republican party; to a&amp;nbsp;ferocious multimillion-dollar divorce and child custody battle with his third wife, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Grammer" title=""&gt;Camille Grammer&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;former Playboy model and current star of &lt;a href="http://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills" title=""&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Real Housewives Of&amp;nbsp;Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt; whose name he refuses even to speak; to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/26/kelsey-grammer-marries-kayte-walsh" title=""&gt;his 2011&amp;nbsp;marriage to Kayte Walsh&lt;/a&gt;, a British woman 26&amp;nbsp;years his junior, whom he met on a Virgin Atlantic flight from LA to London on which she was working as a flight attendant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days before our interview, a publicist tries to persuade me not to ask Grammer any questions about his personal life. Last autumn, &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/27/kelsey-grammer-piers-morgan-cnn_n_1919662.html" title=""&gt;he&amp;nbsp;stalked off the set of Piers Morgan's CNN show moments before a live interview&lt;/a&gt;, apparently because Morgan planned to display a photograph of Camille on screen. But the request is pointless: Grammer talks about his personal life with no prompting, almost compulsively. He talks, especially, about his refusal to talk about Camille. "There areâ€¦ &lt;em&gt;forces&lt;/em&gt; at work in my life these days that blast stuff out all over the internet," he says at one point, in response to a frankly gentle question that didn't touch on his ex-wife at all. "And there's only one source for these stories." He frowns. "And I'm not going to name her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the opening scene of Boss, Tom Kane receives a diagnosis of Lewy body dementia, a&amp;nbsp;lesser-known degenerative disease characterised by vivid hallucinations, shaking and cognitive decline that will kill the mayor within a few years. This built-in timebomb is one&amp;nbsp;of several ways in&amp;nbsp;which the show echoes &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad" title=""&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt;, which derives its early urgency from its lead character's cancer diagnosis; meanwhile, everything from the opening credits to the panoramic shots of Chicago invite comparison with &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/wire" title=""&gt;The Wire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Boss, which started on More4 this week, doesn't quite reach the standard of either, it's because of its anxious insistence on hooking the&amp;nbsp;viewer with ever more sensational plot developments, along with sex scenes so gratuitous it's impossible not to laugh. Kane's machinations, assisted by his inscrutable aide Kitty O'Neill, played by Kathleen Robertson, are regularly interrupted so that Robertson's character can remove most of her clothes in order to have sex with one of the mayor's proteges (Ben&amp;nbsp;Zajac, played by Jeff Hephner).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all this lurid stuff, Grammer insists, is&amp;nbsp;the point: "We wanted Jacobean-slash-Shakespearean, privy councillors, hidden&amp;nbsp;lives, bastard children." The&amp;nbsp;current mayor of Chicago, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rahm-emanuel" title=""&gt;Rahm Emanuel&lt;/a&gt;, has seen Boss, Grammer reports, as has Richard&amp;nbsp;M&amp;nbsp;Daley, the ex-mayor whose father and&amp;nbsp;mayor before him, the legendary Richard J&amp;nbsp;Daley, is the&amp;nbsp;closest thing to a real-life model for&amp;nbsp;Kane. "They like the character, because they want people to think the mayor is that guy. A&amp;nbsp;monster â€“ but you love the monster. He's done bad, bad things, and perhaps he has abdicated his humanity to his work. But the remnant of humanity is in there somewhere." Emanuel once&amp;nbsp;sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster with whom he was having a disagreement â€“ not quite a&amp;nbsp;severed human ear, but you can see why he might feel a certain affinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By his own admission, Grammer isn't an actor with a capital A, diligently developing his character off-camera or deeply researching his roles. "I'm a walk-on guy," he says with some pride. "When the director says, 'Action', I'm on." During the worst years of his alcoholism, he could&amp;nbsp;reportedly turn up wrecked to a&amp;nbsp;recording of Frasier, then snap into character, alongside his&amp;nbsp;co-stars David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves and John Mahoney, and play Crane with absolute conviction. (On the other hand, the cast members of both Cheers and Frasier felt moved to stage interventions, which failed.) The rest of the time he was busy, as he puts it, being "America's favourite tabloid presence", an off-the-rails celebrity bafflingly unlike the prissy Dr Crane. "I&amp;nbsp;had a kind of romantic notion about being a&amp;nbsp;Hollywood Errol Flynn type," he recalls. "Honestly, I did not get into a lot of bar brawls â€“ but I was always willing to. About the only thing&amp;nbsp;missing from my story is that I haven't had&amp;nbsp;a full knock-down fight in the middle of &lt;a href="http://www.beverlyhillshotel.com/the-polo-lounge" title=""&gt;the Polo Lounge&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be a psychiatrist â€“ or to have played one on TV â€“ to discern the roots of this behaviour. Grammer's childhood and early adulthood were marked by an extraordinary sequence of tragic events. First, his father, who had abandoned the family when Grammer was three, was murdered; later, two half-brothers would be killed in a diving accident. But what he calls "the crystallising tragic event of my life" took place in 1975, when his younger sister, Karen, was abducted, raped and murdered, one of&amp;nbsp;three victims of a Colorado spree killer. A&amp;nbsp;20-year-old Kelsey had to identify her body. "I&amp;nbsp;could not work through it for 20 years," he says. "And thenâ€¦ I did. Just through self-forgiveness. It's a weird thing. I finally worked out that I didn't need to carry it any more, this idea that I was responsible in some way. It's always there. It's always bubbling beneath the surface. Something will happen â€“ a certain look&amp;nbsp;on somebody's face, even a commercial on television, or a news report about this poor girl [the victim in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/18/steubenville-misplaced-sympathy-jane-doe-rapists" title=""&gt;the Steubenville rape case&lt;/a&gt;], and that'll tweak something. It never goes away." In&amp;nbsp;recent years, he has actively fought &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8629271" title=""&gt;against the possibility of his sister's killer being paroled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There followed, after Grammer's emergence from alcohol-fuelled self-destruction, years of lucrative professional success, along with a few professional blips â€“ &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/jun/21/michaelellison1" title=""&gt;a stage production of Macbeth was badly received and closed early&lt;/a&gt; â€“ but they were also years of worsening marital discord. Then, in 2008, while on holiday in Hawaii with Camille, Grammer suffered a heart attack, which in his telling triggered a re-evaluation of his life. "I don't really want to go into it, because whenever I say anything about my past now, it becomes a pissing matchâ€¦ but I realised that I&amp;nbsp;had acquiesced, in my 40s, to an idea of 'You know what, maybe this thing that you wanted in your life, maybe it just wasn't important'â€¦ And then I had my heart attack, and I thought, 'I don't want this to be the final story in my life.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, Grammer was offered the role of Georges in a Broadway revival of the musical La Cage Aux Folles, and it was on a Christmas trip to see the London production that he first encountered Walsh, daughter of the former Bristol City striker Alan Walsh. Later the same week, they met up in central London. Grammer tells the story in a tone that suggests he&amp;nbsp;realises it would probably be rejected as a&amp;nbsp;scene in a romantic comedy on the grounds of being too cheesy. "She came out of the tube stop across from Harvey Nichols, and I walked across the street from the hotel, and there she stood, and I just thought, 'That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.' And then we went for a&amp;nbsp;walk&amp;nbsp;in Hyde Park, and the moment we stepped into Hyde Park, snow began to fall." They rode a&amp;nbsp;Christmas ferris wheel, and when they reached&amp;nbsp;the top, "I looked at her, I kissed her, and&amp;nbsp;we've been together ever since. I was finally ready. I was reborn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple have a daughter, Faith, now eight months old â€“ a half-sister to Grammer's four other children (one with his first wife, two with his third and one with a make-up artist).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the Love Actually schmaltz, by the end of this story Grammer is in a state of such rapt delight that a listener can't avoid being affected. Yet it also serves as a kind of rhetorical bulldozer, obliterating prying questions about the relationship, such as the enormous age difference, or the fact that it began as an extramarital affair when Grammer was still married to Camille. It's "the first time" he's felt optimistic about the possibility of "carving out a&amp;nbsp;life together with someone", he says. Peruse earlier interviews and you'll find him saying similar things about Camille, but he brushes that fact aside with an ease that's vaguely unsettling: "I've said nice things about the people I was with before, but that's what you do. This is truly different. It was just magic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grammer is as famous in Hollywood these days for his politics as for his earlier misdemeanours. What makes him a Republican in an industry dominated by Democrats? "The idea of self-reliance is important to me, and that is echoed, in&amp;nbsp;my way of thinking, by a conservative approach to politics," he says. "But that is not what most people believe right now. The majority of people want bigger government. They want government to take care of them." The foundation of this position, perhaps unsurprisingly, turns out&amp;nbsp;to be tax: Grammer finds it "pretty hard to swallow" that he should have to pay "more than half my income" in tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he really think, &lt;a href="http://www.popmodal.com/video/14657/Kelsey-Grammer-comes-out-of-the-closet-on-the-Jay-Leno-Show-Hes-the-Boss" title=""&gt;as he claimed recently in&amp;nbsp;an interview with Jay Leno&lt;/a&gt;, that he was denied&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;Emmy award for Boss because of his politics? "Is it possible that they might think, 'Oh&amp;nbsp;gosh, I&amp;nbsp;don't like what he stands for'? Sure it&amp;nbsp;is." And would he really, as he has suggested&amp;nbsp;several times&amp;nbsp;in the past, consider running for office as a&amp;nbsp;Republican? "That still may happen," he says. "It would be a big nut to swallow." What would voters make of the alcohol, the drugs, the multiple wives or, for that matter, the sex tape (yes, there was one, in 1998)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, all that would come up," Grammer says. "But I don't think it needs to stick. George Bush went through something similar and he said, 'Look, there's some&amp;nbsp;stuff in my past.' And then you move on." There is "a certain elegance" in public service, he says, sounding suddenly like Frasier Crane to the point where I&amp;nbsp;wonder if the whole thing's a joke. I&amp;nbsp;rather hope so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ &lt;a href="http://www.channel4.com/programmes/boss" title=""&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt; is on More4, Thursdays at 11pm.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/kelsey-grammer"&gt;Kelsey Grammer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/comedy"&gt;Comedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/us-television"&gt;US television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/comedy"&gt;Comedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/oliverburkeman"&gt;Oliver Burkeman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the last three months of 2012 it shrank 0.3%. A second quarter of negative growth could undermine faltering business confidence and choke off the first signs of a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts said that even without a triple dip, the worsening economic situation has made further credit downgrades inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents that accompanied the budget, the OBR said it halved the forecast for growth this year to 0.6% and said the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak at 85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Fitch said a tougher measure of the UK's debt burden showed the debt pile would exceed 100% of annual national income before it begins to fall, which makes UK's situation more perilous. While it credited the UK with having a "high-income, diversified and flexible economy", it said the last four years of low growth had damaged the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch said: "The persistently weak performance of UK growth, in part due to European growth, has increased uncertainty around the UK's potential output and longer-term trend rate of growth with significant implications for public finances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Moody's stunned George Osborne when it became the first agency to kick Britain out of the exclusive AAA club, which still includes Germany, Canada and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech to the Labour party's policy forum on Saturday Miliband will accuse the government of leading Britain into a lost decade. "They are shrugging their shoulders, They have run out of ideas. They are resigned to a lost decade," he will say. But he will also admit that Labour faces a struggle in persuading fatalistic voters that British economic paralysis is not inevitable. He will say: "I know some of you are thinking: 'It's true things look grim. But there's nothing we can do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people will believe that the failure of this government means they should give up on politics altogether, that nobody can turn round the problems of this country and nobody deserves our vote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labour leader will say it is his task to show that he can stop the slide and that a "lost decade" is not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polling suggests that although voters are disillusioned with the government's economic record they are doubtful that any government can lift the economy faced by European economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frustration with Labour's economic strategy was revealed by Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, who claimed the public were tired of the Labour argument about cutting too far, too fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a CBI dinner, he said: "The whole argument about whether we are cutting too far, too fast is about the past. It is rather predictable party political stuff for over the dispatch box. It is a bit tiring to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would put the emphasis less on whether we are going too far, too fast, not fast enough, on deficit reduction, and move the debate on to the future of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows we are in a heck of a bad way in the economy. Quite a lot more pain is going to be experienced. What we should be saying is: this is the light at the end of the tunnel. This is where we should be heading. We should develop a slightly less defensive and more forthright analysis or understanding of the structural problems in our economy and why they weren't completely eradicated by the Labour government. I would be a little more candid about the past".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to explain how we would retool and redevelop our economy. We need a politician who will fight on that rather than fight about the past or fight over what is fair and what is not fair. The Labour party has got to offer more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the Labour party is going to go into the next election fighting it on social justice rather than economic transformation and prosperity it will be limited in its appeal. We need to tell people in the country how we are going to earn our way and make our living in the country rather than how we are going to redistribute our money from the very rich. Sometimes they make the mistake of talking about that too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: "This is yet another blow to a downgraded chancellor who made keeping the confidence of the credit rating agencies the number one test of his economic policy. What really matters are the economic realities which Fitch are responding to including, as their statement says, 'the persistently weak performance of UK growth'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/rating-agencies"&gt;Rating agencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phillipinman"&gt;Phillip Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If it is approved, Cyprus's leader is expected to head to Brussels for talks with top officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the news broke, eurozone finance ministers announced that they would meet again on Sunday to discuss the Cypriot government's latest bid to halt a crisis that has sent tremors through the 17-nation bloc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race to secure a bailout from the EU and IMF intensified as the country's banks remained closed. Demonstrators rallied outside parliament after the island's finance minister, Michalis Sarris, returned empty-handed from two days of talks in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus needs â‚¬17bn and is in negotiations to get â‚¬10bn from the EU, the IMF and the European Central Bank. The remainder must come from the country's own resources. The original bailout plan, announced last Saturday, would have raised â‚¬5.8bn by skimming nearly 7% off all bank deposits of less than â‚¬100,000, and 9.9% of bigger bank accounts. A package of austerity measures was also planned to take the total to â‚¬17bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The re-emergence of the savings tax proposal, despite its unanimous rejection by the Cypriot parliament earlier this week, came after Sarris returned with the news no one wanted: that talks with Russia had failed to produce a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that [the savings tax] is clearly on the table, that it is something that needs to be discussed to see whether a levy on deposits of some sort â€¦ would make a contribution to finalising the package," Sarris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday night it was expected that the levy will focus only on accounts with more than â‚¬100,000, a move that will almost certainly stoke tensions with Moscow. Russian investors have â‚¬30bn deposited in Cypriot banks â€“ the island is a tax haven â€“ and the initial plan provoked anger at the highest levels of government in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Nicos Anastasiades had proposed that small savers be included for fear of driving away the Russians, whose deposits are vital to keeping the Cyprus banking system afloat. The Russian government has already extended a â‚¬2.5bn loan to Nicosia, which the Cyprus government needs to retain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volte-face on the bank levy followed mounting criticism of MPs for rejecting the first bailout accord. Prominent former MPs accused the island's political elite of pandering to populist sentiment in the maelstrom of outrage that the proposal triggered. Critics said that, had the levy been passed, the government would not have been forced to draw up alternative plans. These now include the restructuring of the island's second biggest bank, Laiki, a move that its chief, Takis Phidias, described as a "disaster not just for the bank but for the economy of Cyprus". The basic plan is to split the bank in two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, appeared to reject the alternative scheme of a solidarity fund, saying it would not be sufficient to raise the money required to unlock â‚¬10bn in aid. The fund will pool national assets including hypothetical returns from offshore gas and oil reserves, nationalising Cypriot workers' pension funds, and revenues from the sale of assets belonging to Cyprus's affluent Orthodox church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Anastasiades government proposed the creation of the fund after the ECB threatened to cut off emergency aid to Cypriot banks by Monday if the country failed to convince creditors it could meet the onerous conditions of the bailout accord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Vassiliou, the former president of Cyprus, told the Guardian it was imperative that the banking system was not allowed to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cyprus is not just an island in the sun," he said. "We have developed a unique service sector based on confidence in the banking system. If that confidence is lost then you have nothing left. Everything that has been created will be destroyed with formidable repercussions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was "no doubt" that ordinary people should contribute to the island's financial rescue. But he criticised the lack of foresight ministers had shown in announcing the levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With German elections looming in the autumn, Merkel has adopted a tough stance. She told German MPs the Mediterranean island's business model was obsolete and that the bailout would need to be structured in such a way that it could be repaid. Cyprus, she said, could no longer depend on its reputation as an offshore tax haven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greece also weighed in, announcing that its local lender, Piraeus Bank, would buy branches of Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move came as officials in Athens expressed consternation over Germany's apparent determination to cut Cyprus loose if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith"&gt;Helena Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor"&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The country's parliament has remained bitterly divided on most issues in the two years since the elected prime minister, Saad Hariri was ousted by a Hezbollah-led bloc, known as March 8, which now holds the majority of seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remnants of the Hariri bloc, known as March 14, has effectively been in opposition ever since and had pushed for a continued role for the Internal Security Forces chief, Ashraf Rifi, who it sees as its last remaining link to Lebanon's security establishment after the assassination last October of the intelligence general, Wissam al-Hassan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miqati's attempts to act as a conduit for the deeply polarised groups had largely failed and he had twice before threatened to resign. David Cameron personally intervened when Miqati tried to quit in the wake of General Hassan's death, underscoring the depth of British support for his government and fears of what may follow if it fell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's ambassador to Lebanon, Tom Fletcher, said: "Najib Miqati has done one of the world's toughest jobs with great tenacity and skill, at a time of immense challenges. It is now important that Lebanon's leaders work together to forge a clearer national vision, and to manage contagion from the Syria crisis. We should help them brace themselves against the challenges they face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanese leaders immediately tried to douse talk of a vacuum in the country where state control has been sorely tested as the Assad regime's hold on Syria has steadily disintegrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a televised address, Miqati said: "There will be no rescue [for Lebanon] except through dialogue and making room for the formation of a salvation government in which all groups are represented." His resignation is expected to be accepted by President Michel Suleiman on Saturday and a caretaker government appointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gunfire echoed through the centre of Miqati's home city of Tripoli, with Sunni groups battling an Alawite enclave in the Jabel al-Mohsen district. Enmity between the groups is stoked by the Syria crisis, with the Alawites staunchly backing Assad and the Sunnis vehement supporters of the Syrian opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardening sectarian positions in the region and a spillover from Syria had threatened to make this year's planned elections more bitterly fought than ever. Neither bloc has been prepared to compromise on the formation of a commission to oversee the election, or whether it is contested on a law drafted in the 1960s or new legislation. Lebanon's sectarian demographics have shifted drastically in the decades of war and emigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/lebanon"&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hezbollah"&gt;Hezbollah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-chulov"&gt;Martin Chulov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Rightly or&amp;nbsp;wrongly, there are those whom everyone wants to make their instant best friend, and those who&amp;nbsp;get it in the neck. Why is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/adele" title=""&gt;Adele&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;so robustly likable, while&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;equally successful &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/taylor-swift" title=""&gt;Taylor&amp;nbsp;Swift&lt;/a&gt; often comes across like&amp;nbsp;a wounded deer? Why would so&amp;nbsp;many of us run into the nearest pub to neck shots&amp;nbsp;with &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jennifer-lawrence" title=""&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;leave &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/anne-hathaway" title=""&gt;Anne Hathaway&lt;/a&gt; waiting in the car? Using deeply scientific methodology, we've uncovered the reasons behind this puzzling phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five women we love to love&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/merylstreep" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, you don't always want&amp;nbsp;a celeb to be "down to Earth" or "just like us". &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/mariahcarey" title=""&gt;Mariah Carey&lt;/a&gt;'s need for a staff member to carry her&amp;nbsp;drink&amp;nbsp;and prop up the bendy bit of her straw is what makes me love her so much. In politicians, it might be unbecoming to live a&amp;nbsp;life of gross opulence, but showbiz is different. Which is why some journalists were so distraught when&amp;nbsp;Meryl Streep, promoting &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/05/the-iron-lady-film-review" title=""&gt;The Iron Lady&lt;/a&gt;, baked them a pie and washed up afterwards. A small screening was held for some female writers, after which Meryl got out the Marigolds in the kitchen of a house in Islington. "You're Meryl Streep!" they tried to say to her. "We love you! We want our most fabulous movie stars to live massively glamorous lives that we&amp;nbsp;cannot begin to dream of! Roll your sleeves&amp;nbsp;back down and please take my chair!" Then again, Streep was equally resplendent in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/shortcuts/2012/dec/03/hillary-clinton-meryl-streep-caption-competition" title=""&gt;a&amp;nbsp;recently released image with Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;, her arm around the&amp;nbsp;former secretary of state, trying to take a&amp;nbsp;photo of the pair of them on her iPhone. The&amp;nbsp;fact is that neither rubber gloves&amp;nbsp;nor mobile phone selfies can&amp;nbsp;lessen the dignity of Streep. Such joie de vivre, coupled with such accomplishment, makes her a&amp;nbsp;goddess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jennifer-lawrence" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Oscars, there is one question whispered in the dark corners of Hollywood more than any other. And that is: has Jennifer Lawrence been out for a Bacardi Breezer with Jack Nicholson yet? If you haven't seen the footage of the 22-year-old being chatted up by the veteran actor after she won the best actress Oscar, then &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJmhsJ5T5L0" title=""&gt;get thee to YouTube immediately&lt;/a&gt;. Her face! Her hands! Her shocked howl! While you're there, you might as well watch every other clip of her from the ceremony: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE3MQOH8cv4" title=""&gt;tripping on her dress&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hsGm3WP5xQ" title=""&gt;bewildered by the red carpet fashion people&lt;/a&gt;. The&amp;nbsp;press conference at which &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M-cMptmIMQ" title=""&gt;she admits she's a bit too sloshed to focus on the questions&lt;/a&gt;, only to get brilliantly annoyed when somebody asks if winning the Oscar means she's peaked too soon. (Somehow, her annoyed response is also very warm.) Everything seems so unrehearsed and so genuinely funny, as if she had somehow slipped this far through the film industry without anyone remembering to put her name down for media training. I&amp;nbsp;mean, really â€“ maybe she has? I&amp;nbsp;don't know anybody who watched that and didn't want to become Jen's&amp;nbsp;best friend as a matter of some&amp;nbsp;urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/michelleobama" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michelle Obama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Michelle Obama had her hair cut into a&amp;nbsp;trendy fringe, she pointed at her forehead and told a CNN reporter, "This is my midlife crisis, the bangs. I&amp;nbsp;couldn't get a sports car, and they won't let me bungee jump." Oh, you can just imagine her and Barry O together, exuding droll wit as they snuggle up by the fire in the White House den, wondering how to deal with the latest insurgency from their pesky kids that they just love so goddamn much. And as for &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/feb/22/michelle-obama-big-bird-lets-move-video" title=""&gt;the healthy eating campaign&lt;/a&gt;, given that half the food sold in the US appears to be fashioned purely from E numbers and polystyrene, that's not a twee first lady hobby, that's humanitarian crisis work. She also gets away with doing dance routines with Tina Fey on Saturday Night Live because, unlike David Cameron for example, she can actually dance. Yet you can also fully believe her when she says, "I never cut class. I&amp;nbsp;loved getting As, I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I&amp;nbsp;thought being smart is cooler than anything in the world." And thus the geek shall inherit the Earth. (We aren't even going to mention her arms. Those high-fiving, fist-bumping, glorious arms.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005109/" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mila Kunis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you can just imagine her&amp;nbsp;wanging out to World of Warcraft, the game she plays online, anonymously, against total&amp;nbsp;strangers (she had to stop using the voice command after somebody recognised her). Because&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzuT_vhcQ7U" title=""&gt;she was recently interviewed by a&amp;nbsp;bumbling&amp;nbsp;boy from&amp;nbsp;Radio 1 who asked if she would go to the pub with his mates in&amp;nbsp;Watford&lt;/a&gt; and she was all, hell, why not, I'm the person who says yes to everything â€“ what are&amp;nbsp;we drinking? She went on&amp;nbsp;to lecture him&amp;nbsp;about&amp;nbsp;beer. (Famously, she also went to a&amp;nbsp;Marine Corps ball in North&amp;nbsp;Carolina after a&amp;nbsp;soldier, then serving in Afghanistan, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdRgkyRYfgE" title=""&gt;put&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;video on YouTube asking her to&amp;nbsp;be his date&lt;/a&gt;.) Because her Ukrainian family&amp;nbsp;left the Soviet Union to move&amp;nbsp;to LA when she was seven, to&amp;nbsp;escape communism and antisemitism, and she describes her&amp;nbsp;first day at her American state school as making her feel deaf and blind. Because she joined an after-school acting class for fun and realised that everyone in LA was beautiful so she'd better work on her&amp;nbsp;comic timing instead. Because she criticises&amp;nbsp;the Republican party, saying things like, "I may not be a&amp;nbsp;practising Jew, but why we gotta talk about Jesus all the time?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/adele" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adele&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessed with the kind of smile that&amp;nbsp;sets her whole body off laughing, and then sets everybody else's off with it, Adele is queen of the fantasy&amp;nbsp;BFFs. Do you know any&amp;nbsp;woman who'd turn down a night on the sauce with her? Anyone who&amp;nbsp;doesn't think that if they could&amp;nbsp;just have her in their bedroom&amp;nbsp;at seven o'clock on a&amp;nbsp;Friday&amp;nbsp;night, in control of the white wine, the Elnett and the minicab booking, that life would somehow never be cheerless again? She always regales with stories such&amp;nbsp;as the time she went to see the&amp;nbsp;Spice Girls at the 02 and puked out of the car window all the way home. We need a new word for laddishness, for this is womanishness nowadays. In&amp;nbsp;fact,&amp;nbsp;this awards season really felt&amp;nbsp;dramatically different because of&amp;nbsp;women such as Adele and her twin soul Jennifer Lawrence talking&amp;nbsp;like humans, not zombies. The jokes, the laughter, the immediacy of their response: it was no longer a PR schmoozefest. Adele&amp;nbsp;brings to celebrity what &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/mo-mowlam" title=""&gt;Mo&amp;nbsp;Mowlam&lt;/a&gt; brought to politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five women we love to hate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/anne-hathaway" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne Hathaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's such a shame that wanting people to like you always has the opposite effect. I mean, is there something so wrong with Anne Hathaway's desire to bring happiness and be popular? Truth be&amp;nbsp;told, it &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get a bit exhausting. I&amp;nbsp;once sat near her in a&amp;nbsp;restaurant, where she zealously introduced herself and her friends to each waiter, as if he were a cherished member of their social unit and not just some bloke paid to carry a tray. People who have worked with her have said similar: that the constant praising of movie minions with, "You did such a good job there! Well done!" can grate. And if that's in sunny LA, think how well it would go down over here. The solution is for Hathaway to spend a&amp;nbsp;year in sarky Manchester, where her attempts to go jogging will be thwarted by 324 days of rain, and if she so much as thinks about telling a&amp;nbsp;Mancunian barmaid that she has poured those lagers fantastically well, she will swiftly learn an aloofness not taught in any American drama school.&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/anne-hathaway" title=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor Swift is a massively successful singer-songwriter, whose own hard slog as composer and&amp;nbsp;performer has taken her to the top. When &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egIEFNbBaLw" title=""&gt;Kanye West dissed&amp;nbsp;her at an awards ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, everyone swung to her defence. But then she kept banging on about it. And when &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0llm8lTa8xI" title=""&gt;Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made a joke about her love life at&amp;nbsp;the Golden Globes&lt;/a&gt;, she started going on about that, too, saying that there was "a special place in hell reserved for women who don't&amp;nbsp;help other women", which was a bit ironic, given how many of&amp;nbsp;Swift's songs place her in the role of victim of other terrible slutty types. It has been said that women are not hard-wired to respond to damsels in distress in the same way men are, so all this "white dress scorned virgin" stuff can get a bit lost on us. The real problem here, though, is that Swift has achieved so&amp;nbsp;much, so young, by herself, and&amp;nbsp;is trying massively hard to be a&amp;nbsp;grown-up. One is reminded of a&amp;nbsp;line from her hero, Bob Dylan: "Ah, but I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now." We predict that the Taylor of five years' time will have learned to knock back a&amp;nbsp;nice Malibu and pineapple, and laugh at herself a bit. And maybe quit the princess-who-can't-sleep-on-a-pea routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/keiraknightley" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/article3002179.ece" title=""&gt;I interviewed Joe Wright&lt;/a&gt;, director of many of Knightley's films (Pride And Prejudice, Anna Karenina, Atonement), he told me he loved working with her because she was so much fun to muck about with&amp;nbsp;on set. Obviously, her acting talent was the top draw, but what he really raved about was what a massive laugh she was. I&amp;nbsp;must admit I was surprised, and found myself wondering if&amp;nbsp;the misapprehension all comes down&amp;nbsp;to bone structure. Are we&amp;nbsp;somehow programmed to associate those sculpted cheeks and pouted mouth with someone&amp;nbsp;who can't tell a decent joke? If you look at Lawrence, Adele and Streep, none of them has such a pronounced bone structure as Knightley, Hathaway or &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/angelinajolie" title=""&gt;Angelina Jolie&lt;/a&gt;, and none of them receives such scorn. In polls, men tend to rate Knightley more highly as an actor than women do. Does this mean women equate bony with moany? Or does Knightley just need to unleash a&amp;nbsp;cheery grin and tell some of those knob gags on primetime telly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2013/feb/16/rock-chic-pixie-geldof" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peaches Geldof&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, the Scientology phase was hard to love, we'll give you that much. And the documentary where &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2009/apr/14/peaches-geldof-magazine-disappear-here" title=""&gt;she set up a magazine&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;was rude to her staff because they weren't cool enough or, like, didn't have Nick Cave's mobile number was a bit mortifying. And&amp;nbsp;the shoplifting accusations didn't bode well â€“ but why should they? Can you honestly say you didn't spend your teens and early 20s lurching from one bad decision&amp;nbsp;to another, retrospectively grateful that the paparazzi didn't notice you and Channel 4 couldn't spare the budget to give you a chatshow? It's taken me years to get through all the hair bobbles I&amp;nbsp;nicked from Selfridges at that age. Besides which, Peaches and her husband had a baby shortly after I&amp;nbsp;did and quite clearly love theirs more than I do mine. I&amp;nbsp;thought I&amp;nbsp;was gushy by uploading a new picture every day, but they upload one every 12 to 14 minutes. Instagram is breaking under the weight of Peaches' love&amp;nbsp;for her little&amp;nbsp;grub â€“ and, seeing as she's&amp;nbsp;up&amp;nbsp;the duff again, it will have to migrate&amp;nbsp;to new servers when&amp;nbsp;she&amp;nbsp;has the second. Don't even worry about all the exposure making those&amp;nbsp;kids a mess, because the statute of limitations on genetic&amp;nbsp;inheritance means that third-generation rock'n'roll kids are&amp;nbsp;100%&amp;nbsp;predetermined to become&amp;nbsp;accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/katewinslet" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Winslet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of people love Kate Winslet. She is a hugely accomplished actor who hasn't yet killed anyone that we&amp;nbsp;know of. And yet there are many who would rather donate their eyes to neuroscience than read another magazine profile stating that our Kate is just a normal gal who served bangers and mash at her first wedding, or that she doesn't knacker herself out down the gym, why, she's just happy with her curves! This, my friends, is one of the many reasons it is so brilliant that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/dec/28/kate-winslet-marries-ned-rocknroll" title=""&gt;she has now married for a&amp;nbsp;third time&lt;/a&gt;, and to someone who happens to be Richard Branson's nephew and works on his space travel programme and has legally changed his surname to&amp;nbsp;Rocknroll. The lives and loves of&amp;nbsp;Kate Winslet are becoming as epic as those of Elizabeth Taylor, making her a real vintage Hollywood dame. I&amp;nbsp;mean, you're either hosting a meat and potato party or you're an Oscar winner whose soulmate goes to work on a spaceship. You can't be both. Kate is now fully lost to us, the&amp;nbsp;people â€“ and I for one am in awe&amp;nbsp;of her marriage to that intergalactic adventurer. She has saved us from having to hear about the cumberlands and the maris pipers ever, ever again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/celebrity"&gt;Celebrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/merylstreep"&gt;Meryl Streep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jennifer-lawrence"&gt;Jennifer Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/michelleobama"&gt;Michelle Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/adele"&gt;Adele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/anne-hathaway"&gt;Anne Hathaway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/keiraknightley"&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/taylor-swift"&gt;Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/katewinslet"&gt;Kate Winslet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/peaches-geldof"&gt;Peaches Geldof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sophieheawood"&gt;Sophie Heawood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Downing Street intervened to reassure households; the prime minister's spokesman expressed confidence supplies were not running out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally Britain can store up to 15 days' gas supply, but that has run down to a few days amid freezing weather. While that is not an immediate problem because Britain is constantly importing gas and is also producing some gas from the North Sea, fears of a fuel crunch were heightened on Friday morning when a pump failure caused the temporary shutdown of the UK-Belgium pipeline. The gas was flowing again by noon but not before the British wholesale gas price soared by more than 50% to 150p a therm, with the price stabilising to about 100p when the pipeline reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the looming storage crisis and the pipeline incident raised fears that Britain was becoming over-reliant on a single source of fuel for heating and electricity. It came on the heels of warnings this week by the chief of one of the big six energy suppliers that there could be blackouts within three years unless there is drastic government action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cameron's spokesman said the prime minister was "absolutely confident" that gas supplies were sufficient. "The gas market is how we source our supplies and that market continues to function well. The prime minister's key concern is that gas supplies continue. It is absolutely clear that supplies are not running out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the terminal where the pipeline failure occurred acknowledged the seriousness of the technical glitch. Sean Waring, managing director of &lt;a href="http://www.interconnector.com/" title=""&gt;Interconnector Ltd&lt;/a&gt;, said: "We understand the seriousness of a disruption like this in the current tight energy markets. To date, Interconnector has demonstrated a high level of reliability, but operational upsets do occur from time to time in a complex process plant. Our immediate response enabled us to restore flow to full capacity quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident demonstrated how dependent Britain is on imports of gas, now that North Sea reserves are depleting, and expensive supplies must be piped in from sources such as &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-08/u-k-s-record-norway-gas-need-spells-price-jumps-energy-markets.html" title=""&gt;Norway and Russia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raised questions over the government's strategy of hugely increasing the share of electricity generation that comes from gas. Chancellor George Osborne has championed a new "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/05/gas-strategy-unveiled-george-osborne" title=""&gt;dash for gas&lt;/a&gt;" that could see the fuel account for more than two-thirds of Britain's supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said: "This is a glimpse of a miserable and worrying UK energy future and shows the folly of depending on gas for so much of our electricity generation. Increases in the wholesale gas price are the main reason that our energy bills have rocketed in recent years and this latest concern shows Osborne's judgment in backing gas to provide the bulk of our power for the next generation is seriously flawed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas market ructions came as &lt;a href="http://www.res-group.com/" title=""&gt;RES&lt;/a&gt;, a wind generation company, forecast that about 15% of electricity this weekend would be supplied from wind, compared with about 10% from renewables on average last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Handley, chief economist at RES, told the Guardian: "With gas supplies continuing to dwindle and expensive imports spluttering through pipelines, it will be the nation's wind that helps to bridge the gap."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK can normally store up to 15 days' gas supply, which many regard as an insufficient margin. In recent weeks, the unseasonable March freeze has caused storage to run down dramatically, to as little as a few days if more gas was not piped in from abroad or diverted from the North Sea. Any problems with the technology and pipelines used for the imports are thus magnified, as was dramatically demonstrated when traders pushed the price of gas to record levels on news of the Interconnector failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gas spike also bolstered proponents of fracking, the controversial method of blasting apart dense rocks at high pressure to retrieve natural gas. Fracking has suffered several setbacks in the UK: operations at the only company that has yet fracked for gas, Cuadrilla, are currently stalled, and the government admits it could be more than a decade before fracking produces much gas supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ken Cronin, of the UK Onshore Operators group, said: "Consumers, whether they are industrial companies or home owners, have to have the assurance that constant light, heat and reserves of energy are available . Onshore oil and gas will contribute to a more secure and competitively priced energy supply for the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green campaigners said more renewable energy was a better long term answer. Doug Parr Chief Scientist at Greenpeace said: "As shortages drive up prices for consumers, George Osborne must be the only man in Britain who thinks the answer is a gamble on gas power. Fracking won't lower prices and significant production is more than a decade away. North Sea gas production may be falling, but offshore wind is already helping to fill the gap. The government must act to stabilise bills, secure supplies and create jobs by supporting clean, renewable technologies like offshore wind and a European super grid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/gas"&gt;Gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/commodities"&gt;Commodities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gas"&gt;Gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels"&gt;Fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/windpower"&gt;Wind power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy"&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/fiona-harvey"&gt;Fiona Harvey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephine-moulds"&gt;Josephine Moulds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ministers have also relaxed planning rules limiting construction on greenfield sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was further bad news for Osborne when a second credit ratings agency, Fitch, served notice that it was almost certain to strip the UK of its AAA credit rating. Last month, Moody's was the first agency to cut the country's rating after sluggish economic growth and increased near-term government borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lincolnshire constituency of the combative planning minister, Nick Boles, who once suggested building on 2%-3% of Britain's currently open land, represents one part of the emerging conflict between local and national politics. A plan to build 7,000 new homes in Grantham was agreed in 2010 but the first 50 to 70 will not be completed until spring 2014. The council has also missed the target Boles set for finding sites amid widespread public opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, Tory council leaders have complained to Boles about housing targets that are "out of scale" and fear defeat at the polls if they are forced to build against their electors' wishes. Conservative-controlled Stratford-on-Avon council will take the government to the high court in the summer over its decision to overrule the council's refusal of an 800-home development on fields close to the cottage of Shakespeare's wife, Anne Hathaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand the scale of development that our communities can absorb, and they don't," said Chris Saint, the Tory council leader. "If you put big estates into small communities you either create a soulless dormitory or sink estates of the kind that successive governments have struggled to disentangle. I do not want that to be my legacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ComRes, which polled more than 400 councillors nationwide, found that 83% believed their areas were already overdeveloped. Of Liberal Democrat councillors polled, 84% said their areas were overdeveloped or fine as they were. The figure for Labour was 59%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living in south-west England, West Midlands and Scotland appear most resistant to development, while Wales and the north-east are least opposed. And 90% of the suburban public surveyed were classed as nimbys, compared with 88% in the countryside and 83% in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey's sponsor, Development Intelligence â€“ which has lobbied for clients including the housebuilder Countryside Properties and the commercial developer Hammerson â€“ said the findings indicated "a complete disconnect as neither public nor councillors understand that development creates growth and jobs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Keable, its chief executive, said: "We support the government's pro-development policy, but they have no idea how to implement it in a nimby nation. Negativity about development is driven by the haves, not the have-nots. Where there is deprivation and high unemployment people are more positively disposed than they are in the leafy, suburban south-east."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of households is expected to grow by an average of 232,000 a year in the next two decades, but just 146,420 homes were built in the last financial year. Boles has accused councils of dragging their feet in allocating sites and this week told developers he wanted to "flush out" areas that did not offer up enough land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined the Guardian's requests to comment but Bob Neill, former planning minister and now deputy chairman of the Conservative party, responded by attacking Development Intelligence as "shadowy development lobbyists" and said the survey was "a crude attempt â€¦ to smear local councillors who stand up for local residents". He added: "Conservatives control far more rural and shire councils than other parties, so it is no surprise that Conservative councillors value environmental safeguards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keable responded: "They have attacked the man, not the ball, because this is an inconvenient truth for the government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boles's own constituency, Grantham and Stamford, illustrates the conflict between national and local Tories. "It is not the answer to build our way out of recession," said Jacky Smith, 70, a member of the council's planning committee. "If we are not careful, we may end up building far too many homes and looking back in 10 years and thinking, why on earth did we do that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the town's young people are struggling to find a place to live. Aaron Foster, 20, a motorcycle shop worker, and his girlfriend, Beth McErlean, 19, an unemployed childminder, said they were considering moving away because of the lack of affordable homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A one- or two-bedroom flat or house would be around Â£120,000 and you won't find anywhere like that in a reasonable area," said Foster. "Leasing feels like throwing money away, but to buy there is no real help to get a deposit down. It sounds funny, but people are having children just to get a house [through the social housing system]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This nimbyism is causing a breakdown," said Karl Hicks, managing director of Larkfkleet Homes, the developer that proposed the homes at the village of Manthorpe in Boles's constituency. "If you have a council member living in the immediate area where you have a scheme, you rarely get your scheme through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Communities and Local Government said: "The government is committed to removing top-down targets that built nothing but resentment. Local plans agreed by communities and councils are now at the heart of determining where homes should go. Nearly nine in 10 planning applications are approved, a 10-year high, and seven out of 10 local councils now have published local plans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/construction"&gt;Construction industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/rating-agencies"&gt;Rating agencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/planning"&gt;Planning policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

At the time of the UK financial meltdown he was parachuted into Northern Rock after it was nationalised. He was also a player in the 2008 bailouts of Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. He is understood to have assembled a team of experts in banking and crisis management from across government departments to help solve the problems facing the two biggest banks, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK team arrived amid continued uncertainty about how the country can raise the â‚¬17bn (Â£14.5bn) it needs by Monday to prevent a collapse into bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sombre statement on Cyprus television , government spokesman Christos Stylianides spelt out the gravity of the situation: "The president of the republic and the government are negotiating hard â€¦ to find solutions that would save the banking system and the wider economy and restore calm in the country. In these critical hours, everyone is obligated to show the highest responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parliament will be called up to make great decisions, difficult decisions â€¦ but the country must be saved. The political leadership is obligated, despite political differences, to find a solution. The next few hours will determine the future of this country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking on Cyprus because the European Central Bank has given the country until Monday to shore up its banks before it pulls a key funding lifeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nation's banks will have been shut for 10 days, assuming they are able to reopen on Tuesday. They closed last weekend when Nicosia announced it had accepted a bailout which included skimming â‚¬5.8bn from savings accounts. That was rejected by parliament. On Friday night, Cypriot politicians were promising a deal which would require deposits on accounts bigger than â‚¬100,000 to pay a tax of more than 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills have also been placed before the Cypriot parliament to break up Laiki and allow the country Cyprus to take emergency steps to stop money flowing out of the country once the banks reopen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

An adviser manager in the jobcentre had written: "As you can see Walthamstow are 95th in the league table out of only 109 [jobcentres in London and the Home Counties]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jobcentre staff have since contacted the Guardian to say that it is widespread practice for managers to set targets for removing benefits, sometimes under the guise of benchmarks or expectations for the number of sanctions levied. A separate investigation suggests there is evidence from jobcentres around the UK that pressure is being applied on staff to remove more people's benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also reported that staff in a jobcentre in the West Midlands were this week told that the team who submitted the most Stricter Benefit Regime "Refusal of Employment" referrals would be rewarded with Easter eggs. The staff were told there was drive on this particular type of sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jobcentre source said: "This is an abhorrent trivialisation of the impact of such sanctions on the most vulnerable people in our community. We are not selling time share or insurance policies, these are people's livelihood being rewarded by confection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, was confronted over the initial revelations in the Commons on Friday. He said: "I can absolutely commit to the fact that there are no targets for any sanctions whatsoever. To emphasise that, I should point out that the head of Jobcentre Plus has issued a reminder to everybody in the estate that there are no targets and that there will be no targets, and that anybody using those targets will be disciplined."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressed again, he said: "Anybody caught imposing a target will be dealt with. That is absolutely clear. That message has already gone out. It went out before on innumerable occasions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same debate Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, urged jobcentre workers to come forward to describe the situation in their offices. She said: "The email is not the work of one over-enthusiastic member of staff. When it mentions league tables and the role of divisional managers, it is clear that this is not happening by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I trusted ministers when, on Tuesday, they claimed that there are no targets whatsoever. I now see that means that they are either simply admitting that they do not know what goes on in their own department, or that they were not giving us the full truth on Tuesday in this house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need an independent review to get to the bottom of this problem, and to understand just how out of control this toxic Work Programme is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the Department for Work and Pensions said it would set up an independent inquiry into the use of sanctions this week in return for Labour supporting emergency legislation deigned to clarify the right of the DWP to impose mandatory work activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency legislation is being passed to prevent the DWP having to repay nearly Â£130m in benefit claims following the court of appeal's "Poundland" ruling that people had unlawfully been made to work unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Duncan Smith on Friday, Byrne said scandals such as the one published in the Guardian were "exactly why we sought and secured independent review of the sanctions regime written in to the jobseekers' bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the light of these latest revelations, can I ask you to guarantee â€“ today â€“ that this independent review will get to the bottom of every sanction issued by a jobcentre where targets were in operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrne also asked why if the instruction banning targets had been sent out on innumerable occasions it was simply being ignored by managers â€“ and if the DWP would, in the light of Duncan Smith's comments, discipline managers imposing targets and also allow staff to speak up about the imposition of targets without fear of being disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers have given little detail of how long the inquiry will take or its composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The PD leader said he would start work immediately but added: "I will take the time that is needed. It is a difficult situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The task ahead is tough and it remains unclear how Bersani, a former communist with a track record of reform, will find the backing he needs. If he cannot, Napolitano may feel a caretaker government led by a high-profile figure is the only solution. In that scenario, fresh elections would almost certainly be held later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the shock results of 25 February, Bersani has repeatedly attempted to win support from outside the PD for a limited agenda of reform, focusing on issues such as corruption, electoral reform and jobs. However, the 61-year-old has failed to appeal to political forces outside the PD, and has also had to face discontent from within his own party, which is furious that a double-digit lead in the polls was almost erased after a lacklustre campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many suspect that with the young mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, at the helm, the PD would have attracted those voters who ended up casting their ballots for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). The PD-led centre-left coalition has an outright majority in the lower house of parliament, or chamber, but only leads a centre-right bloc headed by Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom People (PdL) party by a handful of seats in the senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the M5S, founded by the former comedian Beppe Grillo, which holds the balance of power â€“ but Grillo has ruled out backing a Bersani-led administration in the vote needed to form a government. Bersani, for his part, has ruled out forming a grand coalition with the centre-right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paralysis in the eurozone's third-largest economy continues to unnerve foreign observers. Earlier this week the Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, said there was a "significant risk to the world economy" from prolonged political uncertainty in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/beppe-grillo"&gt;Beppe Grillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi"&gt;Silvio Berlusconi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizzydavies"&gt;Lizzy Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now 84, he reflects on his life's work, on current events in Syria and Israel, and on the love of his life â€“ his wife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may have been pouring with rain, water overrunning the gutters and spreading fast and deep across London's Euston Road, but this did not stop a queue forming, and growing until it snaked almost all the way back to Euston station. Inside Friends House, a Quaker-run meeting hall, the excitement was palpable. People searched for friends and seats with thinly disguised anxiety; all watched the stage until, about 15 minutes late, a short, slightly top-heavy old man climbed carefully on to the stage and sat down. The hall filled with cheers and clapping, with whoops and with whistles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noam Chomsky, said two speakers (one of them Mariam Said, whose late husband, Edward, this lecture honours) "needs no introduction". A tired turn of phrase, but they had a point: in a bookshop down the road the politics section is divided into biography, reference, the Clintons, Obama, Thatcher, Marx, and Noam Chomsky. He&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/prospect-100-intellectuals/" title=""&gt;topped the first Foreign Policy/Prospect Magazine list&lt;/a&gt; of global thinkers in 2005 (the most recent, however, perhaps reflecting a new editorship and a new rubric, lists him not at all). One study of the most frequently cited academic sources of all time found that he ranked eighth, just below Plato and Freud. The list included the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he starts speaking, it is in a monotone that makes no particular rhetorical claim on the audience's attention; in fact, it's almost soporific. Last October, he tells his audience, he visited Gaza for the first time. Within five minutes many of the hallmarks of&amp;nbsp;Chomsky's political writing, and speaking, are displayed: his anger, his extraordinary range of reference and experience â€“ journalism from inside Gaza, personal testimony, detailed knowledge of the old Egyptian government, its secret service, the new Egyptian government, the historical context of the Israeli occupation, recent news reports (of sewage used by&amp;nbsp;the Egyptians to flood tunnels out of&amp;nbsp;Gaza, and by Israelis to spray non-violent protesters). Fact upon fact upon fact, but also a withering, sweeping sarcasm â€“ the atrocities are "tolerated politely by Europe as usual". Harsh, vivid phrases â€“ the "hideously charred corpses of murdered infants"; bodies "writhing in agony" â€“ unspool until they become almost a form of punctuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could argue that the latter is necessary, simply a description of atrocities that must be reported, but it is&amp;nbsp;also a method that has diminishing returns. The facts speak for themselves; the adjectives and the sarcasm have the counterintuitive effect of cheapening them, of imposing on the world a disappointingly crude and simplistic argument. "The sentences," wrote Larissa MacFarquhar in a brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/03/31/030331fa_fact_macfarquhar" title=""&gt;New Yorker profile of Chomsky&lt;/a&gt; 10 years ago, "are accusations of guilt, but not from a position of innocence or hope for something better: Chomsky's sarcasm is the scowl of a fallen world, the sneer of hell's veteran to its appalled naifs" â€“ and thus, in an odd way, static and ungenerative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, he has â€“ as he points out the next day, sitting under the gorgeous, vaulting ceilings of the VIP section of the St Pancras Renaissance hotel â€“ not always been preaching to the converted, or even to the sceptically open-minded. "This [rapturous reception] is radically different from what it was like even five years ago, when in fact [at talks about Israel-Palestine] I&amp;nbsp;had to have police protection because the audience was so&amp;nbsp;hostile." His voice is vanishingly quiet as well as monotonal, and he is slightly deaf, which makes conversation something of a challenge. But he answers questions warmly, and&amp;nbsp;seriously, if not always directly â€“ a&amp;nbsp;surprise, in a way, from someone who has earned a reputation for brutality of&amp;nbsp;argument, and a need to win at all costs. "There really is an alpha-male dominance psychology at work there," a&amp;nbsp;colleague once said of him. "He has some of the primate dominance moves. The staring down. The withering tone of&amp;nbsp;voice." Students have been known to visit him in pairs, so that one can defend the other. But it is perhaps less surprising when you discover that he&amp;nbsp;can spend up&amp;nbsp;to seven hours a day answering emails from fans and the questing public. And in the vast hotel lobby he cuts a slightly fragile figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chomsky, the son of Hebrew teachers who emigrated from Ukraine and Russia at the turn of the last century, began as a&amp;nbsp;Zionist â€“ but the sort of Zionist who wanted a socialist state in which Jews and Arabs worked together as equals. Since then he has been accused of antisemitism (due to defending the right to free speech of a French professor who espoused such views, some 35&amp;nbsp;years ago), and been called, by the Nation, "America's most prominent self-hating Jew". These days he argues tirelessly for&amp;nbsp;the rights of Palestinians. &lt;a href="http://www.mosaicrooms.org/recorded-lectures/" title=""&gt;In this week's lecture&lt;/a&gt; he quoted various reactions to the Oslo accords, which turn 20 in September, including a description of them as "an infernal trap". He replied to a question about whether Israel would still exist in 50 years' time by saying, among other things, that "Israel is following policies which maximise its security threats â€¦ policies which choose expansion over security â€¦ policies which lead to their moral degradation, their isolation, their deligitimation, as they call it now, and very likely ultimate destruction. That's not impossible." Obama arrived in Israel this week accompanied by some of the lowest expectations ever ascribed to a US president visiting the country. There was so much more hope, I suggest to Chomsky, when Obama was first elected, and he spoke about the Middle East. "There were illusions. He came into office with dramatic rhetoric about hope and change, but there was never any substance behind them," he responds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He seems cautiously optimistic about the Arab spring, which he sees as a "classic example â€¦ [of] powerful grassroots movements, primarily in Tunisia and Egypt" â€“ but is dryly ironic about the west's relationship with what is happening on the ground. "In&amp;nbsp;Egypt, on the eve of Tahrir Square, there was a major poll which found that overwhelmingly â€“ 80-90%, numbers like&amp;nbsp;that â€“ Egyptians regarded the main threats they face as the US and Israel. They don't like Iran â€“ Arabs generally don't like Iran â€“ but they&amp;nbsp;didn't consider it a threat. In fact, back then a considerable number of Egyptians thought the region might be better off if Iran had nuclear weapons. Not because they wanted Iran to have nuclear weapons, but to offset the real threats they faced. So that's obviously not the kind of policy that the west wants to listen to. Other polls are somewhat different, but the basic story is about the same â€“ what Egyptians want is&amp;nbsp;not what the west would like to see.&amp;nbsp;So therefore they are&amp;nbsp;opposed to&amp;nbsp;democracy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does Chomsky, who has infuriated some with his dismissal of the "&lt;a href="http://www.chomsky.info/books/humanism01.htm" title=""&gt;new military humanism&lt;/a&gt;", think should be done in Syria, if anything? Should the&amp;nbsp;west arm the opposition? Should it intervene? "I tend to think that providing arms is going to escalate the conflict. I think there has to be some kind of negotiated settlement. The question is which kind. But it's going to have to be primarily among Syrians. Outsiders can try to help set up the conditions, and there's no doubt that the government is&amp;nbsp;carrying out plenty of atrocities, and the opposition some, but not as many. There's a threat that the country is on a&amp;nbsp;suicidal course. Nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chomsky first came to prominence in 1959, with the argument, detailed in a book review (but already present in his first book, published two years earlier), that contrary to the prevailing idea that children learned language by&amp;nbsp;copying and by reinforcement (ie behaviourism), basic grammatical arrangements were already present at birth. The argument revolutionised the study of linguistics; it had fundamental ramifications for anyone studying the mind. It also has interesting, even &lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;troubling ramifications for his politics. If&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;are born with innate structures of&amp;nbsp;linguistic and by extension moral thought, isn't this a kind of determinism that denies political agency? What is the point of&amp;nbsp;arguing for any change at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most libertarian positions accept the same view," he answers. "That there are instincts, basic conditions of human nature that lead to a preferred social order. In fact, if you're in favour of any policy â€“ reform, revolution, stability, regression, whatever â€“ if you're at least minimally moral, it's because you think it's somehow good for people. And good for people means conforming to their fundamental nature. So whoever you are, whatever your position is, you're making some tacit assumptions about fundamental human nature â€¦ The question is: what do we strive for in developing a social order that is conducive to fundamental human needs? Are human beings born to be servants to masters, or are they born to be free, creative individuals who work with others to inquire, create, develop their own lives? I mean, if humans were totally unstructured creatures, they would be â€¦ a tool which can properly be shaped by outside forces. That's why if you look at the history of what's called radical behaviourism, [where] you can be completely shaped by outside forces â€“ when [the advocates of this] spell out what they think society ought to be, it's&amp;nbsp;totalitarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chomsky, now 84, has been politically engaged all his life; his first published article, in fact, was against fascism, and written when he was 10. Where does the&amp;nbsp;anger come from? "I grew up in the Depression. My parents had jobs, but a&amp;nbsp;lot of the family were unemployed working class, so they had no jobs at all. So I saw poverty and repression right away. People would come to the door trying to sell rags â€“ that was when I was four years old. I remember riding with my mother in a trolley car and passing a textile worker's strike where the women were striking outside and the police were beating them bloody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He met Carol, who would become his wife, at about the same time, when he was five years old. They married when she was 19 and he 21, and were together until she died nearly 60 years later, in 2008. He talks about her constantly, given the chance: how she was so strict about his schedule when they travelled (she often accompanied him on lecture tours) that in Latin America they called&amp;nbsp;her El Comandante; the various bureaucratic scrapes they got into, all&amp;nbsp;over the world. By all accounts, she&amp;nbsp;also enforced balance in his life: made sure he watched an hour of TV a&amp;nbsp;night, went to movies and concerts, encouraged his love of sailing (at one&amp;nbsp;point, he owned a small fleet of&amp;nbsp;sailboats, plus a motorboat); she water-skied until she was 75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she was also politically involved: she took her daughters (they had three children: two girls and a boy) to demonstrations; he tells me a story about how, when they were protesting against the Vietnam war, they were once both arrested on the same day. "And you get one phone call. So my wife called our older daughter, who was at that time 12, I guess, and told her, 'We're not going to&amp;nbsp;come home tonight, can you take care of the two kids?' That's life." At another point, when it looked like he would be jailed for a long time, she went back to school to study for a PhD, so that she could support the children alone. It makes no sense, he told an interviewer a&amp;nbsp;couple of years ago, for a woman to die before her husband, "because women manage so much better, they talk and support each other. My oldest and closest friend is in the office next door to me; we haven't once talked about Carol." His eldest daughter often helps him now. "There's a transition point, in some way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he think that in all these years of talking and arguing and writing, he has ever changed one specific thing? "I don't think any individual changes anything alone. Martin Luther King was an important figure but he couldn't have said: 'This is what I changed.' He came to prominence on a groundswell that was created by mostly young people acting on the ground. In the early years of the antiwar movement we were all doing organising and writing and speaking and gradually certain people could do certain things more easily and effectively, so I pretty much dropped out of organising â€“ I thought the teaching and writing was more effective. Others, friends of mine, did the opposite. But they're not less influential. Just not known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the cavernous Friends' House, the last words of his speech are: "Unless&amp;nbsp;the powerful are capable of learning to respect the dignity of their victims â€¦ impassable barriers will remain, and the world will be doomed to violence, cruelty and bitter suffering." It's a gloomy coda, but he leaves to&amp;nbsp;a standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/noam-chomsky"&gt;Noam Chomsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middle-east-peace-talks"&gt;Middle East peace talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeasttimeline"&gt;Middle East timeline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/aidaedemariam"&gt;Aida Edemariam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In the last three months of 2012 the economy shrank 0.3%. A second straight quarter of negative growth could undermine faltering business confidence and choke off the first signs of a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures from the Office for National Statistics are expected to show the UK narrowly avoided a third contraction since the banking crash of 2008, but recent surveys have shown key industries, including manufacturing and construction, slipping back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several analysts said even without a triple-dip recession the worsening economic situation made further credit downgrades inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In documents that accompanied the budget, the OBR said that a lack of growth and lower than expected tax receipts had worsened the economic outlook and delayed the recovery until after the next election. It halved the forecast for growth this year to 0.6% and said the debt-to-GDP ratio would peak at 85%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Fitch said a tougher measure of the UK's debt burden showed the debt pile would exceed 100% of annual national income before it begins to fall, which makes situation more perilous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it credited the UK with having a "high-income, diversified and flexible economy", it said the last four years of low growth had damaged the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said: "The persistently weak performance of UK growth, in part due to European growth, has increased uncertainty around the UK's potential output and longer-term trend rate of growth with significant implications for public finances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month Moody's stunned the chancellor when it became the first agency to kick Britain out of the exclusive AAA club, which still includes Germany, Canada and Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has argued that the downgrade shows the UK needs to cut public expenditure to get on top of its debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour responded that the downgrades were the result of an austerity-first policy that failed to generate growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Leslie, the shadow Treasury minister, said: "This is yet another blow to a downgraded chancellor who made keeping the confidence of the credit rating agencies the No 1 test of his economic policy. What really matters are the economic realities which Fitch are responding to including, as their statement says, 'the persistently weak performance of UK growth'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"George Osborne's plan has catastrophically failed on growth, living standards and the deficit. But instead of a change of direction and action to kickstart the flatlining economy all we got this week was more of the same failing policies." He said the budget would "be remembered as a wasted chance to change course before it was too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/rating-agencies"&gt;Rating agencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession"&gt;Recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phillipinman"&gt;Phillip Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Led by reformist president Thein Sein, who has carried out a series of economic and political reforms â€“ among them the lifting of censorship regulations and the release of many political prisoners â€“ but the country has also witnessed a growing tension between majority Buddhists and minority Muslims, who comprise 5% of the 60m population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact numbers of those killed and injured are hard to establish. Win Htein, of the opposition National League for Democracy party, said 20&amp;nbsp;people â€“ including the monk â€“ are confirmed dead. But Ko Wanna Shwe of the Rangoon-based Islamic Religious Affairs Council told the Guardian that figure was likely to be much higher: "We are getting reports from people in Meikhtila since Wednesday that [the number] is higher. Nearly 100 people have been killed â€“ teachers, students, shopkeepers," he said by phone. "Even young men aged eight to 14 included."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camps have been established to accommodate 2,000 people who have fled, Win Htein told Reuters, but it is not clear if they are protected by security forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many fear the situation is a reprise of last year's violence in Rakhine state, western Burma, where hundreds were killed and 120,000 left homeless after two serious bouts of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/12/burma-ethnic-violence-escalates" title=""&gt;violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in June&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/27/burma-wave-anti-muslim-violence" title=""&gt;October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stateless minority, the Rohingya are not recognised as Burmese citizens and many of them either live in segregated camps for internally displaced people or have &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/20/burma-rohingya-muslim-refugee-camps" title=""&gt;fled by their thousands to neighbouring countries, often in makeshift boats&lt;/a&gt;. Rumours of a "third massacre" against the Rohingya have been circulating for months, with photos of alleged leaflets inciting violence posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rights groups on Friday described the situation in Meikhtila as a warning sign that Burma still has a long way to go to establish peace and reconciliation in a country that proscribed dissent for nearly half a century, and called for the government to put an end to the violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key issue is this: the government has frankly failed to stare down the people who are inciting hatred, the people who are engaging in this communal violence â€¦ and that failure has set an example that impunity to attack Muslims is alive and well in Burma," said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. "There's a major army base in that town. If people are engaging in rioting and attacks, then they could be stopped. So why does violence continue on now for two days or so? There's either a complete lack of capacity or a failure of political will because Buddhist monks are involved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burmese monks have often been involved in sectarian violence, with anti-Muslim protests in Mandalay led by the saffron-robed religious leaders last year. Meikhtila is no different. One monk, who wielded a foot-long sword, threatened an Associated Press journalist and demanded his camera, while other monks attempted to drag a group of reporters out of a van. "We don't feel safe and we have now moved inside a monastery," one Meikhtila resident told the AP. "The situation is unpredictable and dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the UN and Burma's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, called for order to be restored; the town was still burning on Friday evening. Suu Kyi has come under severe fire for her handling of the Rakhine situation last year, which some activists termed a genocide against the Rohingya, and earlier this month she backed a controversial copper mine in Letpadaung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear exactly why this latest bout of ethnic violence escalated so quickly. Win Htein,&amp;nbsp;the lawmaker for the NLD, told&amp;nbsp;Radio Free Asia that he believed that some Muslims in Meikhtila â€“ who comprise one-third of the population of 100,000 â€“ may have been harbouring "some feelings over the Rakhine problem", thereby fomenting unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may just be one example of violence in a nation that could see many others take place in relatively quick succession, said Mark Farmaner of human rights group Burma Campaign UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen examples of anti-Muslim propaganda in Mon state, Shan state, Kachin state and Karen state, where people are distributing anti-Muslim leaflets," he told the Guardian. "It may not be directly linked to violence in Rakhine state in an obvious way but â€¦ aan incident like this [an argument in a gold shop] wouldn't normally lead to deaths and thousands of people trying to flee, if there weren't already incredibly high tensions in the first place. That means it's been organised and that no action has been taken to put a lid on it." President Tun Khin of the UK-based Burmese Rohingya Organisation described the violence in Meikhtila as a state-sponsored attack, and said: "These are not communal clashes; this is not equal sides fighting. These are organised attacks to cleanse [Burma] of Muslims where the vast majority of those killed and displaced are Muslims â€¦ There should be laws on racism if the government wants to see durable peace in Burma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/burma"&gt;Burma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/buddhism"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kate-hodal"&gt;Kate Hodal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The move is designed to free staff to spend more time caring for patients in the wake of the scandal at Mid Staffordshire hospital trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, is scrapping the need for hospitals to collate 76 â€“ one in four â€“ of the 305 different types of data they have to send to the Department of Health, health regulators and other bodies, as part of a reduction to the service's bureaucratic burdens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will announce the move next Tuesday when he outlines to parliament the government's response to Robert Francis QC's report last month into the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust care scandal, in which multiple failures were found to have led to between 400 and 1,200 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt told the Guardian he has ordered the crackdown on NHS bureaucracy after hearing complaints from frustrated clinical and managerial staff that they have to spend up to three hours a day, every day, collecting and recording different sorts of information, and that some data required by regulatory bodies was irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals will no longer have to gather details of the number of their staff who have been involved in conflict resolution training, or data on the number of fire incidents and false alarms, for example. Hunt is also lifting the requirement, brought in as a result of the bird flu outbreak in 2005, for hospitals to be able to tell the DH how many poultry workers have had the influenza vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt sees the move as a way of refocusing the NHS away from what Francis's highly critical report called "the business of the system" and towards the task of providing better patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduction in data duties will save an estimated 26,000 days of NHS staff time and free up Â£9.2m for other purposes, Hunt believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creating a culture of care, not bureaucracy, in the NHS is essential," Hunt said. "Good information about how well services are doing is also essential, but needless paperwork is not. Over the years, the bureaucratic burden on the NHS has grown to gargantuan proportions. Doctors and nurses went into their professions to help patients, not number-crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have heard myself how doctors, nurses and managers find dealing with paperwork a big and frustrating part of their jobs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is acting to streamline data collection after early findings from a review of health service bureaucracy, which he ordered after the Francis report. This confirmed the irritation staff feel about having to record so much information to satisfy requests and regulator requirements from between 60 and 70 separate bodies, especially from his own department and regulators such as Monitor and the Care Quality Commission. That review, which will report in full in the autumn, is being undertaken by the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NHS has tolerated far more information being demanded than necessarily serves its purposes," said Mike Farrar, the confederation's chief executive, who is leading the work. "This generates frustration among staff, and even the regulatory and supervisory bodies, who have considerable data, struggle to use it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just recently, I received over 500 replies from NHS clinicians, managers, board members and others about busting bureaucracy. Over four in 10 told me they spend between one and three hours of their working day personally collecting and recording information," Farrar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, three-quarters of those who contacted him said that some information collected for regulators was irrelevant, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Farrar also warned that the government's imminent shake-up of the NHS in England is in danger of making bureaucracy even more cumbersome, as newly created organisations can start demanding information, too. "With a raft of new organisations due to come into force on 1 April, we risk increasing the bureaucratic and regulatory burden even further. We need a smarter system of information use, not a bigger one," he said. These new organisations could include GP-led clinical commissioning groups and local councils' health and wellbeing boards. Different departments of hospitals often do not share information with each other, which can further increase the time needed to respond when they receive a request for data, the confederation's review has found. Hospitals' workload is also increased by different organisations seeking similar, but slightly different, data, which forces them to put together a new data package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt will also announce that he is giving the NHS's Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) a new role as a gateway to information collected by the service, in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting it. Any body that wants to ask NHS organisations for a new sort of data will first have to persuade the HSCIC that such information is "patient-proof" â€“ that is, that the benefits outweigh the work involved in putting it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust"&gt;Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deniscampbell"&gt;Denis Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The BBC said farewell to its famous Television Centre studios in west London on Friday with a gig by evergreen "nutty boys" turned national treasures Madness, bringing the curtain down on 53 years of broadcasting history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since opening its doors in 1960, TV Centre has been home to shows including Doctor Who, Top of the Pops, Morecambe and Wise, I Claudius, Fawlty Towers and, more recently, BBC1's Saturday night hit Strictly Come Dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jul/16/bbc-sells-television-centre?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;Sold for Â£200m to property developer Stanhope&lt;/a&gt;, the 14-acre former "fun factory", complete with its famous doughnut-shaped inner ring, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/feb/05/bbc-television-centre?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;is being turned into apartments, a hotel, a cinema, restaurants, cafes and a health club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC stars past and present have expressed their sadness at the sale of the grade II listed building, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/19/television-centre-sale-draws-fire-bbc-stars?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;with chatshow legend Michael Parkinson comparing the venue to the Royal Opera House or National Theatre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC will be back at TV Centre in 2015, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jul/20/bbc-television?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;but will only occupy about 20% of the redeveloped site with a "creative hub"&lt;/a&gt;, including leasing three of the biggest TV studios, which will be revamped, while its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, will return to the space previously occupied by BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'No longer fit for purpose'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC's creative director, Alan Yentob, said on Friday that TV Centre was a place whose time had come and gone at a point when the corporation faced a greater financial burden, including taking on the funding of the BBC World Service and S4C from the licence fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people are critical about the BBC leaving here but the truth is the building was no longer fit for purpose. There wasn't really an option," Yentob told MediaGuardian. "I am determined there will be some sort of BBC experience here, and there will be programme makers as well. The BBC is not being disrespectful of TV Centre. There will be more than a blue plaque."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site is now all but deserted, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/mar/15/bbc-newsroom-etiquette-broadcasting-house?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;with BBC News relocated to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House in central London last weekend&lt;/a&gt;, and all of its children's and sports programming, including Match of the Day, moved to the new BBC North HQ in Salford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strictly Come Dancing will move to Elstree and BBC2's Later with Jools Holland to Maidstone in Kent. Other comedy and entertainment shows will move to studios in London and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last programme to be made on the site will be a comedy panel show pilot on 29 March, with the final event to go through the studio's galleries, the voiceover for the new pope's Urbi et Orbi address, two days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed by architect Graham Dawbarn â€“ who was inspired by a question mark he drew on the back of an envelope â€“ Television Centre was the site of a bomb attack by the Real IRA in 2001 and was where the Blue Peter Garden was vandalised in 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less famously, actor (and mountaineer) Brian Blessed once climbed the monument at the centre of TV Centre's inner ring, putting a condom on its statue of Helios, the personification of the sun in Greek mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, a sign in reception politely asks visitors not to remove souvenirs â€“ Helios would be a tough ask â€“ but many of the fixtures and fittings have already been stripped by BBC staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One production assistant at a recording of BBC4's tribute programme, Goodbye Television Centre, on Monday, was bemused as to why visitors kept asking for directions to the toilets, only to discover that the sign had been unscrewed and removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yentob said: "I can't get too angry about the souvenir thing. If there are people who spent a lot of time here and want to take a door knob, good luck to them. But not breaking into the office and taking things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am sad for the people who looked after the building, the tea ladies, for whom there won't be a place at Broadcasting House. People have spent a lifetime here and some of us are moving on but for others it is the last port of call. You do your own tea now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'A real lump in my throat'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmonds was among a number of BBC stars to take part in the BBC4 show. The presenter spent two decades fronting Saturday morning children's programmes and evening entertainment shows from TV Centre's studio one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now it's come to the end I feel like I did when I saw the final flight of Concorde," said the former host of Noel's House Party and the Late, Late Breakfast Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a real lump in my throat because it's a very special place," Edmonds added. "This is the beginning of a very different era for the BBC. It faces some very big challenges. This place is finished, it's over â€“ what is going to happen to the BBC in the future?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another familiar BBC face, Sir Terry Wogan, added: "I know it's only a building. I know it's an inanimate object and it doesn't have a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it has a spirit. There are spirits here, of immensely talented, brilliant people who made some of the best television programmes ever seen and I think it's a shame. It's a shame to close it down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beatlemania&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One member of the studio audience was retired cameraman Michael Borer, 70, who worked at TV Centre in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembered sneaking off from the filming of a drama in 1967 to watch the Beatles perform their double A side, Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields Forever, on Top of the Pops in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were rather bored during a break in this drama and the Beatles were in the studio next door. Of course no one was allowed in there with all the security, so we said let's go through the lighting gantry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We climbed in and saw them recording their number below. We ended up staying too long and when we got back everyone was asking where we had been."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "It was a new and exciting time and I have some very happy memories of TV Centre. It's very sad that it's been sold off but I can see now that it really is old-fashioned. Technology has moved on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;â€¢ To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
