Cable said the lower rise for the young was "recognising the higher unemployment rates amongst young people".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business secretary was speaking at the Institute of Directors, whose chief, Simon Walker, attacked the "greed" of those demanding rewards for failure and again attacked Barclays for paying out three times more in bonuses than dividends to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker also said it was "mad" that members of the boy band One Direction had earned £5m each last year but that it was up to shareholders to crack down on top executive pay. Cable said he agreed with much of what Walker had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable said it was important that both the apprentice rate and the youth rates kept pace with increases in benefits which are rising by 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative minister Matthew Hancock had last month talked about strengthening the minimum wage so that there was an incentive between being on benefits and earning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid a debate about freezing or even cutting the minimum wage, the TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: "Boosting the incomes of the low paid goes straight into the economy and wage-led growth must be part of the recovery, so we would have liked to have seen minimum wage rates go up further today, even if the government has rightly rejected calls for a freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable indicated he would "be more radical in taxing wealth" after the top rate of tax was cut to 45% from 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there would be a crackdown on "abuses of the minimum wage". He pointed to the cash economy of unrecorded wages, restauranteurs making assumptions about tips and other employers making deductions for uniforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A minimum wage for 16- and 17-year-olds was first introduced in 2004. In London there is a "living wage" campaign for £8.30 minimum per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Cable called for a debate about the living wage campaigns which could result in regional differences. He said the living wage campaigns needed to be "grounded in evidence rather than based on rhetoric and political point scoring".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Grady called for the government to spread the living wage to the public sector so "millions would benefit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/minimum-wage"&gt;Minimum wage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/pay"&gt;Pay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/apprenticeships"&gt;Apprenticeships&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/work-and-careers"&gt;Work &amp; careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/family-finances"&gt;Family finances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople"&gt;Young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So could high-intensity, short-burst exercise be worse for you than none at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Marr, the 53-year-old BBC TV presenter and journalist, made a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/14/andrew-marr-first-tv-appearance-stroke" title=""&gt;guest appearance on his own show&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, just four months after a life-threatening stroke, which he attributed to "heavily overworking" and an intensive session on a rowing machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he was on air, a 23-year-old man &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/apr/14/marathon-runner-dies-collapse-brighton" title=""&gt;collapsed and died at the 16th mile of the Brighton marathon&lt;/a&gt;. He is thought to have had a cardiac arrest, although it is too early to know the specifics. His death brings back memories of Claire Squires, 30, who collapsed and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/23/london-marathon-death-claire-squires" title=""&gt;died in the final stretch of the London marathon last year&lt;/a&gt;. The coroner later ruled that she died of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/jan/30/claire-squires-runner-dmaa-fatal" title=""&gt;cardiac failure caused by extreme exertion and complicated by DMAA toxicity&lt;/a&gt; from a nutritional supplement which has now been banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These incidents raise many questions about the dangers of extreme exertion: how much exercise is good for you? Do these tragic events only affect individuals who are predisposed to heart disease or stroke anyway? How can we tell if we are one of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marr said he had followed the advice to "take very intensive exercise in short bursts – and that's the way to health … I went on a rowing machine and gave it everything I had, and had a strange feeling afterwards – a blinding headache, and flashes of light – served out the family meal, went to bed, [then] woke up the next morning lying on the floor unable to move". Marr, who is making a good recovery, said his advice would be to be wary of rowing machines, or at least of being too enthusiastic on them. He didn't warn off working out too hard, but perhaps that's implied, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what of the current enthusiasm for short bursts of ultra-intensive exercise? A large-scale trial of 300 volunteers, led by &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-17177251" title=""&gt;Jamie Timmons, professor of systems biology at the University of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;, is underway to assess whether just three minutes of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/can-get-fit-five-minutes" title=""&gt;high-intensity interval training (HIT)&lt;/a&gt; a week yields the same benefits as hours pounding the streets or in the gym. Previous results have been encouraging, but the long-term safety of the technique has yet to be proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS offers much more cautious advice about exercise. It suggests at least &lt;a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/fitness/Pages/Whybeactive.aspx" title=""&gt;150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity activity&lt;/a&gt;, such as fast walking or cycling, and muscle-strengthening exercise, like weights, gardening or yoga, twice a week. &lt;a href="http://www.csp.org.uk/press-releases/2009/07/01/nearly-two-thirds-uk-adults-risk-their-health-through-insufficient-exercis" title=""&gt;But over 60% of men and 70% of women in the UK say they don't even follow the modest NHS guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. Every marathon death or Marr story is grist to the mill of the sedentary and idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although moderate exercise is undoubtedly better than no exercise, experts are beginning to warn that excessive, sustained and unsupervised exercise can cause problems. American cardiologists and keen runners James O'Keefe and Carl Lavie &lt;a href="http://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2012/11/21/heartjnl-2012-302886.extract" title=""&gt;writing in the journal Heart&lt;/a&gt; last year, recommended limiting workouts to &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2012/11/30/the-dangers-of-going-too-fast/" title=""&gt;30-50 minutes a day&lt;/a&gt;. Marathons or triathlons should only be done occasionally, they said, adding that intense exercise for more than an hour or two can stretch, tear and scar the heart and cause rhythm abnormalities. They cited research that tracked the heart health of 50,000 people over 30 years: the 14,000 runners in the study were likely to live longer than non-exercisers, but only if they ran between five and 20 miles a week, not more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question remains why some people can undertake extreme exercise and be fine, and others will suffer unexpected and sometimes fatal heart attacks and strokes. Anyone with a family history of sudden, unexplained deaths should seek expert medical advice before taking up extreme exercise. And if you experience chest pain when exercising, it pays to get that checked out. Unfortunately, there is no way of giving you a cast-iron guarantee that your heart will be fine. Professional footballers are subjected to detailed medical testing, but when Bolton Wanderers player Fabrice Muamba nearly died of a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/mar/25/muamba-collapse-minute-by-minute" title=""&gt;cardiac arrest while playing&lt;/a&gt;, none of the tests he'd undergone had hinted that he had a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall message is clear: some exercise is better than none, but moderate exercise is better than extreme exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fitness"&gt;Fitness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/running"&gt;Running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/rowing"&gt;Rowing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing"&gt;Health &amp; wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/heart-attack"&gt;Heart attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/andrewmarr"&gt;Andrew Marr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/annrobinson"&gt;Ann Robinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But Mid Staffs could be the first foundation trust – a supposed marker of excellence in the health service – to face the same fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust was at the centre of a public inquiry into the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffs-hospital-scandal-guide" title=""&gt;Stafford hospital scandal, &lt;/a&gt;where hundreds of patients may have died needlessly after they were routinely neglected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/06/mid-staffordshire-report-sweeing-changes" title=""&gt;Francis report highlighted &lt;/a&gt;the "appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people" between 2005 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only three weeks after the public inquiry report was published, Monitor said it was consulting with the health secretary and key organisations about the prospective appointment of trust special administrators. Monitor said that if administrators were appointed, they would devise a plan for the reorganisation and delivery of services. A spokesman added the plan would be subject to public consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent review into the trust, conducted on behalf of the regulator, concluded that the organisation was neither clinically nor financially sustainable in its current form. The same group of experts suggested that the hospitals run by the trust should be downgraded to make it sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trust should retain two smaller hospitals at Stafford hospital and Cannock Chase hospital, the contingency planning team (CPT) said. But "serious care" and a number of services, including specialist surgical patients, paediatric inpatients and maternity services, should be provided at neighbouring organisations including University hospital of North Staffordshire, the Royal Wolverhampton hospitals and Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five patients would be sent to other trusts if the proposals were put into action, and the smaller hospitals run by Mid Staffordshire would cater for four out of every five patients who currently use the trust, the CPT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finances at the trust, which is deemed to be one of the smallest in the country, have a bleak outlook. Last year, the Department of Health was forced to give the trust a £20m boost to maintain services for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CPT stressed that current services have a "clean bill of health" from the Care Quality Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, local campaigners have organised a demonstration in the town in a bid to retain the services at Stafford hospital. A trust spokeswoman said the hospitals would be running "business as usual" despite the protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mid-staffordshire-nhs-trust"&gt;Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/healthcare"&gt;Healthcare industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And while temperatures at this site increased gradually in phases over many hundreds of years, most of the intensification of melting has happened since the mid-20th century."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of ice melt on the Antarctic peninsula were especially sensitive to rising temperature during the last century, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What that means is that the Antarctic peninsula has warmed to a level where even small increases in temperature can now lead to a big increase in summer melt," Abram added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Robert Mulvaney, from the British Antarctic Survey, who led the ice core drilling expedition in 2008 and co-authored a paper on the findings published on Sunday in &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/index.html" title=""&gt;the journal Nature Geoscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "Having a record of previous melt intensity for the Peninsula is particularly important because of the glacier retreat and ice shelf loss we are now seeing in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Summer ice melt is a key process that is thought to have weakened ice shelves along the Antarctic peninsula leading to a succession of dramatic collapses, as well as speeding up glacier ice loss across the region over the last 50 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ice core record suggested a link between accelerated melting and man-made global warming. But a different and more complex picture has emerged from another region of Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate US study, published in the same journal, shows that thinning ice from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide cannot confidently be blamed on greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ice core record from this site indicates a strong influence from unusual conditions in the tropical Pacific during the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that decade, an El Niño event – a cyclical system of winds and ocean currents that can affect the world's weather – caused rapid thinning of glaciers in the west Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spike in temperature was little different from others that occurred in the 1830s and 1940s, which also saw prominent El Niño events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we could look back at this region of Antarctica in the 1940s and 1830s we would find that the regional climate would look a lot like it does today, and I think we also would find the glaciers retreating much as they are today," said lead author Prof Eric Steig, from the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the same was not true for the Antarctic peninsula, the part of the continent closer to South America. Here, more dramatic changes were "almost certainly" a result of human-induced global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/sea-ice"&gt;Sea ice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/poles"&gt;Polar regions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/antarctica"&gt;Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The vote will be a key test of security forces' ability to keep voters safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but co-ordinated attacks are a favourite tactic of al-Qaida's Iraq branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials believe the insurgent group is growing stronger and increasingly co-ordinating with allies fighting to topple the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, across the border. They say rising lawlessness on the Syria-Iraq frontier and cross-border co-operation with the Syrian militant group Nusra Front has improved the militants' supply of weapons and foreign fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the deadly attacks reported by police officials on Monday morning were bombings, which struck Baghdad, the western city of Fallujah, the contested northern city of Kirkuk and towns south of the capital. Another 100 people were wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows rattled from the force of a blast in central Baghdad when a bomb struck the central commercial district of Karrada. That blast and others in the capital, including one caused by a parked car bomb that went off at a bus station, killed 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kirkuk, an oil-rich city about 290km (180 miles) from Baghdad, police said nine people were killed when six car bombs exploded simultaneously. Three bombs detonated in the town centre – in Arab, Kurdish and Turkoman districts. The rest went off elsewhere in the city, which is home to a mix of ethnic groups with competing claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the bombings, a police officer was killed in a drive-by shooting while he was driving his car in Tarmiyah, 30 miles (50km) north of Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although violence in Iraq has fallen from its peak in 2006 and 2007, bombings and other attacks remain common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blasts came a day after a series of attacks left 10 people dead, including a Sunni candidate running in the upcoming provincial elections. The most serious attack on Sunday took place when a booby-trapped body that was left in the street exploded among a group of policemen who were trying to inspect the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqis vote on Saturday in what will be the country's first election since US troops withdrew in December 2011. The election, for local-level officials, will be a test of the strength of prime minister Nouri al-Maliki's political bloc as well as the ability of security forces to keep the country safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nouri-al-maliki"&gt;Nouri al-Maliki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But Sutherland suggested that other representatives from the university could now be at risk when travelling abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas denied that briefing of the students had been "shambolic", insisting they had been repeatedly spoken to individually and as a group. "We think the risks as we explained them to the students were justified," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I need to be absolutely clear that if we had any suggestion that lives were at risk or anything approaching that – either the BBC team's lives or the lives of the students – then we wouldn't have gone anywhere near this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how high up the BBC chain authorisation for the programme had gone, Thomas said: "This went right to the top."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressed on whether that meant the then-acting director general, Tim Davie, had signed off on the plans in advance, Thomas said: "I can't be sure that Tim Davie did. I know that Tony Hall [the current DG] has been involved in recent days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall, who has already had to defuse a row over the anti-Thatcher song Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead less than two weeks after taking over at the BBC, responded to a letter from Sutherland on Saturday. He is understood to have said the documentary would go ahead as there was a clear public interest in reporting on the escalating situation in North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall is also understood to have said that the BBC had considered the risks involved and made sure the students on the trip were able to make an informed decision about the potential danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign journalists cannot get visas to enter North Korea but overseas academics and students can. Sweeney spent eight days in the country in March with the LSE group on a trip ostensibly arranged by the Grimshaw Club – the student society of the university's international relations department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LSE said it first became aware of the true nature of his visit last Tuesday during a meeting with BBC staff. The university said North Korean authorities alleged that Sweeney had described himself on his visa application as an "LSE student, PhD in history" and gave as his address a room number that is used by a member of its academic staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students on the trip reported that their North Korean guides repeatedly referred to Sweeney as "professor" and he went along with this, according to the LSE. Sweeney graduated from the LSE in 1980 with a BSc in government and if he has a PhD it is not from there, according to the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LSE said students on the trip were not told before setting off that Sweeney and two other BBC journalists travelling with them would be using the visit to film an undercover documentary. The university identified the two other BBC journalists as Alexander Niakaris and Tomiko Sweeney, John Sweeney's wife, who was involved in organising the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advance of leaving London, before they had paid for the trip, the students were told on two occasions – individually and later as a group – that an undercover journalist would be accompanying them to North Korea and if this was discovered they could face arrest, detention and deportation, and would be unlikely to be able to return to the country, according to a senior BBC source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Beijing, they were told of Sweeney's identity and that two other BBC journalists were accompanying him, including a cameraman, the insider said. They were not told more for their own benefit in case the ruse was discovered, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC plans to pixelate faces or use other techniques to ensure none of the students can be identified in the Panorama documentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC and Sweeney's actions have divided opinion in the media. Mark Seddon, the New York bureau chief for al-Jazeera English and a former Tribune editor, criticised Sweeney, asking what protection he or the BBC could have given the LSE students if his true purpose had been uncovered. "The BBC's defence of the editorial decision behind this is woeful," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ray Snoddy, the former FT and Times media editor and ex-presenter of BBC News feedback show NewsWatch, tweeted: "Extraordinary to hear BBC executive say on Radio 4 that the North Korean Panorama undercover filming was worth putting lives at risk for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jason Wong, one of five student representatives on the LSE's court of governors, said he would be seeking a meeting of the university's governing body after the start of the summer term later this month to revoke Sweeney's alumni status. "He is as unwelcomed to be associated with the LSE as Saif al-Islam Gaddafi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/londonschoolofeconomics"&gt;London School of Economics and Political Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ethics"&gt;Ethics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jasondeans"&gt;Jason Deans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Seating at the event was segregated, with different entrances into the lecture theatre for men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It follows news that a London university, UCL, has &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/15/ucl-bans-islamic-group-over-segregation" title=""&gt;banned an Islamic organisation from campus&lt;/a&gt; after concluding that it attempted to impose segregation at a debate which also featured Tzortzis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Leicester, more than 100 students attended the segregated event, which took place last month. A photograph passed to the Guardian shows signs put up in a university building, directing the segregation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A message on the group's website says: "In all our events, [the society] operate a strict policy of segregated seating between males and females." The statement was removed after the Guardian contacted the society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Leicester said: "The University of Leicester does not permit enforced segregation at public events. The university will investigate whether entrances to the hall for this event were segregated by the society and will ensure there is no recurrence of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The University will not interfere with people's right to choose where to sit. If some people choose to sit in a segregated manner because of their religious convictions then they are free to do so. By the same token, if people attending do not wish to sit in a segregated manner, they are free to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "To our knowledge, no-one was forced to sit in any particular seat. If there is evidence of enforced segregation, that would be a matter the university and students' union would investigate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a Leicester student told the Guardian he believed segregation was common practice at the society's events to avoid offending those with strong religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: "Gender segregated seating contravenes the equal opportunities and anti-discrimination policies of universities and student unions. Students and staff should not be subjected to sexist segregationist policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Universities are supposed to be places of enlightenment, tolerance, liberalism and human rights. It is shocking the way some student Islamist societies are being allowed to force women to sit apart from men, sometimes with the connivance of the university authorities, who take a hands-off approach. Some universities are doing very little to ensure that the campus is a safe and equal place for all students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Flatt, an officer for Leicester Students' Union, said: "The Students' Union does not believe in enforced segregation. We trust in our societies' ability to conduct their events in accordance with the principles of the union."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rupert Sutton, from the campus watchdog Student Rights, has &lt;a href="http://www.thecommentator.com/article/2956/is_segregation_on_campuses_becoming_the_norm" title=""&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; there is "consistent use of segregation by student Islamic societies across the country".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote: "While this may be portrayed as voluntary by those who enforce it, the pressure put on female students to conform and obey these rules that encourage subjugation should not be underestimated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue made the headlines recently after Prof Lawrence Krauss, an eminent atheist, walked out of a segregated event at University College London (UCL). He returned after organisers said segregation would be abandoned. Richard Dawkins later described the attempted segregation as a "sexual apartheid".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of East London also recently &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/peter-g-tatchell/peter-tatchell-islamist-hate-preachers_b_2916831.html"&gt;blocked an Islamist meeting&lt;/a&gt; which was also set to have segregated seating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dawkins &lt;a href="http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation_articles/2013/3/10/sexual-apartheid-in-university-college-london#" title=""&gt;wrote on his website&lt;/a&gt;: "Isn't it really about time we decent, nice, liberal people stopped being so pusillanimously terrified of being thought 'Islamophobic' and stood up for decent, nice, liberal values?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/students"&gt;Students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/universityofleicester"&gt;University of Leicester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/higher-education"&gt;Higher education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/islam"&gt;Islam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/universitycollegelondon"&gt;UCL (University College London)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-williams"&gt;Martin Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The limit for single people is £350, although there are some exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National implementation of the cap will begin in July, and the policy should come fully into force by the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap is being brought in to cut spending and to bring benefits payments into line with average income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government last week claimed the number of people expected to be hit by the cap had fallen from 56,000 to 40,000, with 8,000 claimants finding work through JobCentre Plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mark Hoban said the cap had already begun to affect people's attitude to finding work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are getting to work because they realise that's the best way to [avoid] the benefit cap," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He brushed off suggestions that the measures might make it financially beneficial for couples to live apart, saying he was "slightly sceptical" about the notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that couples who have the best interests of their families at heart won't go down that route," he said, adding: "There are plenty of people on low incomes living and working in London."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Jonathan Portes, the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Department for Work and Pensions, said there was no evidence that the cap had affected people's behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said the move would provide "a strong incentive" to get people into work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even before the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and moving off benefits," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a very clear message: we will provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of working families are over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap was originally expected to save £275m a year from the welfare bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samjones"&gt;Sam Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Farmers are more likely to plant the deadly crop in areas of high violence or where they have not received any agricultural aid, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opium traders are often happy to provide seeds, fertilisers and even advance payments to encourage crops, leaving farmers who do not have western or government agricultural help very vulnerable to their inducements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time the more powerful figures in the drugs trade, from traffickers to corrupt government officials, who take over half the profit from each kilo of opium, have shrinking opportunities to earn money from Nato or international aid contracts – and may be preparing a war chest for upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Opium cultivation is up for the third successive year, and production is heading towards record levels," said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, Afghanistan head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. "People are hedging against an insecure future both politically and economically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 14 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces are now "poppy free", down from 20 in 2010. In three provinces, the spring sowing was the first time this decade that farmers had risked an attempt at growing opium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only figures showing a fall in cultivation, for western Herat province, may actually be due to a statistics blip. The UN was forced to use external data last year instead of the satellite images that are usually the basis of poppy growing calculations, and local officials protested heavily that the opium crop there had been overestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this year's poppy fields are harvested without disruption, the country would likely regain its status as producer of 90% of the world's opium. Afghanistan's share of the deadly market slipped to around 75% after bad weather and a blight slashed production over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the decline in opium production also drove up prices, to a record $300 a kilogramme. Prices have now slipped by over $100 but are still far above historic levels, helping tempt more farmers to turn land over to poppy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that the poor harvests of the last year will be repeated; there have been no reports of blight and the exceptionally bitter winter of 2011-12 was followed this year by a milder one, creating expectations of a large crop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase has come despite a marked improvement in Afghanistan's specialised counter-narcotics units, Lemahieu said. Fear of eradication has become a far more significant reason for farmers to stick to legal crops than in the past, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall the government and aid community has not prioritised efforts to cut back a crop and trade that feeds global markets for heroin, Lemahieu said, despite its corrosive effect on security, corruption and trust in Kabul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical of the official neglect are the 22 "national priority programmes" drawn up by Kabul to focus aid money and diplomatic efforts on its key development concerns including justice and education. Counter-narcotics was not one of them, nor has it been put at the heart of the other programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to have counter-narcotics dealt with seriously by the entire government as well as the aid community," Lemahieu said. "One of the big missing links here is providing for the communities themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eradication programmes that do not provide farmers with benefits such as healthcare and education, and support growing other crops will just push the Taliban or other insurgent groups that do tolerate or encourage poppy production, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/drugs-trade"&gt;Drugs trade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/emma-graham-harrison"&gt;Emma Graham-Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The work is an important step towards the longer-term goal of growing personalised replacement organs that could be transplanted into people with kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 51,000 people are treated every year in the UK for end-stage kidney failure and 90% of those are on the waiting list for organs are waiting for kidneys. A shortage of organs means that every year fewer than 3,000 transplants are carried out, however, while more than 3,000 people die waiting for a transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for kidney failure. The only available treatments – dialysis or receiving a transplant – just buy a patient more time but come with considerable limitations on quality of life. A patient on dialysis is advised to drink less than a litre of fluid per day, for example. And kidney transplants only last between 10 to 15 years on average, in addition to any complications caused by immune rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding a new source of replacement organs that could be grown using the patient's own cells and that could last a lifetime would, therefore, be a big leap forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest work, Harald Ott of Massachusetts General hospital led a team of scientists who grew a kidney by using an experimental technique that has previously been used to create working hearts, lungs and livers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ott first took a rat kidney and stripped out its functional cells using a solution of detergent. That left behind a white cellular matrix, the collagen scaffold that gives the organ its three-dimensional structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team then introduced kidney and blood vessel cells from newborn rats onto the scaffold and cultured the growing organs for 12 days, until the cells had grown to cover the scaffold. The team then implanted the organ into a living rat, where it successfully filtered the animal's blood and produced urine. The work is &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3154" title=""&gt;published on Sunday in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work builds on methods pioneered by the American bioengineer Doris Taylor, who first used it in 2008 to &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080113/full/news.2008.435.html" title=""&gt;grow whole, beating hearts&lt;/a&gt;. She described the collagen structure left behind after the bleach had done its work as being like the "gristle" in a steak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ott, further refinement of the technique would be needed, but it could lead to bioengineered kidneys one day replacing diseased or damaged kidneys in the same way that donor kidneys via transplant do now. Ideally, the engineered kidneys would be grown from a patient's own cells, thereby removing the need for the patient to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine Davies, head of research operations at Kidney Research UK, called Ott's work "fascinating science", which would provide hope for kidney patients and those at risk of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she cautioned that patients should not expect imminent human trials. "This whole regenerative medicine approach is still really in its infancy in terms of kidney disease," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Predominantly, it's just the fact that the kidney is a much more complex organ in terms of being able to replicate its anatomy and physiology when you compare it to other organs like skin or heart. It has many different types of cells within it and it has a very complex structure in terms of the different functions it performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's hope with a caution. I'm not saying we won't get there but it could be in [many] decades' time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Davies, not enough patients are diagnosed early in primary care, which would allow preventive measures such as lifestyle changes to delay or avoid kidney failure. "It's a growing health burden."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're predicting that there are 3 million people at risk of kidney disease in the UK," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/tissue-engineering"&gt;Tissue engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/medical-research"&gt;Medical research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alokjha"&gt;Alok Jha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They joined a procession of around 400 personnel from the Royal Navy,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marines, army and Royal Air Force, whose arrival at St Paul's was&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;heralded by the sound of a muffled drum from the bottom of Ludgate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill. Three hundred street-liners, drawn from across the armed forces, stood guard along the route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their head of the procession, a Royal Navy drummer, his drum cloaked in mourning black cloth, kept a steady beat as they marched. He was accompanied by two bear-skinned, mounted guardsmen, their horses' hoof-falls echoing along the cordoned-off street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wakey! Wakey!" came the order as the contingent took up its position. Shortly afterwards the Band of the Welsh Guards could be heard in the distance. It marched down Fleet Street followed by a contingent from the Welsh Guards. Keeping strict time, they arrived at the cathedral to take up position at the foot of the West Steps at 5.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few minutes earlier, a hearse bearing a coffin swaddled in the union flag had pulled up on the cobbles outside St Clement Danes. The weighted casket was removed from the car and taken into the chapel to be formally handed over to the military by the undertakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the church, an RAF padre said prayers while the coffin was prepared for the next stage of the journey: the flag, which had been wrapped tightly around the coffin, was unfolded and draped over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 5.18am, the two horses from the Household Cavalry that had "proved" the procession route for their equine colleagues arrived at the church from St Paul's to be joined by a Royal Marine band, its colour and marching drum both draped in black cloth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came the escort party, which included members of the Royal Artillery, the RAF, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Parachute regiment and the Royal Engineers. In accordance with funeral protocol, their SA-80 rifles were stripped of their bayonets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before 5.25am, the gun carriage arrived, drawn by six black Irish draught horses from the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery. The carriage – which bore a 1.5-tonne gun made in 1914 and had had the steel bands of its wheels replaced with rubber to ensure a quieter run – was lined up behind the statue of Dowding to await its cargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horses did not have long to wait. At 5.32am, eight bearers, their heads bare, carried the coffin from the chapel, hoisted it high on to the gun carriage and pulled the flag tight over the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later, the horses moved off, dragging the carriage over the sanded cobbles and down towards St Paul's to the strains of Chopin's funeral march.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly 19 minutes later, at a precise pace of 70 steps a minute and neatly on schedule, the carriage arrived at the cathedral, where dawn had broken to the sounds of Elgar's Nimrod, I Vow to Thee My Country and the national anthem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the flag-draped coffin pulled up at the cathedral, the street-liners stood "Rest on your arms reversed", with heads bowed and their right hands placed on their rifles, with muzzles pointing towards the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bearer party of 10, made up of soldiers, sailors, and airmen from regiments closely associated with the Falklands war, took up position as a single bell tolled. From inside the cathedral funereal music could be heard as the coffin was borne aloft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guard of honour stood in mute salute as the coffin entered the church. Then all that could be heard was the clump, clump, clump of shiny black boots as the procession left, makings its way back down Ludgate Hill to disband and debrief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the coffin's journey to the cathedral will be accompanied by the firing of a minute gun from Tower Wharf. The first shot will sound as the gun carriage's wheels begin to move off from St Clement Danes, with another following every minute until it reaches St Paul's. On Monday, however, in a gesture of clemency to the capital's sleeping denizens, the gunners held their fire and the passing of each minute was instead marked by a soldier shouting "Bang!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Special events commentator Alastair Bruce, a Falklands veteran who has commentated on past royal funerals, said that while it had gone "extremely well", there was still room for improvement. "Perhaps the bearer party needs tightening a bit," he said. "They are not used to working together. Also they might want to tweak the timing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By his reckoning, things were a little out. Had the rehearsal been the funeral itself, he added, Lady Thatcher's coffin would have entered the cathedral three-and-a-quarter minutes behind schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major Andrew Chatburn, the man in charge of choreographing the parade, said it had been vitally important to stage a trial of Wednesday's event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatburn, ceremonial staff officer for the Household Division, who was also behind the royal wedding procession two years ago and last year's diamond jubilee parade, said: "Timings are most important. We will learn something quite significant this morning about the timings, and to familiarise the troops of their duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to see the ground as well so they can get a feel for how it's going to go and they can perform their duties with confidence on the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "I thought it went very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samjones"&gt;Sam Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies"&gt;Caroline Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The limit for single people is £350, although there are some exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National implementation of the cap will begin in July, and the policy is scheduled to come fully into force by the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap is being brought in to cut spending and to bring benefits payments into line with average income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said last week: "The benefit cap sets a clear limit for how much support the welfare state will provide – the average wage for working households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it's also a strong incentive for people to move into work and even before the cap comes in we are seeing thousands of people seeking help and moving off benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a very clear message: we will provide support to those who need it, but the days of outrageous claims giving people incomes far above those of working families are over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government last week claimed the number of people expected to be hit by the cap had fallen from 56,000 to 40,000, with 8,000 claimants finding work through JobCentre Plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan Smith hailed the figures, saying the cap had provided a strong incentive for people to look for jobs, even before it had started to affect their incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Department for Work and Pensions, said there was no evidence that the cap had affected people's behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap was originally expected to save £275m a year from the welfare bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/iain-duncan-smith"&gt;Iain Duncan Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But some of the more challenging positions, like the Prone Tiger, the Catherine Wheel or the Peg, have left readers a little baffled.

The South's unification ministry described the response as regrettable but said the offer would remain on the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have suggested the North may test a mid-range missile close to its major political holiday – Monday's Day of the Sun, which marks the birth of the country's first leader, Kim Il-sung. It has previously held launches near important anniversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South's defence ministry discounted speculation of such a move on a Monday, pointing out the North had not previously carried out a test on that day. But spokesman Kim Min-seok added: "The military is not easing up on its vigilance on the activities of the North's military with the view that they can conduct a provocation at any time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's defence minister, Kim Kwan-jin, said it was believed the North was ready for a launch, the Yonhap news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say increased activity at missile sites in recent weeks might be intended to send a message that the North is willing to hold a test, whether or not it actually does so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry told reporters that a launch would "raise people's temperatures" and reiterated the US determination to defend its allies. But he added: "Our choice is to negotiate, our choice is to move to the table and find a way for the region to have peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to be so stuck in the mud that an opportunity to actually get something done is flagrantly wasted because of a kind of predetermined stubbornness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said how far the North would need to go would have to be the subject of discussion, but added: "If the Chinese came to us and said, 'Look, here's what we have cooking,' I'm not going to tell you I'm shutting the door today to something that's logical and might have a chance of success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry indicated he might be willing to use back channels rather than an official US government envoy to handle contact with the North. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, the Republican senator John McCain voiced scepticism about possible talks with the North, warning: "If we give them food, if we give them oil, if we give them money, they will come around and they take our money and run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pyongyang, leader Kim Jong-un visited the mausoleum where the bodies of his grandfather Kim Il-sung and father Kim Jong-il lie in state to pay "high tribute in humblest reverence" on Monday, the official Korean Central News Agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, athletes from 16 countries competed in a marathon in Pyongyang as part of the celebrations, while performers gathered for a gala concert in the capital in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/john-kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I'm here to assume my responsibility with courage ... The fight continues!" Maduro, 50, told a rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Chávistas in central Caracas launched fireworks and honked their car horns in celebration, the tiny margin shocked many aides, who had been expecting the double-digit victory predicted by most polls up until a week ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Miraflores, the presidential palace, Maduro addressed a crowd of supporters who had previously welcomed Chávez's election victories at the same venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by his wife, son and government officials, Maduro proclaimed a new era in the "Bolivarian Revolution" began by his predecessor and said his victory was further proof that Chávez "continues to be invincible, that he continues to win battles".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro claimed he was the target of a "dirty war". "There is an international operation to attack Venezuelan democracy," he said. "I will show no weakness against those who meddle with this country's sovereignty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How he will rule with such a narrow majority will be a key question. Maduro said Capriles had called him before the results were announced to suggest a "pact" but that he had refused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capriles said he would never make a pact with "the illegitimate" and declared himself ready to fight against electoral abuse. Speaking to supporters but addressing Maduro, he said: "You and your government are the big losers of this process. We will not recognise the results until every single vote is counted one by one ... Every box, every vote must be counted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membership of the electoral commission is skewed towards the ruling party and many Capriles supporters felt cheated. In the suburbs, where his backing is strongest, protesters banged pots and pans in anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their options, however, are limited. Venezuela now faces a difficult period with a new president who must assert control with a small and contested mandate even as he addresses chronic problems of inflation, high crime rates, crumbling infrastructure and an over-reliance on oil exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chávez's death from cancer in March sparked the race for a successor, which came six months after Chávez won the previous presidential election. In his last address to the nation before undergoing emergency surgery the former president urged Venezuelans to vote for Maduro if he failed to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions appeared to have taken his words to heart in Sunday's election. Maduro won with 7,505,338 votes or 50.66% and Capriles had 7,270,403 or 49.07%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was considerably below the 12 percentage point winning margin attained by Chávez in October – underlining the difficulty the new president faces in living up to the reputation of his charismatic predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voter turnout was slightly down at 78.71%, when for the October 2012 election it was 80.4% of the 19 million registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition complained throughout the campaign that it was at an unfair disadvantage because Maduro had far more airtime on the state broadcasting channels and made use of the extensive funds and personnel of nationalised companies to bolster his rallies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibisay Lucena, the head of the electoral commission, said destiny had put Venezuela to the test but the country had passed the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a moment to go home and transmit to your followers the tranquility that people deserve. We ask all of you to go home in peace and as always with the solidarity we have always shown," Lucena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until a week ago most polling groups had predicted at least a 14-point margin of victory for Maduro but the gap was said to have narrowed towards the end of the 10-day presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts attributed this to a frenetic mobilisation campaign by Capriles and to Maduro's lack of charisma and often bizarre comments, which included a claim that he was visited by the spirit of Chávez in bird form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But voter desire for continuity of popular social welfare "missions" and a strong sympathy vote in the wake of Chávez funeral helped to carry the day for Maduro, who has proclaimed himself the "son" of the former president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail Maduro promised to deepen his predecessor's construction of a socialist model in the oil-rich nation, to hike the minimum wage by 30-40% and to disarm the slums. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro – who served as minister for foreign affairs for six years before being named vice-president in November 2012 – has also vowed to honour Chávez's close relationship with Cuba, one of several ideologically aligned countries to which Venezuela donates substantial quantities of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the hard work now begins. Maduro must fill the political shoes of a leader who pulled together a diverse coalition of interests largely through the force of his personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with Chavez's blessing, voters appear to have been sharply divided about whether to give him six years to show what he can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolas-maduro"&gt;Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hugo-chavez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/virginia-lopez"&gt;Virginia Lopez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonathanwatts"&gt;Jonathan Watts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Investigators are considering whether a powerful downdraft of wind caused the crash&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/13/indonesian-plane-crashes-into-sea-off-bali"&gt; in which all 108 passengers and crew survived &lt;/a&gt;despite the Boeing 737 cracking in half on impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly built plane undershot the tourist island's main airport runway in Denpasar and belly-flopped in water on Saturday. Authorities from Indonesia, the US and Boeing are investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial debriefings, witness comments and weather reports have focused attention on the possibility of "wind shear" or a downdraft from storm clouds known as a "microburst". Experts say such violent and unpredictable gusts are rare but can leave even the most modern jet helpless if they are stronger than the plane's ability to fly out of trouble – with the critical moments before landing among the most vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a downdraft which exceeds the performance of the plane, then even if you put on full thrust you will go downhill and you can't climb out," said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways captain and expert on loss-of-control events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of the crash has potential implications for the reputation of one of the world's fastest-growing airlines, which is fighting to be removed from a European Union safety blacklist just as it buys record volumes of Airbus and Boeing jets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to initial pilot debriefings, details of which have been described to the Reuters news agency, flight JT-904 was on an eastwards approach to Bali's Ngurah Rai airport at mid-afternoon on Saturday following a normal flight from Bandung, West Java. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-pilot, an Indian national with 2,000 hours of relevant flying experience, was in charge for the domestic trip, which was scheduled to last one hour and 40 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Lion Air plane was coming in to land, with an aircraft of national carrier Garuda following behind and another about to take off on the runway just ahead, the co-pilot lost sight of the runway as heavy rain drove across the windshield. The captain, an Indonesian citizen with about 15,000 hours' experience and an instructor's licence, took the controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 122 metres and 61 metres altitude (400-200ft) pilots described flying through a wall of water, according to the source. Bursts of heavy rainfall and lost visibility are not uncommon in the tropics but the aircraft's low altitude meant the crew had little time to react. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no sight of the runway lights or markings the captain decided to abort the landing and perform a "go around", a routine manoeuvre for which all pilots are well trained. But the captain told officials afterwards that instead of climbing the 737 started to sink uncontrollably and their well-practised routines unravelled quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The captain says he intended to go around but that he felt the aircraft dragged down by the wind; that is why he hit the sea," said the source, who was briefed on the crew's testimony. "There was rain coming east to west; very heavy," the source said, asking not to be named because no one is authorised to speak publicly about the investigation while it is under way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passenger on board the jet painted a similar picture of an aircraft getting into difficulty only at the last minute. "There was no sign at all it would fall but then suddenly it dropped into the water," Tantri Widiastuti, 60, told Metro TV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lion Air declined to comment on the cause of the crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Flight Safety Foundation, bulletins for pilots at around that time indicated a few storm clouds at 518 metres (1,700ft) and a wind blowing moderately but varying in its direction from east-south-east to the west. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aircraft itself was delivered in February and there had been only one technical problem: a landing light that had to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;According to Boeing, the 737-800, its most popular current model, is equipped with a system that detects wind shear ahead and warns the pilot audibly to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/plane-crashes"&gt;Plane crashes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bali"&gt;Bali&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indonesia"&gt;Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/boeing"&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry"&gt;Airline industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The 41-year-old takes over a party that dominated Canada for much of the last century but was relegated to third-party status in the most recent election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierre Trudeau, who died at age 80 in 2000, was Liberal prime minister for almost all of a 16-year stretch from 1968 to 1984. Sweeping to power on a wave of support nicknamed "Trudeaumania", he had a charisma reminiscent of another young dashing politician who had captivated the US eight years earlier: John F Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trudeau's sophisticated, sometimes irreverent style fascinated Canada but riled conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, is said to be bent on shattering the image of the Liberals – a party that produced other memorable prime ministers in Jean Chretien and Lester Pearson – as the natural party of government in Canada and to redefine what it means to be Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper has incrementally moved what has been an instinctively liberal country to the right since taking power in 2006. He has gradually lowered sales and corporate taxes; promoted the potential of Alberta's oil sands, the world's third-largest oil reserves, regardless of environmental objections; increased spending on the military; and staunchly backed Israel's rightwing government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper has successfully blitzed the country with TV attack ads against previous Liberal leaders, including during telecasts of the Oscars and the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Trudeau warned in his acceptance speech of more attacks to come. "Canadians want to be led, not ruled. They are tired of the negative, divisive politics of Mr Harper's Conservatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper's camp immediately put out a release slamming the inexperience of Trudeau, who is also a former high school teacher. "Justin Trudeau may have a famous last name but in a time of global economic uncertainty he doesn't have the judgment or experience to be prime minister," the Conservative spokesman Fred DeLorey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moving eulogy at Pierre Trudeau's state funeral, Justin Trudeau challenged the country to make his father's vision of a united, bilingual and multi-ethnic Canada a permanent monument. "It's all up to us, all of us now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Trudeau also called for party unity after years of infighting between Chretien and the most recent Liberal prime minister, Paul Martin. Chretien made no mention of Martin during a speech on Sunday. Trudeau said the Liberals had been focused on fighting each other rather than fighting for Canadians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't care if you thought my father was great or arrogant," Trudeau said. "It doesn't matter to me if you were a Chretien-Liberal or a Martin-Liberal or any other kind of Liberal. The era of hyphenated Liberals ends right here right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trudeau reached out to the French-speaking province of Quebec, where the Liberals must do well if they are to form a national government again. The next election is expected in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/stephen-harper"&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Figures released by Network Rail show that incidents which affected rail services dropped by two-thirds over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total delays caused by the problem fell by more than half in the year to March 2013 to around 2,700 hours – down from more than 6,000 hours of delays to trains at the peak in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cost to the industry was still put at almost £13m over the last year, it represents a significant decline in a crime that has caused widespread disruption and delays for rail passengers over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper cable theft has been a particular problem, hitting telephone and broadband connections as well as causing rail delays. Despite an increasing police crackdown, thefts in recent weeks caused problems including an entire Lincolnshire village losing its communications and a new bridge in south Wales having to be closed after safety railings were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network Rail said passengers were reaping the benefits of years of work to tackle the problem with partners in the railway and associated industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Henry, the head of operations and performance at Network Rail, said the figures were a result of several factors, including the targeting of thieves and scrap dealers by the British transport police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "Our engineers are working with suppliers and other industries to make metal – particularly our cables – harder to steal and easier to identify and our teams around the network are introducing new ways of working to reduce delay and fix thefts more quickly. We believe the introduction of new laws following our work with other industries to explain the need for change to government will continue to help to stifle the market for stolen metal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport minister Norman Baker said: "The coalition government is strongly committed to tackling metal theft and it is heartening to see that the decisive action that has been taken is now paying off with major reductions in this kind of crime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ban on paying cash for scrap metal came into force in December. Fines have been increased for dealers trading in stolen metal and police have been given new powers to close unlicensed scrap yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Chief Inspector Gill Murray of the British transport police said the reduced figures were "encouraging" but added: "We cannot, however, take our eye off the ball and will continue to develop initiatives and tactics to make life even more challenging for thieves and unscrupulous metal recyclers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 285 thefts that caused delays to rail services last year, down from 845 in 2011-12. The bill for passenger compensation for delayed trains fell to £5.8m from £12m in 2010-11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Scrap Metal Dealers act which comes into force in the autumn gives police powers to close unlicensed scrapyards, creates a register of dealers, and requires dealers to record ID from all sellers of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spike in commodity prices since 2008 made stealing metal an increasingly lucrative business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copper prices hit record highs in 2011, having trebled in the previous two years, and remained high until this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent falls in the price may dampen the appetite for illegal trade, although a report in the Wall Street Journal last week said suppliers were having to pay hefty premiums to source metals at short notice, despite a glut stockpiled in warehouses in Belgium and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/network-rail"&gt;Network Rail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/gwyntopham"&gt;Gwyn Topham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By comparison the 3G auction in April 2000 raised £22.5bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/15/4g-auction-chancellor-loses-out" title=""&gt;published by Ofcom in March&lt;/a&gt; showed that the highest bids for 4G spectrum came to a total of £5.2bn. But Ofcom said those were only theoretical because it was using a rule whereby winners only paid slightly more than the second-highest bidder – similar to an eBay auction – a measure taken to make the auctions harder to rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodman said she welcomed the NAO's intervention: "It is entirely right that the National Audit Office has launched this investigation. Serious questions must be answered as to why the Conservative-led government ended up £1bn short of the estimate George Osborne had provided just months earlier. When the 3G auction took place, Labour ensured that maximising revenue was an objective. The Conservative-led government did not do the same for the 4G auction, which I believe was a serious mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sources at bidders felt that the design of the auction, using a system known as "combinatorial clock" – which has been used in other countries to sell off 4G airwaves – not only worked against maximising revenue but was also unsatisfactory for bidders. "[Ofcom] neither raised the amount that the government was looking for, nor did it ensure that spectrum found its way into the hands of everybody who wanted it," one bidder said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their dissatisfaction could also become part of the study. Morse told Goodman that Ofcom had "a responsibility to ensure that the auction delivered an economically efficient allocation of spectrum".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allocation after the auction means that Vodafone's share of all UK mobile spectrum has leapt from 23% to 28%, while that of its rival O2 has dropped from 20% to 15%, and that of the smaller Three network from 18% to 12%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the NAO does not have the power to order a rerun of the auction, a report will go to the Commons public accounts committee, which in turn can censure the government and demand a response from Osborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofcom defended the auction. A spokesman said: "The 4G auction was a success, which will deliver the maximum benefit to UK citizens and consumers – in line with Ofcom's statutory duties. It will create competition, with five companies able to launch competitive 4G services. This will lead to investment in new services, greater innovation and lower prices, plus enhanced coverage with a rule to cover almost all of the UK population by 2017 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The auction was designed to promote competition and ensure coverage, rather than to raise money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Treasury spokesman said it was the Office for Budget Responsibility, not the Treasury, that estimated the auction would raise £3.5bn. He also said that, even if the actual figure raised had been available at the time of the autumn statement, the Treasury would still have been able to say it was on course to lower borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/4g"&gt;4G&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms"&gt;Telecoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/telecoms"&gt;Telecommunications industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones"&gt;Mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/smartphones"&gt;Smartphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/charlesarthur"&gt;Charles Arthur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In his triumphant, but never placid, Indian summer, Davis continued above all to adorn his own monument as the unassailable leading interpreter of the 19th century's most individual composer, Hector Berlioz, frequently returning to other idols in a&amp;nbsp;broad if selective repertoire that ranged from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR8GFUTMP_E" title="YouTube: Magic Flute Overture"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt; to Tippett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fifth of seven children, he was born in the affluent stockbroker belt of Surrey. But his father was a bank clerk, and the only form of music in the family flat above a shop came from a gramophone which was the young Colin's solace and delight. In this way he experienced his road to Damascus with a performance of Beethoven's Eighth Symphony which alerted him to what he later called "the power, the tenderness, the beauty, the ferocity of music". A wealthy great-uncle assisted him to a place at Christ's Hospital school, West Sussex, and there an older student encouraged him to take up the clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his teachers tried to steer him towards a career in biology or chemistry, subjects in which he excelled, he was determined on a life in music. There were obstacles to his chosen sphere, conducting, since he had not learned the piano, and having gained a clarinet scholarship to the Royal College of Music, London, where he studied with Frederick Thurston, he found himself barred from conducting classes there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another standard route to the podium, that of becoming a repetiteur with one of Germany's many opera companies, would also be closed to him; though looking back in 1991, he had no regrets about his lack of pianistic skill, declaring that "conducting has more to do with singing and breathing than with piano-playing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1949, after military service, which he fulfilled as a clarinettist with the Household Cavalry, he married the soprano April Cantelo, soon to enjoy a distinguished career of her own, and conducted other graduates of the RCM in the newly formed Kalmar Orchestra, rehearsing in the basement of the Ethical Church in Bayswater. Out of the orchestra came the semi-professional Chelsea Opera Group, which invited him to conduct its performances of Mozart's Der Schauspieldirektor and Don Giovanni, an opera which was to remain a constant throughout his life. In Mozart, he later told the New York Times, he found "all those things that helped keep me together … in Mozart you find a fantastic balance between the elements that make up music and make up a human being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His own life at this time, however, was far from balanced. He had part-time engagements as a clarinettist at Glyndebourne under Fritz Busch, then Mozart's greatest champion, and with the New London Chamber Orchestra. But even supplementary jobs conducting local choirs and coaching at Cambridge failed to bring in an income sufficient to support his wife, son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His first break came when he was offered the post of assistant conductor at the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in 1957, and two years later Mozart came to the rescue when he took over from an indisposed Otto Klemperer in a concert performance of Don Giovanni at the Royal Festival Hall. Sadler's Wells Opera, where he had conducted Mozart's Entführung aus dem Serail, had already offered him the post of chief conductor, and he became the company's music director in 1961. Stravinsky, his other great love of the late 1950s and early 60s, featured in memorable performances of Oedipus Rex and The Rake's Progress, and he faced the challenge of Beethoven's Fidelio for the first time. A personal crisis which precipitated the breakdown of his 15-year marriage, however, led to a request to be released from his five-year contract with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possibilities were in the air: influential voices canvassed for him to become the next principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and music director of the Royal Opera House. Neither post was forthcoming; doubts were voiced about his stability, and many musicians found him, as he admits he then still was, "a bit hard and tactless".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis finally turned around his mid-life crisis with careful reading of Hermann Broch's Death of Virgil and Nikos Kazantzakis's The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel; the happiness of his marriage in 1964 to a Persian student, Ashraf Naini – his adored second wife, Shamsi – and appointment to the post of the BBC Symphony Orchestra's chief conductor in 1967, which he described as "the completion of my education".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From this point on there emerged a&amp;nbsp;new Colin Davis – less ambitious and self-indulgent, more ready to work alongside his orchestral musicians than to confront them with tactless invective. The BBC post allowed him to choose repertoire in co-operation with the supremely diplomatic controller of music, William Glock, and to venture into such complex new scores as Peter Maxwell Davies's Worldes Bliss, which he looked back on as the most difficult work he had ever undertaken. He was less comfortable with the patriotic high jinks of the Last Night of the Proms, which he confessed gave off more than a whiff of the first world war antihero Earl Haig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His career had now taken a decidedly international turn, with chief conductorships in the offing from New York and Boston. He later took up the post of principal guest conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, recording his first and perhaps most keenly articulated Sibelius symphony-cycle there in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, he chose to succeed Georg Solti as music director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He had already laid down a gauntlet with productions of Berlioz's Les Troyens in 1969 and two Tippett operas – The Midsummer Marriage and the world premiere of The Knot Garden – in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outstanding recordings accompanied all three events, and the Tippett association continued with the heartfelt approval of the composer. Davis and Tippett shared an intellectual curiosity stretching way beyond the bounds of the musical world, and Tippett told Alan Blyth in 1972 that "Colin has an instinctive understanding of what I want without our ever having discussed it. I just feel that as far as interpreting my music is concerned, he's the tops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship with the Royal Opera, perhaps inevitably given the countless sensibilities involved, proved less adulatory in the long term. The introspective Davis was perceived as much less of a theatrical animal than his predecessor, Solti; despite successful advances in his own repertoire, and his insistence on sharing seasons with other top international interpreters – among them Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Riccardo Muti, Zubin Mehta, Loren Maazel, Bernard Haitink and Gennadi Rozhdestvensky – he was still more revered abroad, especially in Amsterdam with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, than at home. Friction with the board of directors, responsibility for four unsuccessful new operas and controversial decisions over productions, not least Götz Friedrich's staging of Wagner's Ring cycle, which he conducted and eloquently defended throughout the 1970s, contributed to a departure earlier than he would have liked, in 1986, after a 15-year reign that would have been more than enough for many other conductors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Sir Colin – he was knighted in 1980, appointed Companion of Honour in 2002 and awarded the Queen's Medal for music in 2009 – he continued to live an unostentatious private life divided between his homes in Highgate, north London, and Suffolk, devoted to his wife, the three sons and two daughters by his second marriage and a pet iguana that would terrorise visiting colleagues by landing on them unpredictably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world was more than ever at his fingertips. A fruitful reign, from 1983, at the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, which understood his increasingly mellow and expansive manner perfectly, was followed by a principal guest conductorship with one of the most aristocratic of European orchestras, the Dresden Staatskapelle, in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a new golden age, with never a harsh word between conductor and players, truly began five years later when he accepted the post he had failed to reach back in 1964 – principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. Critics and public were unanimous in acclaiming him the finest interpreter of Berlioz of the age; concert performances of the operas and the pick of the major orchestral works and dramatic cantatas were mostly recorded for posterity (though not the first, ideally cast Barbican Benvenuto Cellini, perhaps the gem of the entire series).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his Bruckner, Dvořák and Elgar symphonies were now magisterial, offering plenty of vitality within broad lines, Davis's plushly upholstered Sibelius stood in marked contrast to the more volatile, plainer-speaking interpretations of younger conductors. He discovered for himself a British composer whose white-heat inspirations suited him as well as Tippett had done, James MacMillan, and one of his last major undertakings with the LSO was a cycle of Nielsen's symphonies. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcvD_0M8eAA" title="YouTube: Proms performance from 2000"&gt;Berlioz's Requiem&lt;/a&gt; was the last work he conducted with the LSO, in June last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis's commitment to education and fostering the talents of the younger generation was embodied in his 25 years as international chair of orchestral studies at the Royal Academy of Music, which ran parallel to a similar role in Dresden's Music Conservatory. During his time at the academy, he was equally involved in opera productions, concerts, chamber music and masterclasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the last, Davis was certain of the repertoire which suited him best; the Russians, he declared, smacked too much of the circus, and most of Mahler's symphonies struck him as overwrought. Not everything he had once conducted with such vivacity aged well; his later Mozart and Richard Strauss at the Royal Opera could feel rather grandiose, in marked contrast to glorious concert performances with the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8fTjfjO27A" title="YouTube: Conducting discussion"&gt;LSO&lt;/a&gt; of three long-term favourites, Britten's Peter Grimes and Verdi's Falstaff and Otello. Mozart continued to be of the essence: when his wife died in 2010, he carried on with his commitment to a run of performances of Le Nozze di Figaro at the Royal Opera House. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/12/sir-colin-davis" title="Sir Colin Davis: 'You are of no account whatsoever'"&gt;"How did he do it?", asked Guardian critic Tom Service. The answer was simple: the strength comes from the music, and Mozart is "life itself"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis always remained true to a credo of humility, dating back to the turning-point of the mid-1960s, and revering that "something in the air" which was the essence of music. As he put it so eloquently to the writer Helena Matheopoulos: "If people are musical and want to play, they will share this thing with you.

He was the longest-serving principal conductor in the LSO's history. "Sir Colin's role in British musical life was immense. Alongside his commitment to the LSO, he forged special relationships with the Royal Opera House, the BBCSO, and the English Chamber Orchestra, as well as mentoring many young performers and conductors at the Royal Academy of Music and the Guildhall School," the LSO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was internationally renowned for his interpretations of Mozart, Sibelius and Berlioz, and music lovers across the world have been inspired by his performances and recordings. His musicianship and his humanity have been cherished by musicians and audiences alike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes after his death, Davis's name began trending on Twitter. Harriet Harman, the deputy leader of the Labour party wrote: "&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HarrietHarman/status/323550906077552641" title="Harriet Harman"&gt;Colin Davis made a historic contribution to music&lt;/a&gt; - in this country &amp; worldwide. Condolences to his family". &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KathJenkins/status/323543137337356288" title="Katherine Jenkins"&gt;Katherine Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, the Welsh soprano, was one of hundreds of fans who expressed their sadness. Classic FM announced they would play a selection of his recordings on Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conductor worked all over the world and received dozens of awards. Davis was made a CBE in 1965 and received a knighthood in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was named a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the Queen's birthday honours in 2001 and also received the Queen's medal for music in December 2009 and was awarded the Commander of the Order of Dannebrog by the queen of Denmark in 2012.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Weybridge, Surrey in 1927, Davis also conducted the BBC Scottish Orchestra and Sadler's Wells Opera House. From 1967 to 1971, he was chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became music director of the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in 1971. Davis also conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic and the Dresden Staatskapelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/colin-davis"&gt;Colin Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/classicalmusicandopera"&gt;Classical music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/london-symphony-orchestra"&gt;London Symphony Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/conalurquhart"&gt;Conal Urquhart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

State media said that only "terrorist nests" had been hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just over two years into the Syrian crisis – the longest and bloodiest of the Arab uprisings – ignoring the sound of death and destruction nearby has become the new normal for Damascenes. Qaboun is barely 20 minutes from the capital's centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend men could be seen puffing on water pipes in a palm-shaded park, children playing between the flowerbeds and couples chatting demurely on benches as the unmistakable thunderclap of high explosive rippled through the air a few miles away – smoke rising between the minarets of a nearby Ottoman-era mosque. No one seemed to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Actually you do get used to it after a while," said George, an IT technician who hails from an Alawite village on the coast. "But you never know exactly what they are hitting." That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by opposition media outlets on YouTube – shell-damaged buildings, corpses and a disembodied voiceover naming the location and date, followed by the words: "Allahu Akbar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Revolutionary Leadership Council in Damascus said in a statement that 10 children died in Sunday's attack by a Mig jet on a civilian area of Qaboun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sinister background noise is doubly disturbing because the government tries so hard to preserve a jaunty air of business as usual – a Syrian version of the blitz spirit. "As you can see everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists," an army officer announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official, whose route home has come under attack from rebels in Daraya, said: "If I was afraid I would just shut my door and stay inside. I have to work and I am not afraid. If I don't defend my country, who else will?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordinary citizens, in private conversation, are less defiant. In the centre of town a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of shelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeina, a twentysomething student, fears becoming desensitised to suffering – and perhaps to danger too. "In the beginning last year when there started to be explosions I used to have nightmares," she reflected. "Now I can sleep through anything."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the risks are multiplying even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a car bomb detonated last Monday, leaving a blackened concrete facade, gaping window frames and mangled metal as well as blast damage to the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mourning notices for two of the 15 victims – Muhammad al-Sufi and Manal al-Tahan – are stuck to the wall opposite. Scruffy, machine-gun toting militiamen mill around the square, often used for televised pro-regime rallies with civil servants bussed in en masse to chant slogans under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated in recent months. In February, 80 people, including schoolchildren, reportedly died near Ba'ath party headquarters in Mazraa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crater is still visible, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. "I live nearby but luckily I wasn't there," recalled Munir, a university lecturer. "The cars seemed to have melted. You wondered what happened to the passengers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mazraa attack was blamed on Jabhat al-Nusra, the rebel group that has just announced its affiliation to al-Qaida – grist to the mill of the government, which sought from the start to portray the anti-Assad uprising as an exclusively Islamist, extremist and terrorist conspiracy fomented by Arab and western enemies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now within easy range of the city, have become an ominous novelty in recent weeks. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended target is thought to have been a government building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security measures have intensified since the devastating bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assad's most senior aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers – often painted in the Syrian flag's black, red and white – now protect official premises, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian embassy in Mezze, its turquoise mosaic front giving an exotic glimpse of Isfahan or Shiraz, looks like a fortress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus," a foreign diplomat said. "But for whatever reason the perimeter is starting to be punctured and that brings home the reality of the war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable, and time-consuming – another aspect of the new normal across an understandably nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads funnel traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors – vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, the Guardian was forced to spend 90 minutes at a roadblock off Ummayad Square, home to the ministry of defence, state TV and the Assad national library, while my passport was checked. Ali, my Aleppan taxi driver, was unfazed but fatalistic. "Every checkpoint is a law unto itself," he mused, also unconvincingly upbeat about the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrians warn that many cab drivers now report to the Mukhabarat secret police, and loose talk can be dangerous. It seems safer to chat about the weather – gloriously spring-like, warm and jasmine-scented against such a bleak political and security backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyone's mind: will there be a battle for Damascus – the world's oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say – like the one that has so damaged Aleppo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its ritziest hotel is eerily deserted though many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies drawn by the deepening crisis – blue helmets and flak jackets piled up on Persian carpets in an ornate reception room, white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. The streets empty soon after 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One view is that the fight for Syria's capital is coming, but not quite yet – in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have consolidated their gains in the south. Others argue that outright victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution imposed from abroad. But few here seem to expect things to get any better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/bashar-al-assad"&gt;Bashar al-Assad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianblack"&gt;Ian Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He had not realised he had broken it when the accident happened, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband was walking with his wife, Justine, on a coastal path in Devon and fell, hitting his left wrist on a rock. The injury only came to light when he visited the accident and emergency unit at University College hospital, London, on Friday because the pain in his wrist was not subsiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband spent three days campaigning with the injured wrist, as well as delivering his tribute to Lady Thatcher in the House of Commons and attending an overnight Policy Network conference in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. It was only on the way back from Denmark on Friday that he decided he needed an x-ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday he underwent a minor operation to reset the wrist, returning home in the afternoon. He will be campaigning on Monday, and will attend Thatcher's funeral as planned on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the procedure, Miliband, who also had an operation in 2011 to treat a deviated septum in his nose, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ed_Miliband/status/323462725885906945" title=""&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: "Thanks to all of the brilliant, friendly, dedicated staff today at University College hospital who helped treat my broken wrist #lovetheNHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/10/margaret-thatcher-tributes-ed-miliband-speech" title=""&gt;Miliband's speech about Thatcher&lt;/a&gt; last Wednesday was widely praised, with even David Cameron saying it was "very good". But it is understood that Miliband needed painkillers to get through his Commons performance, which lasted seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the speech, in what seemed to be a reference to his own style of leadership, Miliband said Thatcher was someone who "sought to be rooted in people's daily lives" but also someone who "believed that ideology mattered".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewsparrow"&gt;Andrew Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
