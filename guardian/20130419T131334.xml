That figure is likely to reach at least 10 million, more than half the pre-war population of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another UN body, Unicef, says half of those currently in need are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't remember any other crisis where we are having 8,000 per day [fleeing across borders], every day since February," Guterres said in an interview with the Guardian. "There will very likely be 3.5 million by the end of the year. We will have half the population of Syria in dire need of assistance and this is incomprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the civil war now into its third year and increasingly taking the shape of a proxy regional war fought on a sectarian faultline, aid groups are making ever more strident predictions of a catastrophic funding shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guterres goes further, warning that the modern boundaries of the Middle East and the post-Ottoman agreements that underpin them may unravel if the crisis is not brought to an end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The political geography of the modern Middle East emerged from the Sykes Picot agreement with the exception of the never-resolved Israeli-Palestinian situation," he said of the Anglo-French deal at the end of the first world war that eventually formed the nation states of Syria and Lebanon. "The conflict in Syria might for the first time put that political geography into question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of state, John Kerry, and Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, this week both warned of a partition of the country that would inevitably cause grave ramifications in neighbouring Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry appeared to advance the US position on Syria by suggesting an "enclave break-up" could only be prevented by getting "everybody on the same page with respect to what post-Assad Syria will look like".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assad, meanwhile, reiterated his earlier warning that no country in the region would be safe if the Syrian war, in which a majority Sunni opposition is fighting a minority Alawite regime aligned to Shia Islam, led to the collapse of the embattled state's borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNHCR figures show that close to 1.3 million Syrians have fled the country in the past two years. The figure is markedly less than the numbers that left Iraq and Afghanistan over the past decade, but is increasing at a faster rate than at any point in either country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are thought to be at least 3 million internally displaced Syrian refugees, many of whom have limited means to provide for themselves or their families. Communities in Syria's war-ravaged north, west and south are largely without electricity and low on food and running water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refugee camps in northern Jordan, southern Turkey and Lebanon's Bekaa valley are overwhelmed with daily arrivals of refugees who have often made precarious journeys to escape nearby battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the most brutal [conflict], even with very brutal conflicts elsewhere," said Guterres. "If one looks at the impact on the population, or the percentage of the total population in need, I have no doubt that since the end of the cold war it is the worst. And it will become even worse still if there is no solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My belief is that if we take all of these elements, then this is the most dramatic humanitarian crisis that we have ever faced. Then if we look at the geopolitical implications, I have no doubt that this is the most serious that we have ever dealt with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanon and Iraq are increasingly unable to deal with the Syrian spillover, which is disturbing already fraught sectarian power bases and straining meagre resources during an economic downturn brought on by the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a real threat to Lebanon and Iraq," said Guterres. "Jordan is under serious economic stress. We have the Palestinian/Israeli question and the fact that the Syrian army has withdrawn from the Golan Heights. In the context of the Sunni-Shia divide, all the key actors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even compared to Afghanistan, the geopolitical implications and the threat to global stability are profound. It's the most dangerous of all crises."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an address to the United Nations security council on Thursday, Guterres said there had "not been an inch of progress towards a political solution".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on that to the Guardian, he said: "It is of enormous frustration that we have come to such a situation in global governance that nobody can address it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diplomacy on Syria has failed to bridge a yawning divide in views on what has fuelled the crisis and how best to deal with it. Russia and China, two permanent members of the security council, have blocked moves towards more robust support of the opposition in Syria. The US and Europe have attempted to impose ever-tougher sanctions on the Assad regime, but have baulked at arming the opposition because of concerns about the influence of al-Qaida groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I lived in a bi-polar world," said Guterres. "Until the war in Iraq, I witnessed a unipolar world with one single superpower. Now we are in a clearly established multi-polar world. New actors have emerged – the Brics: China, Russia, Brazil, India. There is no longer a clear set of power relations. There is no way to bring about consensus among global players, or to bring about common action. There is no capacity to produce any solution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN appeals for aid to Syria remain desperately under-funded with some agencies, including Unicef, reporting a shortfall of more than 70%. The crisis was eased somewhat on Thursday when Kuwait transferred $300m to the UN for Syria relief. "[It] will be distributed across all of our institutions," said Guterres. The Kuwaitis are the only country of the Gulf that has honoured its promise through the multilateral aid organisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can now put some money up front in Syria, but we are all in big trouble. Most of the western countries have huge budget difficulties. Moving towards 3 million refugees, there is no way that this can be dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The system is at breaking point.

Goody died in 2009 and Brazier was contacted by the police in late 2011 and found that a number of details about his private life appeared in a file prepared for the News of the World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eighth person to settle was James Perring, a close friend of Davina McCall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The event, named the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games, will mark exactly one year since the London 2012 opening ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organisers insisted the website had not crashed but had slowed to a crawl amid huge demand for tickets that is likely to have left many would-be purchasers disappointed – another echo of the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickets remain available for the IPC International Challenge, featuring 14 of Britain's 16 Paralympic medallists, on Sunday 28 July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Athletics sees the event as crucial in maintaining the enthusiasm for the sport engendered by the Games and the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) hopes that it will showcase how the redevelopment of the park is progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event is likely to be the only time that the stadium is filled to capacity this summer, after the LLDC admitted this week it was unlikely to hold any pop concerts there before closing it for almost three years for redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will reopen in 2016 after a £160m refit as a multi-sport venue suitable for both football and athletics, with &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/mar/22/west-ham-tenants-olympic-stadium" title=""&gt;West Ham due to move in as the main tenant&lt;/a&gt;. UK Athletics will be able to use the stadium for 20 days a year and the athletics world championships is due to be held there in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/apr/17/usain-bolt-olympic-stadium-diamond-league" title=""&gt;Bolt will make more than £20,000 a second&lt;/a&gt; when he returns to London this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jamaican is understood to be receiving his standard Diamond League fee of around $300,000 a race to appear in the 100m and the 4x100m on the track where he won three gold medals last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chancellor agreed in last month's budget to a one-off exemption allowing Bolt and other international athletes appearing at the event to avoid tax rules that, said his agent, would have meant Bolt was in effect paying to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax break, as well as the likelihood of selling out all three days of competition, has enabled organisers to assemble a lineup including 29 Olympic medal-winners, 12 world champions and four world record holders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other overseas star names include the 100m hurdles Olympic champion Sally Pearson, sprinter Carmelita Jeter and men's 400m champion Kirani James. The women's 400m gold medallist Sanya Richards-Ross will renew her rivalry with Christine Ohuruogu, whom she beat into second place at the London Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK Athletics has signed up all five British track and field medallists, including Farah, Ennis and Greg Rutherford, for the London Grand Prix. Fourteen of Great Britain's 16 Paralympic medallists have also signed up, with the notable exceptions of David Weir and Hannah Cockroft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics-2012"&gt;Olympic Games 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics-2012-athletics"&gt;Olympics 2012: athletics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/paralympics-2012-athletics"&gt;Paralympics 2012: athletics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympic-stadium"&gt;Olympic Stadium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/athletics"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/olympic-legacy"&gt;Olympic legacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owengibson"&gt;Owen Gibson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said it was "absolute nonsense" that adults who worked with animals as veterinary assistants needed better qualifications than those working with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of our biggest problems is that too many of the workforce are underqualified and there is far too much regional variation," he said. "We demand more from those who work with animals – they need at least five good GCSEs. There isn't the same insistence for early years providers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilshaw said care in poorer areas was particularly patchy, despite the millions spent by the Labour government on Sure Start centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to address this problem urgently. We all know from the research that children's early years are a period of rapid development and vital for building a secure foundation for future personal and academic success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Elizabeth Truss, the early years minister, announced that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2013/jan/29/nursery-staff-childminders-restrictions-lifted" title=""&gt;nurseries and childminders would be able to take on more pre-school children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childminders are currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member between the ages of one and five. In future, they will be able to look after four children, two of which can be aged under one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilshaw added that he wanted to stop failing nurseries from renaming themselves and reopening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Andy Goodwyn, head of the University of Reading's institute of education, said early years workers did not need a tougher inspection regime, but a period of stability to build on their skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It needs to become an attractive and high-status sector that can attract graduates who can see a real career path … The last thing it needs is more threats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/ofsted"&gt;Ofsted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/earlyyearseducation"&gt;Early years education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicashepherd"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The kidnapping came six weeks after France launched a military intervention in Mali to fight Islamist groups who had taken over a swath of the north after a coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollande told a news conference on Friday that secret talks had been taking place over several weeks to secure the hostages' release. He denied any ransom had been paid. "France has not changed its position, which is not to pay ransoms," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the former US ambassador to Mali, Vicki Huddleston, had claimed that France in recent years had &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/08/us-france-hostages-idUSBRE9170UQ20130208" title=""&gt;paid millions of dollars in ransoms&lt;/a&gt; in the Sahel that had ultimately funded the al-Qaida-linked militants its troops were fighting in Mali. French officials denied ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollande said: "I spoke to the father this morning … He told me how happy and relieved he was. This is an immense relief. This will redouble our determination to free the hostages who remain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight French hostages are still held by al-Qaida-linked groups in the Sahel region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/25/youtube-french-family-kidnapped-cameroon?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;a video surfaced showing a man who appeared to be Moulin-Fournier&lt;/a&gt;. The man said his family was being held by Boko Haram, which wanted its members freed, especially women and children held in Nigerian and Cameroonian custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has been waging a campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria's north. It has been held responsible for more than 790 deaths last year and dozens more since January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, the man said his family was not doing well in captivity.

The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/16/measles-outbreak-5000-children-risk" title=""&gt;city is at the centre of a major outbreak &lt;/a&gt;of the highly infectious disease, and the fatality – if the cause is confirmed – would be the first UK death from measles since 2008. Seventy-seven people have needed hospital treatment during the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 800 cases, many among 10- to 18-year-olds, have been reported since November, and numbers are rising steadily and spreading north from the south of the country despite health authorities organising special immunisation clinics at hospitals and schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man is being named locally as Gareth Williams. His body was found in a flat in the city on Friday. His death is not being treated as suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials have repeatedly warned parents of children who had not had the triple measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to arrange vaccination for them "as a matter of urgency".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/apr/17/measles-outbreak-mmr-jab" title=""&gt;One local head told the Guardian this week&lt;/a&gt; that he was concerned by a lack of response by some parents to a special clinic at his school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said on Fri it was aware of a death being investigated by the Swansea coroner. She added: "A diagnosis of measles has not yet been confirmed. Testing the deceased for measles is forming part of the investigations being overseen by the coroner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My sympathies are with the family at such a tragic time. Whatever the cause of death in this case, we should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths in Wales. Measles is a potentially fatal disease and around one in every 1,000 people who contracts measles in developed countries will die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that those not fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR were likely to catch measles, which is highly contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that there are unprotected people in all age groups but we have particular concerns about the 10-to-18 age group," she said. "The MMR vaccine is recommended by the World Health Organisation, UK Department of Health and Public Health Wales as the most effective and safe way to protect children against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The alarming numbers of cases of measles and continuing spread of the disease in Wales illustrates how vital it is for parents to get their children vaccinated. Symptoms of measles include fever, cold-like symptoms, fatigue, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red-brown rash that appears a few days into the illness. Anyone who thinks they or their child may have measles should speak to their GP immediately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/infectiousdiseases"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/mmr"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/wales"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/vaccines"&gt;Vaccines and immunisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"These allegations are politically motivated and I will fight them in the trial court, where the truth will eventually prevail," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president, who seized power in a coup in 1999 before being harried out of the country in 2008 by his opponents, faces several court challenges, including claims of conspiring to assassinate Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, by not providing her with enough security, and for ordering the killing of an important separatist tribal leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Friday's court hearing stems from the fury of Pakistan's lawyers and judges over his arrest of the senior judiciary during the dying days of his rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He returned to Pakistan last month after he was granted pre-arrest bail. It was repeatedly extended, until Thursday when a judge delivered a scathing judgment that said Musharraf's move against the judges in 2007 was an act of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the judge ordered him to be arrested, he was able to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/pervez-musharraf-flees-court-avoids-arrest" title=""&gt;march out of the Islamabad high court to a waiting armoured vehicle&lt;/a&gt; that whisked him to his luxury farmhouse, originally conceived of as a retirement home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, one of Musharraf's lawyers said he would seek to overturn the arrest by appealing to the supreme court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest is an extraordinary humiliation for the former army chief whose return to Pakistan from his home in exile in Dubai last month has turned into a debacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has received scant support from the public or any of the leading political parties in his bid to get elected in next month's historic polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His dream of re-entering politics has been crushed by election officials who ruled he was ineligible to stand for any of the four seats for which he applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts believe the country's powerful military establishment does not wish to see former high-ranking members tried in civilian courts and will try to intervene to help him. Others are not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the army was in favour of Musharraf returning and tried to dissuade him," said General Hamid Khan, a former senior army commander.

Ofsted figures show that since August up to 243,400 children were being cared for by nurseries, childminders and pre-schools that were not considered good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two-fifths of early years educators were judged no better than satisfactory at their last two inspections, and more than one in 10 had dropped a grade, according to the watchdog's annual report in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Wilshaw's proposals, to be published for consultation on Friday, Ofsted will consider only a rating of good or outstanding to be acceptable from September. The satisfactory judgment will be scrapped and replaced by "requires improvement", a change already implemented at school inspections in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurseries and pre-schools that are judged to require improvement will face more inspections and have up to four years to raise standards. If they are not rated good after two inspections they are expected to be considered inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate nurseries and pre-schools that fail to improve could face having their registration cancelled, in effect closing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilshaw was expected to say: "Parents, whatever their circumstances, want their children to access good-quality childcare and get a good early education that sets them up well for statutory schooling. Yet too many providers are not good enough, particularly in the most deprived areas. We must be tougher on weak settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From September 2013, nurseries and pre-schools judged less than good will need to improve rapidly. I want the new designation of 'requires improvement' to act as a catalyst to get all early years providers to good as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll encourage providers that are good or outstanding to support weaker settings. We know that the best schools are joining forces and we anticipate that this will happen in the early years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofsted said it was considering plans for inspection of childminder agencies, and had not yet made proposals about early re-inspection of childminders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jan/17/ofsted-satisfactory-rating-scrapped" title=""&gt;satisfactory rating used by inspectors for school inspections was scrapped&lt;/a&gt;, and replaced with requires improvement, a move Ofsted said was intended to raise standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools judged to require improvement at two consecutive inspections, and which were still not providing a good education at the third, were more likely be placed in special measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move caused upset among headteachers as it was likely to leave more schools in special measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultation on the latest proposals closes on 24 May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/ofsted"&gt;Ofsted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/childcare"&gt;Childcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/earlyyearseducation"&gt;Early years education&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Several firefighters were missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities warned that the number of victims could rise. "It's going to take time before we can say that everyone is accounted for," said Jason Reyes of the Texas Department of Public Safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast occurred at about 7.50pm local time on Wednesday night, when the town's small team of volunteer fire-fighters were tackling a blaze at the West Fertiliser Company plant. "It was a like a nuclear bomb went off," said the mayor of West, Tommy Muska. The explosion registered as a 2.1 magnitude seismic event, and was felt for miles around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said on Thursday night that 14 people had died in the blast. Reyes said: "We are still in the search and rescue phase, looking for individuals." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition of some of the buildings destroyed or severely damaged in the blast made it impossible to calculate accurately the number of fatalities, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the victims who died in the blast was named as Kenny Harris, an off-duty fireman, who lived locally and worked in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is thought that the blast was caused when a tank of fertiliser exploded. Official records showed that up to 54,000lbs of anhydrous ammonia were stored at the plant, and that it was fined twice in recent years for various deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities were in the process of evacuating residents, including a nearby nursing home, when the explosion happened. It is thought that some 50 to 75 properties were damaged by the blast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the buildings hit was an apartment complex. DL Wilson, a spokesman for the Texas Public Safety Department, told Reuters that it had been reduced to "a skeleton standing up". A middle school in West was also badly damaged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, spoke of seeing "utter devastation" in West after touring the site by helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Immediately next to the explosion are railroad tracks. They were basically fused together," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the other side was a playground. I have no idea if anyone was playing there at that time, what I can tell you was on that playground was utter devastation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shell of the wrecked apartment complex, he said, "looked like it was a bombing site like you'd see in Baghdad. It was utterly destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also spoke of seeing two wrecked schools, one with its gymnasium roof imploded. "Had this explosion taken place in school hours there would have been mass devastation of children. Thank God that did not happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he added: "You can see hope in the eyes of the rescue workers. You can see already the community working to get itself back together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was evidence of damage all over the town, which is known locally as West-comma-Texas, to avoid confusion between this central-state town and the geographical location of west Texas. It has about 2,800 residents, many of Czech heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Nors said he felt the blast at his home, five miles away. "The first thing that went into my mind was a nuclear bomb," he told the Guardian. "I was standing in my garage flipping meat on the grill. The shock wave felt like somebody hit me in the gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shivering from the cold as he stood outside the family's restaurant, Nors Sausage and Burger House, Nors said his sister had had a lucky escape. She lived within 500 yards of the blast. "I haven't seen the house but supposedly it's demolished," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nors said residents of West, which depends heavily on the agriculture industry, had never considered the potential danger of living so close to the plant. "It's never been a concern. This was never even a thought, an issue," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father, Bernie, said that he knew four firefighters who were believed to have been killed. "They were fighting the fire when it blew up." He saw the explosion from his home four miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick Perez was playing basketball at a nearby school when the fire started. At first, the basketball players thought little of the blaze, but after half an hour, the smoke changed colour, he told the Associated Press. Then the blast came, and he was thrown to the ground. "The explosion was like nothing I've ever seen before," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing outside The Village Shoppe clasping a broom, Joyce Beaubien worried that she had not been able to make contact with a friend and former neighbor who works at the plant. "I haven't been able to get in touch with her," Beaubien said. "It's really devastating for a little town like this where nothing ever happens – except sometimes a person might get a little drunk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debby Marak, 58, a teacher, told AP that she was in her car when the plant exploded. "It was like being in a tornado. Stuff was flying everywhere. It blew out my windshield. It was like the whole earth shook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Calvin, fire chief of nearby Navarro Mills, said his son Perry had been one of the first volunteers to respond to the call for assistance and had been missing since just after the explosion. Perry had been taking an emergency medical training class at the nursing home across the street from the plant when the group received the call. "We don't know anything yet," Calvin said. "We just know that he's missing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) confirmed that it had fined the plant's owners $2,300 in 2006 for failing to have in place a risk management assessment that met federal standards. An EPA official said: "They certified that they had corrected the deficiency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A later emergency plan, submitted by West Fertiliser Company to the EPA and seen by the Dallas Morning News, stated that up to 54,000lb of anhydrous ammonia was stored on the site. But it said that there was no risk of fire or explosion, and that the worst-case scenario would be a short release of ammonia gas that would not cause any deaths or injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records reviewed by the Associated Press show the US pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $10,000 last summer for safety violations that included planning to transport anhydrous ammonia without a security plan. An inspector also found the plant's ammonia tanks were not properly labeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last visit to the plant by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which ensures workplaces are safe for America's 7 million employees, was in 1985 when it noted one serious violation and two other violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas attorney general Greg Abbot told reporters at an afternoon press conference in West that it was too early to talk about whether anybody might be held criminally negligent for the blast. "Our focus right now is on trying to help the families who were affected by this," he said. "We'll have to leave to another day issues such as [this]"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he warned that legal action would be taken against any businesses that pushed up prices illegally. "If anyone tries to profiteer off this tragedy by hiking up prices for basic needs and necessities, they will be facing the wrong end of a lawsuit from the Texas state attorney general," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, who was preparing for a prayer service in Boston for the victims of the marathon bombings, sent a message of condolence to West. "A tight-knit community has been shaken, and good, hard-working people have lost their lives," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blocks surrounding the plant remain closed off. Emergency workers continued a search and rescue operation, scouring the rubble for survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas-fertiliser-plant-explosion"&gt;Texas fertiliser plant explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/epa"&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tom-dart"&gt;Tom Dart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams"&gt;Matt Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/richardluscombe"&gt;Richard Luscombe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sometimes they only inform the NDS minutes before the operation," Faizi said. "They are conducting operations without informing local authorities and when something goes wrong it is called a joint operation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these groups was involved in a battle with insurgents in a remote corner of eastern Kunar province in early April &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/07/diplomat-killed-afghan-suicide-bombing" title=""&gt;that left several Afghan children dead&lt;/a&gt;, Faizi said. Karzai has fired the provincial head of intelligence in connection with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US citizen who died during the battle was advising the Afghan intelligence service, and the airstrike that killed the children is believed to have been called in after he was fatally injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US embassy declined to comment on CIA issues, but sources with knowledge of the battle said he was an agent, and his name has not been released, usually an indication of intelligence work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Woodward in his 2010 book Obama's Wars described a &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/how-the-cia-ran-a-secret-army-of-3000-assassins-2087039.html" title=""&gt;3,000-strong Afghan militia working for the CIA&lt;/a&gt;, and Faizi said the Afghan government had little information about the teams. "There is a lack of clarity about their numbers and movement," he said when asked how many men the CIA had on their payroll, or where these large teams might be based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodward said the unofficial commando units were known as counter-terrorism pursuit teams, and described them as "a paid, trained and functioning tool of the CIA", authorised by President George W Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were sent on operations to kill or capture insurgent leaders, but also went into lawless areas to try to pacify them and win support for the Afghan government and its foreign backers. Woodward said the units even conducted cross-border raids into Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Kunar battle, Karzai has also ordered his security officials to step up implementation of a presidential decree issued in late February &lt;a href="http://president.gov.af/en/news/17849" title=""&gt;abolishing "parallel structures"&lt;/a&gt;. Faizi said this order was aimed primarily at dismantling CIA-controlled teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The use of these parallel structures run by the CIA and US special forces is an issue of concern for the Afghan people and the Afghan government," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Karzai the move is another step towards reasserting Afghan sovereignty, part of a long campaign waged against US forces and their allies. He has already &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/24/us-handover-afghan-prisoners-pressure-uk" title=""&gt;won control of the main US-run prison in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/08/afghanistan-us-night-raids" title=""&gt;ended unilateral night raids on insurgent hideouts&lt;/a&gt; that coalition commanders once described as critical to the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Karzai's move comes at a critical time for an already volatile relationship, when Washington and Kabul are trying to negotiate what, if any, military presence the US will have in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and curbing the CIA's reach could strike at the heart of US strategic interests there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama has been clear that the US does not plan to fight the Taliban after next year. Instead some foreign troops will train Afghan soldiers to fight the insurgency while US special forces pursue groups such as al-Qaida hiding along the lawless border with Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the US is expected to keep a few thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, bolstered by troops from Nato allies, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/25/us-forces-afghanistan-local-troops-john-allen" title=""&gt;Obama has also made clear there is "zero option"&lt;/a&gt; of a complete US withdrawal, as happened in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hamid-karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cia"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/emma-graham-harrison"&gt;Emma Graham-Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Met said in an earlier statement: "The man from Berkshire was interviewed under caution on suspicion of sexual offences after attending south London police premises by appointment. On 24 November 2012 officers had executed a search warrant at an address in Berkshire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is understood that Harris was arrested last month but not charged with any offence. He has been bailed until May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainer, made a CBE in 2006 and Officer of the Order of Australia in the Queen's birthday honours last year, had been named in blogs and social media but not by mainstream media until Friday. Harris, one of 12 people arrested under Operation Yewtree, has made no public comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Harris's arrest in March days before his 83rd birthday, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: "An 82-year-old man from Berkshire was arrested by officers on Operation Yewtree on suspicion of sexual offences. He has been bailed to a date in May pending further inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The individual falls under the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are individuals who have come to police attention as part of the Operation Yewtree investigation into Jimmy Savile but whose alleged offences are not connected to Savile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris's hits include Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport and a version of Stairway to Heaven, and he painted an official portrait of the Queen for her 80th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several high-profile figures have been arrested in connection with the investigation including the PR consultant Max Clifford, the comedian Freddie Star, the radio DJ Dave Lee Travis, the former TV producer Wilfred De'Ath and the comedian Jim Davidson. They all deny any wrongdoing and De'Ath was released without charge last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vikramdodd"&gt;Vikram Dodd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-second amendment," said Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet campaign disclosures show the group were also direct recipients of gun cash. The &lt;a href="www.nra.org"&gt;National Rifle Association&lt;/a&gt; alone has given $800,000 to 40 of the senators who voted against the amendment since 1990, much of it in the run-up to the last election, according to &lt;a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/12/18/nra-and-congress/"&gt;Sunlight Foundation figures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information for the period since the Newtown school shooting is harder to come by because many quarterly filings due out on Tuesday have been delayed by the suspected ricin attack on members of Congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArPk5ytuH-tfdHdEN1JCTEVvWmE4S3lyVjItamhCTFE&amp;output=html"&gt;Guardian analysis&lt;/a&gt; of the data available so far for 2013 reveals that some groups have continued to be active outside the election cycle – including &lt;a href="http://www.scifirstforhunters.org/advocacy/pac"&gt;Safari Club International&lt;/a&gt;, a pro-hunting organisation which gave $1,000 to Senator Coats on 29 March, according to the filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Documents also show the NRA saw a surge in donations to its lobbying arm in the months following Newtown – registering a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/15/gun-lobbyists-nra-newtown-shootings-figures"&gt;record $2.7m in cash&lt;/a&gt; during January and February. Further disclosures showing the scale of its recent donations, particularly to politicians in the House of Representatives, are expected on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://gunowners.org/"&gt;Gun Owners of America&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nationalgunrights.org/"&gt;National Association for Gun Rights&lt;/a&gt; – two groups seen as more conservative than the NRA – have also been active in the Senate, giving $9,000 and $5,000 respectively to Ted Cruz, one of the leaders of Republican opposition to the amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others to receive arms-related donations recently include &lt;a href="http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandCmteFilingsPDFDownload.do?imageNumber=13020161431&amp;pdfURL=http://images.nictusa.com/pdf/431/13020161431/13020161431.pdf"&gt;Senator Richard Burr&lt;/a&gt; of North Carolina, who received $1,000 on 4 March from BAE Systems, a British defence group that &lt;a href="http://www.baesystems.com/capability/BAES_030661"&gt;manufacturers ammunition&lt;/a&gt;, although mostly for military purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more relevant donations do not come explicitly from gun campaigners. Senator Jeff Flake, a crucial swing voter from Arizona who turned against gun control at the last minute, received $5,000 in 2012 from The Madison Project, a right-wing campaign group that lists gun rights as one of its top priorities. On 9 April, it warned against Republicans such as Flake, who voted for the gun debate, and urged members to call these senators and "tell them that when the Bill of Rights reads 'shall not be infringed' with regards to the second amendment, it means exactly that".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the sums are relatively small they indicate the range of lobbying targets pursued by groups such as the NRA, which spent $8.5m before the last election on television ads and telephone drives. Far more money is spent on negative attack ads against politicians seen as weak on gun rights, than in favour of supporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of so-called 'dark money', or undisclosed expenditure, by the Sunlight Foundation shows the NRA was behind at least five TV ad campaigns against gun control since Newtown, targeting key swing states such as Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Keily, a campaign finance expert with Sunlight, said: "Keep in mind that the power of the NRA is to a considerable degree fear-based. So it's not just how much they've given to support a politician but how much they might give to oppose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such thinking may have influence the handful of Democrats, such as Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who voted against the amendment, says Keily. Pryor received $1,000 from the Safari Club before the last election, but none from the NRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only three senators who voted against the measure have not declared any donations from gun lobbyists – Democrats Mark Begich and Heidi Heitkamp and Republican Rand Paul – although 2013 quarterly data for Begich does not appear to have made it through the congressional mail backlog. Rand Paul was recently &lt;a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2013/04/gun-rights-group-with-close-ties-to.html"&gt;found to have close family ties&lt;/a&gt; to the National Association for Gun Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of groups in favour of gun control have also been spending money in recent months, including Michael Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns, but &lt;a href="http://reporting.sunlightfoundation.com/2013/whos-who-gun-fight-senate-corral/"&gt;analysis of its campaign funding&lt;/a&gt; shows it to be dwarfed by the NRA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NRA has also tightened the screws on senators in recent days by taking the unprecedented decision to award negative scores to anyone who voted for a motion allowing the gun debate to go ahead. These scores are widely used during elections to show adherence to the gun cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republican senators and the NRA both said they opposed the amendment on background checks because it would be a "slippery slope" to a national register of gun owners and would add burdensome delays and costs to gun purchases. They favoured measures to improve school safety and prosecutions of violent criminals instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the data &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArPk5ytuH-tfdHdEN1JCTEVvWmE4S3lyVjItamhCTFE&amp;output=html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control"&gt;US gun control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-senate"&gt;US Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nra"&gt;NRA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/democrats"&gt;Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/house-of-representatives"&gt;US House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts"&gt;Dan Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He was later allowed to return home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appearance on Friday came a day after Musharraf &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/pervez-musharraf-flees-court-avoids-arrest"&gt;fled court under personal guard&lt;/a&gt; moments after an order for his arrest was handed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday television footage showed Musharraf being escorted by uniformed police officers to an Islamabad court. A judge issued an arrest order for the former army chief on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qamar Afzal, Musharraf's lawyer, said Musharraf had voluntarily presented himself at the court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afzal said he had asked the court to order police to place Musharraf under house arrest at his residence rather than put him in jail. Musharraf returned to his residence after the brief hearing, Afzal added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This morning former president Pervez Musharraf surrendered before a judicial magistrate," Afzal, who accompanied to Musharraf to court, told the Reuters news agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lawyer for Musharraf, Ahmad Raza Kasuri, told Reuters that his legal team would file an appeal at the supreme court to try to overturn the arrest order later on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now I am going to the supreme court to file a petition against the arrest orders," Kasuri said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf, a former army chief who ruled Pakistan from 1999-2008, returned last month from nearly four years of self-imposed exile in the hope of running in next month's general elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his bid to run for office has been rejected by election officials and he has instead found himself battling a host of legal challenges relating to his years in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Similar demonstrations were seen in other cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as the protest peaked, the president, en route to Venezuela for the inauguration of Nicolás Maduro, ignored the proceedings and instead tweeted about her age. "Yes, I'm stubborn, and plus I am old, but it's actually lucky to reach old age isn't it?" the 60-year-old wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive turnout for the rally, organised via Facebook and Twitter, was fuelled by anger against judicial overhaul being pushed through Congress that could give the government virtual control of the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fernández administration has also been shaken in recent days by allegations that businessmen laundered tens of millions of euros obtained from public work contracts through offshore accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the legal moves are designed to prevent investigations into corruption and reverse a series of rulings against the government's attempt to dismember the Clarín media empire, which has been a staunch critic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Fernández criticised a court that declared unconstitutional essential parts of an overhaul of the press that would force Clarín to sell a large part of its cable assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It left me speechless, I thought there would be more decorum," she said, accusing the judges of "ruling in favour of those who pay for their trips and who knows what else", and repeating claims from her government that some of them had received favours from the media titan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarín has since hit back with a media campaign stating: "She has no limits, do you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes to the courts system proposes that judges be elected in Argentina's general elections on political party tickets, something critics say will make them subservient to political interests and reduces the power of the supreme court. Given the president's majority in Congress, it is likely the proposals will be made law before the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner"&gt;Cristina Fernández de Kirchner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest"&gt;Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ukigoni"&gt;Uki Goni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said the risk was "very big indeed" and that almost all investors and regulators were failing to address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/apr/17/why-cant-we-give-up-fossil-fuels" title=""&gt;carbon bubble&lt;/a&gt;" is the result of an over-valuation of oil, coal and gas reserves held by fossil fuel companies. According to a report published on Friday, at least two-thirds of these reserves will have to remain underground if the world is to meet existing &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal" title=""&gt;internationally agreed targets&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the threshold for "dangerous" climate change. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/09/why-havent-governments-solved-global-warming" title=""&gt;If the agreements hold&lt;/a&gt;, these reserves will be in effect unburnable and so worthless – leading to massive market losses. But the stock markets are betting on countries' inaction on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stark &lt;a href="http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital" title=""&gt;report is by Stern and the thinktank Carbon Tracker&lt;/a&gt;. Their warning is supported by organisations including HSBC, Citi, Standard and Poor's and the International Energy Agency. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/19/fossil-fuels-sub-prime-mervyn-king" title=""&gt;Bank of England has also recognised&lt;/a&gt; that a collapse in the value of oil, gas and coal assets as nations tackle global warming is a potential systemic risk to the economy, with London being particularly at risk owing to its huge listings of coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stern said that far from reducing efforts to develop fossil fuels, the top 200 companies spent $674bn (£441bn) in 2012 to find and exploit even more new resources, a sum equivalent to 1% of global GDP, which could end up as "stranded" or valueless assets. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/15/stern-review" title=""&gt;Stern's landmark 2006 report&lt;/a&gt; on the economic impact of climate change – commissioned by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown – &lt;a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/sternreview_index.htm" title=""&gt;concluded that spending 1% of GDP would pay for a transition&lt;/a&gt; to a clean and sustainable economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's governments have agreed to restrict the global temperature rise to 2C, beyond which the impacts become severe and unpredictable. But Stern said the investors clearly did not believe action to curb climate change was going to be taken. "They can't believe that and also believe that the markets are sensibly valued now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They only believe environmental regulation when they see it," said James Leaton, from &lt;a href="http://www.carbontracker.org/" title=""&gt;Carbon Tracker&lt;/a&gt; and a former PwC consultant. He said short-termism in financial markets was the other major reason for the carbon bubble. "Analysts say you should ride the train until just before it goes off the cliff. Each thinks they are smart enough to get off in time, but not everyone can get out of the door at the same time. That is why you get bubbles and crashes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Spedding, an oil and gas analyst at HSBC, said: "The scale of 'listed' unburnable carbon revealed in this report is astonishing. This report makes it clear that 'business as usual' is not a viable option for the fossil fuel industry in the long term. [The market] is assuming it will get early warning, but my worry is that things often happen suddenly in the oil and gas sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC warned that 40-60% of the market capitalisation of oil and gas companies was at risk from the carbon bubble, with the top 200 fossil fuel companies alone having a current value of $4tn, along with $1.5tn debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://johnmcfall.com/" title=""&gt;Lord McFall&lt;/a&gt;, who chaired the Commons Treasury select committee for a decade, said: "Despite its devastating scale, the banking crisis was at its heart an avoidable crisis: the threat of significant carbon writedown has the unmistakable characteristics of the same endemic problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report calculates that the world's currently indicated fossil fuel reserves equate to 2,860bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, but that just 31% could be burned for an 80% chance of keeping below a 2C temperature rise. For a 50% chance of 2C or less, just 38% could be burned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/10/carbon-capture-storage" title=""&gt;Carbon capture and storage&lt;/a&gt; technology, which buries emissions underground, can play a role in the future, but even an optimistic scenario which sees 3,800 commercial projects worldwide would allow only an extra 4% of fossil fuel reserves to be burned. There are currently no commercial projects up and running. The normally conservative &lt;a href="http://www.iea.org/" title=""&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt; has also concluded that a major part of fossil fuel reserves is unburnable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi bank warned investors in Australia's vast coal industry that little could be done to avoid the future loss of value in the face of action on climate change. "If the unburnable carbon scenario does occur, it is difficult to see how the value of fossil fuel reserves can be maintained, so we see few options for risk mitigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings agencies have expressed concerns, with Standard and Poor's concluding that the risk could lead to the downgrading of the credit ratings of oil companies within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Oman, senior vice-president at Moody's, said: "It behoves us as investors and as a society to know the true cost of something so that intelligent and constructive policy and investment decisions can be made. Too often the true costs are treated as unquantifiable or even ignored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jens Peers, who manages €4bn (£3bn) for Mirova, part of €300bn asset managers Natixis, said: "It is shocking to see the report's numbers, as they are worse than people realise. The risk is massive, but a lot of asset managers think they have a lot of time. I think they are wrong." He said a key moment will come in 2015, the date when the world's governments have pledged to strike a global deal to limit carbon emissions. But he said that fund managers need to move now. If they wait till 2015, "it will be too late for them to take action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pension funds are also concerned. "Every pension fund manager needs to ask themselves have we incorporated climate change and carbon risk into our investment strategy? If the answer is no, they need to start to now," said Howard Pearce, head of pension fund management at the Environment Agency, which holds £2bn in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stern and Leaton both point to China as evidence that carbon cuts are likely to be delivered. China's leaders have said its coal use will peak in the next five years, said Leaton, but this has not been priced in. "I don't know why the market does not believe China," he said. "When it says it is going to do something, it usually does." He said the US and Australia were banking on selling coal to China but that this "doesn't add up".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Grantham, a billionaire fund manager who oversees $106bn of assets, said his company was on the verge of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/apr/16/jeremy-grantham-food-oil-capitalism" title=""&gt;pulling out of all coal and unconventional fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;, such as oil from tar sands. "The probability of them running into trouble is too high for me to take that risk as an investor." He said: "If we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands, or other unconventional oil and gas then we're cooked. [There are] terrible consequences that we will lay at the door of our grandchildren."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels"&gt;Fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-emissions"&gt;Carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/coal"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gas"&gt;Gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/stern"&gt;Nicholas Stern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oil"&gt;Oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oilandgascompanies"&gt;Oil and gas companies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/stock-markets"&gt;Stock markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/damiancarrington"&gt;Damian Carrington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

By studying footage from the crime scene, he said, the FBI had concluded that the two were associated with each other, and that Suspect 2 put down a backpack at the site of the second explosion, just in front of the Forum restaurant, shortly before the blast occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following apparently planting the bomb, Suspect 2 walked west along Boylston Street and then disappeared from police sight. Video released by the FBI on its website showed Suspect 1 walking through the marathon crowd, followed by Suspect 2 about five paces behind. The two men do not talk to each other but do move in the same direction, both with bulky packs slung on their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the photographs, the two suspects are seen walking through the crowd of marathon spectators up Boylston Street, in the vicinity of Gloucester Street. Each suspect is the subject of four photographs: Suspect 1 is heavy set, wearing sunglasses and a black baseball cap with a white insignia in front; he is dressed in a white T-shirt and a knee-length dark coat and khaki-coloured trousers. Suspect 2 is thinner, with dark curly hair protruding from a white baseball cap placed backwards on his head. He is dressed in a grey hoody beneath a black coat and black trousers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both appear to be in their mid- to late twenties. Crucially, both are seen carrying a black backpack – &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/17/boston-bombs-pressure-cooker-investigation"&gt;the FBI has found fragments of such bags in the debris around the bomb site&lt;/a&gt; and has concluded that the pressure-cooker devices were carried in heavy backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DesLauriers stressed that the two men were armed and extremely dangerous, and warned the public not to approach them in any circumstances. But he also repeated his appeal for somebody to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For more than 100 years the FBI has relied on the public to be its eyes and ears," he said. "The public will play a critical role. Somebody out there knows these individuals as family, friends or neighbours. It may be difficult, but the nation is relying on the public to come forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of the suspect photos propels the hunt for the Boston marathon bombers into a new phase. DesLauriers said there would be no more media briefings for the foreseeable future, as the 1,000 FBI agents assigned to the chase would be focusing exclusively on apprehending the men. "Identifying and locating those responsible is now our highest responsibility. It continues to be an ongoing active investigation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DesLauriers stressed that he was aware of no further threats to the public. But the country remains jittery, with a spate of recent evacuations of public buildings including the federal courthouse in Boston on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DesLauriers appealed to the media to regard the two men in the FBI photos as the only suspects the agency was pursuing. The comment was made pointedly in the wake of a spate of inaccurate media stories, including reports of an arrest on Wednesday that were later discounted. The comment is particularly embarrassing for &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/new-york-post-boston-suspects-cover"&gt;the New York Post, which printed on its front page on Thursday pictures of two men it said the FBI was interested in&lt;/a&gt;. The men in the Post pictures were not those identified by the FBI as its only suspects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DesLauriers said the FBI had initially focused on a single suspect, having pored through thousands of hours of video and followed thousands of tips. But agents had eventually been led to a second suspect, who appeared to be associated with the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions"&gt;Boston Marathon explosions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime"&gt;US crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His artwork for the band also included the lonesome-looking cow on the cover of Atom Heart Mother, the burning businessman on the sleeve of Wish You Were Here, and the giant pig flying over Battersea power station on the cover of Animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidgilmour.com/" title=""&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, Thorgerson's family said he died peacefully on Thursday surrounded by family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He had been ill for some time with cancer though he had made a remarkable recovery from his stroke in 2003," the statement said. "He is survived by his mother Vanji, his son Bill, his wife Barbie Antonis and her two children Adam and Georgia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pink Floyd guitarist and singer Dave Gilmour said &lt;a href="http://davidgilmour.com/" title=""&gt;in a statement on his website&lt;/a&gt; that Thorgerson's artwork for the band had been "an inseparable part of our work".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "We first met in our early teens. We would gather at Sheep's Green, a spot by the river in Cambridge, and Storm would always be there holding forth, making the most noise, bursting with ideas and enthusiasm. Nothing has ever really changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He has been a constant force in my life, both at work and in private, a shoulder to cry on and a great friend. I will miss him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A statement on the official Pink Floyd website said: "We are saddened by the news that long-time Pink Floyd graphic genius, friend and collaborator, Storm Thorgerson, has died. Our thoughts are with his family and many friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/storm-thorgerson"&gt;Storm Thorgerson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/design"&gt;Design&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/art"&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/pinkfloyd"&gt;Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidbatty"&gt;David Batty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Survey finds that women and 16-20s are most vulnerable groups, and that internet has replaced streets as marketplace&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five recreational drug users in the UK has been taken advantage of sexually while vulnerable after alcohol or drug use. The finding is one of the starkest results from the &lt;a href="http://globaldrugsurvey.com/global-drug-survey-2013" title=""&gt;2013 Global Drug Survey&lt;/a&gt;, conducted in partnership with the Guardian, &lt;a href="http://www.mixmag.net/" title=""&gt;Mixmag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/" title=""&gt;GT magazine&lt;/a&gt;, which polled more than 7,000 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also suggests that the internet is starting to rival the backstreets as a place to buy illicit drugs, with 22% of users reporting they had bought drugs online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the extent to which drugs are apparently being used to take advantage of users will be of particular concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, 20% of drug users said they had been taken advantage of sexually after alcohol or drug use; in an answer to a separate question 14% said they had been given alcohol or drugs by someone they believed had the intention of taking advantage of them sexually; and 2.4% had said they had had sex without giving their consent as a result of being drugged without their knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey used "being taken advantage of sexually" as specific wording on its questions in this area to include behaviour ranging from sexual assault up to and including rape. The particular phrasing was used to avoid language which may cause distress in respondents, and also to avoid language relating to specific criminal offences, to try to gain accurate responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that both voluntary and involuntary drug use can leave users at significant risk of exploitation, and should be a significant factor in public health messages about drugs, according to &lt;a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/depts/addictions/people/profiles/DrAdamRWinstock.aspx" title=""&gt;Dr Adam Winstock&lt;/a&gt;, director of the survey and consultant psychiatrist and senior lecturer at King's College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being taken advantage of whilst under the influence of substances was surprisingly common in this sample," he said. "Our findings show that you don't need to have a drug or alcohol problem to experience drug-related harms and use often increases the risk amongst those already most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Intoxication can also impair a person's ability to give informed consent, remove themselves from a risky situation or to take safe sex precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 22,000 people worldwide completed the survey, which is conducted online. Participants are recruited via media outlets, including the Guardian, in different countries, so the sample is self-selecting and self-identified, but nonetheless gives an insight into the attitudes of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women were three times more likely to report sexual assault as a result of drug use than men, while younger respondents were at significantly more risk: 16- to 20-year-olds were twice as likely to have been taken advantage of sexually than 21- to 30-year-olds, and seven times more likely than those over 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winstock said the key message for those using recreational drugs was to be aware of the risk and look after others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results also highlight how drug use within intimate settings can increase your risk of both opportunistic and planned sexual assault," he said. "Friends really need to keep an eye on each other; they're in the best position to spot risk and steer mates way from situations where intoxication and isolation can make sexual assault more likely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have launched &lt;a href="http://drugsmeter.com/" title=""&gt;drugsmeter.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://drinksmeter.com/" title=""&gt;drinksmeter.com&lt;/a&gt; alongside the survey results to allow users to compare their drug use anonymously with 45,000 other people, and to receive further information about risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey showed &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/internet-drug-dealing-survey" title=""&gt;buying drugs online&lt;/a&gt; is becoming more mainstream. The &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/22/silk-road-online-drug-marketplace" title=""&gt;online marketplace Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; is notorious as essentially an eBay for drugs: law enforcement cannot trace the computers of sellers or buyers, and transactions are made with the anonymous and untraceable &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/video/2013/mar/22/bitcoin-currency-video" title=""&gt;online currency Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the survey suggests this is just the most visible aspect of a much wider phenomenon. Just under a third of respondents had heard of Silk Road, while 14% had set up an account on the site and browsed its wares. However, only 3% said they had themselves bought drugs from the site – although a similar number had taken drugs a friend had bought on Silk Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wider &lt;a href="http://www.kernelmag.com/features/report/2805/how-the-internet-is-changing-the-drug-trade/" title=""&gt;drug dealing online&lt;/a&gt; happens with less rigorous secrecy than Silk Road. Instead, it relies on obscure coded listings hidden among job adverts, private sales and suspiciously cheap properties to let: "flat for rent – £60 – ask for Charlie".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also highlight the risks of alcohol and tobacco, the two most commonly used legal recreational drugs. Just under 2% of people who had drunk alcohol in the last 12 months reported having sought emergency medical treatment as a result of their consumption, compared with 0.4% of cocaine users, 0.3% of ecstasy users, and 0.2% of cannabis smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol and tobacco were the drugs most people wanted to give up: 40% of smokers said they wanted to cut back, and 34% of drinkers said the same; among heroin users (albeit a small sample of just 65 users) only 26% said they wanted to consume less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside the report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Prescription addiction: this year's Global Drug Survey contained yet more evidence of a prescription drug misuse problem in the UK. More than half of those taking benzodiazepines (sleeping pills) said they had obtained them from a friend, not a doctor, while 35% said they had bought some from a dealer. Just under a third of benzoate users said they took the pills "to get high" – as did 20% of people taking codeine tablets, and 23% of people taking prescription opioids. 15% of people who had been prescribed these drugs in the last year said they had shared them, while 20% said they had taken at least one overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Drug driving: the UK is set next year to introduce roadside tests for drug use, alongside definitions of drug levels which "impair" driving and can lead to criminal prosecutions – but many drug survey respondents think police would be unable to tell if they were driving on drugs. Only 17% of respondents said police would "definitely" or "probably" be able to tell they were intoxicated if they were pulled over within two hours of smoking a joint of cannabis. The figure was similar for cocaine users, at 15%, but MDMA users were much likelier to think police would be able to tell: 41% said police would notice, against just 5% who thought they would not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Synthetic risk: so-called synthetic cannabis – herbs sprayed with chemical compounds which supposedly cause similar effects to cannabis – has not achieved anything like the popularity of its natural counterpart, but does have a small but growing user base, with just under 9% of respondents having tried it. However, those taking the drug may be running much higher risks than users of natural cannabis: while only 0.2% (1 in 500) of cannabis users reported seeking emergency medical treatment as a result of their drug use in the last 12 months, 2.2% (1 in 45) of synthetic cannabis users had done so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Not talking to Frank: despite a huge advertising push over several years, drug users still do not seem all that inclined to turn to government websites (such as &lt;a href="http://www.talktofrank.com/" title=""&gt;Talk to Frank&lt;/a&gt;) for advice on drug use. Asked where they would send a friend for information on drug use, only 2% of respondents suggested such websites. Telephone advice lines did somewhat better, at 9%, while local drug services managed 20%. Perhaps surprisingly, a third of survey respondents said they would recommend their GP for advice on drug use, but it was overwhelmingly friends and family, at just over 60%, that won out as the premier information source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Mystery white powder: around one in seven (14%) of respondents said they had, in the last twelve months, taken a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/15/truth-about-young-people-and-drugs?DCMP=EMC-thewrap08" title=""&gt;mystery white powder&lt;/a&gt; without knowing what it was – a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/mar/15/respondents-guardian-mixmag-drug-survey?DCMP=EMC-thewrap08" title=""&gt;similar level to last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the phenomenon was first examined. Among recent users of cocaine, speed or MDMA, this figure doubled to 28%. Alcohol was a huge factor contributing to people's willingness to try a mystery drug: 78% said they were intoxicated when accepting the powder. But perhaps most disturbingly for those worried about the consequences, 39% accepted the powder from a stranger or someone they did not know well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Supermarket-style pricing: drug dealers seem to be adopting a tactic born in the supermarket ready-meals market – tiered pricing. More than half of people who had bought MDMA pills said they had been offered "better quality" pills for a higher price – up to £20 a pill – and 64% elected to pay for the premium-quality offering. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/video/2013/apr/19/whats-in-my-cocaine-video"&gt;Cocaine users&lt;/a&gt; reported similar results: the typical price paid for cocaine was £50 a gram, but 65% of those who purchased were offered an upgrade, with an average price of £80 a gram. In this case, 60% of users elected for the pricier option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 19 April 2013. The original referred to benzoates where it should have said benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/drugs"&gt;Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/drugspolicy"&gt;Drugs policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesball"&gt;James Ball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Lagarde said she "vividly remembered" the chancellor coming to a meeting of European finance ministers and confessing that he was not proud of "carrying the biggest deficit in the room".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF had supported the government's attempt to tackle Britain's record peacetime budget deficit, but the backing had never been unconditional, Lagarde insisted. Despite suggestions from the Treasury that there was a split at the fund between pro- and anti-austerity factions, she gave full support to her chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who warned Osborne this week that he would be "playing with fire" if he continued on his present course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde said: "We have said that should growth abate, should growth be particularly low, then there should be consideration to adjusting by way of slowing the pace. This is nothing new. And this is still the position and one that has been very clearly articulated within the various departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we very much stand by that. Consideration should be given if growth weakens, and looking at the numbers, without having dwelled and looked under the skin of the British economy, as we will do in a few weeks' time under the article IV, the growth numbers are certainly not particularly good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time IMF officials arrive in Britain next month, the Office for National Statistics will have released growth figures for the first quarter of 2013. These will show whether the UK has slipped into an unprecedented triple-dip recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consensus among City economists is that the UK will next week narrowly avoid a third leg to the recession that began in 2008, but figures this week showing rising unemployment and lower high street spending have underlined the fragility of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's growth performance has consistently undershot both government and IMF forecasts. This week, the fund's half-yearly World Economic Outlook cut its prediction for UK growth to 0.7% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2014 – a 0.3 percentage point reduction in both years. Osborne said in the budget last month that he expected growth of 0.6% this year, rising to 1.8% in 2014. Output is still around 3% lower than it was when the recession began in the first quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What has changed is clearly the quality of the numbers. But I would not, and I don't think anybody in this institution would want to prejudge ahead of the article IV, because that is when we spend three, four weeks discussing, debating, exploring, understanding, trying to go really under the skin of the economy, and we will do that," Lagarde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osborne, who has already eased the pace of deficit reduction, is certain to resist any pressure from the IMF for a politically damaging U-turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde said the past year had seen the emergence of a three-speed global economy – those countries doing well, those on the mend and those that still had quite a distance to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, with strong interconnections, and uneven recovery, that three-speed recovery is not enough and what we need is a full-speed global economy." Lagarde said growth needed to be "solid, sustainable, balanced but also inclusive and very much rooted in green developments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF managing director said central banks were travelling in "uncharted territories" and would be more comfortable if they could return monetary policy to more normal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unconventional policies were required, Lagarde added, because interest rates were already low and there was "not much else at the moment to try to kickstart growth in economies, to lower long-term interest rates, and to actually provide that breathing space which the authorities have to use to actually deliver on their fiscal policies as well as their structural reforms".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde was also forced to answer questions about her own future. Next month she will appear before a French magistrate investigating an arbitration payment made to a former supporter of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy when she was finance minister in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde said there was "nothing new under the sun" and she was ready to be heard in the case, involving businessman Bernard Tapie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A date has been set. It will be at the end of May and I'll be very happy to travel for a couple of days to Paris, but it's not going to change my focus, my attention and my enthusiasm for doing the work that I do," she said at a news conference in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury was not commenting on Thursday night but is understood to believe the IMF stance, far from being critical, is consistent with its previous support for deficit reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Osborne's deficit strategy leaves him vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not since the dark days of 1976 has the arrival in London of the International Monetary Fund been so eagerly awaited. As Christine Lagarde made clear, her officials will pull no punches when they conduct next month's annual health check of the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, key differences between 2013 and 1976. For a start, the IMF will not be telling the government to adopt austerity but rather to ease up on the pace of deficit reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, Britain is not going cap in hand to the IMF for a loan. That means, finally, that George Osborne can politely tell Lagarde to take a running jump, which is what he almost certainly will do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, a duffing up by the IMF would still damage Osborne, who has relied on Lagarde to give him cover for his deficit-reduction strategy. The IMF wants countries to reduce their debt levels but believes spending cuts and tax rises cuts in spending and increases in taxes are more than usually potent when interest rates are low, banks weak and many countries are seeking to push through austerity programmes at the same time. Britain provides a textbook example of what happens: growth weakens and deficit reduction falters. &lt;strong&gt;Larry Elliott&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/budget-deficit"&gt;Budget deficit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf"&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christine-lagarde"&gt;Christine Lagarde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts"&gt;Public sector cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance"&gt;Public finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/larryelliott"&gt;Larry Elliott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Pakistan's former military dictator visibly shocked by ruling after returning from exile to 'save' the country in elections next month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former military dictator, beat a hasty retreat from an Islamabad courtroom on Thursday after a judge ruled he should be arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had barely finished reading out his denunciation of Musharraf when the former general fled the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf appeared visibly shocked as Siddiqui said Musharraf should be "taken into custody and dealt with in accordance with the law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid chaotic scenes in the small room, packed with lawyers – many of whom were standing directly in front of the judge's bench – Pakistan's former president stalked out of the building and was whisked directly to his fortified mansion on the edge of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no one apparently primed to arrest a man who returned to his homeland in March after four years of self-imposed exile, his bodyguards easily pushed their way through the many policemen milling around the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary getaway left Pakistanis wondering whether authorities would dare fulfil the court's orders to arrest a man who is still presumed to enjoy some protection from the military, an institution that has been somewhat weakened since Musharraf was its chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siddiqui had been considering a bail application in a case in which Musharraf is accused of illegally suspending and holding under house arrest senior judges during his desperate attempt to cling to power in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident has made Musharraf, a 69-year-old former commando, into a hate figure among Pakistan's feisty legal profession, some of whom had gathered in large numbers outside the court and shouted in jubilation: "Look who is running, Musharraf is running!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his written judgment, Siddiqui said Musharraf's short-lived attempt to usurp the power of judges in 2007 had spread "alarm in the lawyers' community and terror throughout Pakistan".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Moreover, this shameful act lowered the honour, prestige and status of the country in the eyes of the nations spread over the entire global face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday Pakistani TV stations replayed again and again the moment when a man who once enjoyed absolute power was bundled into a waiting armoured vehicle by his security team, some of whom stood on the car's running boards as it edged into the morning traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was taken to his "farmhouse", a purpose-built mansion in the expensive neighbourhood of Chak Shahzad that was supposed to serve as his retirement home, but which may yet be designated a "sub jail" where he could be kept under house arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hours after the court ruling, Musharraf remained unseen behind tall walls crowned with razor wire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of riot police clad in body armour quickly sealed off the road leading to his compound – a Mediterranean-style estate that boasts a swimming pool and jogging track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few dozen well-wishers, mostly volunteers for his All Pakistan Muslim League – a political party Musharraf founded in 2010 – gathered outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not accept the ruling of the court, they are just doing it to interfere with Pervez Musharraf's election campaign," said Haider Zeb Akhtar, an 18-year-old politics student standing at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf had successfully avoided his judicial tormentors for the last four years, living in London and Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He flew into Pakistan last month and announced plans to "save" the country only after his lawyers won him "pre-arrest bail" in the cases against him, ensuring that he could campaign for elections to be held on 11 May without being arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was always a risk given the antipathy of Pakistan's lawyers and the many cases against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as Thursday's case, there are other ongoing attempts to privately prosecute him for allegedly conspiring to assassinate the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and for killing a tribal separatist leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts believe the arrest order puts the military establishment, in particular the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, in an awkward position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The army has been anxious not to be seen to be meddling in civilian matters but is also thought to be concerned not to create any precedent for former high-ranking soldiers being tried in civilian courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Musharraf is not happy with Kayani because Musharraf knows all too well how powerful the army chief is," said Asad Munir, a retired brigadier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He knows that Kayani could have quietly told the judges that Musharraf was not be humiliated and hounded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munir said that although Musharraf had made a disastrous error in returning to Pakistan, he had been justified in fleeing the court, not least because of the risk from the country's "rowdy and violent" lawyers. "These rascal, hooligan judges are pandering to popular opinion in Punjab who want to see Musharraf behind bars," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way out of the predicament could be the supreme court. Yesterday Musharraf's judges attempted to lodge an appeal but their paper work was rejected. They will try again on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aasia Ishaque, a spokeswoman for the All Pakistan Muslim League, said Musharraf was prepared to answer to the law, but that the high court in Islamabad was clearly biased against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The order for him to be arrested is illegal so it is right for him to avoid arrest and go and seek legal remedy at the supreme court," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The media reports that say he fled from the court is completely untrue, the police themselves opened the gates to let his cavalcade leave."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the order is overruled by the supreme court, the episode caps a disastrous few weeks for Musharraf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His hopes of winning a seat in parliament were wrecked when the election commission ruled him ineligible to contest any of the four constituencies he had applied for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also admitted in a television interview to having authorised some CIA drone strikes against terrorists whilst he was leader, a remarkably casual reversal of his country's longstanding public denials of any involvement in the hugely unpopular secret air campaigning in the restless border areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But most of all a politician who is widely thought to have become bored and even lonely living abroad where he was increasingly seen as a man of merely historical interest, he has been ignored by his fellow countrymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The media's election coverage has barely mentioned Musharraf's campaign, focusing instead on politicians that have greatly eclipsed Musharraf in importance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After hyping his return and boasting of his large number of Facebook followers, fewer than 2,000 people came to greet him when he landed in Karachi – a feeble turnout by Pakistani standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/benazir-bhutto"&gt;Benazir Bhutto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jon-boone"&gt;Jon Boone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
