A Home Office spokesman said: "This is not the end of the road. We plan to seek leave to appeal. Meanwhile work will continue with Jordan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judges said they recognised that Qatada was regarded by the UK government as a danger to national security and understood that there was a general feeling that his deportation to Jordan to face trial was long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the legal principles that special immigration appeals commission had to apply are clear and well established. The fact that he is considered to be dangerous is not relevant to the application of these principles any more than it would be relevant if the issue was whether he should be deported to a country where he would be at risk of facing torture himself," said the appeal court ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling follows a one-day appeal court hearing earlier this month during which James Eadie QC, on behalf of the home secretary, argued that Siac – effectively Britain's anti-terror court – had "erred in law" and taken the wrong approach when it concluded that Qatada could not be sent back to Jordan because he would not face a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siac blocked Qatada's deportation in November on the grounds that there was a "real risk" that the retrial he would face for bombing offences dating back to 1998 – for which he has been convicted in absentia– in the state security court would be based on evidence obtained by torture from his co-defendants Abu Hawsher and Al-Hamasher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Siac judge, Mr Justice Mitting, said that the diplomatic assurances obtained by the home secretary, Theresa May, were insufficient to prove that torture-based evidence would not be admitted in any retrial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the risk remained until Jordan amended its code of criminal practice or there was a ruling by the Amman constitutional court that such evidence could not be used in a trial. The only other alternative was for the Jordanian prosecutor to prove "to a high standard that the statements were not obtained by torture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitting upheld the ruling by the European court of human rights last year that Qatada would face a "flagrant denial of justice" if he was sent back to Jordan to face trial. His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, has maintained there is "concrete and compelling evidence" Qatada's co-defendants were tortured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is at the centre of political debate over the future of human rights legislation in Britain. At its heart lies the clash between Britain's commitment to the rule of law and its abhorrence of the use of torture and the fate of a radical Islamist cleric who has been described by Spanish judges as "Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now 11 months since the home secretary told the Commons that "we can soon put Qatada on a plane and out of the country for good". The radical cleric who was released on bail with a 16-hour-a-day curfew to a London address after last November's Siac ruling was re-arrested and taken back into custody two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan police said they had seized a vast amount of propaganda material, including online and print publications, after searching his north London home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Home Office says it is pursuing a "twin track" approach to securing the deportation Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman. The battle in the courts is being matched by continuing talks with the Jordanian government to secure his return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abu-qatada"&gt;Abu Qatada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/special-immigration-appeals-commission"&gt;Special immigration appeals commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/theresamay"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/immigration"&gt;Immigration and asylum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/court-of-appeal"&gt;Court of appeal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/torture"&gt;Torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/european-court-of-human-rights"&gt;European court of human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/terrorism"&gt;Terrorism policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/extradition"&gt;Extradition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alantravis"&gt;Alan Travis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Instead, the definition should be "something that cannot be found on the web using Google". And include a trademark notification, the search giant added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council refused, and simply dropped the word from its list of new additions instead. "Google asked the Language Council to amend the definition of the word. Today we instead are deleting the word, marking our displeasure with Google's attempts to control the language," the council's director, Ann Cederberg, said in a &lt;a href="http://www.sprakradet.se/15922" title=""&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cederberg, clearly miffed at Google's search for brand immortality, said the dramatic step of deletion had only been taken after long email exchanges with Google's lawyers. "We have been trying for ages, but it has taken too long and too many resources," she said in &lt;a href="http://www.svd.se/kultur/sprakradet-stoppar-ogooglebar_8031624.svd" title=""&gt;an interview with SVD Kultur&lt;/a&gt;. "Google has not won anything on this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a verb, "google" has been part of the English language for a long time. One of its first uses in print came in January 2001 in the Telegraph-Herald of Dubuque, Iowa, when the city editor Amy Gilligan asked readers "Have you been Googled yet? It's the latest thing. I was just sitting here Googling myself, in fact." She also added, for those who wondered: "Don't worry. It's not a euphemism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the search engine was only just two years old then, and keen for all the publicity it could get. Now, it seems more picky about how it appears in languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One purpose of the neologisms list is to show how society and language development interact with each other.

Meanwhile, to borrow from the Private Eye cartoon strip, it's grim up north London, although east London ranked lowest overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ilford, on the eastern edges of the capital, was ranked as the ugliest for home decor, while Croydon in south London was worst for neighbourliness. Even west London, covering wealthy areas such as Chiswick, was in the bottom 10 for the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, people living in the north are happier than those living in the south, according to Rightmove's ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrogate did not rank highest on any individual measure, but came top by virtue of its residents feeling happy across a broad range of factors. &lt;a href="http://www.andrewjonesmp.co.uk/" title="Andrew Jones website"&gt;Harrogate MP Andrew Jones&lt;/a&gt; said: "I think it is about the sense of community in the town. It's also a very down to earth place. There are lots of really good businesses which have grown organically and sensibly with little boom and bust. Youth unemployment in Harrogate is only 2.5%."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one of Harrogate's most popular attractions, &lt;a href="http://www.bettys.co.uk/" title="Betty's website"&gt;Betty's cafe&lt;/a&gt;, manager Hazel Bone enthused about the town's delights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a lovely town with a really good feeling and atmosphere," she said. "There is a beautiful town centre with Victorian architecture, lovely attractions such as the Roman Baths, nice shops and lots of great places to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The town is well looked after and for me it has such a feeling of home that, having worked with Bettys for the past 18 years, I am finally moving here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the town of 74,000 is not without its drawbacks. Locals complain about poor rail links, crowded roads and problems with helping the growing number of elderly in the area. House prices are also a concern, with the average detached home now selling for about £380,000 and Georgian townhouses fetching significantly more than £1m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the centre of Stockport there was mild surprise that the area is the second happiest place in Britain. Landlord of the Chestergate pub, Stuart Pike, 49, said: "It's not bad I suppose – it's not a troublesome area and the people are pleasant, but it has no nightlife." Across the road, under the neon glow of the Plaza cinema, deputy manager Peter Johnson, 51, said he appreciated the location: "It's not far from the countryside, Manchester is only five or six miles away, and it's close to the airport. I love living here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger adults didn't quite agree. Michael Regan, 23, who lived in Stockport during his teenage years, said: "About all there is is a Megabowl and a McDonalds. It's been pretty hard hit by the recession too. You walk through the town centre and half the shops and pubs have closed down in the past five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But council leader Sue Derbyshire was upbeat. "It came as no surprise to me whatsoever to see that Stockport had been rated as the second happiest place in Britain to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stockport has a thriving business community, excellent transport links, offers high quality education, has an historic market and can boast some of the best tourist attractions in the region, including Bramall Hall and the air raid shelters. All of this will have greatly contributed to making Stockport such a happy place to live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining the reasoning behind the research, a spokesman for Rightmove said: "We felt that various house price index data reports say prices in a location have gone up/down etc, but don't actually tell real people whether that location would make for a happy place to live … which feels like quite important information when choosing somewhere to live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Rightmove had excluded locations where the sample size was fewer than 80, and grouped some locations by their postcode area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Britain's happiest places to live&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Harrogate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Stockport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Ipswich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Exeter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; St Albans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Kingston upon Thames&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; Bath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; Worcester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; Bromley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; Truro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Britain's unhappiest places to live&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; East London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Croydon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; East central London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Ilford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; South-east London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; Enfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; North-west London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; West London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.&lt;/strong&gt; Dudley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; North London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Rightmove.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/property"&gt;Property&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickcollinson"&gt;Patrick Collinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-norton"&gt;Jim Norton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The south-east is likely to see temperatures of 6C to 8C, but the average for April is 12C or 13C," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be some sunny spells around at times, and a few light snow flurries, especially in the east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High pressure will start to build across the UK, so there will be fewer snow flurries and more in the way of dry weather over Easter weekend, but it will remain very cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sunny spells might begin to thaw the snow, but winds from the east could cause more drifts. There are no real signs of warmer weather moving in at this time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But after writing two election manifestoes in 1997 and 2001, and serving as a minister for eight years, I now have to make a choice about how to give full vent to my ideas and ideals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Wednesday Ed Miliband said: "Having spoken to him a lot over the past few months, I know how long and hard he thought about this before deciding to take up the offer. I also know how enthusiastic he is about the potential this job provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As for us, we went through a difficult leadership contest but time has helped to heal that. I will miss him. British politics will be a poorer place without David. But his huge talents will be serving people around the world. I hope and believe that at some point in the future he can once again make a contribution to British public life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Blair said Miliband's move "shows the huge regard in which David is held worldwide. I'm sure he will do a great job. He is obviously a massive loss to UK politics. He was the head of my policy unit and then a truly distinguished minister in the government and remains one of the most capable progressive thinkers and leaders globally. I hope and believe this is time out, not time over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband, an MP since 2001, stunned the party by his decision to accept the post of president and chief executive of the &lt;a href="http://www.rescue.org/" title=""&gt;IRC&lt;/a&gt;, the New York-based humanitarian organisation. His decision will spark a byelection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends of Miliband told the Guardian he had decided to abandon British politics to end the "permanent pantomime" over his political relationship with his younger brother, who narrowly beat him to the Labour leadership in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter to Alan Donnelly, the chair of the constituency party, Miliband said: "After the leadership election, I felt I could be most helpful to the party on the front line, in South Shields and around the country, rather than on the front bench in parliament. I felt this gave Ed the space and at the same time the support he needed to lead the party without distraction. He has done so with real success, leading a united team that has taken the fight to the Tories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am very pleased and proud that our shared goal of making this a one-term government is achievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband, the elder son of Jewish immigrants whose family was split during the second world war, said he had always sought "to make a difference to the disadvantaged and vulnerable". The IRC did this on a daily basis and a large scale "for some of the most desperate people in the world". Its work represented the best of humanitarian innovation and ideals, said Miliband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The organisation was founded at the suggestion of Albert Einstein in the 1930s for those fleeing the Nazis, so given my own family history there is an additional personal motivation for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel that in doing this job I will be repaying a personal debt. It is a strong, innovative and inspirational organisation, with the potential to change lives and help shape the global conversation about the growing challenge of displaced people around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary, told the World Tonight on Radio 4 on Tuesday: "He just combined policy, good judgment, real concern, a knowledge of economics and an ability to tie things together. That is how he will be remembered. And that is why he why he will be a loss. But never say never. I wouldn't say goodbye to David Miliband forever in British politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One friend said: "David was always clear that it was time for him to make a decision this year about his future. The feeling was that if he came back into the shadow cabinet it would be a permanent pantomime. But equally if he did not come back, but remained in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party], it would also be a permanent pantomime. It was therefore not sustainable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband, whose wife Louise is an American violinist, had indicated that he would continue serving as an MP after losing the Labour leadership to his brother, Ed, in 2010. But he has felt for some time that he needed to make a decision on whether he could remain in the frontline of British politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One friend said: "We are facing an election that Labour can win. We need to remove anything that can get in the way of that. David owed it to Ed and to the Labour party to put an end to the endless speculation. He has made that call and shown what a big figure he is. It is very sad but he has done this in the best interests of the party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Straw, Miliband's predecessor but one as foreign secretary, told the World Tonight: "His abilities were legion. He has got a very, very sharp mind. He is very good at developing personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He is trusted and he made a big difference, particularly in that last three years of a Labour government under Gordon Brown, in helping to secure Britain's exit from Iraq, in winding down our responsibilities in Afghanistan and also helping to rebalance the British government's position in the world following all the traumas after 9/11 and our relationship with the Americans. So it is a very, very big legacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straw agreed with Mandelson that Miliband may have a future in British politics. "These days exiting from the House of Commons at one stage – he is only 47 – is not the end of his political life at all. He may feel after running the IRC that he wants to come back into British politics, and he will be welcomed back into the Labour movement if he does want to come back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straw said Ed Miliband would have mixed feelings. "I can't be inside in the relationship between Ed Miliband and his older brother David … But I guess that Ed will both be relieved that a decision has been made for him about what to do with David but also very sorry to see such a talent leave and what could have been a great partnership not be there for the immediate future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the IRC website, former US president Bill Clinton called Miliband "one of the ablest, most creative public servants of our time", while George Rupp, whom Miliband is succeeding, called him "an experienced world leader and a man of both action and character". He said Miliband's insights, ability and commitment would be tremendous assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She is at present chief of staff at the secret service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reputation of the service was badly damaged after &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/20/secret-service-scandal-columbia-agency"&gt;revelations in April last year&lt;/a&gt; about preparations for Obama's trip to Cartagena, Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secret service employees, part of an advance team preparing for Obama's arrival, took prostitutes back to the hotel where they were staying. The incident raised questions about a macho culture alleged to be pervasive inside the service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierson, 53, replaces Mark Sullivan, who retired last month after leading the agency for seven years. He faced heavy criticism on Capitol Hill over the Colombian scandal for which he apologised but insisted the president's safety had never been compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By appointing a woman, the White House sends a message that a macho culture will not be tolerated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal tarnished the image of an agency that had previously been based on the notion that gents were prepared to put their lives on the line to protect the president and others under their watch&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Obama, in his announcement, praised Pierson: "Over her 30 years of experience with the secret service, Julia has consistently exemplified the spirit and dedication the men and women of the service demonstrate every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on: "Julia has had an exemplary career, and I know these experiences will guide her as she takes on this new challenge to lead the impressive men and women of this important agency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as its protection duties, the secret service is also involved in criminal investigations, mainly in the field of counterfeiting, and has 150 offices across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierson, who is originally from Orlando and is a graduate of the University of Central Florida, began her career as a police officer in Orlando in 1980, joining the secret service in 1983 in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said: "Julia is eminently qualified to lead the agency that not only safeguards Americans at major events and secures our financial system, but also protects our leaders and our first families, including my own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/secret-service"&gt;Secret service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime"&gt;US crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill"&gt;Ewen MacAskill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So please allow me to begin my remarks this evening by reiterating how deeply I regret and apologise for the circumstances that led me to resign from the CIA and caused such pain for my family, friends and supporters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Robert B Barnett, has said Petraeus has been spending much of his time with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petraeus received applause and a standing ovation before he began the evening's program by cutting a cake, a task reserved for the highest ranking person in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retired four-star general's affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was discovered during an FBI investigation into emails she sent to another woman she viewed as a rival for his attention.&lt;br /&gt;At the time Petraeus told his staff he was guilty of "extremely poor judgment … Such behaviour is unacceptable both as a husband and as the leader of an organisation such as ours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the military leader credited with reshaping US counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus had expected a friendly audience at the ROTC dinner. Ahead of the speech Petraeus drew lavish praise from USC's president, CL Max Nikias, who called him "arguably the most effective military commander since Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our post 9/11 world General Petraeus's influence on our military is unmatched and his contributions to the CIA are far-reaching," Nikias said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/david-petraeus"&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cia"&gt;CIA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One persistent line of questioning raised the prospect that the court will sidestep a decision on the basis that the plaintiffs – the proponents of the gay-marriage ban – do not have legal standing to bring the case after the state of California declined to do so when the referendum result was overturned by a federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is regarded as the potential swing vote on this issue, raised the question of whether the court should even be hearing the case. He said the court may be entering "uncharted waters" by deciding on who has the right to marry, and wondered aloud why the justices had agreed to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wonder if this case was properly granted," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other justices also pressed questions that appeared to reflect scepticism about whether the supreme court should have taken up Proposition 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second case, over a federal law preventing the government from recognising same-sex unions, is to be heard on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A considerable amount of the questioning from the bench on Tuesday focused on whether the central purpose of marriage is procreation. Charles Cooper, legal counsel for four Californians seeking to uphold the results of Proposition 8, barring gay marriage in the state, told the court on Tuesday that the inability of same-sex couples to have children together meant that to allow them to wed would change the historic definition of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are saying the interest in marriage and the state's interest and society's interest in what we have framed as responsible procreation is vital. But at bottom, with respect to those interests, our submission is that same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples are simply not similarly situated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that position was met with deep scepticism and even derision from several of the justices. Sonia Sotomayor asked how permitting gay couples to marry interfered with procreation. She then pressed Cooper on whether his argument meant that sterile heterosexual couples should not be permitted to wed because they cannot have children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan leapt in. "Suppose a state said that because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licences anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55. Would that be constitutional?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper said it would not, but tried to suggest that age didn't matter. "I can assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage," Kagan said, to laughter from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg picked up on the theme, asking whether someone serving a life sentence in prison should be prevented from marrying because there is no possibility of them becoming a parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper struggled for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotomayor also pressed Cooper on whether it would be acceptable to discriminate against gay couples on grounds other than marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis for a state using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them? Is there any other rational decision-making that the government could make? Denying them a job, not granting them benefits of some sort, any other decision?" she asked. Cooper said he could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan pressed the lawyer on how allowing gay couples to marry possibly harms the state's interests, as it does not interfere with the right or ability of heterosexuals to procreate. Cooper responded that the real question is whether or not redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charge against arguments in favour of gay marriage was led by the conservative justice Antonin Scalia. "If you redefine marriage to include same-sex couples, you must permit adoption by same-sex couples, and there's considerable disagreement among sociologists as to what the consequences of raising a child in a single-sex family, whether that is harmful to the child or not. Some states do not permit adoption by same-sex couples for that reason," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg noted sharply that California already permits same sex couples to adopt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Anthony Kennedy said Scalia may have a point, but there was another interest to consider. "There's substance to the point that sociological information is new. We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury or what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some 40,000 children in California that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theodore Olson, counsel for opponents of the gay-marriage ban, said the referendum "walls off the institution of marriage" to gay people – something he said society does not have the right to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an individual right that this court again and again and again has said the right to get married, the right to have the relationship of marriage is a personal right. It's a part of the right of privacy, association, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalia challenged Olson to name the date when existing laws on barring gay marriage breached the constitution. "I'm curious. When did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868, when the 14th amendment was adopted?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson threw the question back by noting that interracial marriage was illegal in some US states until 1967, and asking when that prohibition became illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalia pressed the issue, asking whether the bar on gay marriage has always been unconstitutional. Olson said he could not give a specific date. "So how can I decide?" asked Scalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court also heard from the Obama administration, which sent the US solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, to the hearing. He faced questions over the government's position that California and other states which permit same-sex civil unions must go all the way and allow gay marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verrilli was asked if that was not unfair, in that it punished those states which have made some steps toward equality by forcing them to introduce a measure they may not want to, while the 30 states that have a total bar on gay marriage would not be obliged to make any change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solicitor general responded that the administration would like to see all states permit gay marriage in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Alito asked Verrilli if there is not a need to tread carefully with such a sensitive issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want us to step in and render a decision based on an assessment of the effects of this institution which is newer than cell phones or the internet? I mean, we do not have the ability to see the future. On a question like that, of such fundamental importance, why should it not be left for the people, either acting through initiatives and referendums or through their elected public officials?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verrilli replied that not doing anything also has an impact. "The argument here about caution is an argument that, well, we need to wait. We understand that. We take it seriously. But waiting is not a neutral act. Waiting imposes real costs in the here and now. It denies to the — to the parents who want to marry the ability to marry, and it denies to the children, ironically, the very thing that petitioners focus on is at the heart of the marriage relationship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the passions and expectations raised by the hearings, the court may yet sidestep the issue – precisely because it is so divisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the hearing focused on whether the four private individuals seeking to uphold Proposition 8 – originally five before one pulled out – had the authority to bring the case to the supreme court after the California state government decided not to defend the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper argued that referendums are designed to force politicians to fulfil the will of the people, and that if ordinary individuals cannot then seek legal redress, that gives those same politicians and officials a means to negate the vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If public officials could effectively veto an initiative by refusing to appeal it, then the initiative process would be invalidated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotomayor was sceptical. She asked what injury had been created to the four individuals who brought the case to the supreme court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper responded: "The question before the court, I would submit, is not the injury to the individual proponents; it's the injury to the state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Stephen Breyer described the plaintiffs as "no more than a group of five people who feel really strongly that they should vindicate the public interest".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginsburg wondered whether the court had "ever granted standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?" She questioned why, once the law is passed, it proponents should be granted any special status to see it enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proponents are interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's passed, they have no proprietary interest in it. It's law for them, just as it is for everyone else. So how are they distinguishable from the California citizenry in general?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sceptical questioning from the liberal justices hinted that they had doubts about whether the supporters of Proposition 8 should ever have made it so far as the supreme court. It remains to be seen whether they were persuaded by the arguments in court, and the much lengthier and more detailed written submissions, to take the next step and rule on whether Proposition 8 should stand or fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the supreme court will hear more arguments about the validity of another gay marriage case on Wednesday when they will consider whether Congress has the legal standing to fight to uphold the 1996 Defence of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex unions, when the Obama administration has repudiated the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights"&gt;Gay rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court"&gt;US supreme court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties"&gt;US constitution and civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chrismcgreal"&gt;Chris McGreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Police confirmed they "humanely destroyed" four of the dogs, whose remains will now be examined as part of the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breed of the dogs has not yet been confirmed but two are thought to have been bull mastiffs and two Staffordshire bull terriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superintendent Mark Kenny said it was "too early to speculate" about what had happened. "First and foremost, our thoughts are with the family of the girl who has tragically lost her life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I understand this is an extremely distressing incident for all concerned, including the community, and we will work hard to establish the full circumstances that led to this tragedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A "significant" police presence would remain in the area through the afternoon and evening, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will be there to carry out an investigation and address any concerns residents may have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident is likely to reignite the debate about control of potentially dangerous dogs. Four-year-old John Paul Massey was killed by a violent family dog at a home in Liverpool in 2009. Last November a week-old boy died after being bitten by his family's pet dog in Shropshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February this year, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/15/action-on-dangerous-dogs-woefully-inadequate" title=""&gt;MPs strongly criticised&lt;/a&gt; the government for "inaction" over dog attacks and poor animal welfare. A cross-party committee of MPs said current laws "comprehensively failed" to tackle irresponsible dog ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proposals published in February to introduce compulsory dog microchipping in England and extend the law so that owners could be prosecuted if their dog attacked an individual on private property, were "belated" and "woefully inadequate", according to the select committee on environment, food and rural affairs called for the environment department (Defra) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tory MP Anne McIntosh, who chairs the select committee, said Defra's proposals were too limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Home Office approach to tackling antisocial behaviour is too simplistic and fails to reflect the impact that poor breeding and training by irresponsible owners can have on a dog's behaviour," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"New rules should give enforcement officers more effective powers, including dog control notices, to prevent dog-related antisocial behaviour. Local authorities need to devote more resources to the effective management of stray dogs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Defra website there are about 8m dogs in the UK and "incidents involving dangerous dogs" are on the rise with eight children and six adults have been killed in dog attacks since 2005. Five of the victims were children under the age of four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legislation does not protect children in their homes or people who have to visit private properties such as healthcare, postal and professional utility workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/dangerous-dogs"&gt;Dangerous dogs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping"&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His decision will trigger a byelection in South Shields, where he has been MP since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Mandelson, the former business secretary led tributes to the "huge" contribution Miliband has made but said it would be wrong to write off his future in British politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandelson told the World Tonight on Radio 4: "He just combined policy, good judgment, real concern, a knowledge of economics and an ability to tie things together. That is how he will be remembered. And that is why he why he will be a loss. But never say never. I wouldn't say goodbye to David Miliband forever in British politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends of Miliband told the Guardian he had decided to abandon British politics to end the "permanent pantomime" over his political relationship with his younger brother Ed who narrowly beat him to the Labour leadership in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One friend said: "David was always clear that it was time for him to make a decision this year about his future. The feeling was that if he came back into the shadow cabinet it would be a permanent pantomime. But equally if he did not come back, but remained in the PLP [parliamentary Labour party], it would also be a permanent pantomime. It was therefore not sustainable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband had indicated that he would continue serving as an MP after losing the Labour leadership to his brother, Ed, in 2010. But he has felt for some time that he needed to make a decision on whether he could remain in the frontline of British politics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One friend said: "We are facing an election that Labour can win. We need to remove anything that can get in the way of that. David owed it to Ed and to the Labour party to put an end to the endless speculation. He has made that call and shown what a big figure he is. It is very sad but he has done this in the best interests of the party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former foreign secretary, whose wife Louise is an American violinist, has decided instead to embark on a completely different career by working for the International Rescue Committee (IRC) which provides emergency relief to victims of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband's successor as foreign secretary, William Hague, &lt;a href="http://www.rescue.org/blog/angelina-jolie-and-william-hague-visit-irc-programs-women-congo" title=""&gt;visited a displacement camp for victims of rape run by the IRC&lt;/a&gt; with Angelina Jolie in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Straw, Miliband's predecessor but one as foreign secretary, paid a warm tribute to him. Straw told the World Tonight: "His abilities were legion. He has got a very very sharp mind. He is very good at developing personal relationships. He is trusted and he made a big difference, particularly in that last three years of a Labour government under Gordon Brown, in helping to secure Britain's exit from Iraq, in winding down our responsbilities in Afghanistan and also helping to rebalance the British government's position in the world following all the traumas after 9/11 and our relationship with the Americans. So it is a very very big legacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straw added that all members of the parliamentary Labour party would be sorry. "This is hard. He has made this decision and I respect him for it although all of us in the PLP and in the wider Labour movement will be very sorry to see him go though we understand exactly why he has felt he had to make that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straw agreed with Mandelson that Miliband may have a future in British politics. "I agree with Peter Mandelson. These days exiting from the house of commons at one stage – he is only 47 – is not the end of his political life at all. He may feel after running the IRC that he wants to come back into British politics and he will be welcomed back into the Labour movement if he does want to come back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straw said Ed Miliband would have mixed feelings. "I can't be inside in the relationship between Ed Miliband and his older brother David … But I guess that Ed will both be relieved that a decision has been made for him about what to do with David but also very sorry to see such a talent leave and what could have been a great partnership not be there for the immediate future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Lammy, the former minister, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLammy" title=""&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: "David Miliband a big loss to PLP. Will miss him. Very loyal friend. The right decision however for him Louise and his two boys. Great new job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Farron, the president of the Lib Dems, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timfarron" title=""&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: "If this story is true, it's a big loss for parliament … David was a big thinker, great politician and a lovely man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

May's legal team submitted at a recent one-day hearing in London that he was a "truly dangerous" individual who escaped expulsion only through "errors of law". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) decided in November that Qatada could not be removed to Jordan, where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999. Siac judges said there was a "real risk" that evidence from Qatada's former co-defendants Abu Hawsher and Al-Hamasher, who were allegedly tortured, could be used against him at a retrial, breaching his human rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Fitzgerald QC, appearing for Qatada, now in his early 50s, defended the ruling, saying there was "concrete and compelling evidence" that Qatada's co-defendants were tortured.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fitzgerald argued there was "a real risk of a flagrant denial of justice" if Qatada was sent back to Jordan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But James Eadie QC, appearing for May, said the Siac decision should be quashed. He argued the Siac judges, chaired by Mr Justice Mitting, had taken an "erroneous" view of the position in Jordan and the legal tests that had to be applied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;aEdie said the Jordanian constitution "prohibits clearly and expressly the use of torture and the reliance on any statement obtained under duress, including torture". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no reason to believe that Jordanian judges would not take that into account. It was a matter for Jordan and Siac erred in blocking deportation, Eadie argued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday Lord Dyson, the master of the rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Elias will decide whether or not to allow May's challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qatada, who was living on bail at a London address, is back in custody after he was arrested for alleged breaches. A hearing over whether he should be granted bail was due to be held last Thursday but was delayed. Police searched the hate preacher's house before he was held. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, of the Metropolitan police, revealed last week that the hate preacher was being investigated over extremist material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abu-qatada"&gt;Abu Qatada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/torture"&gt;Torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jordan"&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It recommended only 403 of the 754 bathing beaches tested in 2012 as having excellent water quality – 113 less than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months of rain and flooding in many parts of the UK last year washed pollution from towns and cities, farms and sewers into the sea. Sewage and animal waste contains bacteria and viruses that can result in ear, nose or throat infections, and gastroenteritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Swimming in water that is subject to faecal pollution is associated with an increased risk of gastroenteritis," said Paul R Hunter, professor of health protection at the Norwich School of Medicine, University of East Anglia and editor of the Journal of Water and Health. "Faecal pollution in the water is measured by the presence of &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt; and enterococci, bacteria that comes from the guts of mammals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCS said that bacterial and viral pollution results in an "out of sight, out of mind mentality", because bathers cannot see the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCS coastal pollution officer, Rachel Wyatt, said action must be taken to reduce pollution from farms and populated areas. "With stricter bathing water standards from 2015 and summers that appear to be getting wetter, the iconic image of people bathing off golden beaches could be at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no simple solution to sewage and animal waste reaching our seas. However, if the water industry, communities and local authorities recognise that there is a problem and begin to work together to find answers then that would be a significant start."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MCS bases its findings on water samples collected by UK environment agencies and local authorities during the previous summer. These are tested for bacterial indicators that show the presence of pollution from sewage and animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year the MCS recommended fewer beaches in every English region, and in Wales and Scotland. The north-east, north-west and south-west of England, regions that were hit particularly hard by the wet weather, had the fewest number of recommended beaches for at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The north-east of England was the best-performing region in last year's guide, but this year only 31 out of 64 beaches were recommended for their excellent water quality – 22 less than 2012. Eight beaches failed to meet the minimum standard, compared with none in last year's guide. North-west England was the worst-performing region in England, with only three out of 37 beaches reaching the highest standard – the lowest number in the region for at least a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year 83 out of 124 beaches in the south-east of England obtained an excellent rating. With all of its beaches reaching the minimum standard, this was the region with the highest percentage of its beaches recommended this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South-west England was hit particularly hard by the wet weather and flooding of last year. After being one of the best-performing regions in the 2012 guide, this year only 110 of 196 beaches are recommended for excellent water quality. Sixteen beaches, including Plymouth Hoe East and West, Bude Summerleaze in Cornwall and Exmouth in Devon, failed to meet the minimum standard – 14 more than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year fewer beaches in Wales and Scotland were recommended for excellent water quality, while Northern Ireland has 15 out of 23 beaches recommended for excellent water quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Prof Hunter said that classifying a beach based on a single year's data was misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A single bad summer shouldn't really affect a single beach's classification, and it won't when the new bathing water directive has been fully implemented," said Prof Hunter. "But if you've got bad beaches consistently over four years, it's a bad beach full stop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-bathing/index_en.html" title=""&gt;EU bathing water directive&lt;/a&gt; is being replaced in 2015 with stricter rules that will also monitor water for the enterococci bacteria and classify beaches over a period of four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under the new directive you won't get these random variations in beaches that do or do not have blue flags that we've seen over the last 10 years, and hopefully that will be more useful and understandable to people," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/06/uk-beaches-dirtiest-decade?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;In November 2012, figures released by the Environment Agency&lt;/a&gt; showed that the UK's beaches were the dirtiest in a decade, with two in five failing national standards for pollution. The wet weather and washout summer were blamed for the surge in sewage, farm and city waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May, after &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jun/07/drought-risk-wet-weather-rain" title=""&gt;early warnings of drought and a hosepipe ban&lt;/a&gt; gave way to heavy rains, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/03/rain-water-quality-uk-beaches?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;raw sewage was flushed into coastal waters&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the bathing season. One-third of the 750 beaches tested for the 2012 Good Beach Guide were contaminated by overflowing sewers and run-off from farms or streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/water"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pollution"&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/coastlines"&gt;Coastlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/beach"&gt;Beach holidays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicaaldred"&gt;Jessica Aldred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In a speech to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference in Liverpool on Wednesday, Twigg will argue that the average of one teacher per 17.6 pupils, plus more than 500 existing vacancies, amounts to a lack of more than 15,000 teachers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twigg will point also the departure of 10,000 teachers in a year and a decline in graduate trainees in some subjects when he argues that Michael Gove, the education secretary, has brought about "a crisis in the teaching profession".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speech will say: "Pupils deserve far better. Unless this crisis is addressed head on, pupils will be in bigger class sizes or face being taught by people without teaching qualifications. This is a real and growing threat to school standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the international evidence shows that the quality of teaching makes the biggest difference to results. We cannot let the next generation down by cutting teacher quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.gttr.ac.uk/aboutus/media_enquiries/mediareleases/2013/20130304" title=""&gt;figures earlier this month from the Graduate Teacher Training Agency&lt;/a&gt; the number of postgraduate training entrants fell by more than 2,500 between the 2012 intake and this year, a drop of 6.3%. The falls are particularly large in some subject areas – 28% for computer science and 25% for religious education, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twigg will spell out Labour's "new deal" for teachers, including financial incentives to work in more deprived areas and a Royal College for Teachers to assist professional development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Education spokeswoman said it was ridiculous to talk of a shortfall in teachers. She said: "Teaching is a highly attractive profession – more top graduates and career changers than ever before are coming into teaching and vacancy rates are at their lowest since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teacher training applications for fee-based postgraduate courses in England are up by more than 1,500 applicants on this time last year. We have invested £4m to help existing teachers develop their skills. Plus we are spending £5bn by 2015 on creating new school places – more than double the amount spent by the previous government in the same timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teacher-shortages"&gt;Teacher shortages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching"&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/education"&gt;Education policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterwalker"&gt;Peter Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

After energy companies have taken their profits, and VAT has been paid, government policies can only influence around 11% of the bill, said Davey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a riposte to some Conservative politicians and media which have claimed that wind power will cost more than £120bn in the next eight years and send household bills soaring, he claimed that energy-saving policies, better gas boilers, tighter building regulations, the coalition's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2013/jan/28/green-deal-homes-energy-efficient" title=""&gt;green deal loan scheme&lt;/a&gt; and smart meters could save householders around £166 a year by 2020. According to Decc, that is an 11% cut compared to the government doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onshore and offshore wind power are needed for the UK's energy mix to insulate it from global gas prices and together cost householders only £18 a year in total, he said. "It is a tiny part of the overall bill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Global gas price hikes are squeezing households. They are beyond any government's control. The analysis shows that our strategy of shifting to alternatives like renewables and of being smarter with how we use energy is helping those who need it most to save money on their bills," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2020, the average household's dual fuel bill could be expected to be £1,496 without government policies and £1,331 with energy-saving policies, according to Decc's analysis. By then, around half of UK households are expected to have at least one major insulation measure delivered through energy supplier obligations which could save households from £25 to £270 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace's policy director, Doug Parr, said: "This report demonstrates that green policies are not causing rocketing household bills and they will not do so in future. With the right investment, UK clean energy will only get cheaper. The same cannot be said of gas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey brushed off reports that Britain was risking the lights going out with only two days' gas in store. "It is true that supplies are relatively low, but that is because it is the end of winter. It is what we expect. It does not mean we are running out of gas. Only a small part of our supply is stored. Reports of big consumer bill [hikes] are wildly wrong," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said businesses could expect much bigger rises in energy prices without the same cushion. "The picture for businesses is less positive, which is why our new proposals to exempt and compensate the most energy-intensive industries from certain policy impacts is crucial. Nothing would be gained from forcing industry, jobs and emissions abroad," he said. In 2011, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/28/george-osborne-green-energy-economy-budget-report-industry?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;the government announced £250m compensation for so-called energy-intensive industries&lt;/a&gt; such as cement, chemical and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mark Swift, a spokesman for EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: "This is a wake-up call. Policies are already adding 30% to business electricity prices, and this will rise to 50% by 2020. Measures to shield the most energy-intensive industries from a portion of the costs will make a difference but, unless we get a grip on spiralling policy costs, steeply rising electricity prices for the rest of the sector risk making the UK an increasingly unattractive location for industrial investment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/energy"&gt;Energy bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/household-bills"&gt;Household bills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energyefficiency"&gt;Energy efficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethical-living"&gt;Ethical and green living&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy-monitoring"&gt;Energy monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ed-davey"&gt;Ed Davey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnvidal"&gt;John Vidal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"The ACCC is satisfied that the alliance is likely to result in material, but not substantial, public benefits," the ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACCC had already granted interim approval, allowing the Australian and Dubai-based carriers to share flights between Australia and Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's final ruling, which lasts for five years, requires each airline to maintain its existing capacity on four overlapping routes to New Zealand: Sydney-Auckland, Melbourne-Auckland, Brisbane-Auckland and Sydney-Christchurch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On these routes the ACCC is concerned that Qantas and Emirates will have the ability and incentive to reduce or limit growth in capacity in order to raise airfares," Sims said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement to maintain capacity on these four routes, which account for about 65% of all seats between Australia and New Zealand, would be subject to a review to consider whether increases in the minimum capacity were warranted. "With this condition the ACCC is satisfied that the relevant net public benefit tests are met," the ACCC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qantas and Emirates also plan to co-operate on sales, marketing and pricing. The alliance was a key plank in Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce's bid to return the company's international operations to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the partnership Qantas will use Dubai rather than Singapore as the stopover point for its flights to London. The first Qantas flight to London via Dubai departs on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qantas signed a 10-year partnership with Emirates in September last year, ending a 17-year relationship with British Airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Emirates nor Qantas takes a stake in the other under the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce and the emirates president, Tim Clark, said they welcomed the ACCC decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry"&gt;Airline industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/air-transport"&gt;Air transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newzealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/united-arab-emirates"&gt;United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Chinese forces did not fire weapons and no Vietnamese boats caught fire, the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam also claims the Paracels and has said &lt;a href="China denies setting fire to Vietnamese fishing boat"&gt;one of the boat's cabins caught fire&lt;/a&gt; in the incident, which it called "very serious". The government lodged a formal complaint with the Chinese embassy in Hanoi seeking compensation for the alleged damage and punishment of the Chinese sailors responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam says the fishing boat was near the Paracels when an unidentified Chinese vessel chased it and fired the flare. China's navy responded that this was a "complete fabrication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Tuesday that China had taken unspecified but "legitimate and reasonable" actions against Vietnamese boats working illegally in Chinese waters. He denied that any boats had been damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam and China each claim large parts of the South China Sea. The Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei also maintain that parts of the sea are theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile China says its navy visited its southernmost territorial claim during military drills in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visit to James Shoal followed exercises that began on Saturday marking a high-profile show of China's determination to stake its claim to territory in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official People's Daily online said on Wednesday that one destroyer, two frigates and an amphibious landing ship took part in the drills around Chinese-controlled outcroppings. They involved hovercraft, ship-borne helicopters, amphibious tanks and land-based fighters and bombers, and were followed by a ceremonial visit on Tuesday to James Shoal farther south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area is surrounded by shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds claimed in whole or in part by neighbouring countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vietnam"&gt;Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Three other hospital staff have subsequently been charged in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendant is now on trial for seven cases of murder, which she has denied. The ministry of health has warned that the number of victims may be far higher, according to an analysis of 1,700 hospital records from the past seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mario Lobato, the head of the ministry's investigation team, told a local news network that he had closed the book on at least 20 suspicious cases and was looking into almost 300 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients are said to have died when oxygen levels on their respirators were dialled down and the drug Pavulon, which weakens diaphragm muscles, was introduced into the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They all have the same modus operandi, the same relationship between the drug and the death, and the timing," Lobato said. Some of the alleged victims were reportedly conscious and talking shortly before their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state ombudsmen passed on anonymous tipoffs last March, but no arrest was made for almost a year despite an undercover investigation. Police have been criticised for failing to act earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the trial continuing, much remains unclear including the motive. The defence team are due to present their case later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elias Mattar Assad, de Souza's lawyer, said her client was innocent. "We will soon prove that everything that happened in that ICU was justified by medical procedure," he said. The defendants have been released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all of the suspected cases are confirmed, the death toll could exceed that of the world's worst known serial killer, Harold Shipman. The British doctor was convicted in 2004 of killing 15 patients in Manchester, and was reportedly responsible for up to 260 other deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 27 March 2013.

After fierce lobbying by the government, peers have failed to restore even minimal amendments previously included to this deeply damaging bill. The cherished and vitally important principle that justice must be done and seen to be done has been dealt a serious blow this evening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Clarke, the minister without portfolio who championed the bill, says it is necessary to introduce the CMPs to allow sensitive intelligence to be heard in court, though this will be limited to the judge and to special advocates cleared for security who would represent claimants. Clarke claims the government has had to pay compensation to alleged victims of torture because some evidence cannot be heard in open court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government won on Tuesday night when peers voted by 174 to 158, a majority of 16, to reject a Labour amendment to allow the CMPs to be convened only if a judge rules that it would be impossible to reach a fair verdict "by any other means".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate amendment by Lord Macdonald of River Glaven, the Lib Dem former director of public prosecutions, which would have given judges the power to balance the interests of "national security" and "fair and open administration of justice" was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Beecham, who moved the unsuccessful Labour amendment, said: "[Ken] Clarke's adherence to liberal principles over the years has earned him many admirers in a lifetime in politics, though not necessarily within his own party. I hope that by endorsing these amendments the house can not only help to minimise the damage that threatens the most valued elements of our jurisprudence and judicial system but also help rescue the minister without portfolio from self-inflicted damage on his own reputation for upholding those liberal values as he comes to the end of his most distinguished career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macdonald told peers: "The illiberalism inherent in this bill lies in this: that CMPs, as presently constituted, are not fair because they don't deliver and can't deliver balanced justice between the citizen and the state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Wallace of Tankerness, the Lib Dem advocate general for Scotland who also acts as the attorney general's spokesman in the Lords, said the government had made key changes to the bill to reflect concerns in the Lords after peers had defeated the government during an earlier stage of the bill. Wallace said: "The decision rests with the judge not the secretary of state … what we have sought to do is to ensure that this should be a procedure used only in very exceptional circumstances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clare Algar, executive director of the human rights charity Reprieve, said: "This is a disastrous result for British justice. Not only are we now facing a wave of secret courts at odds with our centuries-old legal freedoms; but we have not even seen the minor safeguards upheld which would have made them less dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is deeply shameful that the government has been allowed to push these plans through parliament, despite the total lack of evidence that they are needed. Secret courts will not make us any safer. They will, however, do irreparable damage to our reputation as a country which respects fair play and the rule of law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/justice-and-security"&gt;Justice and security bill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/criminal-justice"&gt;UK criminal justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/kenneth-clarke"&gt;Kenneth Clarke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/uk-civil-liberties"&gt;UK civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Three other hospital staff have subsequently been charged in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendant is now on trial for seven cases of murder, which she has denied. The ministry of health has warned that the number of victims may be far higher, according to an analysis of 1,700 hospital records from the past seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mario Lobato, the head of the ministry's investigation team, told a local news network that he had closed the book on at least 20 suspicious cases and was looking into almost 300 more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients are said to have died when oxygen levels on their respirators were dialled down and the drug Pavulon, which weakens diaphragm muscles, was introduced into the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They all have the same modus operandi, the same relationship between the drug and the death, and the timing," Lobato said. Some of the alleged victims were reportedly conscious and talking shortly before their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state ombudsmen passed on anonymous tipoffs last March, but no arrest was made for almost a year despite an undercover investigation. Police have been criticised for failing to act earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the trial continuing, much remains unclear including the motive. The defence team are due to present their case later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elias Mattar Assad, de Souza's lawyer, said her client was innocent. "We will soon prove that everything that happened in that ICU was justified by medical procedure," he said. The defendants have been released on bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all of the suspected cases are confirmed, the death toll could exceed that of the world's worst known serial killer, Harold Shipman. The British doctor was convicted in 2004 of killing 15 patients in Manchester, and was reportedly responsible for up to 260 other deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/brazil"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonathanwatts"&gt;Jonathan Watts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said greater numbers of staff result in better healthcare: "Simply leaving the setting of staffing levels to local discretion clearly isn't working and the time has come for mandatory, legally enforceable safe staffing levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action against Medical Accidents (Avma), which has campaigned for years for a duty of candour, was concerned ministers had apparently not been convinced by the recommendation from Francis that individual NHS employees should be made liable for mistakes – and urged the Department of Health not to discount it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the department's 82-page response to Francis's 290 recommendations warned that there was a risk of "unintentionally create[ing] a culture of fear. This in turn could prevent lessons being learned and could make services less safe".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Avma, said Hunt's statement was "vague" – but welcomed the statutory duty on NHS organisations to tell the truth when patients have been harmed or killed as tougher measures would "help change the culture of cover-up and denial that has been eating away at the NHS like a cancer" and be "the biggest advance in patient safety and patients' rights in the history of the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A final decision on the proposal of personal accountability will not be made until later, subject to the findings of a review of patient safety in the NHS being conducted by Professor Don Berwick, a global expert in safe care who has advised President Barack Obama, who will report by July. Many medical organisations, including the British Medical Association, have expressed concern that such a move would deter staff from owning up to errors and open the NHS to a flood of new litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Hunt's proposals had been carefully trailed in the past few days. Failing hospitals would be monitored with a system of performance ratings based on Ofsted's existing assessments of schools in England. Meanwhile, managers responsible for failures will be barred from working elsewhere in the health service, while clauses gagging ex-NHS staff from raising concerns publicly will be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Jordan, a medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which has investigated over 50 cases of alleged negligence at Mid Staffs since 2005, said many patients would wonder why a zero-harm culture wasn't already in place. "Until ministers give their full response and put a detailed plan of action together responding to each of the 290 recommendations set out in the Francis reports, patients and their families will be left with questions unanswered as to how this could have happened in the first place and left waiting for the assurances they want that patient safety will never again be compromised to this extent," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcoming the statutory duty of candour and penalties for executives who withheld important information, Jordan said questions remained "as to what will happen to less senior members of staff who are found to withhold information or cover up inexcusable mistakes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Jones, from the law firm Leigh Day, who represented over 120 victims of abuse at Stafford hospital in successful claims for compensation, called Hunt's measures "a small step in the right direction to keep the NHS true to its founding principles and the envy of the world." She said the duty of candour "needs to apply to individual hospital employees as well as the hospital itself. The majority of my clients complained about their treatment and care but either received a very bland or misleading response or no response at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the NHS Employers organisation however was lukewarm about the new obligation. Dean Royles, its chief executive, said that while such a requirement "makes sense … we need to beware the law of unintended consequences. You don't improve culture by creating a climate of fear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis said that although ministers had not accepted all his 290 recommendations, "the government's statement indicates its determination to make positive changes to the culture of the NHS, in part by adopting some of my recommendations and in part through other initiatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nursing"&gt;Nursing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/jeremy-hunt"&gt;Jeremy Hunt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deniscampbell"&gt;Denis Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Bristow confirmed yesterday that one of the two types of helicopters it will use will carry fewer casualties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hugely controversial aspect is that Bristow will move operations from military bases such as Culdrose in Cornwall and Valley in Anglesey, where Prince William is based as a SAR pilot, to commercial airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that two bases – at Portland in Dorset and Boulmer in Northumberland – will be cut has also caused anger. The government has said it needs to privatise SAR because the Sea Kings are reaching the end of their working lives and the military needs to focus on frontline duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, paid tribute to the RAF and navy. "The service they have provided has been exemplary and the country owes them all an enormous debt of gratitude." But he said Bristow would be able to deliver a "first-class service" with its "state of the art" helicopters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DfT insisted the new service would be better: "There will be an overall improvement in flying times to incidents of around 20% (from 23 to 19 minutes)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, a helicopter can reach about 70% of high-risk areas in the UK search and rescue region within 30 minutes. This would rise to 85% under the new contract. Ten Sikorsky S92s and 10 AgustaWestland AW189s will operate, two per site, at bases around the country. Bristow said 350 new jobs would be created. The contract is also good news for AgustaWestland, which will build half the new fleet in Somerset, and for Newquay airport, where the Cornish service will be based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristow said it would be able to provide a "world-class" service. A spokesman confirmed the AW189s have less room for casualties than the Sea Kings. But Bristow said the new machines were faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will be tested is whether the ethos will change. Mike Margeson, vice-chairman of Mountain Rescue England and Wales and a team leader at Duddon and Furness in the Lake District, said he was "a little cautious and apprehensive" that the service would be as good. "We tremendously value our relationship with the navy and the RAF. We realise the Sea King fleet is ageing and welcome the investment in new aircraft. We just hope we will have the same service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Drax, Tory MP for South Dorset and a former army officer, accepted Bristow has an "extremely good reputation" but said it was a shame that military expertise would be lost. Closure of the Portland base, which covers one of the busiest shipping and leisure sailing areas in the world, was a "body blow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristow Helicopters was founded in the UK by Alan Bristow, a test pilot, war hero and entrepreneur. In 1996 the US company Offshore Logistics bought 50% of the company and later adopted its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bristow group, headquartered in Houston, provides helicopter services across the world. Since 1971 Bristow Helicopters has run civilian search and rescue services in the UK, mainly on behalf of HM Coastguard. Mike Imlach, Bristow Helicopters managing director, indicated that the company would hire service personnel: "The existing expertise and local SAR knowledge is immensely valuable and we will ensure that this is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Defence said personnel who did not wish to leave would be redeployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/privatisation"&gt;Privatisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevenmorris"&gt;Steven Morris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
