That investigation is also being supervised by the IPCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development means 10 officers from four forces are being investigated over the affair in separate disciplinary and criminal inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met's inquiry team, led by the assistant commissioner, Pat Gallan, is preparing to deliver evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service, which will then decide whether to charge the officers with misconduct in public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three serving Met diplomatic protection officers have been arrested as part of the investigation. A fourth person, a relative of one of the officers, has also been detained and questioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met has also questioned one of those arrested over an email in which he purported to be a member of the public who witnessed the incident when in fact he had not been there. Seven officers from the force, including the three who had been detained, have received section 15 notices to alert them they are the subject of disciplinary investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Midlands Police Federation representatives have been accused of exploiting the furore over the Mitchell incident after they printed PC Pleb T-shirts and protested outside the former chief whip's Sutton Coldfield constituency office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They held a meeting with Mitchell at the Tory party conference in Birmingham and emerged to tell the waiting media Mitchell needed to consider his position. Mackaill said the politician had apologised for his comments to the officers in Downing Street and repeated a denial of key elements. Mackaill would not reveal exactly what Mitchell had said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Mitchell had secretly recorded his conversation with the officers and passed the tape to the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actions of the Police Federation representatives led to a rift in the organisation, with national officers reprimanding them over their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell, who resigned as chief whip five months ago, claims he is the victim of a "vile stitch-up" to destroy his political career. He admits he swore in the presence of the police officers but denies using the word pleb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/andrew-mitchell"&gt;Andrew Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sandralaville"&gt;Sandra Laville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

So immediately on having gone through the no lobby and having voted against the government bill, I then texted both the chief whip and the shadow secretary of state for international development&amp;nbsp;… to say, with a heavy heart, I resign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Among 43 or 44 Labour MPs who voted [against the bill], I was the one who had the PPS position. But I know a significant amount of pressure was brought to bear on other colleagues in similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were an awful lot of people who were clearly unhappy&amp;nbsp;… well over half of the parliamentary Labour party were clearly uncomfortable with the position that was taken by the leadership," Mearns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateshead MP said that during last Monday's weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party "there wasn't a single person in the room who spoke in agreement with the position being put forward by the leadership team".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His description of the meeting was confirmed by other MPs who did not want to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mearns said the rebellion by over 40 Labour MPs included a former chief whip, Nick Brown, former housing minister John Healey and a former junior minister, Derek Twigg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These people aren't the usual suspects. I think the frontbench had their reasons [for wanting everyone to abstain from voting] but I must admit, I still don't completely understand why we were put into that position in the first instance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Labour source said the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, had not wanted to lose fiscal credibility on the eve of the budget by being seen to be favouring a £130m payout to benefit claimants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mearns criticised his own shadow frontbench for misunderstanding the nature of the benefit sanctions regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It just seems to me that our frontbench stance is that everybody who's been guilty of some sort of [benefit] infringement and had a sanction against them since 2011 is someone swinging the lead or taking a political stance," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gosh, I really do wish there were that many thousands of people who were willing to take a political stance and lose benefits for the sake of putting a marker down against workfare&amp;nbsp;… I just don't think that's the case at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mearns spoke as disgruntled Labour MPs prepared to vent more rage at Monday's planned meeting of the parliamentary Labour party. Many who obeyed the order to abstain anticipate an angry reaction from union backers and activists in their constituencies. "There is a lot of anger still because we were forced to do something that we knew was wrong," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Miliband is not expected to attend the meeting but a source said Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary and target of much ire, is likely to be, adding: "The feeling is that left to his own devices we would consistently be voting with the Tories. We urgently need to develop a distinctively Labour approach on welfare and not just keep following the Tories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/statebenefits"&gt;State benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Most opposition leaders and activists say the president's regime has killed too many people to be part of the solution to the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All that has happened to the Syrian people – from [the] destruction of infrastructure to the arrest of tens of thousands, to the displacement of hundreds of thousands to other tragedies – is not enough for an international decision to allow the Syrian people to defend themselves," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khatib was chosen to serve as president of the opposition's Syrian National Coalition, which was formed amid international pressure to serve as the opposition's official liaison with other countries and co-ordinate anti-Assad forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite electing a new, US-educated prime minister to lead a planned interim government last week, the coalition has failed to establish itself as the top rebel authority on the ground in Syria, where hundreds of independent rebel brigades are battling Assad's forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition did not immediately respond to the resignation. Khatib's spokesman could not be reached for further comment, but the coalition leader has often used his Facebook page to release statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Syrian government has largely ignored the opposition coalition and says the civil war is an international conspiracy to weaken the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN says more than 70,000 people have been killed since the crisis began in March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arab-and-middle-east-protests"&gt;Arab and Middle East unrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Johnson suggested the journalist Michael Cockerell had effectively blackmailed him into participating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is like when the News of the World ring up and they say listen, you are going to be in this story. You can either co-operate or not co-operate," he said. "I thought on the whole it was probably wiser, given that it was going to happen anyway, to try to say something rather than leave the field clear to put the boot in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mair said he wanted to "talk about you", Johnson joked: "That's exactly what I am trying to avoid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor appeared thrown when Mair grilled him on his sacking from the Times more than two decades ago for making up a quote. "I mildly sandpapered something someone had said. It is very embarrassing, and I am very sorry about it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mair, who is standing in for Andrew Marr on his Sunday morning show, pressed Johnson over whether he lied to the then Tory leader Michael Howard about allegations of an extra-marital affair in 2004, which resulted in his resignation as shadow arts minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I never had any conversation with Michael Howard about that matter," Johnson said. "I do not propose to go into all that again. Why should I? I've been through it a lot. Why don't we talk about something else?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insisting that he was talking about integrity, Mair turned to a telephone conversation Johnson had in 1990 with one of his friends who was demanding the private address of a News of the World journalist. A recording of the call suggested Johnson had agreed to supply the details, even though his friend indicated he wanted to have the reporter beaten up for smearing his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson said that "nothing eventuated" from the conversation, adding: "I think if any of us had our phone conversations bugged, people say all sorts of fantastical things whilst talking to their friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mair said: "You are a nasty bit of work, aren't you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All three things I would dispute … if we had a longer time I could explain that I think all three interpretations you are putting on these things are not wholly fair," an exasperated Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenged to give a straight answer on whether he wanted to be prime minister, Johnson said: "What I want is for David Cameron to win this election, which he deserves to do. In these circumstances it is completely nonsensical for me to indulge this increasingly hysterical conversation … What I want is to spend my time remaining as mayor to do as well as I can as mayor of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think people would rightly conclude that I don't want to talk about this subject because I want to talk about what should happen, which is that the government deserves to win the next election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a measure of the trivialisation of politics that I thought I was coming on to talk about the budget and housing in London, and you have … I do not mind all these questions about other stuff, but I think it is more important that we look at the things that are happening now in the economy and what the government is doing to help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he would watch the documentary, Johnson said: "I'm certainly not, not after what you have told me. I am not going to watch it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/boris"&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said he had "underestimated how important" Russia was to him, and he felt uncomfortable as an immigrant in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky is believed to have written to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, recently to float the idea of going back to his homeland. If he did, he said, he had no interest in engaging in politics and would focus on science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death comes only months after he lost a high-profile and personally disastrous court case against his fellow Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. He had accused the Chelsea football club owner of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract in relation to a Russian oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the claims were dismissed, he was ordered by the high court to pay £35m of Abramovich's legal costs. His financial difficulties were exacerbated after his former mistress, Elena Gorbunova, 43, claimed Berezovsky owed her £5m in compensation over the sale of their £25m residence in Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky is said by friends to have become deeply depressed last year, not just because he lost to Abramovich, but because the damning judgment at the end of the case had so badly damaged his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businessman thought highly of the British legal system – explaining in an interview with the Guardian six years ago that it had been one of the reasons he settled in the UK – and is said to have been distraught that the judge, Mrs Justice Gloster, described him as "dishonest", "unreliable" and "deluded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One close friend said Berezovsky had taken antidepressants last year and had checked into the Priory clinic for a brief period about four months ago while being treated for depression, adding: "He was very, very low. He talked about suicide. He would say to me: 'It's all over, it's all finished, there's no point in anything – the best thing that could happen to me is that I have a heart attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I still don't believe he had the courage to take his own life – he loved life too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of his fortune, Berezovsky was said to have been concerned about his ability to support his children. He had six children by three women: his two ex-wives and Gorbunova. While two of his children are in their 40s, two are in their 20s and his youngest are aged 12 and 10. The businessmen had been mired in a series of legal disputes, and is said to have been worn down by his long battles with the Russian state, during which there were reports that he had faced a number of assassination plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky, a Kremlin insider in the days of Boris Yeltsin, left Russia in 2000 after a quarrel with Vladimir Putin and has been the subject of an extradition order by Russia. He had appeared on Moscow's most wanted list since 2001 on charges of fraud, money-laundering and attempted interference in the Russian political process. A Russian court sentenced Berezovsky in absentia for embezzling $2bn from two major state companies. Moscow repeatedly requested his extradition, but British authorities did not comply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had forged close contacts with a number of influential British figures around the time of the 1996 Russian election, in which Yeltsin defeated a communist challenger, and was permitted to settle in the UK. In time, he changed his name to Platon Elenin, Platon being the name of a character in a Russian film based loosely upon his life. He was subsequently given a British passport in this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Berezovsky said he had been told to leave by British police for his own safety after the British security services claimed they had evidence of an assassination plot against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, he led a lavish lifestyle, with properties in London, the home counties and the south of France, a private plane and a 1927 Rolls-Royce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that was wiped out by the disastrous defeat in the Abramovich case. Last week, he was reported to have been selling a £50,000 Andy Warhol portrait of Lenin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Russian lawyer, Alexander Dobrovinsky, said Berezovsky "was in a dreadful, horrendous state; covered in debt, almost broke".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Putin's official spokesman, Berezovsky wrote a personal letter to the Russian president two months ago, asking for forgiveness. "Boris Berezovsky passed a letter personally written by him. He admitted that he made lots of mistakes and asked Vladimir Putin to forgive him," said Dmitry Peskov. "He asked Putin for a chance to come back to Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peskov said nothing about Putin's reaction to Berezovsky's letter, adding: "I can say that in any case information about somebody's death – whoever the person was – cannot bring positive emotions." In the UK, however, friends of Berezovsky cast doubt on this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Russia, Berezovsky's death was greeted with surprise, with former associates and observers offering opinions on his legacy and the possible causes of his unexpected demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was a rival of Berezovsky in the late 1990s and knew him well, said: "His life at the end was terrible … he lost money, he lost to Abramovich and he lost his wife … he not only suffered financially but also personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His minuses for the country were more than his pluses, but he wasn't too much of a devil – although he often wanted to look like a devil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prominent opposition activist Sergei Parkhomenko, talking to the liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy about Berezovsky's differences with Putin, said: "We were talking once and we turned to the strange topic of health and illness. He told me: 'My health is yet another weapon. Who dies first, loses. And I never lose.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkhomenko added: "He didn't seem like a potential suicide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Feigin, a lawyer, who worked as a civil servant in the 1990s and met Berezovsky several times, said: "He was not a little person in politics and had unbelievable energy … things you couldn't do, Berezovsky could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the last few months he had been experiencing a full exhaustion of his internal reserves. Maybe this caught up with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrei Sidelnikov, a Russian emigrant, told gazeta.ru he had known Berezovsky for 11 years. He said: "Such a person could never commit suicide. He was an exceptionally joyous person and, despite his various reverses in life, always remained as such. My personal opinion is that his death has either natural causes, or [is the work of] the Russian secret service.

Heavy gunfire echoed through the city early on Sunday as fighters made their way into the city centre and seized the presidential palace, though the country's leader of a decade was not there at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bozize left the city this morning," said Maximin Olouamat, a member of Bozize's presidential majority. He declined to say where the president had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebels from several armed groups that have long opposed Bozize joined forces in December and began seizing towns across the country's sparsely populated north. They threatened at the time to march on Bangui, but ultimately halted their advance and agreed to go to peace negotiations in Libreville, the capital of Gabon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peace deal was signed on 11 January that allowed Bozize to finish his term, which expires in 2016, but the rebels soon began accusing the president of failing to fulfil his promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They demanded that Bozize send home South African forces who were helping bolster the country's military. And they sought to integrate 2,000 rebel fighters into Central African Republic's armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal unravelled more than a week ago, with the rebels taking control of two towns and threatening to advance on the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Saturday, Bangui was plunged into darkness after fighters cut power to much of the city. State radio went dead, and fearful residents cowered in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For us, there is no other solution than the departure of François Bozize," Eric Massi, a rebel spokesman, said from Paris by telephone on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massi said the rebels were securing the city, and he called on residents to remain calm and avoid looting amid the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing unrest is the latest threat to the stability of Central African Republic, a nation of 4.5 million people that has long been wracked by rebellions and power grabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president himself took power in 2003 following a rebellion, and his tenure has been marked by conflict with myriad armed groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/central-african-republic"&gt;Central African Republic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"My grandmother used to say, 'children, burial shrouds don't have pockets'" the pope said, in a variation of "you can't take it with you".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his election on 13 March, Francis has put the downtrodden and poor at the centre of his mission as pope, keeping with the priorities of his Jesuit tradition. His name – the first time a pope has called himself Francis – is inspired by St Francis of Assisi, who renounced a life of high living for austere poverty and simplicity to preach Jesus's message to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis wore bright red robes over a white cassock as he presided over the mass at an altar sheltered by a white canopy on the steps of St Peter's Basilica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinals, many of them among the electors who chose him to be pope, sat on chairs during the ceremony held under hazy skies on a breezy day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his homily, Francis said Christian joy "isn't born from possessing a lot of things but from having met" Jesus. That same joy should keep people young, he said. "From seven to 70, the heart doesn't age" if one is inspired by Christian joy, said the 76-year-old pontiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis said he was looking forward to welcoming young people to Rio de Janeiro in July for the Catholic Church's World Youth Day. So far, that is the first foreign trip on the calendar of Francis's new papacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faithful knelt on hard cobblestones paving the square, and Francis knelt on a wooden kneeler at the point in the Gospel that recounts the moment of Jesus's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-francis"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/easter"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-papacy"&gt;The papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now he is being forced to double that levy to 20%, according to reports from Nicosia late on Saturday, while sparing all savers with less than €100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the stakes never so high for Cyprus, the European Central Bank is threatening to pull the plug on short-term funds propping up the Cypriot financial sector on Monday unless a last-minute deal is struck that satisfies the island's increasingly hawkish eurozone creditors, led by Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eurozone's biggest economy is determined that the island deflates a bloated financial sector that exceeds the size of the Cypriot economy by a factor of eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is well-known that I won't allow myself to be blackmailed, by no one or nothing," said the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble. "I'm aware of my responsibility for the stability of the euro. If we take the wrong decisions, we'll be doing the euro a great misservice," he told a German Sunday newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades's meetings in Brussels will be followed by an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers in the eurogroup on Sunday evening. It will also be attended by Lagarde, the European commissioner Olli Rehn and top officials from the European Central Bank – which will be the crucial venue for striking a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In talks on Saturday in Nicosia with the "troika" of EU, ECB and IMF officials, according to Reuters, Anastasiades conceded a much bigger confiscation of wealthy depositors' cash. Anyone with more than €100,000 in Bank of Cyprus, the country's biggest bank, would lose 20%, while similar deposits in other banks would be hit by a 4% levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal would still need to pass the Cypriot parliament, which last Tuesday unanimously rejected an agreement to tax savers. The parliament is expected to convene quickly if the Cypriots and the eurogroup reach agreement on Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are only hard choices left," said Rehn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are undertaking great efforts. I hope we have a solution soon," Anastasiades tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schäuble said Cyprus could not avoid very tough times. "But that is not because of European stubbornness, but because of a business model that no longer functions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eurozone's terms for an agreement could not be changed, he added, also insisting that depositors with savings under €100,000 had to be spared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior policymaker at the ECB also served Cyprus notice that it would be given little leeway in the crucial talks by predicting that the island's financial woes would not tip its eurozone peers into economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ewald Nowotny, the head of Austria's central bank, echoed the view of his German counterparts in an interview this weekend, warning that the Cypriot economic model – with its reliance on offshore banking and Russian money – was unsustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This system is certainly no longer able to continue," said Nowotny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in an interview with the Austrian newspaper Österreich, Nowotny indicated that failure to agree a deal by Monday's deadline – when the ECB has threatened to cut off financial assistance to Cyprus – would not trigger a systemic crisis across the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see clear signs of improvement in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. I see no massive economic problems in Italy as well, so I do not believe that it will come to contagion," he said, reiterating that Cyprus accounts for only 0.2% of eurozone GDP. Nowotny also ruled out the prospect of the Cypriot depositors' haircut being implemented on Austrian savers. "Austrian savers' money is absolutely safe," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original rescue deal for Cyprus collapsed last week when legislators rejected proposals that included a levy of 6.75% on all deposits below €100,000. Observers have warned that the haircut has damaged public trust in the euro project, because deposits under €100,000 are protected across the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cypriot banks hold €68bn in deposits, including €38bn in accounts of more than €100,000. With so much of the Cypriot banking system predicated on deposits rather than wholesale debt funding, officials at the IMF, the ECB and the EU have told the Cypriot government that depositors must carry some of the pain of a bailout, or risk their savings being wiped out altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danmilmo"&gt;Dan Milmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor"&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Paramilitary rangers and police had been stationed at the airport awaiting his arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey from exile in Dubai is intended as the first step in Musharraf's goal of rebuilding his image after years on the political margins. Since the former general was forced from power, Pakistan's civilian leadership has struggled with a sinking economy, resilient Islamic extremist factions and tensions with Washington over drone strikes and the secret raid that killed Osama bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf represents a polarising force that could further complicate Pakistan's attempt to hold parliamentary elections in May and stage its first transition from one civilian government to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is viewed as an enemy by many Islamic militants and others for his decision to side with the US in the response to the September 11 terrorist attacks. On Saturday, the Pakistani Taliban vowed to mobilise death squads to send Musharraf "to hell" if he returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf's supporters, including elements of the military and members of Pakistan's influential expatriate communities, consider him a strong leader whose voice – even if only in parliament – could help stabilise the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf also faces legal charges, including some originating from the investigation into the assassination in 2007 of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, who also spent time in self-imposed exile in Dubai before returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flight from Dubai came after several failed promises to return in recent years. Musharraf announced in early March he would lead his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, in May elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf briefly met reporters in Dubai before heading to the airport wearing a white shalwar kameez – the traditional loose-fitting outfit in Pakistan – and sandals from the country's Peshawar region near the Afghan border. He mingled with supporters on board the plane on the way to Karachi as some of them chanted slogans for his party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musharraf took power in a 1999 coup and was forced to step down in 2008 amid growing discontent over his rule. He has since lived in Dubai and London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His decision to return was given a boost last week when a Pakistan court granted him pre-emptive bail – essentially preventing his immediate arrest – in three cases in which he is implicated, including the death of Bhutto. He has 10 days to appear in court. He has dismissed the various charges as baseless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the country's election commission appointed a former high court chief justice nominated by the country's outgoing ruling party to serve as caretaker prime minister in the runup to the election. The commission chose Mir Hazar Khan Khoso out of four nominees, two submitted by the recently ruling Pakistan People's party and two by the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Lancashire police said the death, which is not being treated as suspicious, was a "very tragic incident".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of homes are without electricity after power lines were brought down in Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Ireland Electricity said 29,000 homes were still waiting to be reconnected – and it could be days before they all have power. About 1,000 homes in Northern Ireland were also without water on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scotland, about 5,000 homes in Kintyre were without power, with a further 1,500 homes in the north and west of Arran also affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the snow and ice is expected to cause continued problems on the UK's transport network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office still has yellow "be aware" weather alerts in place sweeping from south-east England up to southern Scotland, covering Northern Ireland and north-east Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to an inch of snow has fallen across eastern Scotland and central parts of England, the Midlands, East Anglia and Lincolnshire overnight. Another inch will build up in the same areas throughout Sunday, spreading to east Wales and northern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareth Harvey, a senior forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: "The snow is not going to be as heavy as the last few days but will fall throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will still be windy as well, so any lying snow will be blown around. Away from where the snow is falling, it's going to be a quieter day. Areas which have seen heavy rain like the south-west will have a chance to recover and river levels will begin to drop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperatures will linger around freezing point for most of the UK, but the south-east will be the "exception", where there could be highs of six degrees, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office also warned of a risk of ice, saying: "Lying snow in many areas will melt on roads and pavements by day, refreezing by night to give icy patches. Also, snow blowing off fields in strong to gale-force winds will affect some roads, especially over high ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severe weather is also thought to have led to the death of a woman in Cornwall on Friday. The woman, named locally as Susan Norman, died when her house in Looe collapsed during a landslip following torrential rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather has wreaked havoc across the transport network over the past two days, with delays on roads, railways and runways. Runways at some airports closed temporarily, including Humberside, Leeds Bradford and Doncaster's Robin Hood airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motorists have been urged by the Highways Agency to be cautious and check conditions before setting out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cumbria, where 70 people were stranded in their cars on Friday night, drivers were warned not to travel unless it was absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many sports fixtures, including Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against Russia and two race meetings, were called off on Saturday because of snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Red Cross was brought in to help transport medical staff and patients to hospitals after roads in north Wales became impassable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff, paramedics and renal patients were driven to hospital in the Wrexham and Flintshire areas by volunteers, using 4x4 vehicles to negotiate treacherous roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hallows, service manager for emergency response for the Red Cross in north Wales, said: "I've never seen snow like it. It's a metre thick in places and it's not drifting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Wales Mountain Rescue Association advised anyone travelling into the region not to rely on satellite navigation devices in case they lead them on to untreated minor roads which could be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Wales police said the north-eastern area of the force had been worst hit, with significant snowfalls in Wrexham, Flintshire and south Denbighshire. Most major routes were passable with care, but the force urged motorists to exercise caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Inspector Dave Roome said: "Due to the extreme weather conditions the emergency services are experiencing difficulty in reaching certain areas. Please understand that it make take longer to respond to incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are also urging people to check on neighbours and vulnerable people to ensure they are safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unseasonal weather comes as the UK prepares to enter British summer time next Sunday. Ladbrokes has cut the odds of snow at Easter to 4/5 after taking a flurry of bets in the past 48 hours. If it does snow, it would be the first white Easter in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasters have predicted it could be the coldest March in 50 years. In 1962, average temperatures for the month were 2.8C (37F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Firesale decisions are bad decisions but if you do not have the ability to plan you simply take the big items you can cut from. None of us in local government have any confidence about what our financial settlement is going to be for the year that starts next year. We are major employers and engines of economic growth and any organisation has to plan its forward budget."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cockell also condemned ministers for adopting an "illogical" and contradictory approach, praising local government for its efficiency in one breath, but then subjecting it to far more savage cuts than other services run centrally in the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Government keeps saying to us you are the most efficient part of public services. How can the most efficient part of public services take a disproportionate cut when less efficient parts of public services are being protected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is illogical for a start. We have had a 30% cut in our budget over four years and we are the side of public services that is efficient. You cannot keep cutting services and think it is not going to have an effect at street level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His strong attacks are mirrored across Tory-run local government. In many parts of the country tempers are fraying as local authorities come to the view that they are being used as scapegoats by central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of Tory-run Chiltern district council, Nick Rose, said the way central government was treating local councils and local people was "immoral". "Eric Pickles told us it would be immoral for councils to put up council tax. When it comes to morality, their immorality is in a different league," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local elections will take place on 2 May in 35 English councils, including all 27 non-metropolitan county councils. Last time the same councils were contested in 2009 the Conservative swept the board, gaining control of seven councils and adding 244 councillors, while Labour lost four councils and 291 councillors. This year's elections are seen as a vital test for David Cameron, amid nagging doubts within the party over his leadership, and the rise of Ukip, whose leader Nigel Farage is planning to put forward 2,000 candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Begy, the leader of Conservative-controlled Rutland council, who heads the coalition Sparsity Partnership for Authorities Delivering Rural Services (Sparse), said the further 1% cut announced by Osborne in the budget would put "significantly more pressure" on rural councils, and predicted that Tory councillors "will be answering tough questions on the doorsteps".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Weighell, the Tory leader of North Yorkshire county council, said central government liked to let local authorities take the blame when it often lay elsewhere. "My fear is that the elections will depend on the popularity of the parties nationally," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cockell added: "Councils are already dealing with a 33% cut in funding from central government. Any new cuts next year and beyond will have a significant negative impact, particularly as the rising cost of services, such as adult social care, are already guaranteed to soak up an increasing share of funds. The government needs to reconsider its approach ahead of the 2015-16 spending round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm"&gt;Toby Helm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Oslo is not a huge city and everybody pretty much knows everybody else, so almost everyone we spoke to had been affected. Some people asked us not to write or talk about Breivik. I am not at all certain whether we give him a victory by ignoring him or trying to understand him. That is what I wanted to question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greig and Gray, who already shared an interest in Norway, spoke to many who had lost friends and relatives. As a result, the writer eventually decided not to name Breivik in the show and to relocate the atrocity to his native Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His story centres on a woman, described as being "at the centre of the events", who has to try to decide on her response to the impact of a politically and racially motivated mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray, who commissioned Greig to write the piece for the Actors Touring Company, recalled that on their Norwegian trip they talked to a journalist who revealed that he had been at school with Breivik and was able to give them detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had a lot of angst about whether it was at all right to even do something on this," he said. "It was such a devastating incident, but David wanted to ask whether there are limits to empathy and whether it can even become destructive&amp;nbsp;itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musical theatre has often approached dark subjects. &lt;em&gt;Spring Awakening&lt;/em&gt;, a show based on the controversial German novel by Frank Wedekind, deals with teen rape, suicide and abortion, while a recent National Theatre production, &lt;em&gt;London Road&lt;/em&gt;, was written in response to the murders of five prostitutes in Ipswich in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score for &lt;em&gt;The Events&lt;/em&gt; has been composed by John Brown and involves the voices of a community choir. "Choirs seemed to be the right way to represent that basic faith in the group," said Greig. "They are also theatrically interesting because of the Greek and Brechtian traditions of the chorus, and also the chorus lines of musical theatre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Breivik's violence was done to an entire society," he added. "I was interested in how people responded. Norway seems to be a poster boy for the liberal west. It represents the Scandinavian social democratic ideal and the attack seemed to be aimed at that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In proportional terms, said Greig, the Norwegian murders were akin to the 9/11 attacks on New York. "Americans responded one way, and Norway responded with democracy. I wanted to look at whether trying to understand a crime of this nature is really the best way," he said. The writer said he hoped the show would give the audience an experience almost the opposite of a Greek tragedy, which follows a character's thirst for revenge. "Instead, this woman searches for understanding – but I wanted to question that impulse too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playwright's earlier work &lt;em&gt;Dunsinane&lt;/em&gt; was recently produced for the Hampstead Theatre by the Royal Shakespeare Company and he is working on plays for the National Theatre of Scotland and the Royal Court in London. He hopes &lt;em&gt;The Events&lt;/em&gt; will make audiences wonder whether a mass murderer such as Osama bin Laden is so different to a lone killer such as Breivik – and that the show will make a wider connection, to the horrors of Dunblane, Hungerford and Sandy Hook elementary school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/anders-behring-breivik"&gt;Anders Behring Breivik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/davidgreig"&gt;David Greig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/musicals"&gt;Musicals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/norway"&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre"&gt;Theatre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vanessathorpe"&gt;Vanessa Thorpe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Now a new edition of Lawrence's poems, many rendered unreadable by the censor's pen, will reveal him as a brilliant war poet whose work attacking British imperialism during the first world war was barred from publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His poems took aim at politicians, the brutality of the first world war and English repression – but censorship and sloppy editing rendered them virtually meaningless, to the extent that the full extent of his poetic talent has been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deleted passages have now been restored and hundreds of punctuation errors removed for a major two-volume edition to be published on 28 March by Cambridge University Press – the final part of its mammoth 40-volume edition of Lawrence's &lt;em&gt;Letters and Works&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poems&lt;/em&gt;, the first critical edition of Lawrence's poetry, sheds new light on the miner's son who became one of the 20th century's most influential writers, with novels such as&lt;em&gt; Sons and&amp;nbsp;Lovers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Women in Love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new volume's editor, Christopher Pollnitz, told the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; that it "radically shifts our understanding of Lawrence's significance as a poet". What was removed from the poems – by state censors or publishers fearing government intervention – was the "ultimate censorship", he said, because extensive and significant cuts made the texts virtually unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence wrote poetry from 1905 until his death in 1930, aged 44. Pollnitz said it is widely assumed that only the novels suffered censorship, "but it goes all through the poetry as well".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 860 poems are published in the new edition. They include All of Us, a sequence of 31 war poems never fully published before, which reveal Lawrence's preoccupation with the Allies' campaigns in the first world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1916 and 1919, Lawrence struggled to get the sequence into print. Pollnitz said publishers who knew of the banning of &lt;em&gt;The Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; would not touch a collection that criticised imperial policy – the opening up of eastern fronts in Turkey or Iraq – and poetry that explored the evil of self-sacrifice for some abstract greater good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lines now restored identify places such as Salonika and Mesopotamia – explosive references at the time, Pollnitz said. "While the war was continuing, the worst defeat the British suffered was in Mesopotamia … General Townshend's charge up the Tigris towards Baghdad was one of the most costly and wasteful ventures, in lives and money, of the first world war."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subtitle Salonika appears in Rose, Look out upon Me, a previously unpublished work. Pollnitz said: "Salonika was the Greek city to which Allied troops were sent after the attempt to storm the Dardanelles failed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the poem, Lawrence portrayed a common English soldier, stationed in Salonika, who is attracted to a Greek woman, but it is a doomed passion: "Oh you Rose, look out/ On a miserable weary fellow./ For once she looked down from above/ And vanished again like a swallow/ That appears at a window …"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence also wrote about the home front, and the changing roles of women – a girl startling her boyfriend by asking him to stay with her before he leaves – and how childhood innocence can be wrecked by the stresses of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollnitz added: "Lawrence's writing on war and sex were censored by publisher timidity, making All of Us unpublishable at the time, and the sequence is being fully published almost 100 years after its wartime composition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ill-health meant Lawrence himself was never conscripted. His insight into the war probably came from his pacifist friend, Lady Cynthia Asquith, daughter-in-law of prime minister Herbert Asquith. While war poets such as Wilfred Owen depicted the cruelty of a bloody battlefield, Lawrence tackled the loss of lives and impact on loved ones from a political point of view. He also had to write with more subtlety because censors were already watching him. In a poem titled Dust, he wrote of a relative's horrible death: "My brother died in the heat/ And a jackal found his grave;/ Nibbled his fingers, the knave;/ No more would I let him eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Antiphony, he wrote of a British prisoner of war in Turkey struggling to cope with captivity – "Each evening, bitter again" – and, in Needless Worry, he explored a young woman's loss of her soldier fiancé, talking to her mother: "Why are you so anxious, there's no fear now he's dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In The Well of Kilossa, he referred to the war in German east Africa and the huge loss of lives in inhospitable terrain: "A draught of thee is strength to a soul in hell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poetry edition is published a century after 10,000 words were censored from &lt;em&gt;Sons and Lovers&lt;/em&gt;, and nearly all copies of &lt;em&gt;The Rainbow&lt;/em&gt; destroyed, with a sexual episode between Ursula Brangwen and her schoolmistress among offending passages. His sexually explicit 1928 novel, &lt;em&gt;Lady Chatterley's Lover&lt;/em&gt;, became a cause célèbre in 1960 when, after a much-publicised trial, Penguin won the right to publish the complete book – a dramatic step towards securing freedom of the written word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/dhlawrence"&gt;DH Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/poetry"&gt;Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/censorship"&gt;Censorship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dalya-alberge"&gt;Dalya Alberge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Were secret court sessions, known as "closed material procedures" (CMPs), to be allowed in such cases, campaigners fear that those challenging their imprisonment could lose their case without knowing why, because evidence used against them, but deemed to be sensitive in terms of security, would be kept secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, days before the bill sanctioning changes that will expand the use of secret hearings into the main civil courts reaches its final stage on Tuesday, critics say the government is still sending mixed messages over the use of CMPs in habeas corpus claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked earlier this month whether the bill would impact on such claims, Clarke told the Commons "no". Later in the same session, he amended his answer, reading out a note from a civil service lawyer which said that the government "can't envisage" a situation where habeas corpus would conflict with secret courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the Cabinet Office has now confirmed that secret courts could be used in habeas corpus claims where a "judge has found that their use would be in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice". A Cabinet Office spokesman added that Lord Wallace, advocate general for Scotland, had confirmed to parliament last year that this was a theoretical possibility and that the Home Office minister, James Brokenshire, had confirmed this was the case only last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Clarke, the minister responsible for the justice and security bill, told MPs that the issue of habeas corpus and closed material procedures had "bowled me middle-stump" and that the government "ought to be allowed to go away and consider the matter".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaigners say that the Commons has still to be updated on the issue, even though the bill reaches its final stage this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clare Algar, executive director of the legal charity Reprieve, said: "Ken Clarke has misled parliament over the impact of the secret courts bill. He told the Commons secret courts could not be used in cases where someone's liberty is at stake, yet now his own department has been forced to admit that this claim was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under the government's plans, it will be possible to use secret courts in habeas corpus claims – the ancient right we all have to demand that we are either given a trial or released from custody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill seems likely to have a tricky passage, with peers reported to be planning fundamental amendments that would ensure that judges are given complete discretion over the new system and that the courts are used only as a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algar added: "This bill strikes at the heart of the principle that everyone has the right to a fair trial and that no one, not even the government, is above the law. Given the significance of these changes, it is disgraceful that we are seeing obfuscation and misinformation from ministers, even at this late stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to see how anyone can now believe any of the reassurances given by the government on the secret courts bill. MPs and peers must do everything they can to stop these dangerous proposals from wrecking our justice system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaigners point to the recent &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/23/yunus-rahmatullah-cannot-be-freed-habeas-corpus" title=""&gt;habeas corpus claim of Yunus Rahmatullah&lt;/a&gt;, one of two men detained by UK forces in Iraq in 2004, then subsequently handed over to the US and rendered to Bagram prison in Afghanistan, where he remains without charge or trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reprieve brought a habeas corpus claim against the British government in 2011 because it had signed an agreement with the US under which Rahmatullah, 29, remained under UK control and the UK could request his return at any point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The habeas corpus claim in the court of appeal was successful, forcing the UK government to ask the US to return Rahmatullah into its custody, so that he could be charged or released. The appeal court's ruling was later overturned after the US refused the demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of the bill say Rahmatullah's case illustrates how, if secret courts are introduced, the government could claim "national security" reasons in such cases, making it harder to win as Rahmatullah's lawyers would not have been able to hear or challenge the government's evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: "Habeas corpus cases involving national security evidence are extremely rare. Under the bill, a CMP could only be used in such a case where a judge has found that their use would be in the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice.

Now inhabitants on Romney Marsh are at war with the government men again – in a row over planning proposals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the picturesque town of Lydd, the museum records the fate of two smugglers arrested at the turn of the 17th century. The men were locked in a room at a inn on the edge of Romney Marsh, a few miles from the English Channel, where they were guarded by six armed customs officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the officers were unprepared for the militancy of local residents. Hours after the arrests, more than 100 from the surrounding marshes confronted the guards, freeing the men. More than a century later, residents confirmed their antipathy to authority when they cheered a smugglers' convoy of contrabrand through the streets of the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, politicians have replaced the detested customs officers as the &lt;em&gt;bête noire &lt;/em&gt;of residents. They fear Westminster politicians and local councillors are set to approve plans that would lead to the skies above swarming with commercial aircraft, while unsightly wind turbines proliferate on their fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision on whether to develop a major airport in Lydd, less than three miles from the Dungeness nuclear power station, is said to be imminent, while residents are battling to prevent more wind farms being built near the marsh. But this is more than a dispute between the inhabitants of a remote, wild and beautiful region, and the metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle over the future of Romney Marsh offers a snapshot of the dilemmas facing a government struggling to reconcile job-friendly "grand projects" with commitments to reduce carbon emissions and preserve the integrity of the countryside. These have become perennial themes in austerity Britain; all are present in this exposed corner of England. If Eric Pickles, the secretary of state for communities and local government, approves the airport plan, opponents claim that the decision will speak volumes about both the government's attitude to nuclear safety after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, and its attitude to international environmental obligations. It would also undermine the point of the Davies commission, which was set up by the government to consider the arguments for airport expansion, and will not publish its findings until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Lydd receives the occasional light aircraft. But approval for a runway extension would allow large commercial aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, which can weigh over 70 tonnes fully loaded. The operators of Dungeness&amp;nbsp;B, the French energy giant EDF, opposed the application, warning that it would increase the risk of a nuclear accident. "The large increase in air traffic around the site is a risk that should be sensibly avoided in the local and wider public interest," EDF argued in its submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Pickles approves the extension, a crucial step in allowing the airport to take up to two million passengers, opponents say that no other regional runway in Europe, possibly the world, would be as close to a nuclear power complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The airport, which is owned by the Saudi billionaire, Sheikh Fahad al Athel, is surrounded by protected habitats including a major RSPB bird reserve. Environmentalists say that it is under one of the main migratory bird routes in the south of England. As a result, the Dungeness Peninsula is the most heavily protected area in the UK, its habitats designated under EU and UK legislation. But some in government appear willing to flout such laws. George Osborne has said that he wants to "make sure that gold plating of European Union rules on things like habitats are not placing ridiculous rules on British business".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proximity of large colonies of birds to a large airport and a nuclear power station has also prompted fears of a catastrophic birdstrike. The Office for Nuclear Regulation acknowledges that if a large aircraft were to crash onto the site it would have the potential to cause its most severe "Target 9" incident, one that would kill more than 100 people. But it concludes that the probability of an accident at Dungeness, resulting from the introduction of commercial flights at Lydd, is so low that it can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts hired by Lydd Airport Action Group (LAAG), which opposes the scheme, disagree, claiming that the risk assessment is flawed. The group complains that repeated requests, made under the Freedom of Information Act, to establish how the ONR reached its decision not to oppose the expansion, have been denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission has joined the dispute, asking the government for answers, a move that could lead to the application being mired in legal battles. "Should the government approve Lydd airport's development, not only would this leave it open to legal challenge because of infringement of multiple directives but it would demonstrate that the government is willing to sacrifice public safety and the environment for its growth agenda," said Louise Barton of LAAG. The RSPB is equally opposed. "We already know that the only real capacity issue is at Heathrow," said Chris Corrigan, its regional director in the south-east. "If there is a decision to allow expansion at Lydd, it is both unnecessary and extremely damaging, especially in the context of the UK's legally binding climate change targets and the risk of not meeting them due to spiralling aviation emissions." One way of countering the increase in emissions generated by airport expansion would be further investment in green energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But opposition to onshore wind farms in the region also runs deep. A few miles from Lydd, the energy company Ecotricity is looking to build six 125-metre turbines near the village of Snave. "Snave has been identified as an excellent site for wind energy with enough resource to provide clean green electricity to power the equivalent of 9,800 homes a year," it says. The scheme is one of many small-scale onshore wind farms being proposed to help Britain meet EU targets for 15% of its energy to come from renewable sources by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save Our Marsh, Block Rural Exploitation, or "Sombe", a local pressure group, says that the marshes already have one of England's largest onshore windfarms, a 26-turbine scheme at Little Cheyne Court, close to the medieval Cinque Port of Rye. Several other marsh parishes are also being considered for onshore turbines, with plans for four new developments unveiled in the last year alone. As a result, Sombre fears that a plethora of small onshore farms could become one giant network of turbines over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once so many have been placed strategically around Romney Marsh they will go for the infill," said Mike Bartlett, a spokesman for the group. "We are fighting against it because we fear it will set a precedent." Last Thursday evening, about 100 people packed the parish hall to discuss their opposition to the scheme. The mood was angry with many warning that the haunting bleak beauty of the marshes was in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local Tory MP, Damien Collins, backs Sombre's campaign, saying the answer to Britain's energy crisis is to build a new nuclear power station at Dungeness. However he is in favour of expanding the airport, saying it would put "Romney Marsh on the runway to economic growth", an argument shared by some locals who fear the marshes will die unless the young can be dissuaded from moving away in search of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airport expansion, nuclear power, wind farms and conservation: a row that has it all. And what transpires in this remote part of Kent will not stay in Kent. Reflected in the brackish water of its marshes, the shape of Britain's future can be discerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/windpower"&gt;Wind power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy"&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiedoward"&gt;Jamie Doward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Research by a French academic to be delivered to the Royal Economic Society suggests that the country's citizens are "taught" to be miserable by elements of their own culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claudia Senik, a professor at the Paris School of Economics, argues that her country's education system and its cultural "mentality" make the French far less happy than their wealth and lifestyle suggest they should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French enjoy a high standard of living, Senik notes. The country has a generous welfare state, plus universal and free access to healthcare, hospitals, public schools and universities. It also has a 35-hour working week and many foreigners aspire to make it their home – 150,000 Britons have chosen to live there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the French are gloomy. A recent WIN-Gallup poll found that their expectations for the coming year ranked lower than those in Iraq or Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation notes that the suicide rate in France is much higher than in any of the "old European countries", with the exception of Finland. Suicide is the second biggest cause of mortality among 15-to-44-year-olds after road accidents, and the primary cause among 30-to-39-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senik claims that the "French paradox" – the fact that the country's general prosperity does not appear to translate into the happiness of its citizens – can be explained by "mental attitudes that are acquired in school or other socialisation instances, especially during youth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She reached the conclusion after analysing data on life satisfaction, drawn from the European Social Survey, which indicates that French people are less happy than other Europeans on average. Crucially, however, Senik finds that French people who live in other countries report lower happiness levels than the natives, while immigrants who move to France are more happy than the indigenous population. The longer immigrants live in France and become part of its society, the less happy they claim to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that there is something in the culture that makes French people miserable," claims Senik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low level of life satisfaction among the French has been documented extensively as far back as the 1970s. One theory – that language could be a factor – appears to have been discounted by Senik. She finds that French-speakers in Switzerland or Canada are as happy as people from other communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senik concludes that, if the French are to rediscover their sense of gaiety, their education system must play an important role in transforming its citizens' attitudes at an early age. "Happiness policies should take into account the irreducible influence of psychological and cultural factors," Senik writes. "As those are – at least partly – acquired in school and other early socialisation instances, this points to some new aspects of public policy, such as considering the qualitative aspects of the education system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senik's paper provoked a frenzied debate on the blogosphere and, perhaps inevitably, a large dose of introspection among her fellow citizens when it was published in France in her native language. Many saw Senik's paper as providing further evidence of France's decline. "I know countries incredibly poorer than ours and yet I can assure you that their population feels less unhappy than the majority of French, and yet they take it on the chin," one blogger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In many poor countries, people are happy with what they have," another added. "We are nay-sayers, chronic complainers. This is not good for morale, for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/happiness-indices"&gt;Happiness indices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing"&gt;Health &amp; wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamiedoward"&gt;Jamie Doward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The party won 7% of the vote and 18 seats in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then support for the party has doubled amid a crippling austerity regime and rising unemployment rates, which have seen a third of Greeks fall below the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden Dawn is demanding tough new anti-immigrant laws, including banning non-ethnic Greeks from the military and police. Since the election the Golden Dawn Youth Front has been under fire for distributing nationalist leaflets in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgousis, 32, a National Film and Television School (NFTS) student, spent a month with the organisation, as Greece held two general elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group, founded in 1980 as an anti-immigration lobby and registered as a political party in 1993 by a handful of rightwing extremists, was accused by opponents of playing on the insecurities of Greeks. It won 21 of the 300 parliamentary seats in the May ballot and 18 in the reruns in June. Georgousis's film, &lt;em&gt;The Cleaners&lt;/em&gt;, illustrates how the language used by group members during pre-election rallies was openly racist, referring to the Holocaust as a "solution" to the immigration problem and talking of boiling people down to "make soap".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though there is a great tolerance to such fascist views in Greece, I was shocked by their hostility," said Georgousis. "Greek nationalism is not a new thing, and there is a huge acceptance of open racism and such things. There is a tendency to be a bit over-proud of being Greek, of the ancient culture, and with the current crisis a lot of the values that Golden Dawn represents are unfortunately symbolic of values that exist among ordinary Greeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was terrified that these members were proud to express their extreme ideas during campaigning openly in public. I was shocked by the way they treated immigrants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from the documentary were broadcast on Greek TV, and the footage was considered so incriminating that the country's criminal prosecutor has launched an investigation. The group's membership is said to have doubled in the past year as many working Greeks have seen their standard of living plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris has claimed that the film-maker "failed to officially identify himself" during the interviews with party members. He said the party condemned all acts of violence. The group has put a statement on its website claiming that the documentary was illegally filmed with a hidden camera, and that in fact its members were "joking".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFTS told the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; it was totally satisfied that the party's allegations are untrue, and said that it had film evidence that the men knew Georgousis was a student film-maker and that his large video camera, a professional-looking 151 Panasonic, was on full view at all times. He had been filming with the group over a period of some 25 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, a Golden Dawn candidate, Alekos Plomaritis, is filmed saying to camera: "I am saying these things for you, British people; we gave you the lights of civilisation …"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFTS has issued a statement saying: "On 5 March 2013, &lt;em&gt;Channel 4 News&lt;/em&gt; broadcast extracts from Konstantinos Georgousis' film &lt;em&gt;The Cleaners&lt;/em&gt; – an observational documentary about members of the Golden Dawn party, filmed in Athens in the runup to the Greek elections of May 2012. Golden Dawn members featured in the film were also fully aware of the fact that Konstantinos Georgousis was a student at the National Film and Television School in England, and that film footage of their electoral campaign would be edited and submitted as his graduation film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NFTS fully endorses the authenticity of the footage and the fairness of the final film."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the investigation by the authorities into Golden Dawn, said Georgousis, "I am not too confident that anything will really happen with a criminal prosecution, there is a tendency to avoid such things in Greece. But I am a film-maker, not a politician. What I am working towards now is having an open screening of &lt;em&gt;The Cleaners&lt;/em&gt; in Athens, then Greeks will perhaps talk about this and debate if they really want this hatred and resentment to fester within the country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/greece"&gt;Greece&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/far-right"&gt;The far right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/documentary"&gt;Documentary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tracymcveigh"&gt;Tracy McVeigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Or what a brain surgeon or a bikini waxer think about their job? Here, 15 people with very different careers reveal – anonymously – the trade secrets of their working day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Illustrations by Craig Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Priest&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don't really know if you're a real human or not. I was young when I&amp;nbsp;arrived at my parish and lots of my congregation gave me cutlery – because if I wasn't married, I&amp;nbsp;clearly didn't own cutlery. When I&amp;nbsp;started dating someone that was really weird for people. It was weird for me, too – seeing them at the altar rail, knowing that we'd been snogging the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dog collar can be a help and a hindrance. When I leave the gym, the other gym bunnies tend to do a double take, especially if they've been checking me out a bit. I can walk into a meeting of my peers, fellow professionals, and they won't listen to a word because the fact that I&amp;nbsp;believe in God means that I'm clearly bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get to be with people during some of their best moments, but some of my greatest job satisfaction has come from sitting with people who are in pain, either physical or emotional. There are some really poignant moments: last week I helped a lady write a letter of forgiveness to the person responsible for her daughter's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get some odd requests around funerals – people wanting the &lt;em&gt;Countdown&lt;/em&gt; theme tune or "Bat Out of Hell". And then you get people turning up on icy days wearing stilettos walking towards a hole in the ground… there's always the risk that someone's going in. But it's the ushers at weddings that tend to be shocking. I had one group who did football chanting during the hymns, and when it came to the exchange of the rings, they chucked a couple of Haribo on my book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get asked to pray for some odd things: I&amp;nbsp;know far too much about the continence of my congregation. Sometimes they'll get very upset about something they've read in the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt; and I&amp;nbsp;end up having to pray for whatever's causing cancer in cats this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dominatrix&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First thing's first: I don't offer sex and I don't allow any body worship above the knee. They might be able to masturbate a bit, but I'm normally a bitch about that and give them a countdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an incredibly intense environment. I can be in my dungeon for up to seven hours. I'm always checking whether the client is having fun and making sure he or she isn't dying. It's important to know if they have any medical conditions in advance – I certainly don't want a dead body on my hands. I have a couple of code words that the client uses to signal when something is wrong: "amber" for when the client really needs a breather or "red", which is the emergency safe word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do all kinds of set-ups: from regular spanking and cross-dressing to cutting and sewing someone's skin. We all have different ideas of what is weird. I have a client with a custard fetish who likes to be put into an inflatable ball, which I&amp;nbsp;then fill with eight litres of custard and roll him around in it. Nothing surprises or disgusts me – everyone has their thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the dungeon, I have a&amp;nbsp;couple of "lifestyle submissives" – the first guy, Slave X, has been with me for seven years. He cleans my flat, runs errands for me. Another slave was overweight when he first started seeing me, but I've dominated that part of his life now: he emails me every day with a list of his meals and his activity levels. I&amp;nbsp;think of it as life training. I don't get emotionally attached to any of them: slaves are disposable – they need to work hard to make sure they are allowed to stay in my presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People assume I make a fortune, but I don't. The overheads are huge – the rent on the dungeon alone is £50 an hour. I'm sure if I&amp;nbsp;did personal services my income would be fabulous, but it's just not something I'm prepared to do. I see a real cross section of society, from the curious person who's just read Fifty Shades of Grey to married men who can't tell their wives they want to be dominated. For people who are true submissives, a session with me is an escape, like yoga or meditation. I don't think I'll ever be out of the fetish world. I feel completely free and at home in it. Ideally, I'd like to work towards being on a yacht in the Caribbean with a dungeon in the hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain surgeon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could teach you to do a basic brain operation in two weeks. But what takes time and experience is doing it without wrecking the brain. Learning your limitations takes years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up in paediatric neurosurgery because children make better recoveries from brain trauma than adults. So it's more rewarding in terms of outcome and I find children's resilience really inspiring. From the age of six you have an inkling of your own mortality, and most have a good understanding of what's going on. It's taken me a decade to become comfortable discussing an operation with a child, but they have to be able to ask questions. You have to show them respect. Sometimes their perspective is funny; most teenage girls just want to know how much hair you'll shave off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't get upset by my job. I didn't put the tumour there, I'm dealing with what's gone wrong. These children are dying when they come in and I do whatever I can to make them better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I trained I worked 120 hours a week, so life is quieter now. I do two 12-hour operating days when I do three or four procedures – unless it's a big tumour which will take 10-15 hours. Other days are clinics when I see 30-40 patients a day. I also have a week on call every seven weeks, which is night and day for seven days. I'm used to working on three hours' sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people ask what I do, I say I'm a doctor. If I say I'm a brain surgeon, they call me a liar – I'm a council estate boy from the East End, so I don't have the image you expect. I don't mind, though, I think it's funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hollywood agent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I not only provide exposure for my client I also do damage control. We've had clients involved in lawsuits, divorces, phone sex, drugs. One mistakenly took a gun to an airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the red carpet – at the Academy Awards, say, or the Golden Globes – I'm the person making my client look good. The other day at an Oprah Winfrey event the carpet wasn't tacked down properly and my client almost went flying – I had to catch them. They can make some strange requests. At a&amp;nbsp;black-tie gala at the White House two clients hated the dinner and insisted we circle around Washington DC trying to find a&amp;nbsp;Kentucky Fried Chicken open at 1am. I had to go in wearing a gown and order so they could eat it in the limo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never worry that I'm spending my life making other people look good – I'm happy for their success. I feel like a proud parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maitre d'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to know who our clients are. It enhances the experience in a restaurant if the guy at the front can ask with genuine interest how you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everybody goes to a restaurant to have a nice time. Some are there for meetings and – God knows why – but a lot of people come to split up with their partner. The worst customers are those who are drunk and abusive. I've had people square up to me. It's also never great when there's raw sewage on the bathroom floor at 8pm on a Friday night. You're going to have to get your Marigolds on and deal with it yourself until the plumber arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People assume we take bribes for tables, but we don't. Once a&amp;nbsp;guy walked in without a booking on a&amp;nbsp;Friday night with a famous chef and nine friends. When I said we were fully booked he started putting tenners in my breast pocket. In the end we found space in the bar. I didn't give the money back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Undertaker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first couple of years after I started – I chose, when quite young, to go into this; it wasn't a family thing – I couldn't help but be fascinated by the body. After a while, though, when you're with it, it becomes just a… dead body, to be dealt with. It's the life that was lived that becomes important, and the continuing lives&amp;nbsp;of those left here. And you realise that nobody's life has been wholly mundane. It might have been difficult or unfulfilled or full of secrets. But never dull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secrets tend to come out in death. Those of the individual, yes, but also of the family – and I do approach the day as one for those still living. I'm privileged to see them at their very best: death makes the living draw on enormous resources, and I learn more about human nature, kindness and resilience every day. Oh, there's a tremendous amount of emotion about, and occasionally I become the scapegoat, but very rarely. Mostly I learn about love and about the hard lives many people have led; and about sacrifice. And learn again that dying is easy. It's life that's the bloody, bloody hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a hard job, in many ways, not least emotionally, and competitive these days – it's a cut-throat business, with the big boys and all their prepayment schemes. But people always expect aspects of depression to my job, and it's been the precise opposite. There's not a&amp;nbsp;day that goes by when I don't feel happy to learn so much about humanity, to feel so in my place, and I don't regret a single minute. It has been, basically, a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bikini waxer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's when my clients are on the bed, legs in the air and their private bits at the mercy of a waxing strip, that they start to get scared. So I break the ice. I put on a sinister voice and say: "Don't worry, no one will hear your screams from here!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing can shock me now. My friends say to me: "What's it like, looking at vaginas all day?" But I'm not even looking at the body, I'm just concentrating on an area of skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main aim is to relax people, take their mind off what is happening. That is not to say I'm thick. There is a lot of training involved and I can't stand the stereotypes of beauty therapists you see on programmes like EastEnders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I'm not waxing, I'm cleaning. I'm a&amp;nbsp;stickler for hygiene, and skin cells create a lot of dust. I have standards and I expect the same from customers: do not come and see me in a state of unreadiness. Unfortunately, our salon is opposite a Bikram yoga studio so you get the chancers who come straight from class and expect me to wax them sweaty. I refuse. There are young women who don't appear to have changed their knickers for days, people on their periods. Once I almost waxed out someone's tampon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will order either a Hollywood, which is everything off, or a&amp;nbsp;Brazilian, which leaves a thin "landing strip". The original bikini wax, where you'd just remove a small amount of hair, is now virtually nonexistent. Once you've gone down the Hollywood path there's no going back. And it's the same with the back, sack and crack. Waxing the male anatomy is just funny – you can get men who have the wrong idea and think you are going to do "extras", but mostly I'm just trying to stop myself laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Financial adviser&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don't really understand what a financial advisor does, so they think I'm the one who makes the decision on whether they get a mortgage – I&amp;nbsp;constantly have people trying to convince me how well off they are. One friend phoned me up to get a mortgage and we spent hours working on the application before they told me, oh, I resigned yesterday. That person had a master's degree. You think, "How can you be such an idiot?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've got a Russian oligarch I've done a life insurance application for. I said, "Any health questions?" and he said, "No, no – perfect health," and then he fills out on the questionnaire that he's been shot three times and stabbed eight times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that the wealthier people are, the meaner they are. I'll be in the house of a client who has a lot of money, late at night, and they'll quibble over a £300 fee. Then I've got clients who live on a&amp;nbsp;council estate and every time I see them they want to throw money at me: "I don't know what I'd do without you mate, have some pound notes!" I have to explain I can't take it or I'll get struck off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that keeps me doing the job is that I like people. I hate sitting at a computer and looking at figures. There can be a sad side – I see a lot of death claims and at the moment I feel surrounded by cancer. A lot of my clients have it and it's hard advising them, especially when they aren't going to get to use the pension they've been saving for all their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I'm financial advisor to almost all friends I know everything about everyone. We'll be in the pub and someone will say, "Bob's bought a new Merc, he must be doing so well…" I'm thinking, "He's mortgaged up to his eyeballs and he hasn't got a pot to piss in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My own relationship with money is useless. My wife runs the bank account because I can't face it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Judge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you become a judge after years of being a barrister and trying to make points that win cases, you have to remember that a huge part of what you do is listening. Most of your time is spent listening: to advocates, to witnesses, to defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates often talk too much – and rarely realise how easy it is to make a good point start to seem like a weak point, just by going on for too long. Juries are almost always patient and practical. Sometimes they can be tetchy and very occasionally you have to do something that ensures that a juror doesn't fall asleep. A loud cough, or suddenly declaring a coffee break, usually does the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind closed doors most judges, even very experienced ones, are much more anxious about their work than most people might think. We agonise over what we do and the decisions we have to make. Even the smallest cases can feel very important. It would be bizarre to say that as a judge you learn to be less judgmental, but there are times when it almost feels like that. Sitting in the criminal courts gives you a window into the darker, stranger, tragic and dangerous aspects of human activity. You see the complex and difficult lives of the people who end up in front of you. And you realise that your job is not so much to judge them as to ensure that everyone receives justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Call-centre worker&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in a call centre, every minute of every day is an awkward conversation. You're in a room of strip lighting, structured like a classroom, full of people fuelled on instant coffee, trying to stay upbeat while constantly being told they're arseholes. You're trained to gesticulate while you talk (it's meant to make you sound more convincing) so everyone's walking round like politicians. It's a really strict environment, strict on punctuality, on socialising. I do mainly sales, some charity fundraising, some market research, and I get about £200 a week, with an extra £50 with commission if I've done particularly well. If you fail to meet your targets for three weeks then you're fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's exhausting. Sometimes on the phone you feel heartbroken, sometimes you hate them. People who say "fuck off" quickly are fine. The worst are the self-righteous men who feel they've won by putting you down. As if I'd chosen this minimum-wage job. I desperately needed a job and was approached in the street. There are lots of educated people there who can't get a job elsewhere. It made me realise you shouldn't judge someone by the job they do. Call centre workers aren't cartoon baddies – it's rare that they've chosen to do this job. Though some people have – some people love it. It's a form of improvisational performance. And if you enjoy that American, high-five culture then you thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's depressing to be in a room of idealistic hippies doing research for a bank, especially when it's not real research. We're looking for evidence of customer satisfaction for their marketing material. We get through the day by playing games. Like, we try to fit as many animals into a call as possible. "I wonder if you had a few minutes to do a quick antelope satisfaction survey." And, "So would you say the service you received was: excellent, very good, good, fair tiger poor?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to engage them in conversation. You look for any hint of shared interests – mention of somewhere they've been on holiday, or a child studying something you know about. Someone I work with called a woman and asked, as we do, "How's your day been?" The woman said, "My husband's just been promoted." He smelled a&amp;nbsp;sale; she was basically telling him she had money. So he said "Congratulations, that's fantastic!" And she paused and said, "What?" He was confused. She repeated herself, "My husband's just been cremated." Similar things have happened to me. People tell me about how the bank has left their dying father penniless, and I&amp;nbsp;have to go, "Yes yes, but how clean is your local cashpoint?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a shift you crave a normal conversation. All day you've been having these prostitute conversations, where you're not saying the things you want to say and nobody wants to listen. You crave realness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Taxi driver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don't say a word to each other on most forms of public transport, but inside a taxi it's a different world. Everyone's got a story. My day typically starts with a businessperson going to the airport, and nearly always ends with a drunk. I don't mind the drunk people. Sometimes I think they're the better version of themselves: more relaxed, happier, honest. Once, a girl I picked up from a bar loved the music on my iPod so much she made me play one of the songs again when we arrived outside her house. I stopped the car at the end of the drive and she opened the door, lit a fag and danced. It made me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do worry about some of the girls who are very drunk. I have two daughters myself. An awkward scenario for me is having to wake a woman who has fallen asleep. I'm very aware that I could be accused of assault and lose my licence. I tend to get a runner every six months. Usually they're lads and you know as soon as they get in. Recently four 12-year-old girls ran off giggling. I didn't see that one coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only once have I feared for my life. A guy ran out at a traffic light and so I sped up before his brother could run, too. He seemed embarrassed and made me drop him at a car park. When we arrived, the first guy was waiting with a boulder, which went through the windscreen, narrowly missing my head. They punched me through my window until I drove off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the worst people are the ones who call me "Driver".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commis chef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the people I work with can't afford to get the tube in, so their journeys take two hours, but getting the tube means I have time to get a double espresso from McDonald's before my shift starts at 7am. I drink it as I&amp;nbsp;trudge through Soho and think of the hell to come. I'm the lowest of the low, in the kitchen, with no windows, and my mood is one of clinical depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, it's a badge of honour if you say you've done three doubles, been dumped, are becoming homeless and have the shits. That's ultimate kudos – in the kitchen, that's cool. There's no sympathy, and nobody tells you you're doing well. You have to work through illnesses, because if you're off for a day everyone else has a huge load to carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got treated really badly at the start, nobody would even stand next to me. Eventually I earned my place, and over time my body changed, too – my hands got really muscular and scarred. When you burn yourself on oil you have to wear blue plasters, but inevitably they come off when you're washing veg, so you lose them along the way – sometimes into the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started, I signed an employment law waiver. The hours are tough. Lunch shifts are 7 to 4, and dinners 3 to midnight, or later, with no breaks. And you have to do at least one double shift a week. You don't eat. There's food available, but it's inedible – noodles, bad burgers. I've never tried the stuff on the menu. And staff aren't allowed real coffee, which really made me realise how little respect the company has for us. Sexism is rife. There's lots of talk about girlfriends' genitals, or "ugly birds", and there's the feeling that if you can't take the banter then you don't belong. As a&amp;nbsp;woman, you don't get on by pointing out the sexism, you get on by putting up with it and joining in. I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Paramedic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see more death, terror, blood, guts and horror in our professional lives than the SAS or frontline soldiers do – they max out in the few years they're at war, but we do this job for 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an average shift, we see lots of drunks, we might be called to a brothel or a drug den where people are lying around with needles full of heroin in their arms – dark places where people need help. There are so many terrible incidents: car accident scenes where one parent is left alive and the children and other partner have died. Suicides, especially in young teens, are tragic. But there are heartening moments, too. Bringing a baby into the world; going to see little old ladies who've had a fall and just want a bit of company is nice, too. I make them a cup of tea and we have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't get used to breaking sad news. There's no script, you just have to be honest and comforting. I've learned that it's OK to feel emotional, although I don't turn up a blubbering heap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes its toll. About eight years ago I went through a&amp;nbsp;breakdown. It had been a&amp;nbsp;particularly hard week: a&amp;nbsp;suicide; dealing with a man who had been raping his children… difficult stuff, and I couldn't cope. I'd become cynical and bitter and we were also being hammered by management, who were driven by government targets. If we turned up 20 seconds late but managed to save someone's life, we'd still get told off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed in the past decade. There's now no room to come up for air between emergencies. But what I keep at the front of my mind is the reason I&amp;nbsp;got into this: I wanted to help look after people. I'm still smarting that our retirement age has just been raised to 68 – the average fireman gets to retire at 50. But there's a&amp;nbsp;real sense of self-worth and you definitely get treated differently – people make way for a paramedic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Intern&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been a fashion-mag intern on and off for five years. Five years! I know. Completely unpaid, yes, I work six days a week for the magazine, then at a pub evenings and weekends. I drink Red Bull instead of having lunch and eat canapés instead of dinner. It's not a game. Most of my cash comes from eBaying my freebies, although that can be dangerous – a friend of mine sold a Christopher Kane piece and now she's blacklisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first day as an intern, when I was 16, was spent trying to get back a dress that Isabella Blow had given to a mate. It's funny – really rich people seem to think everything is free. Living in a fashion cupboard is extremely depressing, not just because it's tiny and windowless, but because you're surrounded by things you will never be able to afford – though, after a while, everything starts to look like Primark tat. One friend wore a pair of thigh-high boots out and snapped the heel. When she sent them back to the designer she stuck it on with gum and swore they'd arrived like that. There's a lot of stealing. A lot. Jewels, couture gowns. I don't take anything because none of it would fit me. Samples are tiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of bitchiness, too, because you know that, in order for you to get a proper job, the fashion assistant will have to die. I'd definitely be more successful if I were meaner. Also you're in an office of really, really hungry people. The industry would be a&amp;nbsp;much happier place if everyone just ate a sandwich. One editor I&amp;nbsp;worked with banned all food from the office, but I learned that if I offered round sweets it calmed tense situations. This life is all about stamina. If you can outlast everyone else, then there's a job for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I notice myself being mean to someone, it scares me. I can't see anything changing – there's this cycle of abuse. People take fashion very seriously. But we're not curing cancer, it's just clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Psychic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was seven when I got my first connection. I was asleep in bed and got woken by a bright, shining light. Within that light was a young lady I called Star, who became my spirit guide. When I was 22, my mum died. Star returned. I started to feel lots of connections, like there were people above that I could sense and feel. I receive around eight messages a day now. It's a funny feeling, like cobwebs in my hair. If I'm connecting with someone who's passed away and their death was violent, I can get a flutter in my heart. A child's energy can make me feel warm inside, like I'm wrapped in cotton wool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My job is mostly to act as a channel between the living and the dead, but I can see into the future, too. I have to be careful how I break news. I'm never going to tell you that you are going to die soon. I made the mistake once – the guy got shot two weeks later – and I don't think it's fair. But if you've got cancer I will tell you to check out a lump. It does amaze me, the influence I have on people. I told a Hollywood actor he wasn't in love with his wife and he left her that day. I destroyed a marriage instantly, because I knew he loved someone else. He's having a baby with her now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I don't feel anything, I won't do a reading. I'm not one of these psychics who will sit there and lie for the sake of it. Some people want me to counsel them. They think I work for the Samaritans. I'm not God. I can only say what I see or feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been working for a famous hotel chain. I accurately predicted the owner had picked a new site with terrible foundations and saved him millions, so he employed me to help recruit his staff. He'll email me CVs and I'll tell him if someone's dodgy. He didn't listen once and the bloke he employed ended up stealing from him. He listens to me now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, my job has its perks. I don't rip people off. I take home £500 a week and put the rest into growing my business. I clean my energy after every reading by imagining a white light shining around me. Then I go home and argue with my boyfriend, or curse my broken-down car, just like the rest of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/work-and-careers"&gt;Work &amp; careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/job-hunting"&gt;Job hunting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Homes in Cumbria and Scotland are left without power and travellers are warned of flight cancellations, delayed trains and many blocked roads&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was supposed to be the highlight of an otherwise grim year – &lt;a href="http://www.katiescarbrough.co.uk/2013/03/05/katies-ice-gala-23rd-24th-march-dundonald-ice-bowl-belfast/" title=""&gt;two ice skating galas in Belfast this weekend held in honour of Katie Scarborough&lt;/a&gt;, a former British junior champion figure skater who is battling bowel cancer. But on Saturday afternoon the mother-of-two was stuck in a hotel in south Ayrshire, willing the snow to stop falling so that she could reach the port of Cairnryan to catch a ferry to her home town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was the A77 coastal road, which was closed in both directions from the hotel to the ferry port. The 32-year-old had left Birmingham on Friday morning, she said, and was determined not to miss the charity fundraising show. She was "gutted and upset", she wrote on Twitter (@katiescarb). Her friends rallied around, trying but failing to find someone with a helicopter who could give her a lift over the Irish Sea. By 1pm on Saturday, she had formulated a plan to drive to Edinburgh and fly to Belfast. She would arrive too late for Saturday's gala, but would make it in good time for Sunday's show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarborough was one of thousands of Britons whose weekends were ruined by a wholly unseasonal and highly inconvenient blanket of snow that covered much of the UK on Friday and Saturday, adding more misery to what forecasters believe could be the coldest March in 50 years. Over at Scarborough's destination, Northern Ireland, 35,000 homes were without electricity after 24 hours of severe weather. Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) said it could be days before all the problems are fixed. The power cuts also disrupted water supplies in some areas, with about 1,000 households in south Antrim and parts of Co Down without water. An NIE helicopter patrolled electricity lines in areas that were not reachable by road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for NIE said: "Emergency crews have been working since first light yesterday to restore power but access to faults is proving difficult. Specialist engineers will be monitoring the network from the helicopter and provide vital information on access and network damage to crews on the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homes in Cumbria and south-west Scotland were also left without power. In north Wales, the snow was so thick that hospital staff, paramedics and renal patients had to be taken to hospitals by British Red Cross volunteers, using 4x4 vehicles to negotiate treacherous roads. By lunchtime on Saturday, they had helped more than 70 people in the Wrexham and Flintshire areas, starting at 5.15am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Hallows, service manager for emergency response for the Red Cross in north Wales, said: "I've never seen snow like it. It's a metre thick in places and it's not drifting. I just can't believe it. It's great to know that our 4x4 capability can be of such vital use to medical staff in getting them through these tough weather conditions to patients, many of whom are seriously ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Highways Agency said the road network was performing well despite the weather, but warned road users to check conditions before travelling. Trains were badly affected by the snow, however, with disruptions on First Transpennine Express services between Huddersfield and Manchester, and no Northern Rail services between Skipton and Carlisle. Many passengers had little patience with the train companies, given that the snow had been forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no snow on the ground in central Manchester and yet the departure board at Piccadilly station was a rollcall of delays. "It's a shambles how the country grinds to a halt every time there is a bit of snow, especially when they knew it was coming," said Kelly Bancroft, 32, trying to get to London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environment Agency had one flood warning still in place, around the river Clyst in the Broadclyst area of Devon, by midday, and 72 flood alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who died when her house collapsed during a landslip in Cornwall was named on Saturday as Susan Norman. Her body was found after rescue teams spent hours sifting through the wreckage of her home in Looe with search dogs. The building had collapsed around 6am on Friday amid torrential rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday morning, flights out of northern England were disrupted when East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Humberside and Doncaster's Robin Hood airports closed their runways. At East Midlands, an airport spokesman said airfield crews had to clear an area equivalent to 87 football pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for widespread parts of the country, urging people to be aware of adverse conditions. The highest recorded snowfall was in Bingley in West Yorkshire, which had 22cm (8.6in), but some parts of north-east Wales were thought to have seen up to 30cm of snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumbria police were advising motorists not to travel in the south and west of the county unless absolutely necessary. Seventy drivers spent Friday night at Millom high school in south-west Cumbria, which police opened as a reception centre for those unable to return home. Others who were stuck in their cars slept in local hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook for the start of the week is that it will remain cloudy across southern areas of England on Monday but it should be largely dry. Eastern parts of the country will see a scattering of snow showers becoming more widespread over northern areas on Tuesday, but southern England, Wales and the Midlands should remain largely dry with sunshine at times. The first white Easter since 2008 is odds-on after a record number of bets were taken by Ladbrokes, which has slashed the odds to 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd"&gt;Helen Pidd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/saskia-murphy"&gt;Saskia Murphy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's about abuse of power," said "Father Peter", who admitted in the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; report which broke the story that he had been involved in an inappropriate relationship with the cardinal that led to him needing counselling. "The emotional and psychological power Keith O'Brien had over me was incredible. He was utterly manipulative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenny", a former priest who described how he had rebuffed the cardinal's advances while he was a seminarian, said the newspapers were forcing parts of the jigsaw puzzle together that didn't fit : "I was surprised at the suggestion that I was part of a gay cabal. And my partner of 26 years? I'd say she was quite surprised too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/23/cardinal-keith-o-brien-accused-inappropriate" title=""&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt; revealed&lt;/a&gt; that Lenny and Father Peter, and two others, "John" and "Kenny", had complained to the papal nuncio about O'Brien. The cardinal resigned, casting a shadow over the election of Pope Francis. The instinct of many, said Father Kenny, had been to demand forgiveness for the cardinal while blaming the complainants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story has been complicated by leaked details of a fifth complaint, dating to September 2012. The priest involved reached agreement on the matter. When the four men made their complaints five months later, they were advised to stay silent and were informed that O'Brien would retire to Rome. Fearing another cover-up, they went public, prompting the cardinal's resignation and apology in which he admitted: "There have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father Peter, who became suicidal as he struggled with guilt and depression, says the story has been misunderstood. The complaints were neither political, nor timed to affect the papal conclave. "Our complaints were made before the pope resigned. I am now more convinced than ever they played a part in his resignation. But this is not something that all happened last month. I sought help for this a decade ago. I was on antidepressants and I couldn't cope any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Father Peter claimed he felt O'Brien had "groomed" him. As a young priest, he had personal problems of which the cardinal, more than 20 years his senior, had been informed. "I was vulnerable and he knew that. He was very charismatic and I couldn't believe his interest in me. I thought he was helping me." A relationship developed that Father Peter struggled to disentangle himself from, until he temporarily left the priesthood. "Only when I got away could I assimilate what had happened. It was like the Stockholm syndrome. I kept trying to argue in his favour, even to my psychologist. She just kept saying, 'Peter, it was abuse'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He describes watching a film in which a mother behaved lovingly, but secretly, she was poisoning her daughter's soup. "I remember thinking, that's my relationship with Keith to a T. He is poisoning me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the four complainants knew one another, not all were close friends. A chance reunion for Lenny and Peter led to the discovery of their common link to the cardinal. "We couldn't have acted alone because Keith was too powerful," explains Father Peter. "Gradually, we all found one another. We had each thought that Keith had a problem, but then we realised there was more to it. This was a man who was using his power wickedly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenny said he had not received a formal response from the nuncio and did not know whether there would be an inquiry. When contacted by the &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;, the nunciature refused to confirm whether more priests had come forward since the original article. A spokesman also refused to comment on an inquiry. Not even on the process? "Not even on whether it exists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complainants deny being motivated by malice. "This was done for altruistic reasons," says Father Peter, who is still seeing a psychologist. "I see the bigger picture: the cleansing of the church." The opprobrium has caused them great distress. Father Kenny begins counselling this week. "I feel a real need to shed tears but fear that if I start, I will have difficulty stopping." Lenny believes the church would make them all disappear if it could. "I think we are seeing evidence of this in the sheer anger of these statements. These may be men of the cloth but they are not men of the holy spirit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/catherine-deveney"&gt;Catherine Deveney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Then along came the internet and Vice reinvented itself as the edgiest, wildest online media brand in the world. It's staffed by twentysomethings and aimed at a global youth who have no interest in mainstream media. Which is why he is courted by everyone from Rupert Murdoch to Google. Here he explains what drives his brand of gonzo journalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One evening in October of last year, after a reported couple of drinks in a Brooklyn bar, Rupert Murdoch was giving a good impression of a man who thought he had seen the future. From his car on the way home he tweeted: "Who's heard of VICE media? Wild, interesting effort to interest millennials who don't read or watch established media. Global success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The months since have served to emphasise the Digger's clairvoyance. If you hadn't heard of Vice media back then, it is likely that now you have. In America, in particular, two archly millennial Vice stories have made the "established media", Murdoch included, look distinctly 20th-century by comparison. The first involved&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/20/john-mcafee-dont-see-myself-as-paranoid" title=""&gt; the on-the-run internet millionaire, John McAfee&lt;/a&gt;, whose paranoid tale of drugs, murder and subterfuge in the jungly paradise of Belize dominated the daily news channels and blog sites for a few weeks before Christmas. When McAfee surfaced, having gone into hiding after being sought for questioning over the death of his neighbour, it was in the company of not only his 18-year-old girlfriend, but also a couple of young reporters from Vice. While the rest of the world's media, as well as the Belize police force, had tried to track McAfee down, Vice had helped to smuggle the fugitive over the border into Guatemala, and also, in true chaotic gonzo fashion, succeeded in inadvertently revealing his whereabouts in a blogged photo, which carried the message, "&lt;a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/we-are-with-john-mcafee-right-now-suckers" title=""&gt;We are with John McAfee right now, suckers!&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second Vice scoop was perhaps even more incendiary. Last month a documentary film crew from Vice blagged its way into North Korea in the company of the NBA legend, and celebrity rehab casualty, Dennis Rodman, and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Vice crew once again could hardly believe its fortune when &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2013/feb/28/dennis-rodman-meets-kim-jong-un-north-korea" title=""&gt;Rodman ended up befriending Kim Jong-Un&lt;/a&gt;, the recently installed supreme leader of the world's most repressive regime, and now, apparently a basketball fan. Over the course of a couple of days, outtakes from this unlikely bromance were sent from the Hermit Kingdom via Vice.com and provoked predictably manic viral attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I visit Vice's offices in Brooklyn, co-founder Shane Smith has spent the weekend both defending Rodman's "basketball diplomacy" and revelling in the media storm that has attended it. The story, a trademark mix of laddish farce and harder-edged foreign affairs is, he suggests, pretty much the perfect Vice exclusive. "The thing is: Dennis Rodman is absurd. North Korea is absurd. And our whole mission statement at Vice is the absurdity of the modern condition. So it made perfect sense for us." Smith is amused and frustrated in about equal measure by the generally outraged response of Fox and CNN and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and the rest. Above all it demonstrated, he says, a certain kind of unease – perhaps even envy – at the Vice philosophy of what he calls "immersive" journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much, I wonder, did Rodman, the lavishly pierced and tattoed former lover of Madonna, know about the trip in advance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well I think he was keen to go play a game with the kids there but I don't suppose he quite got the gravity of what he was doing and where he was going. He's not a diplomat. And frankly we did not know that Kim Jong-Un would show up. When he did, we thought: 'Oh, OK, what happens now?' And then, when he said, 'Hey, everyone come back to my place for dinner!' we were quite gobsmacked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways it was a logical conclusion to what has been a long-term obsession for Smith. He visited the police state a couple of times in 2007 to film&lt;a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/the-vice-guide-to-travel/vice-guide-to-north-korea-1-of-3" title=""&gt; The Vice Guide to North Korea&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary of pre-conceived weirdness which did not stray far from what heavy-handed minders allowed. Smith was, in any case, subsequently banned from returning, but felt he had unfinished business in Pyongyang. He believes the Rodman stunt served a wider purpose, giving his film crew "unparalleled access" to the regime for a documentary on which they are still working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People turned round and said we ate food with this guy [Kim Jong-Un] and people are starving in North Korea. So you are saying no diplomat can ever eat food with a bad leader? That's half the world gone. It's just we had an idea of how to get in and how to get access and it worked. But when people like [former Clinton spokesman, now a TV political journalist] George Stephanopoulos ask Dennis Rodman about foreign policy and people are surprised he doesn't understand all the subtlety, I mean who is shocked by that?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it journalism in any sense, though, or just a curious, contrived spectacle? "Well," he says, "we are getting a story that everyone is interested in seeing and nobody else could get. People call us 'adventure journalists' or 'daredevil journalists' or whatever. But in an insane world the mad way often works …"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith has high hopes that the Rodman documentary will surpass the previous most-watched Vice film, with more than a million hits, which was an interview, by Smith himself, with Joshua Blahyi, known as &lt;a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/vice-news/butt-naked-in-liberia" title=""&gt;General Butt Naked, the cannibal warlord of Liberia&lt;/a&gt;. "Both are crazy stories with sad and tragic underpinnings," he says. "But a news story for us is the same as for everyone; we like our stories to punch you in the face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he ever feel that he weights his stories more to the punch in the face, and less to the sad and tragic underpinnings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The easy answer is no. If you look at the story we did about the slave labour camps of Liberia," he says, [another strand of the &lt;em&gt;Vice Guide to Liberia&lt;/em&gt;] "we broke the story, it was an important story. This guy General Butt Naked killed 20,000 people and ate some of them. I don't know how you would go about further sensationalising those facts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane Smith is a burly 42-year-old Canadian, whose vast glass-sided office is dominated at one end by a stuffed grizzly bear in front of a blown-up photo of the snow-capped Rockies. He is a direct and charming talker, but he carries just the vaguest hint that if there were any literal punching in the face to be done, he would not be taking a step back. The Vice offices are in a corner of&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/12/new-york-brooklyn-williamsburg-gentrification" title=""&gt; recently gentrified Williamsburg&lt;/a&gt;, on a street decorated with expensively commissioned graffiti and bookended by slightly contrived boho cafes. The office itself is on the site of a former brewery, but any sense that this is a sort of slacker's paradise is dispelled when you step inside, and teams of intense twentysomethings are busily convening everywhere you look to discuss this magazine spread, or that mobile platform, or the latest YouTube offering or marketing collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vice has come an awful long way from its origins as a free and underground music magazine in Smith's native Montreal 20 years ago. He created it with a couple of friends – having persuaded the city fathers to let them take over an earnest community title called the &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;. In the two decades since Vice dropped its middle "o" it has grown from being a "hipsters' bible", given away on street corners and in record stores, to a global brand with offices in 34 countries. The high-traffic online and documentary film incarnations of the Vice sensibility are about to spawn a 24-hour terrestrial news channel available in 18 countries. A documentary series in partnership with august HBO will include the Rodman and McAfee films. There is also a record label and an ad agency, Virtue, which numbers Nike and Dell among its clients. Announcing some of those departures at an industry event in Abu Dhabi last year, Smith envisioned "a changing of the guard within the media," and announced his ambition for Vice to become both the largest online media network in the world and "the voice of the angry youth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To back up this fighting talk, Spike Jonze, the disruptive intelligence behind the film &lt;em&gt;Being John Malkovich&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt; franchise, was recently installed as creative director. Two years ago a consortium that included Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP advertising group, and Tom Freston, founder of MTV, invested a reported $50m in Vice media. Since the company purchased Vice.com (formerly a porn site) the same year, revenues have doubled to a reported $200m in 2012, on which insiders suggest an unverified 20 per cent profit margin. Smith talks of 3,000 contributors, though the official payroll is about 850. The average age of a Vice journalist is 25, but scanning the screen-staring ranks of the magazine's newsroom that seems on the high side. It is easy to see why, on his visit here, Rupert Murdoch might suddenly have felt all of his 82 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith retains a centralised control of his ever-shoutier multi-platform mouthpiece. "We have a global editor, then we have domestic editors and content directors each country that we are in," he says. "They send in the stories they want to do and we say 'great, let's do it', or 'no, let's not do it'. And we make a call that this would be good for online, this would be good for mobile, this would be good for the mag, this would be good for TV and so on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remains insistently involved with every stage of that decision-making. "We are releasing so much content now," he says, "that there is a probability otherwise that it will run away with itself. You know, if you are Henry Ford you better give a shit about making cars. And if you are making grapple grommets you better give a shit about grapple grommets. We are in the business of creating content so I better give a shit about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before meeting Smith I've been trying to get a proper immersive sense of what that content might include. There is above all a sort of attention-deficit quality to Vice's output, shifting abruptly between tones and sensibilities. To take just the &lt;a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/magazine/20/1" title=""&gt;current magazine&lt;/a&gt; for example, lengthy closely reported articles about expat Jewish Americans settling illegally on the West Bank and the rise of Swedish fascism rub up against vaguely cruel spreads about Elvis lookalikes and high-concept fashion shoots. There is a voyeuristic &lt;em&gt;Dazed and Confused&lt;/em&gt; edge to a lot of it, done with the production values of &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, and occasionally the kind of easy misogyny that has seen the magazine banned from campuses (though Smith insists that the readership, particularly online, "is not skewed as much to the male as you might think – no more than 60 per cent"). Regular features include "Do's and Don'ts" which offers a surrealist commentary on random snapshots of people, fashion victims and other candidly photographed unfortunates, in the street or in clubs or bars, sometimes bleakly funny, sometimes laced with the kind of bullying rhetoric of anonymous blogging. Alongside that there is an indefatigable effort to find a musement in the world – there have been popular "Vice Guides" to everything from anal sex to Mecca – and a commitment to understanding, however brutally, or surreally, the margins of global culture. The writing owes something to the golden age of British style and music magazines, the &lt;em&gt;Face&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt; and the rest, self-consciously erudite or smugly postmodern, and something to the packaged curiosity, and patient storytelling, of &lt;em&gt;Reader's Digest&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith and his less visible co-founder Suroosh Alvi have the unusual ability both to curate this slightly dysfunctional mix and sell it smoothly to advertisers and anyone else who might listen. He gestures intermittently toward his and the magazine's "DIY punk origins", but you guess he was always more Malcolm McLaren than Johnny Rotten. "We were a quintessential Gen X magazine, and we are now a quintessential Gen Y company," he will say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does he define that particular alphabetical shift? I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Well," he says, "20 years ago we were the hipsters' bible and all that crap, and then we went online, and famously, or famously at least in Vice lore, we reinvented ourselves. We like to say, in reference to Dylan, 'We are not afraid to go electric'. We let our very high-profile editors go. We handed the thing over to kids straight out of school and let them run our magazine. And that has allowed us to become this Gen Y platform. It took us 10 years to get to a million copies of the magazine, and it took us one year to get to 10m uniques [online browsers] a month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how does he measure success himself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For me personally, you always think when you are starting out, I am going to make a nebulous amount of money, buy an island, wear an Amadeus wig and go naked and be crazy. But, you know, I was talking recently to Spike [Jonze] and he said 'Take money out of the equation. And ask yourself what would you do?' and I realised two things: first I would pay money to do the job I am doing, and second I wanted to build the next CNN, the next ESPN. And I also realised that given the digital revolution that is not only within my grasp, but I am frontrunner to get there. Once I realised money isn't the report card, and putting your imprint on the world's cultural fabric is possible, that is when we stopped scrabbling around on the periphery begging for money, and thought 'let's go for it'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may not sound much of a business plan, but the money duly followed "in buckets". It's in Smith's interest to say so, but you pretty much believe him when he suggests that every private equity firm or media corporation around has tried to buy Vice at one time or another. Rupert Murdoch was only the latest mogul enthusiast for the company, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had everyone in here. Hearst, Time, Condé, Google. It was funny, we were in a meeting with News Corp and Rupert walked in, and I said, 'You should come by the office some time, check out the shop'. And he said, 'Well let's go now'. So we drove out here and I walked him round, we had a drink in a bar round the corner. And I suppose because he is recognisable people started tweeting…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith explains Murdoch's fascination with Vice as only natural. He has the feeling that in the "boardrooms of every major media company they are saying, 'OK we need Gen Y, we need online, we need social, we need mobile, and we don't have any of that stuff. We need it globally, we need scale and we need to be able to monetise all that.' So they look around to see who ticks those boxes and eventually they come to us. They come out here and see all the kids working 18 hours a day and everyone really passionate. They think, 'Yes, we have cracked the internet code!' And they are so used to everyone saying yes, to people who have been waiting for their Amadeus wig all these years, that when we say actually we are not really interested in selling, they keep offering us more millions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;mith developed some of his business acumen in his gap year after studying political science at Carleton University in Ottawa, when he apparently set himself up as a black-market currency trader in Budapest at the time of the fall of Soviet communism. For a while he says, he was earning more in a day than doctors there earned in a week. That kind of thing. Having been "a real leftist, working for Greenpeace and all that" he consequently developed something of a taste for edgy capitalism. Even so, when he returned to Montreal and started the magazine, he couldn't understand how anyone could buy a car, or why you would want a mortgage. "But once you have a family and kids you realise the importance of those things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith has two daughters, now, aged three and one. I wonder, eyeing the grizzly bear at his shoulder, if fatherhood has put him more in touch with his feminine side?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is funny," he says, "I was in Libya with a bunch of mujahideen jihadists doing a story when I heard that my second baby would also be a girl, and when I told them they were all so thrilled, 'Allah has blessed you!' And I said I thought it was kind of interesting in such a male-dominated culture for them to be so excited that it was to be a daughter. They said "No! A man needs daughters, they will love you forever and never leave you, unlike sons who are off at the first opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith himself is a case in point in that regard. Though he talks about a very happy childhood, he also claims to have left home and got himself a job and a place to live aged 13 – "I was in a bit of a gang, a headstrong guy". Not for the first time, in talking to him, I have the sudden sense that his father, a pioneer computer programmer amongst other things, might have been something of a tough taskmaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He laughs when I suggest that. "He was. My dad has always been like me but on steroids, a lot smarter than I am, a lot tougher than I am, sort of a George Bernard Shaw: taught himself everything. But the thing was he was never happy. It's my luck that I am that much stupider than him. When I graduated, I had a paper published in this political journal and everyone was so proud, and I remember coming home and he just destroyed my thesis. He knew more about it than I did even though I had been studying the subject for years. And he wasn't trying to knock me down, he just knew a lot about everything, theoretical physics, whatever, but he could never get it across. I my case I kind of lobotomised myself with booze and drugs early on but the one thing I had, I could sell ideas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Smith suggests, he can hear his father's voice in his head, when things have been tough, when the magazine was failing to begin with, or when he has tried to launch in new cities. "When I was a kid my dad told me two things," he says. "Life isn't fair and you have to be both the strongest guy and the smartest guy. He thought it was important that I could build a house from scratch, so I worked alongside him as he built one. From when I was eight years old we would go and get a car from the junkyard and work out how to get it running. That was the weekend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given he was forced to grow up early, it's understandable perhaps that the dominant sensibility of Smith's creation should have been a kind of permanent adolescence. He recently had the idea for a TV series about the generally parlous state of the world, and the mostly juvenile political response to fixing it, entitled "Where are all the adults?" Then he realised that perhaps he had the opportunity to be a grown-up himself. With this in mind he seems to visualise a future in which Vice comes of age with him, and becomes the voice of a more politicised generation, the one just now realising that it has been shut out from the opportunities enjoyed by those who have gone before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the beginning," he suggests, in biblical fashion, of the first web generation, "there was this era online of let's just be cool and criticise everything, and we were very guilty of that. But as Josey Wales says, 'There comes a point when it is time to get busy living or it is time to get busy dying.' So we have been trying to say, OK we are going to go out and actually do stuff, get involved. We don't mind if people hate us, we would prefer them to love us, but we don't want indifference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of stuff will they do, though, beyond Rodman-style stunts? It is Smith's and therefore Vice's contention that we are approaching a kind of reckoning. The stories he is drawn to tend to have a red-in-tooth-and-claw apocalyptic component, whether he is documenting a two-week traffic jam in Mongolia, or featuring, as the current online offering does, the sewage flooded graveyards of Gaza, or describing what happens when you wear semen-scented perfume for a week. If you read only Vice, I'm pretty sure paranoia, possibly agoraphobia, would set in quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brand of stylised bleakness is evidence, he suggests, that "the cheque has now arrived – economically, geopolitically, environmentally – and the coming generation, Gen Y, are realising they are going to have to pay it. Would I like Vice to be a major part of the media that reflects that? Absolutely. If you look not just at the Arab spring, but at what I call the youth spring that has started in Europe, young people are starting to find a voice, and they are not looking to the traditional media to reflect that. CNN was made by the Gulf war. I think the economic crisis will prove to be our Gulf war. It is making young people very angry and we want to be the voice of that anger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His commitment to the absurdity of the modern condition is one part of that rage, he says. "A lot of what happens in the world is full-on crazy and doesn't get reported on. We want to change that." He doesn't believe that the outsider generation Vice is speaking to will adopt old-style party-based politics any time soon, but will assume instead a far more eclectic and scattershot range of anger and passion. "Going forward it's clear that advocacy will be a hugely powerful force. If you dislike what General Motors is doing, you can overnight create a movement to tell people to buy Ford. What we want to do is provide more and more information to this generation to help them to bring that kind of advocacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith is clearly a man who warms to themes. Having started him on this line of thinking, he quickly gets into his stride, lecturing me now on the complacency of the western world, now on Vice's crucial role as agit-proppers-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the early days it was kicking against the pricks," he says, at one point. "If we had received the press that we have gotten over this North Korea thing in the early days we would have all been walking up Broadway with our middle fingers in the air. We are not afraid to fight our corner, but we have a documentary team there still, we have a job to do. If that is growing up, then yes, we are growing up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith routinely reserves the full blast of his frustration for the media status quo, the commentators and the columnists who don't set foot out of the door of their office and blithely assume that the world is pretty much as it always was. He can quickly rouse himself to the full rhetorical anger of the midnight blogger, while all the time carefully positioning his business as both the authentic voice of the outsider, and the new mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"American media has just become talk radio, incredibly partisan name-calling and op-eds," he says. "I think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan proved it has completely failed to act as an effective fourth estate. And young people didn't sleep through that, as is widely believed, they learned instead not to trust what they were being told. Huffington Post and Drudge Report and all these things came up, exactly because people no longer had any faith in the traditional media. I am not saying either of those things are great, but they are a symptom of that loss of trust. I am not even saying Vice is great. I always say: if Vice has become a primary news source, then the world is completely fucked! I mean, we are still talking half the time about rare denim and sneakers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the fact is four corporations own all of American news, and they are all equally scared of losing Budweiser or whoever as their advertisers. The greatest propaganda coup of the American right has been to convince its citizens that we are in the grip of a liberal conspiracy. As a result, Obama is to the right of Richard Nixon on most issues. And there is we believe, certainly some space to exploit there." He pauses, smiles, concludes his lesson for the day. "And we, Vice, aim to exploit it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/vice-magazine"&gt;Vice magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media"&gt;Digital media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/magazines"&gt;Magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/rupert-murdoch"&gt;Rupert Murdoch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/new-york"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/investigative-journalism"&gt;Investigative journalism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timadams"&gt;Tim Adams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Police said the death was being investigated as unexplained and the search for hazardous materials was a precautionary measure. Reports said his body was discovered in a bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's death comes only months after he lost a high-profile and personally disastrous court case against fellow Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich. He had accused the Chelsea football club owner of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract in relation to a Russian oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the claims were dismissed, he was ordered by the high court to pay £35m of Abramovich's legal costs. His financial difficulties were recently exacerbated after his former mistress, Elena Gorbunova, 43, claimed Berezovsky owed her £5m in compensation over the sale of their £25m residence in Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky is said by friends to have become deeply depressed last year, not just because he lost to Abramovich, but because the damning judgment at the end of the case had so badly damaged his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businessman thought highly of the British legal system – explaining&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/13/topstories3.russia" title=""&gt; in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; six years ago that it had been one of the reasons he settled in the UK – and is said to have been distraught that the judge, Mrs Justice Gloster, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/humiliation-boris-berezovsky-battle-oligarchs" title=""&gt;described him&lt;/a&gt; as "dishonest", "unreliable" and even "deluded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One close friend said Berezovsky had taken antidepressants last year and had checked into the Priory clinic for a brief period about four months ago while being treated for depression, adding: "He was very, very low. He talked about suicide. He would say to me: 'It's all over, it's all finished, there's no point in anything – the best thing that could happen to me is that I have a heart attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I still don't believe he had the courage to take his own life – he loved life too much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the loss of his fortune, Berezovsky was said to have been concerned about his ability to support his children. He had six children by three women: his two ex-wives and Gorbunova. While two of his children are now in their 40s, two are in their 20s and his youngest are aged 12 and 10. The businessmen had been mired in a series of legal disputes, and is said to have been worn down by his long battles with the Russian state, during which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/jul/18/russia.internationalcrime" title=""&gt;there were reports&lt;/a&gt; that he had faced a number of assassination plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky, a Kremlin insider in the days of Boris Yeltsin, left Russia in 2000 after a quarrel with Vladimir Putin and has been the subject of an extradition order by Russia. He has appeared on Moscow's most wanted list since 2001 on charges of fraud, money-laundering and attempted interference in the Russian political process. A Russian court sentenced Berezovsky in absentia for embezzling $2bn from two major state companies. Moscow has repeatedly requested his extradition, though British authorities have not complied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had forged close contacts with a number of influential British figures around the time of the 1996 Russian election, which saw Yeltsin defeat a communist challenger, and was permitted to settle in the UK. In time, he changed his name to Platon Elenin, Platon being the name of a character in a Russian film based loosely upon his life. He was &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3421883.stm" title=""&gt;subsequently given a British passport&lt;/a&gt; in this name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Berezovsky said he had been told to leave by British police for his safety after the British security services claimed they had evidence of an assassination plot against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, he led a lavish lifestyle, with properties in London, the home counties and the south of France, a private plane and a 1927 Rolls-Royce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that was wiped out by the disastrous defeat in the Abramovich case. Last week he was reported to have been selling a £50,000 Andy Warhol portrait of Lenin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Russian lawyer, Alexander Dobrovinsky, said that Berezovsky "was in a dreadful, horrendous state; covered in debt, almost broke".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Putin's official spokesman, Berezovsky wrote a personal letter to the Russian president two months ago, asking for forgiveness. "Boris Berezovsky passed a letter personally written by him. He admitted that he made lots of mistakes and asked Vladimir Putin to forgive him," said Dmitry Peskov. "He asked Putin for a chance to come back to Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peskov said nothing about Putin's reaction to Berezovsky's letter, adding: "I can say that in any case information about somebody's death – whoever the person was – cannot bring positive emotions." In the UK, however, friends of Berezovsky cast doubt on this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Russia, Berezovsky's death was greeted with surprise, with former associates and observers offering opinion on his legacy and the possible causes of his unexpected demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was a rival of Berezovsky in the late 1990s and knew him well, said: "His life at the end was terrible … he lost money, he lost to Abramovich and he lost his wife … he not only suffered financially but also personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His minuses for the country were more than his pluses, but he wasn't too much of a devil – although he often wanted to look like a devil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prominent opposition activist Sergei Parkhomenko, talking to liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy about Berezovsky's differences with Putin, said: "We were talking once and we turned to the strange topic of health and illness. He told me: 'My health is yet another weapon. Who dies first, loses. And I never lose'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkhomenko added: "He didn't seem like a potential suicide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Feigin, a lawyer, who worked as a civil servant in the 1990s and met Berezovsky several times, said: "He was not a little person in politics and had unbelievable energy … things you couldn't do, Berezovsky could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the last few months he had been experiencing a full exhaustion of his internal reserves, maybe this caught up with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrei Sidelnikov, a Russian emigrant, told gazeta.ru he had known Berezovsky for 11 years. He said: "Such a person could never commit suicide. He was an exceptionally joyous person and, despite his various reverses in life, always remained as such. My personal opinion is that his death has either natural causes, or [is the work of] the Russian secret service. Everybody knows that Boris was Putin's enemy number one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIA Novosti, a state-run news agency, cited a source close to Berezovsky, saying he had died of a heart attack, and had recently undergone treatment for health problems in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 24 March 2013 to make clear that Berezovsky left Russia in 2000 rather than the 1990s, and because of a quarrel with Putin rather than claims of money laundering involving Aeroflot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abramovich-v-berezovsky-court-case"&gt;Abramovich v Berezovsky court case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simongoodley"&gt;Simon Goodley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktownsend"&gt;Mark Townsend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iancobain"&gt;Ian Cobain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/howard-amos"&gt;Howard Amos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They bear little relationship to the actual reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarks come as the prime minister, David Cameron, prepares to outline tough new measures to ensure that immigrants will have to have been settled in the UK for between two and five years before they can even get on the waiting list for social housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the bishop, who served on the board of the National Housing Federation and is a former chairman of South Yorkshire Housing Association, said: "The tone of the current debate suggests that it is better for 10 people with a legitimate reason for coming to this country to be refused entry than for one person to get in who has no good cause. It is wholly disproportionate as a response. It is especially galling in Holy Week, when Christians are remembering how Jesus himself became the scapegoat in a political battle, to see politicians vying with each other in just such a process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Studies show that the vast majority of new arrivals to the UK enhance and enrich our society, both economically and culturally. The true threats to our national wellbeing lie not with those who come to visit or make their lives here but with the increasing gap between the rich and poor among us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's tough line, to be outlined in a speech he is due to give on Monday, comes as the Tories, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all try to harden their rhetoric on immigration in response to concerns about an influx of Bulgarians and Romanians into the UK once transitional controls are lifted in January next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PM's pledge will also be seen as a response to the recent surge in support for Nigel Farage's Ukip, which calls for the UK to quit the EU and end the free movement of citizens from other member states into this country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/mar/23/opinion-poll-ed-miliband-next-pm" title="Poll shows 54% of voters expect Ed Miliband to be next prime minister"&gt;An Opinium/Observer poll&lt;/a&gt; out on Sunday puts support for Ukip at 16%, down 1% on a fortnight ago, but way ahead of the Lib Dems on 9% and just 12% behind the Conservatives on 28%. Labour, which may also be losing some support to Ukip, is down 1% on a fortnight ago at 38%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech, Cameron will claim the government has already got a grip on immigration – saying Labour is a "soft touch" – but will argue that incentives to come to the UK can be reduced by limiting the access immigrants have to housing provided by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will say that at present almost one in 10 new social lettings go to foreign nationals – the total rose from 6.5% in 2007/08 to 9% in 2011/12 – and that in future immigrants should know they cannot expect a new home on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers will therefore instruct councils, through new statutory guidance, to ensure that people must have lived in the same area for between two and five years before they can be allowed on to a waiting list for social housing. At present local authorities are allowed to set their own qualification criteria but ministers say many choose not to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exemptions will be made for UK nationals who have to move for work reasons, or because of family breakdown, in addition to the protections that exist for members of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Farage renewed his attack on the coalition parties and Labour over immigration, saying they operated an "open door" approach to eastern Europeans. Highlighting fears about a rush of Romanians and Bulgarians to the UK, Farage said voters wanted a party that ensured that the "benefits system in this country should be there to be used by British nationals" rather than foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid signs that the political parties are involved in an "arms race" of hardline anti-immigrant rhetoric, Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said Cameron appeared to be reacting to a problem that was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The available evidence shows that the pressure on social housing from the immigrant population is very small," he said. "Will this make any difference? It is highly unlikely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg abruptly dropped the Lib Dems' commitment to an amnesty on illegal immigrants, saying that although the idea still had merits, it was "seen by many people as a reward for those who have broken the law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The party's 2010 general election manifesto said it would give an amnesty to those who had been in the country for a decade, spoke English and had no criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband has admitted that the Labour government made mistakes on immigration and said that rights to benefits in the UK "should be looked at".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Labour sources said that Cameron's pledge, while it would be examined closely, appeared at first sight to "miss the point" because many councils already used existing powers to limit the access of immigrants to social housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source said that 95% of immigrants lived in private rented accommodation, often of low quality. The greater problem was that employers often lured immigrants to this country by offering them places in low-grade houses, charging them extortionate rent, and then paying them unreasonably low wages that undercut the rate for local workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/immigration"&gt;Immigration and asylum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ukip"&gt;UK Independence party (Ukip)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/nickclegg"&gt;Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/polls"&gt;Opinion polls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm"&gt;Toby Helm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Alexander Nekrassov, a former Kremlin adviser, said: "If it is the case that there will be a 25% levy on deposits greater than €100,000 then some Russians will suffer very badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then, of course, Moscow will be looking for ways to punish the EU. There are a number of large German companies operating in Russia. You could possibly look at freezing assets or taxing assets. The Kremlin is adopting a wait and see policy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nekrassov rejected suggestions that Russia might hit back by cutting off gas supplies, a tactic the country used in 2009 after the collapse of talks with Ukraine to end a row over unpaid bills and energy pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gas is no longer a weapon," Nekrassov said. "When Russia did that before, it realised that the foreign energy lobby reacted and efforts to find alternative sources were increased. If Russia kept threatening, it knows that nobody would be buying its gas in 20 years' time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Ingram, an analyst at City broker BGC Partners, said: "In Russia, historically, if they want an asset they just grab it. If they want cash out of a [EU] business [in Russia] they just create a tax bill or raid offices and make your life unpleasant. They could also make life difficult diplomatically on issues such as Syria. They might also rattle a few sabres over deployment of the missile defence system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a week of high-stakes brinkmanship, the EU, ECB and IMF – the so-called "troika" behind the rescue of five southern European countries – had refused to budge on its insistence that Cyprus raise €5.8bn of its own revenues to qualify for the bailout aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest levy plan reflected Nicosia's fast-dwindling options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week Cypriot MPs overwhelmingly rejected a similar levy proposal – even after it was adjusted to remove any charge on savings below €20,000 – triggering a week of tumult as Nicosia tried and failed to win financial support from Russia instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax on savings is unprecedented in Europe's handling of a debt crisis that has spread from Greece to Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. The crisis has reignited uncertainty about the future of the eurozone just as many EU leaders began to believe the worst was over for the single currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, uncertainty shrouding the island turned from unease on the streets, where people have rushed en masse to withdraw money from cash machines, to scenes of panic-buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inept handling of the crisis by politicians has exacerbated a dark mood with many Cypriots fearing that they stand to lose life savings following the government's decision to also raise funds by restructuring Laiki, the island's second biggest bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marios Panayides, 65, a protester outside the Cypriot parliament said: "Our so-called friends and partners sold us out. They have completely abandoned us on the edge of an abyss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers, facing cash-on-delivery demands from suppliers, warned stocks were running low. "At the moment, supplies will last another two or three days," said Adamos Hadijadamou, head of Cyprus's Association of Supermarkets. "We'll have a problem if this is not resolved by next week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cypriots fear the damage the levy would do to the country's offshore banking industry. Much of the Cypriot banks' capital was wiped out by the collapse of investments in Greece, the epicentre of the euro zone debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/european-central-bank"&gt;European Central Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith"&gt;Helena Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm"&gt;Toby Helm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simongoodley"&gt;Simon Goodley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He had accused the Chelsea football club owner of blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract in relation to a Russian oil company. After the claims were dismissed, he was ordered by the high court to pay £35m of Abramovich's legal costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His financial difficulties were recently further exacerbated after his former mistress Elena Gorbunova, 43, claimed that Berezovsky owed her $8m (£5m) in compensation over the sale of their $40m residence in Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Berezovsky's death emerged on a Facebook post yesterday that appeared to have been made by his son-in-law, Egor Schuppe. According to the post, Berezovsky was recently depressed and had failed to keep in touch with friends, often choosing to stay at home rather than socialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleksandr Dobrovinksy, head of the Moscow-based Alexander Dobrovinsky &amp; Partners law firm, claimed on his social network page that the 67-year-old former billionaire had killed himself. The statement read: "Just got a call from London. Boris Berezovsky committed suicide. He was a difficult man. A move of disparity? Impossible to live poor? A strike of blows? I am afraid no one will get to know now."Berezovsky had become a colourful and controversial figure in London life, firing off regular salvos at his nemesis in the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin. But his decision to take on the financial might of his former protege, Abramovich proved a grievous error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case left Berezovsky's reputation in tatters, as the high court judge ruling in the case described him as an "inherently unreliable witness", who was "deliberately dishonest" and viewed truth as a "transitory, flexible concept".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's legal bill is thought to have generated total fees of over £100m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details from the second high court battle in January, with Gorbunova, heard how his former partner of 20 years won a freezing order, reported to be $200m, on Berezovsky's assets after they split up last year amid claims he owed her money and was in dire financial straits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The asset freeze was thought to include two luxury properties Berezovsky was allegedly trying to sell in France which, she maintained, were promised to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence that the businessman was in serious financial difficulties also surfaced with recent reports that the exiled oligarch was attempting to auction off an Andy Warhol limited-edition portrait of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in the hope of paying off creditors and legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1987 portrait by the Pop Art pioneer has been estimated by Christie's to be worth between $45,000 and $75,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kremlin insider in the days of Boris Yeltsin, Berezovsky left Russia in the late 1990s after a money-laundering scandal invloving Aeroflot airlines and has been the subject of an extradition order by Russia. He has appeared on Moscow's most wanted list since 2001 on charges of fraud, money-laundering and attempted interference in the Russian political process. A Russian court sentenced Berezovsky in absentia for embezzling $2bn from two major state companies. Moscow has repeatedly requested his extradition although British authorities have not complied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Berezovsky said he had been told to leave England by British police for his own safety after the British security services claimed they had evidence of an assassination plot against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abramovich-v-berezovsky-court-case"&gt;Abramovich v Berezovsky court case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simongoodley"&gt;Simon Goodley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/marktownsend"&gt;Mark Townsend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
