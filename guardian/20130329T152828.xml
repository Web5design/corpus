The official KCNA news agency said Pyongyang and Washington could only settle their differences by "physical means".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also released pictures of Kim and his senior generals huddled in front of a map showing strike possibilities on both US coasts. Pyongyang has rockets that could easily wreak carnage on Seoul, but its longer-range missiles that might hit US Pacific bases are unproven and experts are sceptical of the threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the KPA (Korean People's Army), ordering them to be on standby for fire so that they may strike any time the US mainland, its military bases in the operational theatres in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in South Korea," KCNA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported there had been additional troop and vehicle movements at the north's mid- and long-range missile sites, indicating they may be ready to fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yonhap quoted a South Korean military source who said "sharply increased movements of vehicles and soldiers" had been detected recently at the sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on Friday, at the main square in Pyongyang, tens of thousands of North Koreans turned out for a 90-minute mass rally in support of Kim's call to arms, Associated Press reported. Men and women, many of them in olive drab uniforms, stood in arrow-straight lines, fists raised as they chanted: "Death to the US imperialists." Placards in the plaza bore harsh words for South Korea as well, including: "Let's rip the puppet traitors to death!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest flurry of hostile language came after the US flew two nuclear-capable stealth bombers over the peninsula on Thursday, dropping dummy munitions in joint military drills with South Korea. They flew from the US and back in what appeared to be the first exercise of its kind, designed to show America's ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes "quickly and at will", the US military said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, said the decision to send B-2 bombers to join the military drills was part of normal exercises and not intended to provoke North Korea. Hagel acknowledged, however, that North Korea's belligerent tones and actions in recent weeks had ratcheted up the danger in the region, and, he said, "we have to understand that reality".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia and China, both of which share a border with North Korea, both called for restraint. In thinly-veiled criticism of the US manoeuvres, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, expressed concern that "unilateral action is being taken around North Korea that is increasing military activity".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The north stepped up its rhetoric this month after the UN agreed a new round of sanctions to punish a nuclear test conducted on 12 February. Many experts believe the bellicose statements are aimed more at a domestic audience than at Pyongyang's international adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These sorts of threats are not new," said Dr James Hoare, the former British chargé d'affaires in Pyongyang. "It's theatre — it's like Peking opera, with lots of shouting and stamping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That said, it's always dangerous because if you up the rhetoric, someone might make a mistake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions run higher during joint US-South Korean military drills, such as the current exercise Foal Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seoul and Washington say the drills are defensive, but Hoare noted that they are also "big, and threatening" and that the north has always reacted to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Cathcart, an expert on North Korea at Queen's University, Belfast, said: "North Korea was completely levelled by American power in 1950-53. They had no air cover whatsoever. That did profound things to society and their concept of American power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is something that's also manipulated and instrumentalised [by the leadership]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

An estimated 1.2 million passengers are expected to fly out from Heathrow this weekend, and 570,000 are due to leave from Gatwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most popular destinations include Spain, Tunisia, Egypt and Florida – but southern European city breaks and ski trips are also in demand. Gatwick, a budget airline specialist, expects to break previous Easter records with 1.6 million passengers over the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who remain can expect below-average temperatures over the weekend, with the gauge falling below freezing in many parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/28/britain-coldest-march-since-1962" title=""&gt;coldest March since 1962&lt;/a&gt; and the fourth coldest since records began, the Met Office confirmed this week. The record lowest Easter temperature of -9.8C was set at Lagganlia, Inverness, on Easter Monday 1986. Temperatures hit -8.8C early Thursday in Aonach Mor, Inverness, and -6.7C at Great Dun Fell, Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government cold weather health warnings have been extended until Easter Monday – the first time the system has been used in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics from the Met Office show that from 1 to 26 March the UK average temperature was 2.5C, three degrees below the long-term average. This made it the joint fourth coldest March in the UK since records began in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is some good news: the weather is expected to remain dry across the country, with sunny spells. Easter Day should see more sunshine, particularly in the east and Scotland, which has dealt with severe snow fall in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the UK may see a white Easter with light but wintry showers forecast for eastern areas though these are likely to be isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday looks like having the best of the Easter weather, and may look spring-like with sunshine across most of the country, but temperatures will remain cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Met Office forecaster Sarah Holland said the sunshine would raise temperatures to five and six degrees in some places, though it is likely to feel significantly cooler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"March is usually a month of contrasts, but the weather will be more settled than we've seen it recently. Many people will see brighter spells than we've had for a while, but because of the winds it will feel a lot colder than it actually is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend looks set to join the list of unpredictable Easter bank holidays the UK has seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2011 was the UK's hottest Easter on record, with temperatures reaching 27.8 degrees in some parts of the south, but 2012 saw heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/easter"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport"&gt;Road transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/air-transport"&gt;Air transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The granting of bail appeared to have been key to his decision to return from Dubai to Pakistan last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the chances of him re-remerging as a political force in the land remain slight. Politicians from parties that might be able to provide the organisational muscle his own APLM lacks have kept their distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say Musharraf has grossly exaggerated his political pulling power. Prior to the shoe incident, he had attracted a flicker of interest on social media after posting a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/P_Musharraf/status/317148634300952576/photo/1" title=""&gt;picture of himself on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; exercising in the gym of his hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the focus of national attention remains fixed on preparations by the leading political parties for the election battle ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country also continues to be rocked by violence. On Friday a Taliban suicide bomber on a bicycle attacked the convoy of a paramilitary police commander in the turbulent city of Peshawar, killing 11 people including a four-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pervez-musharraf"&gt;Pervez Musharraf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jon-boone"&gt;Jon Boone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was the biggest gain in five months and followed a revised 0.4% rise in January, which was double the initial estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans were able to spend more because their income rose 1.1% last month. That followed January's 3.7% plunge and December's 2.6% surge. The huge swings reflected a rush to pay bonuses and dividends in December before taxes increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After-tax income increased 1.1% last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jump in income allowed consumers to put a little more away in February. The saving rate increased to 2.6% of after-tax income, up from 2.2% in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers spent more at the start of the year even after paying higher taxes. An increase in social security taxes has reduced take-home pay for nearly all Americans receiving a paycheck. And income taxes have risen on the highest earners. The tax increases both took effect on 1 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jump in spending and income suggests economic growth strengthened at the start of the year after nearly stalling at the end of last year. Consumer spending accounts for 70% of economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most economists predict the economy is growing at an annual rate of roughly 2.5% in the January-March quarter. That would be a vast improvement from the 0.4% growth rate in the October-December quarter, which was held back by slower company stockpiling and the sharpest defense cuts in 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflation, as measured by a gauge tied to consumer spending, increased 1.3% in February compared with a year ago. That's well below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, giving the central bank room to keep stimulating the economy without having to worry about price pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the tax increases haven't slowed the economy is companies have accelerated hiring and are slowly but steadily increasing wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month since November. That helped lowered the unemployment rate in February to a four-year low of 7.7%. Economists expect similar strong job gains in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most other signs point to an economy that is gaining momentum. Businesses are investing more in equipment and machinery, which has given factories a lift after a disappointing 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the housing recovery appears to be strengthening. In February, sales of previously occupied homes rose to the highest level in more than three years. The gains have helped lift home prices, which have made Americans feel wealthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock prices have also surged. On Thursday, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/28/s-p-500-record-high-wall-street"&gt;the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index closed at a record high of 1,569&lt;/a&gt;. That surpassed the previous record of 1,565 set in October 2007, a year before the peak of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets are closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/consumerspending"&gt;Consumer spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomicgrowth"&gt;US economic growth and recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"[T]here had been rumblings in the cardiac surgical community for some time that all was not well in Leeds and on Tuesday I had two phone calls which I found disturbing, both from highly respected, temperate surgeons who commenced the conversations by saying that they had to speak out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One was endorsing the suspicions of the Children's Heart Federation and the other raised issues over staffing levels in Leeds. Then ... at 4pm on Wednesday I had a call from an extremely agitated senior cardiologist who had a preliminary cut of some mortality data from Central Cardiac Audit Database, which showed that mortality for 2011-12 and 2010-11 was considerably higher than any other unit in the country and there was clear blue water between the Leeds mortality rate and other units, so as medical director I couldn't do nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leeds unit had been earmarked for closure by an NHS review, in order to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres, but on Wednesday a high court judge quashed the decision to shut it down, to the jubilation of campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said he had not received one complaint about care. "I think it is very odd indeed. On Wednesday we had jubilation in the area because we found out that the high court supported everything we said, that actually the decision to close Leeds was based on information that wasn't used properly," he said. "We have always been told it's safe at Leeds. Suddenly that's changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keogh and senior managers from the Care Quality Commission visited the hospital on Thursday to say it must stop all children's heart surgery there immediately. The review was expected to take three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Keatley Clarke, chief executive of Children's Heart Federation, wrote to the Care Quality Commission two and a half years ago to raise concerns about death rates, following up complaints with concerns about the difficulties parents were facing getting referrals in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart surgery can be very, very complex. The surgeons are working with quite vulnerable children and therefore the outcomes can't be guaranteed and often children, although their lives will be saved, may well end up with some level of learning disability or delay," she told Today. "And the feeling was, although it was a feeling, that that might be happening more in the Leeds area than elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie Boyle, chief executive of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust, apologised on Thursday night to affected parents and families and assured them patient safety was being put first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision has left many who campaigned to keep the unit open angry and confused. "We're mystified," said Sharon Cheng, from the Save Our Surgery group which is co-ordinating the fight to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds. "We don't know of anything that could justify this step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 600,000 people, including parents concerned at having to travel long distances for their children's care, signed a petition to keep the Leeds unit open after the NHS review said surgery should stop at hospitals in Leeds, Leicester and London to focus care at fewer, larger sites, to concentrate medical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of Leeds city council, Keith Wakefield, said he was "shocked at the timing of today's events". Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, called for Keogh to resign. In a statement on his website, Mulholland wrote: "To have arrived in Leeds and done this, without warning, just one day after the decision to close the Leeds unit was proved in a court of law to have been unlawful beggars belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe that Sir Bruce Keogh should resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe and Sustainable review, which has proved an exercise in how not to effect major change to the NHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/leeds"&gt;Leeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping"&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His illness has cast a shadow over the Easter holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mac Maharaj, spokesman for the South African presidency, said: "The presidency wishes to advise that former president Nelson Mandela is in good spirits and enjoyed a full breakfast this morning, 29 March 2013. The doctors report that he is making steady progress. He remains under treatment and observation in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like to repeat our appeal for the media and the public to respect the privacy of Madiba and his family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president is believed to be at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria and to have been visited by close family. This is his third stint in hospital in four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Jacob Zuma said people should "slow down the anxiety" about the health of the country's first black president, whom he referred to by his clan name, Madiba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course I have been saying to people, you should bear in mind Madiba is no longer that young and if he goes for check-ups every now and again, I don't think people must be alarmed about it," &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21970869" title=""&gt;Zuma told the BBC on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. "I would like to really say the country must not panic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if people should prepare for the inevitable, Zuma replied: "In Zulu, when someone passes away who is very old, people say he or she has gone home. I think those are some of the things we should be thinking about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he stressed that Mandela had been able to handle the situation very well so far. "Very few outstanding personalities in the world live to his level," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela was admitted for treatment shortly before midnight on Wednesday, his third stint in hospital in four months. He is believed to be at 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria and to have been visited by close family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama led wellwishers around the world in expressing hope for his speedy recovery. The US president said he was "deeply concerned with Nelson Mandela's health" and "we will be keeping him in our thoughts and prayers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "When you think of a single individual that embodies the kind of leadership qualities that I think we all aspire to, the first name that comes up is Nelson Mandela. And so we wish him all the very best."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said Mandela was as strong physically as he had been in leadership and character. His remarks came on Thursday as he met the leaders of Sierra Leone, Senegal, Malawi and Cape Verde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People around the world posted best wishes on Twitter. South African anti-apartheid activist Frank Chikane tweeted a call for prayers: "As we enter the Easter weekend we should dedicate our prayers for Tata Mandela for his speedy recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela has been mostly absent from the political scene for the past decade but remains a beloved symbol of the struggle against white-minority rule. He spent 27 years in prison, including 18 on Robben Island. He became South Africa's first black president after winning the country's first multiracial democratic election in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela has a history of lung problems dating to when he contracted tuberculosis as a political prisoner. He was in hospital briefly earlier this month for a check-up and spent nearly three weeks in hospital in December with a lung infection and after surgery to remove gallstones. That was his longest stay in hospital since his release from prison in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nelsonmandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/zuma"&gt;Jacob Zuma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidsmith"&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said the criminal charges were unwarranted in a business dispute that has since been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu Hui's arrest is the latest blow to the family and, Mo said, is particularly painful for his sister, Liu Xia, the wife of democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo. He was imprisoned in late 2008, and ever since he was awarded the Nobel prize two-and-a-half years ago, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/06/liu-xiaobo-wife-absurd-interview" title=""&gt;Liu Xia has been under house arrest&lt;/a&gt;. Isolated in an apartment with no phone or internet, she appears emotionally fragile, allowed only weekly visits with family members and a monthly visit to her husband in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest arrest "affected the whole family, especially Liu Xia, who is worried about her brother", said Mo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calls to the prosecutor's office in the suburban Beijing district of Huairou where Liu Hui is to be tried rang unanswered. Family members publicly declined comment, but privately one said the stress on the family is taking its toll. They are under close surveillance and have been warned not to talk to the media about Liu Xiaobo or Liu Xia, said the family member, who asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An associate of Mo's, who declined to be named, said Liu Xia skipped her February visit to Liu Xiaobo in Jinzhou prison 280 miles (450km) east of Beijing out of anger at the arrest of her brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities commonly put pressure on relatives and friends of government critics and political and religious dissidents as a way to try to keep them in line. Even by those standards, the treatment of the Liu family is severe and underscores how the Nobel award embarrassed the Chinese government, which bridles at criticisms of its human rights record and its authoritarian political system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used to interact with both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia's brothers and sisters, but now we have been completely cut off from them," said Pu Zhiqiang, an activist lawyer and family friend. "I think there is only one explanation about this: that the family has been the victim of repressive measures, which are cruel and cowardly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu Xiaobo, once a literary critic and university lecturer, had &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/liu-xiaobo-nobel-peace-prize-winner" title=""&gt;campaigned for peaceful democratic change for 20 years&lt;/a&gt; and been imprisoned three times before his current stint, an 11-year sentence for drafting a programmatic call for political reform called Charter '08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent arrest of the brother, Liu Hui, may be particular retaliation for two incidents that broke the security cordon around Liu Xia and her isolation in her fifth-floor apartment in central Beijing. Reporters from The Associated Press visited her briefly in December, getting into the building while the guards were apparently away at lunch. A few weeks later five Chinese activist friends did the same thing. In both cases Liu Xia appeared agitated and shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pu, the lawyer and Liu family friend, said arresting and prosecuting Liu Hui in an ordinary business dispute fits a pattern of selectively using the law to harass activists and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artist and prominent government critic Ai Weiwei has faced tax charges, for example, rather than a direct attack against his activism. "State security is increasingly using selective enforcement of the law," Pu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police previously arrested Liu Hui in April last year for the same real-estate dispute but then released him on bail in September, Mo said. According to the recent indictment, Liu represented a company from the southern city of Shenzhen in development deals in Beijing, and he and a partner pocketed 3m yuan (£318,000) that was claimed by another party to the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to go on trial in May, Mo said, even though the disputed funds have already been returned, and there's insufficient evidence of a crime. "This is irregular," Mo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/liu-xiaobo"&gt;Liu Xiaobo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I have to succeed because the country cannot wait. The crisis continues, my duty is to get France out of the crisis," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am confident in France. We are a country of great innovation … I need all French people, whatever their economic and social place. I am counting on our entrepreneurs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If viewers were looking for determination and a global vision, however, they were given a mix of detail and generalisations. "What are my priorities … my priority is growth. I want France to have growth. I have a duty to restore growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today, we have lower growth than expected, so I'm asking for an effort from everyone," Hollande said. "It's true we have asked businesses to make an effort above all those who have an international market … but everyone must participate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten months into his mandate, Hollande has the worst presidential popularity rating since 1981, according to a TNS Sofres poll for the centre-right Le Figaro magazine. Surveys show the French president has the support of only 27% of voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even leftwing supporters who backed Hollande in the May 2012 elections have been questioning his handling of the economy, which is teetering on the brink of recession amid a spate of industrial layoffs and unemployment at a 15-year high. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault's rating also fell 5 points to 28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment figures on Tuesday showed the number of jobless rose to 3.17 million last month, the highest since July 1997. Hollande has admitted that stuttering growth would make it harder to fulfil his pledge to stem the rise in unemployment by the end of 2013. "French people are asking 'Can we get out of this? Can we be the best?'," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president stood by his controversial temporary 75% "supertax" on high earners, rebuffed by France's highest court last year as unconstitutional. "I hope to introduce the 75% rate of tax … I will respect the decision of the constitutional court," Hollande said. "Those who have the highest salaries … cannot they make an effort for two years? I've always said it will be difficult for the next two years for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said pursuing a politics of austerity would lead to unwelcome results: "You want to see extremists, even neo-Nazis in Europe … where is the European interest? To prolong austerity risks not reducing deficits but at the same time risks populist governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I will not follow policies that lead Europe into austerity. Other European countries say only France can say these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the French military operation in Mali, Hollande said: "We have stopped a terrorist offensive … today, that France that was regarded as a coloniser is regarded as a liberator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/francois-hollande"&gt;François Hollande&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/kim-willsher"&gt;Kim Willsher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But he gave no timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus's difficulties have sent jitters around the fragile single European currency zone, and the imposition of capital controls has led economists to warn that a second-class Cyprus euro could emerge, with funds trapped on the island worth less than euros that can be freely spent abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech to civil servants in the capital, Nicosia, Anastasiades hit out at banking authorities in Cyprus and Europe for pouring money into a crippled Cypriot bank that now faces closure under the terms of the €10bn (£8.4bn) bailout plan that averted the immediate risk of financial meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How serious were those authorities that permitted the financing of a bankrupt bank to the highest possible amount?" Anastasiades said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to say more," he added. "Now is not the time to say who bears more or less of the blame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades clinched the last-ditch bailout in Brussels five days ago, but has faced a backlash from Cypriots angry at the price that came with it – the winding down of the island's second-largest bank, Cyprus Popular Bank or Laiki, and an unprecedented raid on deposits over €100,000 that could spell the end of Cyprus as a hub for offshore finance. The country faces steep job losses and a prolonged and deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president, barely a month in the job and wrestling with Cyprus's worst crisis since a 1974 war split the island in two, accused the 17-nation euro currency bloc of making "unprecedented demands that forced Cyprus to become an experiment". But he added: "We have no intention of leaving the euro. In no way will we experiment with the future of our country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European leaders have insisted the raid on big bank deposits in Cyprus is a one-off in their handling of a debt crisis that refuses to be contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But policymakers are divided, and the waters were muddied a day after the deal was inked when the Dutch chair of the eurozone's finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said it would serve as a model for the handling of future crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with a market backlash, Dijsselbloem rowed back. But on Friday European Central Bank governing council member Klaas Knot, a fellow Dutchman, said there was little wrong with his assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The content of his remarks comes down to an approach which has been on the table for a longer time in Europe," Knot was quoted as saying by Dutch daily Het Financieele Dagblad. "This approach will be part of the European liquidation policy," he said, in comments a spokesman said were accurately reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government initially said the controls would stay in place for seven days, but foreign minister Ioannis Kasoulides &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/28/cyprus-crisis-limits-bank-withdrawals" title=""&gt;said on Thursday they could last about a month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists warn it could be much longer before confidence in the Cypriot economy bounces back enough to lift the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The celebrated stage and screen star, one of Britain's best-known character actors, was 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tributes poured in for the actor, who died on Thursday at the University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire. Daniel Radcliffe, who starred alongside Griffiths in the Harry Potter films, said the actor made any room "twice as funny".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radcliffe said Griffiths had supported him at two key points in his career, when he first played the young Harry Potter and later when he made his stage debut in Equus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In August 2000, before official production had even begun on Potter, we filmed a shot outside the Dursleys', which was my first ever shot as Harry. I was nervous and he made me feel at ease," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seven years later we embarked on Equus together. It was my first time doing a play but, terrified as I was, his encouragement, tutelage and humour made it a joy. In fact, any room he walked into was made twice as funny and twice as clever just by his presence. I am proud to say I knew him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard E Grant, who played the title role in Withnail &amp; I, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RichardEGrant/status/317600544350945280" title=""&gt;paid tribute to his late co-star on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote: "My beloved 'Uncle Monty' Richard Griffiths died last night. Chin-Chin my dear friend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffiths was feted for his roles as Withnail's eccentric Uncle Monty in the cult classic and Hector, the unconventional teacher in Alan Bennett's play The History Boys, for which he won the Laurence Olivier Award for best actor, the Drama Desk Award for outstanding actor in a play, the Outer Critics Circle Award for best featured actor in a play, and a Tony Award for best performance by a leading actor in a play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gained widespread fame as grumpy Uncle Vernon in the Harry Potter films and was much loved as disillusioned police officer and pie chef, Inspector Henry Crabbe, in the successful TV detective drama series Pie In The Sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theatre, said Griffiths' "army of friends" would be devastated by his unexpected death. "Richard Griffiths wasn't only one of the most loved and recognisable British actors – he was also one of the very greatest," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His performance in The History Boys was quite overwhelming: a masterpiece of wit, delicacy, mischief and desolation, often simultaneously. But that was just one small part of a career that spanned Shakespeare, cutting-edge new plays and major work in film and television."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hytner, who directed Griffiths in The History Boys and The Habit Of Art, added: "His currency as an actor was truth; as a colleague it was hilarity. His anecdotes were legendary. They were, literally, endless. They would go on for hours, apparently without destination, constantly side-splitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only way to stop them was to tell him you were walking away, though there were always others in the audience so, as far as I know, he never stopped. He was the life of every party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thea Sharrock, who directed Griffiths in Equus, Heroes and Sunshine Boys, said: "I worked with Richard more times than any other actor. Everybody knew he was my favourite. He was the most tender, gentle, kind, generous, loving man. His curiosity was unending, as was his striving for perfection. I cannot imagine a world without all those stories. I will miss him so very, very much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The producers of Heroes and Equus, David Pugh and Dafydd Rogers, said the actor was a "great man, a great character, a great talent greatly missed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griffiths, the son of a steelworker, was born in Thornaby-on-Tees, North Yorkshire, in 1947 were he cared for his deaf parents. He left school at 15 but later studied drama, before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company. He married Heather Gibson in 1980 after they met during a production of Lady Windermere's Fan in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His portly stature, which made him instantly recognisable on screen, was thought to have been caused by medication he was given as a youngster. He was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His agent, Simon Beresford, said his thoughts were with Griffiths' wife and family. "Richard brightened my days and enriched the life of anyone he came into contact with. On stage he allowed us to share in our own humanity and constantly question our differences," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Richard gave acting a good name.

There has been a long-standing dispute about the number of deaths at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been rumblings in the cardiac surgical community for some time that all was not well in Leeds," Keogh told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "On Tuesday I had two phone calls which I found disturbing, both from highly respected, temperate surgeons who commenced the conversations by saying they had to speak out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surgeon was concerned about the referrals process at the hospital, while the other was worried about staffing levels, he said. Preliminary data revealed this week shows mortality in the hospital's child congenital heart surgery unit was around twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't do nothing. I was really disturbed about the timing of this. I couldn't sit back just because the timing was inconvenient, awkward or would look suspicious, as it does," Keogh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Leeds unit had been earmarked for closure by an NHS review, to concentrate children's heart surgery in fewer bigger centres, but on Wednesday a high court judge quashed the decision to shut it down, to the jubilation of campaigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, who has led a cross-party campaign to keep the unit open, said he had not received one complaint about care. "I think it is very odd indeed. On Wednesday we had jubilation in the area because we found out that the high court supported everything we said, that actually the decision to close Leeds was based on information that wasn't used properly," he said. "We have always been told it's safe at Leeds. Suddenly that's changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keogh and senior managers from the Care Quality Commission visited the hospital on Thursday to say it must stop all children's heart surgery there immediately. The review is expected to take three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Keatley Clarke, chief executive of charity the Children's Heart Federation, wrote to the Care Quality Commission two and a half years ago to raise concerns about death rates, following up complaints with concerns about the difficulties parents were facing getting referrals in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart surgery can be very, very complex. The surgeons are working with quite vulnerable children and therefore the outcomes can't be guaranteed and often children, although their lives will be saved, may well end up with some level of learning disability or delay," she told Today. "And the feeling was, although it was a feeling, that that might be happening more in the Leeds area than elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie Boyle, chief executive of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals trust, apologised on Thursday night to affected parents and families and assured them patient safety was being put first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision has left many who campaigned to keep the unit open angry and confused. "We're mystified," said Sharon Cheng, from the Save Our Surgery group which is co-ordinating the fight to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds. "We don't know of anything that could justify this step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 600,000 people, including parents concerned at having to travel long distances for their children's care, signed a petition to keep the Leeds unit open after the NHS review said surgery should stop at hospitals in Leeds, Leicester and London to focus care at fewer, larger sites, to concentrate medical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leader of Leeds city council, Keith Wakefield, said he was "shocked at the timing of today's events". Greg Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, called for Keogh to resign. In a statement on his website, Mulholland wrote: "To have arrived in Leeds and done this, without warning, just one day after the decision to close the Leeds unit was proved in a court of law to have been unlawful beggars belief. I believe that Sir Bruce Keogh should resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe and Sustainable review, which has proved an exercise in how not to effect major change to the NHS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping"&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We are confident in the quality of the care provided by our staff and hope they will bear with us during this difficult time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children's heart surgery unit at the hospital was earmarked for closure under NHS plans taken last July aimed at streamlining services which would have seen operations being carried out at fewer and more specialised centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A campaign was launched to stop the site from closing which culminated in a legal battle at the High Court on Wednesday where the plan was quashed after a judge ruled the consultation process had been unfair and legally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon Cheng, a member of Save our Surgery - the group co-ordinating the campaign – expressed her shock at the decision to suspend children's heart surgery at the hospital. "We're mystified. We don't know anything that could justify this step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the CQC confirmed it had received claims that the hospital had resisted sending patients for treatment at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital – a unit that would remain open under the original NHS restructuring plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital strongly denied "any suggestion that we would act improperly either by restricting referrals or by failing to carry out surgery where either of these actions was the right thing to do".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS England said the decision to suspend children's heart surgery at the hospital was a "highly responsible precautionary step" while checks were made to ensure the unit was operating safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Bruce Keogh, the Medical Director of NHS England, said: "Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information. It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers. But it is absolutely right not to take any risks while these matters are being looked into. The priority must be the safety of children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cass-jones"&gt;Cass Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I've got nothing against you, I think you are wonderful, you are absolutely marvellous right across the Today programme, without exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it just doesn't fit in with what I am doing in the morning. Never would be an exaggeration, but I do very occasionally, but it is very rare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking from a "snowy Kent", the archbishop told of two news stories he had seen this week about the Cypriot banking crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good editing of that paper made me see two views. The impact was more powerful because neither made any comment, they just told the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the different accounts of the crucifixion there is a similar grim sense of factual narrative. The remorseless process of crucifixion is recounted sparingly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Good Friday is an extraordinary day. Whoever you are, whether rulers and rich or ordinary people dealing with the worst of times, the death of Jesus is both a challenge and a promise of hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welby will play the theme tune from the BBC sitcom The Vicar of Dibley when he makes his radio presenting debut on Easter Sunday by hosting a Classic FM breakfast programme.

A 23-year-old man who does not work for the police was also arrested and bailed until May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CPS spokesman said: "We have received initial papers but we have not received a full file of evidence and we now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also since been called into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 30 detectives have taken statements from all 800 officers in the DPG, which is tasked with protecting government officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland Yard is currently trying to find out how the Sun and Daily Telegraph obtained information about the "plebgate" row and if it came from police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also looking at a police officer's claim to have witnessed the altercation between Mitchell and officers in Downing Street, and allegations by Mitchell that police had lied in a log dated 19 September 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressure on Mitchell intensified when the Daily Telegraph published the log.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell's lawyer Graham Atkins indicated that further legal action could follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can confirm that I recently issued proceedings for libel against the owners of the Sun on behalf of Andrew Mitchell MP," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a number of other potential actions being considered but I do not intend commenting any further at this stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/andrew-mitchell"&gt;Andrew Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/sun"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sources suggested he had been suffering from a bad cold and was being given oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac Maharaj, a spokesman for the country's presidency, &lt;a href="http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=15133" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "The doctors advise that former president Nelson Mandela is responding positively to the treatment he is undergoing for a recurring lung infection. He remains under treatment and observation in hospital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the 94-year-old by his clan name, Maharaj added: "The presidency thanks the media and the public for their co-operation in respecting the privacy of Madiba and his family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health scares around Mandela occur with increasing frequency and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/15/mandela-house-cameras-media" title=""&gt;put many South Africans on edge&lt;/a&gt;. This is the third time in four months that he has been hospitalised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nobel peace laureate was admitted to an unnamed hospital just before midnight on Wednesday, Maharaj said. "Doctors are attending to him, ensuring that he has the best possible expert medical treatment and comfort."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday afternoon TV crews set up cameras outside 1 Military Hospital in Pretoria, a likely location for Mandela's treatment. Soldiers guarded the gate and turned away journalists trying to enter the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela contracted tuberculosis during his 27-year imprisonment for leading the resistance to white minority rule in South Africa. He has repeatedly had lung problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also become increasingly frail in recent years and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/09/nelson-mandela-hospital-admission" title=""&gt;spent a night in hospital&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month when he underwent what was described as a scheduled medical test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December Mandela spent three weeks in a hospital in Pretoria, where he was treated for a lung infection and had a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/23/nelson-mandela-remain-hospital-christmas" title=""&gt;procedure to remove gallstones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Zuma, the South African president and a fellow ex-prisoner on Robben Island, wished him a speedy return to health. "We appeal to the people of South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba and his family and to keep them in their thoughts," he said. "We have full confidence in the medical team and know that they will do everything possible to ensure recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Mthembu, national spokesman for the governing African National Congress, &lt;a href="http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=10149" title=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "The African National Congress calls on all South Africans and the world to keep Nelson Mandela in their prayers as he has been admitted at the hospital again for lung infection treatment. We are confident that the treatment will be successful as he is in professional and competent hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During these trying times we wish President Mandela well and for his family to be strong. We also appeal to all South Africans to afford Madiba's family deserved privacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mmusi Maimane, national spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), &lt;a href="http://www.da.org.za/newsroom.htm?action=view-news-item&amp;id=12023" title=""&gt;added&lt;/a&gt;: "The DA is saddened by news this morning that Nelson Mandela has been hospitalised for a recurring lung infection. We hope and pray that he will have a speedy recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that he will be in the thoughts and prayers of many people around the world today. We wish him, his family and friends all the best in this difficult time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandela, who is retired but remains a potent political symbol, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/11/world-cup-final-nelson-mandela" title=""&gt;last made a major public appearance&lt;/a&gt; when South Africa hosted the 2010 football World Cup finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has since preferred to live quietly in the rural village of Qunu in Eastern Cape province, where he grew up. He was visited there in August by Hillary Clinton, then US secretary of state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors said in December that he should remain at his home in the Johannesburg suburb of Houghton to be close to the best available medical facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nelsonmandela"&gt;Nelson Mandela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidsmith"&gt;David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In his first interview since that decision, he explains his anger, and his hopes for the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robbie Rogers needs to be brave again on another freezing morning in east London. Even walking down the stairs to open the big black door to his apartment takes courage – for this is how the next stage begins. Once the door swings open he will be back on an emotionally bruising ride into the open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that, last month, &lt;a href="http://robbiehrogers.com/blog/2013/2/23/the-next-chapter" title=""&gt;Rogers told the world the truth about himself in 408 crisp words&lt;/a&gt; which, on his website, confirmed that, "Life is simple when your secret is gone. Gone is the pain that lurks in the stomach at work, the pain from avoiding questions, and at last the pain from hiding such a deep secret."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers, who has represented the United States in 18 international football matches, was signed by Leeds United in January 2012. His time at the club was blighted by injury but he played briefly for Leeds and this season, on loan, for Stevenage. He left Leeds "by mutual consent" three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers then became only the second gay footballer in Britain to come out in public. Justin Fashanu, his solitary predecessor, hanged himself in 1998 in Shoreditch, just a short walk from where Rogers now lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Secrets can cause so much internal damage," Rogers wrote. "People love to preach about honesty, how honesty is so plain and simple. Try explaining to your loved ones after 25 years you are gay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers, from a close-knit conservative Christian family in America, has kept the world at a safe distance since &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2013/feb/15/robbie-rogers-comes-out-gay-soccer" title=""&gt;coming out&lt;/a&gt;. He has been besieged with large offers of money for interviews and contracts, as well as moving emails from thousands of people who have thanked him or asked how they might uncover the truth about themselves. Rogers has turned down every money-man; but he has written to some ordinary people. Today marks a big step forward for himself and, as he says, "people like me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a day of fierce cold, beneath a heavy grey sky, Rogers is a long way from home. As a self-confessed Californian dude who grew up playing soccer, surfing and going to church in a sun-kissed place, he misses his family. But Rogers needs to be strong when talking for the first time in public about his sexuality and all it took to reach a point of honesty as pure as it is still raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside his rented flat, while Rogers makes coffee and introduces me to Jeffrey, his five-month-old dog and close pal, he is relaxed. It helps that we had met a week before, to discuss if and how we might talk, but Rogers admits his trepidation: "It felt scary when this day was coming close. First, it was a case of I'm never going to come out. Next, I'm going to come out to my friends and family. And then I'm going to come out to the world and do interviews? It's like: 'Oh, my gosh, what's next?' So last night I was nervous – but excited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backdrop for a professional sportsman is so harsh that coming out usually feels impossible. There have been notable exceptions – from the Welsh rugby player &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/may/04/gareth-thomas-gay-interview-crusaders" title=""&gt;Gareth Thomas &lt;/a&gt;to the Puerto Rican boxer &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/18/orlando-cruz-gay-boxer-interview" title=""&gt;Orlando Cruz&lt;/a&gt;. Yet even those hard and violent trades are more forgiving than the tribal world of football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is still loved by so many of us, and mythologised as "the beautiful game", but football has long been a place where bigotry, greed and ignorance thrive. Rogers will become a symbol and a spokesman but it's important to remember that, more than just a pioneering gay footballer, he is a 25-year-old man who stepped out of the shadows of his secret history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a very happy childhood," he says. "Very story-book. Conservative, Catholic family. Five kids. I'm the middle child so [Rogers laughs] I was destined to be gay. California is amazing and, all the while, I had a football at my feet. We had this giant driveway and I'd kick the ball up and down for hours. I loved it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers also fell in love, in a one-way long-distance relationship, with Arsenal. He sounds smitten when remembering the great Arsenal team of a decade ago, Arsene Wenger's side of steel and subtlety which went unbeaten through an entire Premier League season. "It's tough being an Arsenal fan right now, but I fell for the beauty and toughness of that team. They had such beautiful players. Patrick Vieira was so hard he could kill someone, and then he'd pop the ball on his chest and hit this dink of a pass with such artistry. When we were playing in the streets my team was always Arsenal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid gorgeous days of sunshine and soccer, with Rogers being talented enough to make national youth squads from 14 onwards, conflicting emotions unfurled inside him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started feeling very different and it was a case of, 'All right, I'm good at football and I get attention from girls. Why don't I want that? What's wrong with me?' I realised I was gay when I was 14 or 15. I was like, 'I want to play football. But there are no gay footballers. What am I going to do?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You feel such an outcast. I just couldn't tell anyone because high school in the States is brutal. You're going through puberty and kids can be vicious. I was lucky my older sisters were cool people and I was the football guy. All these things made it easier to mask myself. But it was also difficult. You have girls coming on to you and you're like, 'Shit, it would be a lot easier if they weren't interested and I could just play football.' I kept saying: 'I can't go out because I have training today or a match tomorrow.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Rogers force himself to go out with girls as a way of appearing 'normal'? "Of course. Yeah. I tried to change myself. I would date beautiful, intelligent, amazing girls – if I was straight maybe I would have been going nuts. Some of them are still my friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year at the Dutch club Heerenveen, Rogers excelled on his return to America where, at Columbus Crew, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL6Cg1P-FRU." title=""&gt;he helped his team win the MLS Cup in 2008&lt;/a&gt;. "We won that trophy in LA, in front of my family, with this amazing team. Afterwards we went to a bar and I was like, 'I should be so happy now…' But I left after a few drinks and sat on my own in my room, thinking, 'OK. I'm gay. But I can't come out because I love football so much. What am I going to do?' The more successful you become the harder it is to step away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, Rogers became acutely aware of the impossibility of being a publicly-out gay footballer. He was an established international and his most recent caps had been won under Jürgen Klinsmann – whose first game in charge ended in a draw, against Mexico, after an &lt;a href="http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6852098/united-states-draws-mexico-jurgen-klinsmann-debut-coach" title=""&gt;equaliser from Rogers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he understood the bitter truth: "In football it's obviously impossible to come out – because no-one has done it. No one. It's crazy and sad. I thought: 'Why don't I step away and deal with this and my family and be happy?' Imagine going to training every day and being in that spotlight? It's been a bit of a circus anyway – but that would have been crazy. And you wouldn't have much control because clubs are pushing you in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just fearful. I was very fearful how my team-mates were going to react. Was it going to change them? Even though I'd still be the same person would it change the way they acted towards me – when we were in the dressing room or the bus?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all professional sport, dressing room "banter", in that euphemistic phrase, can be callous. "Especially football," Rogers stresses. How did he react when homophobic quips were made – even though his team-mates were oblivious to his sexuality? "There were different emotions. Sometimes I would feel bad for them. Sometimes I would laugh because it was kinda funny. And, sometimes, it got malicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was when I would get this awful feeling in my stomach. I would turn my head and try to chat about other things. They often don't mean what they say. It's that pack mentality – they're trying to get a laugh, they're trying to be the top guy. But it's brutal. It's like high school again – on steroids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers speaks warmly of individual footballers. "They're amazing people, really. Professional footballers are very interesting and from all walks of life. They have great stories when you get them away from the banter and the pack. They can really open up. To become a professional footballer there is something special about you. You need this drive, this hunger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there is also something diseased at the heart of professional football – epitomised by its attitude towards homosexuality. "Football is an amazing sport," Rogers says. "But it is also a brutal sport that picks people up and slams them on their heads. Adding the gay aspect doesn't make a great cocktail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if Rogers had still been playing for Leeds when he came out? "That would have been interesting," he says wryly. "I don't think I would have been able to go training the next day. That would be so scary. The guys might have said, 'That's great, Robbie.' Maybe. But because no-one's done it and because of the things I've heard in the dressing room I just thought: 'I need to get away from this – make my announcement, find peace, go from there.' So I can never imagine announcing that at Leeds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could he have come out while playing for Columbus in the US? "No. Not at any club – anywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, back in this country, if he was playing for Leeds and they were away to Millwall today? "Woah!" Rogers exclaims. "I can't even think about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We end up laughing, helplessly, which shows how much football has to change. "Definitely. Maybe a lot of fans aren't homophobic. But, in a stadium, sometimes they want to destroy you. In the past I would have said: 'They don't know I'm gay so it doesn't mean anything.' But, now they know it, am I going to jump in the stands and fight them?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be incredibly powerful if a gay footballer could face down that hate and abuse – just as black sportsmen like Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali stood up to racism in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sure," Rogers says. "I've thought about that. I might be strong enough but I don't know if that's really what I want. I'd just want to be a footballer. I wouldn't want to deal with the circus. Are people coming to see you because you're gay? Would I want to do interviews every day, where people are asking: 'So you're taking showers with guys – how's that?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're playing well it will be reported as: 'The gay footballer is playing well.' And if you have a bad game it'll be: 'Aw, that gay dude … he's struggling because he's gay.' Fuck it. I don't want to mess with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the response to his coming out seems to have been &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/the-shin-guardian-blog/2013/feb/18/robbie-rodgers-coming-out-gay-america" title=""&gt;overwhelmingly positive&lt;/a&gt;. "It's been very warm, very accepting. Guys I played with have sent messages saying, 'You know I was joking when I said that?' I say, 'Bro, don't worry about it. You were hilarious. Don't worry.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He becomes thoughtful when asked if he knows any gay footballers. "No. Even now, one of my best friends said: 'Do we know anyone else in football who could possibly be gay?' And we couldn't think of anyone. We're such great actors because we're afraid to let people know who we are. We've been trained by our agents how to do interviews, how to present ourselves. No footballer has since said to me, 'Robbie, thank you, I'm gay too…' I don't know if anyone will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many gay men, surely, are playing professional football? "Of course. Tons. I mean footballers dress really well [he laughs]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could he imagine a young gay footballer knocking on his manager's door to ask for advice? "It would be so tough. Would I have had the same opportunities when I was younger if I'd come out? I don't think so. There would have been that mentality: 'Oh he's gay … how will that affect the team?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way in which Fashanu was treated has been a bleak warning to any gay footballer. He might have been a million pound player but Brian Clough, one of the greatest managers this country has produced, demeaned him at Nottingham Forest as "a bloody poof." Fashanu's tragic end should never be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I read a little about him," Rogers says. "It's such a sad story because my coming out was so positive. I wish everyone could have that same support. If people say bad things about you, you can give your parents a call. But hearing &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2116058/Justin-Fashanu-gay-says-John-Fashanu.html" title=""&gt;comments Justin's family made&lt;/a&gt; – oh my gosh."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we consider the way in which Clough treated Fashanu at Forest, Rogers says: 'I've heard it recently from coaches. Obviously they're not homophobic but they'll say: 'Don't pass the ball like a fag.' That's when you look at them and think, 'Fuck you. What are you talking about? Does it make a difference, if you're gay or straight, as to how you pass the ball? Are you on drugs?' I guess they say it because they think it's funny. There's the stereotype of a gay man being soft and flamboyant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers sounds like a necessary force for change. He shrugs. "About a month ago I would've thought: 'I don't want to be a spokesman for gay footballers.' I have so many different things I'm interested in. But after thousands of emails, I'm thinking, OK, how can I help others? How can I make some positive change? How am I going to reach young Robbie and tell him to be himself? He might not fit the gay or the football stereotype. That's one thing I definitely want to do – break some barriers and kill some stereotypes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footballer smiles at Jeffrey. "I'm saying all this with a gay dog sitting on my lap. It's ridiculous. But I'm ready to share my story and help people any way I can – but on my terms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last December Rogers wrote the 408 words which changed his life. "I was sitting on my bed, lights off, on my laptop, in a good place. Pure emotion poured out of me and the words came easy. I didn't even proof-read it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week earlier I'd told Rogers how, when I showed his blog to my teenage daughter, she described it as a beautiful piece of writing. "I told my mom that," Rogers says. "When I wrote it I thought I'd maybe never post it because I was still a footballer at Stevenage then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 15 February, Rogers "didn't even know I was posting it that day. I was talking to a friend and he said, 'Dude, send it out or don't. It's getting annoying.' My laptop was sitting there. So I thought, 'Let me post it. What can happen?' I posted my blog and went to Shoreditch House. I had a bunch of drinks and pizza. I got a little drunk. It was a case of, 'All right, I did it!'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did he harbour any doubts? "No! My friend was checking his Twitter. He told me: 'It's going nuts.' I said: 'It doesn't matter. My phone's off. No one can reach me. I'm totally free.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had already taken his first steps towards freedom when he told his eldest sister. "Alicia is a strong character, opinionated, but very cool and lovely. I said, 'I'm sending you an email now as I need to get all my feelings down. Read it and then call me.' It was a long letter but she seemed to read it in 10 seconds. She Skyped me back and I was like 'OK, here we go.' We talked forever. She was so loving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She kept saying 'Robbie, it doesn't matter. I'm just so happy you're at peace.' My sister is very religious. I was afraid to tell her but it was great. She said: 'OK, how are you going to tell mom, what are you doing next, are you dating anyone?' It was a huge interview. I was so happy. It was like: 'Whew, that weight's gone…'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother was equally supportive. "When I told her, she made me cry. She was so loving and positive. I was expecting her to be apprehensive but she just said: 'I love you so much.' There's that line I wrote – 'Honesty is a bitch but it makes life so clear and simple.' My mom said it's great you can be honest about everything. People might disagree but at least you tell them the truth. People will see you're authentic.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides that authenticity, Rogers is also smart. He has today all mapped out. Before he talks later, via Google, to the New York Times, we do another interview at lunchtime. This time we're filmed for a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts" title=""&gt;Google+ Hangout&lt;/a&gt; in central London. We feel awkward, especially me, rehashing an interview which had felt so spontaneous during an old-fashioned one-to-one at his apartment. But Rogers doesn't mind. The aim of working with Google is to produce segments of him talking which can be viewed discreetly. A secretly gay person might feel unable to sit with their family and watch him on a television chat show – but they can choose to hear his story in private on their laptops or phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future, for Rogers, appears intriguingly open-ended. He flies to New York this weekend and will meet people at Ralph Lauren so they can decide whether he is suited to their new campaign. He has also won himself a place at the London School of Fashion and could begin a three-year course in September. But he might just have enough talent, contacts and nous to concentrate on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Halsey44" title=""&gt;Halsey&lt;/a&gt; – the menswear brand he co-owns in LA. And then, of course, there is football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most days I wake up and I go to my computer and look at my emails and then go onto the football sites. Football will always be part of me. I don't know if I'm done playing yet. I might ask [the coach] Bruce Arena if I can train with LA Galaxy – we'll see. I miss it and think about it a lot. But I'm so happy now I don't want to mess with that. Football was my life and maybe I'll need to go back … or maybe I'll just be a fan. But it's an industry where there are lots of problems – from sketchy agents to homophobic culture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, and never forgetting that Justin Fashanu was black, we've discussed the way in which certain prejudices have shifted. In the 1980s, some white men in English football voiced their belief that black players "disappeared" when winter began to bite. Black footballers were dismissed as psychologically weak and tactically inept. Bananas were thrown at great players like John Barnes. There is still racism now, but life has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Rogers believe that, eventually, similar progress can be made in overcoming football's last taboo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes. I know things will change. There will be gay footballers. I just don't know when and how long it will take. The next step is how do you create an atmosphere where men and women feel it's OK to come out and continue to play? It's a great question. Football has so much history. It's a great sport with so much culture and tradition. But I'm positive there will be changes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's sobering to consider how far this old game needs to move before it includes gay players. Yet the battle will be fought more intently now; and Rogers will play his groundbreaking role with intelligence, resilience and wit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His own struggle has already been won and he laughs when he sees all the hip young things at Google crooning over Jeffrey. "You'll have to get that dog an agent," I suggest. "Oh," Rogers says, rolling his eyes, "I'm his agent. I'm happy for him to take my shine." He smiles, scooping up Jeffrey, and says, "Hey, we're done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest day of revelation is over, and the secrets and shadows of his past retreat still further. Robbie Rogers appears much more than just a lone gay footballer now. He looks 25 again, with the rest of his life stretched out before him, studded with promise and opportunity and, most of all, happiness and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights"&gt;Gay rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality"&gt;Sexuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/us-sport"&gt;US sports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/usfootballteam"&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/mls"&gt;MLS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/stevenage"&gt;Stevenage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/heerenveen"&gt;Heerenveen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/columbus-crew"&gt;Columbus Crew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/robbie-rogers"&gt;Robbie Rogers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/donaldmcrae"&gt;Donald McRae&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Less than 100 days ago that happened. And the entire country was shocked, and the entire country pledged we would do something and this time would be different. Shame on us if we have forgotten. I have not forgotten those kids. Shame on us if we have forgotten," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said he expected votes in the Senate on gun reform measures soon after Congress returns from its Easter break on 8 April. The relatively modest package of measures he proposed in January has already been scaled back, with a ban on military-style automatic weapons effectively scuppered and even background checks to keep guns out of the hands of those with mental problems in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the criticisms of Obama is that instead of asking vice-president Joe Biden to oversee a task force looking at proposals for reform in January and then leaving Congress to come up with a draft bill, he should have pushed his own set of proposals when emotions were still raw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president at the White House, accused opponents of reform of trying to run down the clock. He called for members of the public who back gun reform to put pressure on their members of Congress, most of them back in their districts and home states for the Easter break. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those in the audience at the White House were the families of Newtown victims Grace McDonnell, Lauren Rousseau and Jesse Lewis, as well as the mother of Hadiya Pendleton, who was killed in Chicago, and Nardyne Jeffries, the mother of Washington shooting victim Brishell Jeffries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama acknowledged he had read an article "in the news just the other day wondering has Washington missed its opportunity, because as time goes on after Newtown, somehow people start moving on and forgetting"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not the case, he said. "Let me tell you, the people here, they don't forget. Grace's dad is not forgetting. Hadiya's mom hasn't forgotten. The notion that two months or three months after something as horrific as what happened in Newtown happens and we've moved on to other things, that's not who we are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an extremely emotional event, with people behind him, some of them families of victims, weeping throughout. "We need everybody to remember how we felt 100 days ago and to make sure that what we said was not just a bunch of platitudes. That we meant it," Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tears are not enough. Expressions of sympathy are not enough. Speeches are not enough. We have cried enough. We have known enough heartbreak. What we are proposing is not radical. It is not taking away anyone's gun rights. It is something if we are serious we will do. Now is the time to turn that heartbreak into something real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several Republicans have threatened to filibuster gun reform measures in the Senate. Without 60 of the 100 senators needed to break a filibuster, almost all of the packages proposed by Obama could fall. Obama reiterated he still wanted a ban on military-style assault weapons, even though the Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, has effectively said it has no chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats see the best chance of getting something into law as background checks to ensure guns are not sold to the mentally unstable and checks at gun shows to ensure someone does not have a criminal background. Republicans favour increased security at schools, the line backed by the National Rifle Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayors Against Illegal Guns &lt;a href="http://www.demandaction.org/newtown-families"&gt;put out its first ad in its $12m television campaign&lt;/a&gt; Thursday with interviews with family members of those killed at Newtown. The ad campaign is targeting 13 states during the recess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg said: "We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy – it's long past time for elected officials to listen to their constituents and pass reforms like comprehensive background checks that we know will save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His co-chair on Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Thomas Menino of Boston, echoed this. "The Senate now has the opportunity to take a vote that the American people are demanding to make our neighborhoods safer. The time has come to pass legislation and make reform a reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition is hiring dozens of organisers and opening campaign offices in 10 states. More than 140 events were scheduled for Thursday in 29 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-administration"&gt;Obama administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congress"&gt;US Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newtown-shooting"&gt;Newtown shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-control"&gt;US gun control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ewenmacaskill"&gt;Ewen MacAskill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He is the 11th person to be arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, which was set up to examine allegations of abuse against Savile and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was originally interviewed under caution by officers on 29 November after a search warrant was executed at an address in Berkshire five days earlier. Police said the individual falls under the strand of the investigation which is looking at complaints against people who are not connected to Savile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several high-profile figures have been arrested in connection with the investigation including PR consultant Max Clifford, comedian Freddie Star, DJ Dave Lee Travis, former TV producer Wilfred De'Ath and comedian Jim Davidson. They all deny any wrongdoing and De'Ath was this week released without&amp;nbsp;charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police report released in January revealed that Savile abused children across six decades at 14 hospitals including Great Ormond Street while working as a DJ and TV presenter at the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commander Peter Spindler of the Metropolitan police said Savile had used his fame and celebrity status to "hide in plain sight" and had "groomed the nation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cass-jones"&gt;Cass Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Along the way, they stop at the Stations of the Cross for prayer and recitation of&amp;nbsp;the liturgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a path followed by thousands of Christian pilgrims to the Holy City every Easter. For Maria Immaculada, among a group of 25 Spanish devotees, it is the pinnacle of her 48 years. "It is very emotional. I have been waiting for this my whole life," she says. "Carrying the cross was very special. It made me want to cry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Yosef Kanan, a 25-year-old Palestinian Muslim, it is simply another day for his three-generation family business renting plain wooden crosses to pilgrim groups. On Good Friday, the peak of his year, Kanan greets the first devotees at dawn and will only lock away his 30-plus crosses in a small store off the Via Dolorosa around sunset. "There will be a sea of people," he predicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this year he has seen fewer pilgrim groups in the Old City. "There are not so many from Europe, because of the economic crisis. They don't have the money. And people see what's happening in Syria on the television, and they think the whole region has trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kanan's oldest cross, made more than 50 years ago, two metres high and worn to a rich dark brown, is brought out of the store only on Good Friday, to be carried by an elderly priest who makes the journey from Portugal to the Holy Land every Easter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The olive wood crosses are made by craftsmen in the Palestinian Christian town of Beit Jala, now cut off from Jerusalem by Israel's separation barrier. Kanan's family pays around $220 (£145) for each cross, recouped by charging $20 a hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the business's main income comes from the sale of photographs taken by Kanan and his uncle to pilgrims after their journey across the Old City. "Even though everyone has their iPhones, they still want my pictures because they are very&amp;nbsp;beautiful," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His grandfather started the business "in Jordanian times" – before East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed – taking black and white photographs, hand-developing them in a darkroom in the Old City and delivering them to clients the same evening. "Today, no one has time, everything is done on a computer, everything comes out &lt;em&gt;chik-chak&lt;/em&gt;," laments Kanan, using Hebrew slang for "quick" or "on the double".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 10 years in the business, Kanan knows every inch of the Via Dolorosa – the Way of Grief – and almost every word of the liturgy in several languages. "Sometimes the priest forgets something," he says, "and I can remind him." Along the route, he gently ushers pilgrims to the next station and suggests when it is time for someone else to take a turn at carrying the cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ancient rose-coloured stones and smooth cobbles of the route can be treacherous for elderly or cross-burdened pilgrims. The narrow artery is lined with shops selling a typical Old City mix of spices, sweets, underwear, Chinese-made incense, pottery, jewellery, saucepans and religious memorabilia. T-shirts bearing the insignia of the Israel defence forces are displayed next to those calling for a "Free Palestine". The pilgrim groups jostle with tourists, residents, armed Israeli border police, priests, nuns, ultra-Orthodox Jews and devout Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilgrims come from all over the world. "The Indonesians are the biggest spenders," says Kanan. "The Koreans are the craziest – very emotional, crying, kissing stones and the ground – but they don't give money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has no qualms, as a Muslim, servicing a Christian festival. "Just like we do Hajj in Mecca," he says, "the Christians come here. It's the same thing.

They flew from the United States and back in what appeared to be the first exercise of its kind, designed to show America's ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes "quickly and at will", the US military said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of Kim's response was unusually swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the KPA, ordering them to be standby for fire so that they may strike any time the US mainland, its military bases in the operational theatres in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in South Korea," KCNA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has an arsenal of Soviet-era Scud missiles that can hit South Korea but its longer-range missiles are untested. Independent assessments of its missile capability suggest it may have theoretical capacity to hit US bases in Japan and Guam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has launched a daily barrage of threats since early this month when the United States and the South, allies in the 1950-53 Korean War, began routine military drills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South and the United States have said the drills are purely defensive in nature and that no incident has taken place in the decades they have been conducted in various forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States also flew B-52 bombers over South Korea earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has put its military on highest readiness to fight what it says are hostile forces conducting war drills. Its young leader has previously given "final orders" for its military to wage revolutionary war with the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the tide of hostile rhetoric from Pyongyang, it has kept open a joint economic zone with the South which generates $2bn a year in trade, money the impoverished state can ill-afford to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pyongyang has also cancelled an armistice agreement with the United States that ended the Korean War and cut all communications hotlines with US forces, the United Nations and South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The North Koreans have to understand that what they're doing is very dangerous," U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We must make clear that these provocations by the North are taken by us very seriously and we'll respond to that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US military said that its B-2 bombers had flown more than 6,500 miles (10,461 km) to stage a trial bombing raid from their bases in Missouri as part of the Foal Eagle war drills being held with South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bombers dropped inert munitions on the Jik Do Range, in South Korea, and then returned to the continental United States in a single, continuous mission, the military said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's drill was the first time B-2s flew round-trip from the mainland United States over South Korea and dropped inert munitions, a Pentagon spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Cha, a North Korea expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the drill fits within the context of ramped efforts by the Pentagon to deter the North from acting upon any of its threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he thought the latest moves could further aggravate tensions on the peninsula, Cha, a former White House official, said: "I don't think the situation can get any more aggravated than it already is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the shrill rhetoric from Pyongyang, few believe North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will risk starting a full-out war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Hagel, who on 15 March announced he was bolstering missile defenses over the growing North Korea threat, said all of the provocations by the North had to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their very provocative actions and belligerent tone, it has ratcheted up the danger and we have to understand that reality," Hagel said, renewing a warning that the US military was ready for "any eventuality" on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea conducted a third nuclear weapons test in February in breach of UN sanctions and despite warnings from China, its one major diplomatic ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kim-jong-un"&gt;Kim Jong-un&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That was thrown out by France's highest court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollande said he hoped the new proposal would persuade companies to lower executive pay at a time when France's economy is suffering, unemployment is soaring and employees are being asked to take pay cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the president reiterated his goal of stopping the rise of unemployment this year and restarting growth, he offered no specific new economic policies. "The tools are there. We need to use them fully," he said on France-2 television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new payroll tax would last only two years. Companies already pay payroll taxes that equate to at least a 50% rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's my idea? It's not to punish," Hollande said. "When so much is asked of employees, can those who are the highest-paid not make this effort for two years?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollande's original plan for a 75% tax on individuals was also conceived as a largely symbolic measure. It was likely to have brought in €100m-€300m – insignificant when set against France's €85bn deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hollande's popularity slides, he has struggled to convince the French he is doing enough to boost growth – or redistribute wealth, as his leftist base wants. Going after high earners may win over voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;French growth has been stagnant for nearly two years and unemployment, rising for 19 months in a row, is at 10.6% – a level not seen since 1999. Consumer confidence slipped again in March after a brief rise this year. The national statistics agency, Insee, found this month that the French are more pessimistic about the economy's prospects for the coming year than any time since the survey began in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some may wonder if adding another tax on companies as he is trying to encourage growth is the right message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the poor economy, Hollande has avoided imposing the deep spending cuts that other European countries such as Greece and Spain have imposed. And he said again on Thursday he would not go down that path – even though France will miss its deficit target of 3% of gross domestic product this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prolonging austerity will risk not reducing the deficits and bring the certainty of having unpopular governments that populists will eat alive," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France has largely avoided the unrest seen in European countries that are experiencing deep recessions, but the layoffs are piling up and have spawned some protests. On Thursday, about 100 workers from a car factory that PSA Peugeot Citroen wants to close stormed the offices of France's leading business lobby, Medef. Police said dozens were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/francois-hollande"&gt;François Hollande&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/executive-pay-bonuses"&gt;Executive pay and bonuses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
