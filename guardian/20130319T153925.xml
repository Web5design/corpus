I don't know because I was asleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latham then asked her: "Are you saying that there is a possibility that your husband set this fire behind your back literally?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She replied: "I honestly don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't rule out anybody – I just don't know who set the fire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her second day of testimony, she insisted that covert recordings made of conversations after the fire in which she discussed "sticking with the story" were references to her having sex with Mosley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latham put it to her that she and her husband had been talking about the allegation that they were responsible for the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she told the jury that the phrase "sticking with the story" was a reference to not telling anyone about the sexual activity with Mosley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was about the sex," she told the court. "I didn't want to be disgraced in the papers. My children had just died – I was more bothered about my children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Latham's cross-examination, she accepted that she had been a "fully functioning participant" in the conversations covertly recorded by the police following the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she denied that they showed "deviousness" on the part of her and her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to Latham's claim that she was not "hysterical" during a 999 call on the morning of the fire, she added: "I was panicking, I just wanted to get to my children – I didn't know what was happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"[Hinkley] will generate vast amounts of clean energy and enhance our energy security. It will benefit the local economy, through direct employment, the supply chain and the use of local services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two 1.6-gigawatt reactors will become one of the biggest power plants in the UK, providing enough electricity for up to 5m average homes. The nuclear plant is expected to be the first in a series of new ones the coalition has proposed as part of its plans to replace ageing coal and nuclear facilities that are due to be closed over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the symbolic decision on planning permission still leaves Davey's department for energy and climate change and EDF locked in negotiations over how much subsidy the company will get during the life of the plant. It is thought officials are discussing a contract that would guarantee the French company being paid nearly £100 for each megawatt hour of electricity produced over 30 to 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the system, called "&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/68772/Energy_Bill_-_Feed-in_Tariffs_with_Contracts_for_Difference.pdf" title=""&gt;contracts for difference&lt;/a&gt;", if the market price, which is about half that level, is lower than the agreed minimum "strike price", electricity suppliers will have to pay the difference by making a surcharge on customer bills; if the market price rises higher, then the company would forfeit the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDF and government officials also have to agree how much the company will pay for long-term storage of nuclear waste. "Discussions on both those are on going and intense, but I expect them to be concluded shortly," Davey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the subsidies will cost bill-payers at least £1bn a year, pointing out that a strike price of nearly £100 would be higher than all but the highest of the government's forecasts for future electricity prices up to 2030, and in opposition to a host of government policies designed to reduce that price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ministers believe the contracts for difference, available for all low-carbon power, will help develop a variety of energy sources including renewable energy as offshore wind, nuclear, new gas plants and, in future, carbon capture and storage equipment fitted to gas and coal plants. These sources would make the UK more resilient to fluctuating power prices, and reduce the carbon emissions on which climate change is blamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey declined more than once to comment on the negotiations, but added: "When the deal is concluded we will be completely transparent on that deal, whether it's on the strike price, the length [of the contract] or other details."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are additional concerns that when a deal is agreed with EDF, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/14/nuclear-power-european-commission-investigation" title=""&gt;the European commission could launch an inquiry&lt;/a&gt; into the subsidies, which would qualify as state aid. That would delay the project by at least 18 months. EDF would then have to begin finding funding of up to £14bn to pay for construction of the turbines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approval has been granted for the design of the EPR (European Pressurised Reactor) reactor, and the Environment Agency last week agreed to the environmental permits needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the reactors is expected to create 20,000-25,000 construction jobs, and 900 permanent jobs when the plant opens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katja Hall, the CBI chief policy director, said: "This is a big step forward on a critical energy infrastructure scheme. Major projects like this not only help us to overcome our energy challenges, but provide a real boost to growth, creating thousands of jobs directly and through the supply chain. A balanced energy mix is essential in order to ensure secure, low-carbon and affordable supply in the future, and new nuclear is a key part of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Allott, chief adviser on climate change at WWF-UK, a wildlife protection group, said: "Backing nuclear means shifting a huge liability to British taxpayers for the cost of building, electricity and, crucially, dealing with the waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unlike renewable energy, the costs of nuclear keep on rising, as witnessed by the fact that the only reactors currently being built in Europe are massively over-budget and far behind schedule. Focusing on renewables and energy efficiency, on the other hand, where the UK has huge potential to be an industrial leader, could deliver both huge cost reductions and a substantial boost to UK economic growth and manufacturing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recently built nuclear plant in Britain is Sizewell B, which was constructed in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/nuclearpower"&gt;Nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/nuclear-waste"&gt;Nuclear waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/waste"&gt;Waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ed-davey"&gt;Ed Davey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/windpower"&gt;Wind power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy"&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage"&gt;Carbon capture and storage (CCS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels"&gt;Fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/carbon-emissions"&gt;Carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/coal"&gt;Coal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliettejowit"&gt;Juliette Jowit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Impose a further 1% cut on all "unprotected departmental resource budgets" a year over the next two years. There are three "protected" budgets that will remain immune from the cuts – the NHS, schools and overseas development, though the latter will be adjusted downwards if Britain's gross national income (GNI) shrinks. Britain is committed to spending 0.7% of its GNI on overseas aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Divert the cumulative savings of almost £2.5bn over the two years to further investment in capital spending to be announced in the budget. Capital budgets will not be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Set aside a £1.2bn "downpayment" for the 2015-16 spending review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MoD will benefit from what the prime minister's spokesman described as "exceptional flexibility", allowing £1.6bn of its underspend to be "rolled over" into 2013-14 and 2014-15. Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, who is a leading member of the "NUM" group of ministers, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/9903911/Philip-Hammond-cut-welfare-not-troops.html" title=""&gt;made a rare intervention earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; when he called for the defence budget to be protected in the next spending period of 2015-16. He says the axe should fall on the welfare budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police grants will not be affected by the cuts for 2013-14. This marks a significant victory for Theresa May, the home secretary, because the police budget accounts for two-thirds of the total Home Office budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local government grant allocations will not be affected for 2013-14 only because they have already been allocated for that period. But the Department for Local Government and Communities will make a contribution to the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The budget for HMRC will be protected as the government redoubles its efforts to tackle tax avoidance and tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's spokesman said: "The chancellor and chief secretary informed cabinet of changes to the government's spending plans to tighten spending controls in this spending review period and to make a downpayment on the savings necessary for the 2015-16 spending review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The forecasts that are going to be published at the budget will show that departments are underspending their budgets more than the historical average, reflecting the work the government has done across all budgets to bring spending under control. The chancellor and chief secretary have decided to take account of this and reduce departmental budgets in future years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget-2013"&gt;Budget 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/budget"&gt;Budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance"&gt;Public finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts"&gt;Public sector cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/eric-pickles"&gt;Eric Pickles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/theresamay"&gt;Theresa May&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/philip-hammond"&gt;Philip Hammond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/defence"&gt;Defence policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Click here to view video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria's main opposition group has elected an interim prime minster to run what amounts to an administration in exile, tasked with bringing disparate rebel military groups under the control of a credible civilian leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghassan Hitto, who had lived in the US for the past 30 years, narrowly won a ballot to lead the nascent political body, the Syrian National Coalition, which has remained under pressure since its inception to offer an alternative to the totalitarian rule of the Assad regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitto, an IT executive, was elected from relative obscurity, having made his name in opposition circles over recent months, in which he played a lead role in a burgeoning humanitarian effort that has led to increased supplies of aid delivered into northern Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another stated core goal of the interim administration – to unite opposition interests that have largely remained disparate and factionalised – remains unfulfilled, to the chagrin of Arab and western states who have conditioned their backing on clear lines of command and control being established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitto's appointment generated little interest inside Syria, where rebel groups remain engaged in a bitter fight with regime forces for control of the country's key cities. Political efforts have been largely derided by the myriad opposition fighters, who claim they have done little to change the situation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the civil war into its third year and much of the nationwide battlefield now in stalemate, a consensus is emerging in rebel circles that a more unified effort is necessary to shift the balance in its favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitto said: "We will work to return all Syrian refugees to the freed provinces." He was referring to the rural north and east of the country, which have been in rebel hands for close to six months. In a direct message to Syrian military leaders, he added: "We urge all of the commanders in the regime's military to defect and join the civilians."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called for the opposition coalition to be given a seat at the UN and on other international bodies, such as the Arab League, which suspended Syria, a founding member, after the violent state response to the uprising launched more than two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the Syrian National Coalition was "a legitimate representative of the Syrian people" and refused to enter a dialogue with the regime – a key demand of stakeholders, such as Russia, which remains strongly supportive of President Bahsar al-Assad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embattled Syrian leader last week told a Lebanese delegation in Damascus that the regime remained on the front foot militarily, despite some defeats in key parts of the country. He acknowledged the heavy economic toll the war had taken on Syria, but insisted it could ride out its troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict has seen an exodus of at least 2 million people, around 1 million of whom are registered as refugees in neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lebanon continues to buckle under the strain of its powerful neighbour's woes, amid which Syrian jets fired rockets into an area three miles inside Lebanese borders on Monday, for the first time since the war began. The rockets hit an area near the border town of Arsal in the Bekaa Valley, which has been used at times to smuggle opposition fighters and weapons over the frontier. They caused no injuries, but drew widespread condemnation from the US and France, both of which described the attack as a "serious violation" of Lebanon's sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in Lebanon, authorities are trying to contain the fallout from an assault on four Sunni sheikhs, which has stoked sectarian tensions that have been simmering for many months. The chief of the Lebanese Army, Jean Kahwagi, said on Tuesday the country had passed through one of its "direst days", referring to the attack, which led to two of the sheikhs being admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Aleppo, regime and opposition groups are accusing each other of firing rockets loaded with chemicals into an opposition-held neighbourhood. The Khan al-Asal area was hit by a large ballistic rocket on Tuesday morning, witnesses told the Guardian. The region was seized from regime forces during the past fortnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebel groups in Aleppo strongly denied responsibility for the attack. "These are our own people," a commander of the largest militia in the city, Liwa al-Tawheed, said via Skype. "We do not have scuds, we do not have chemicals. If we had either we would not even use them on an enemy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrian state media alleged the attack had killed 16 people and wounded about 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/syria"&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martin-chulov"&gt;Martin Chulov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

This failure led to it being targeted by fraudsters, who used the personal details of more than 7,000 individuals to apply successfully for loans totalling millions of pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regulator also said that the firm had engaged in unfair business practices by writing to people who it was aware may not have taken out loans, asking unequivocally for repayment. The company had ignored its requests to stop this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OFT's director of credit, David Fisher, said: "'Removing MCO's licence is a timely reminder that payday and other lenders risk losing their licences if they engage in unfair business practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The way MCO chased consumers for debts they did not owe was unacceptable and caused unnecessary distress to many people," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt charity Citizens Advice said it had helped lots of people who had been caused "significant distress" after being pursued by MCO for loans they had never taken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizens Advice chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: "We provided evidence to OFT when it launched its investigation last year and continued to see problems with the lender, so we are pleased they have taken action today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of MCO's licence means it is no longer allowed to recover outstanding debts itself, but callers to its helpline are told that it has passed on its outstanding loans to a company called Webloans Processing Limited, which is using Northern Debt Recovery to collect payments from borrowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/payday-loans"&gt;Payday loans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/debt"&gt;Borrowing &amp; debt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/identityfraud"&gt;Identity fraud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/scamsandfraud"&gt;Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/office-of-fair-trading"&gt;Office of Fair Trading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/hilaryosborne"&gt;Hilary Osborne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They erupted in joy when Francis called them from Rome, his words broadcast to the crowd over loudspeakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to ask a favour," Francis told them. "I want to ask you to walk together, and take care of one another … and don't forget that this bishop who is far away loves you very much. Pray for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis was interrupted by applause several times during his homily, including when he spoke of the need to protect the environment, serve one another with love and not allow "omens of destruction", hatred, envy and pride to "defile our lives".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the role of the pope was to open his arms and protect all of humanity: "Especially the poorest, the weakest, the least important, those whom Matthew lists in the final judgment on love: the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and those in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today amid so much darkness we need to see the light of hope and to be men and women who bring hope to others," he said. "To protect creation, to protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope, it is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis, 76, thrilled the crowd at the start of the mass by getting out of his jeep to bless a disabled man. It was a gesture from a man whose short papacy so far is becoming defined by such spontaneous forays into the crowd and concern for the disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue and white flags from Argentina fluttered above the crowd, which Italian media initially estimated could reach 1 million. Civil protection crews closed the main streets leading to the square to traffic and set up mile-long barricades to try to control the throng and allow official delegations through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pope-francis"&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/catholicism"&gt;Catholicism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/christianity"&gt;Christianity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/the-papacy"&gt;The papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vatican"&gt;Vatican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There were no deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cryptosporidium parasite causes the disease cryptosporidiosis, of which the most common symptom is diarrhoea. Potential sources include contaminated water or food, and swimming in contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said its investigation into the outbreak was unable to identify the source of contamination. But it said consumers could still have confidence in the ready-to-eat label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added that bagged salads sold in supermarkets were often sourced from the same suppliers for most leaf types, with production lines packing products for several retailers at the same time, which was the situation in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HPA's head of the multi-agency outbreak control team, Dr Stephen Morton, said: "This outbreak was fortunately short-lived but it was important to see if we could find the source. Our findings suggest that eating mixed-leaf bagged salad was the most likely cause of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is, however, often difficult to identify the source of short-lived outbreaks of this type as by the time that the outbreak can be investigated, the affected food and much of the microbiological evidence may no longer be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As this was an isolated and short-lived outbreak there is no specific action for the public to take, but we hope the investigations between the FSA and the food industry will help to prevent further outbreaks of this type from happening again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FSA's director of food safety, Dr Alison Gleadle, said: "We'd like to remind everyone of our usual advice to wash all fruits and vegetables, including salad, before you eat them, unless they are labelled ready to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's also important to wash hands thoroughly as well as clean chopping boards, knives and other utensils between preparing raw and ready-to-eat foods to prevent cross-contamination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/food-safety"&gt;Food safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/salad"&gt;Salad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/asda"&gt;Asda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/morrisons"&gt;Morrisons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/supermarkets"&gt;Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

More than a third (37%) are not getting the healthcare they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A scandal of avoidable deaths on the scale of Mid Staffs takes place every year for people with a learning disability in the NHS. These deaths, caused by poor care and delays in diagnosis and treatment, highlight the scale of discrimination faced by disabled patients in the NHS," said Jan Tregelles, the acting chief executive of Mencap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The confidential inquiry into the premature deaths of people with learning disabilities (CIPOLD) examined the sequence of events leading up to death of all known adults and children with learning disabilities in five primary care trusts of the south-west over a two-year period – 233 adults and 14 children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined the illnesses and deaths of 58 other adults without learning disabilities but of similar background and state of health for comparison. They found that 22% of people with learning disabilities die before the age of 50, compared with just 9% of the rest of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other adults were more likely to die prematurely because of smoking, alcohol and a poor diet – all factors connected with lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with learning disabilities, however, were more likely to die early because there were delays or problems with investigating, diagnosing and treating their illnesses. They were also more likely to have problems in having their needs identified and getting the appropriate care. Their families or carers had more problems in getting their views heard and listened to. The review team says premature deaths could be avoided by better health and social care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pauline Heslop, the study's lead author at the University of Bristol Norah Fry Research Centre, said: "This report highlights the unacceptable situation in which people with learning disabilities are dying, on average, more than 16 years sooner than anyone else. The cause of their premature death is not, like many in the general population, due to lifestyle-related illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cause of their premature deaths appears to be because the NHS is not being provided equitably to everyone based on need. People with learning disabilities are struggling to have their illnesses investigated, diagnosed and treated to the same extent as other people. These are shocking findings and must serve as a wakeup call to all of us that action is urgently required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have, over the past few years, been rightly horrified by the abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View hospital and of vulnerable patients at Mid Staffordshire. The findings of the confidential inquiry into the deaths of people with learning disabilities should be of no less a concern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/learningdisability"&gt;Learning disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/disability"&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sarahboseley"&gt;Sarah Boseley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Over the last two years police forces have seized more than 1m marijuana plants, with an estimated value of over £200m, and there was a 15% increase in cannabis farms in 2011/12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crimestoppers will be distributing the cards, which replicate the smell of the drug in its growing state, with the help of the police. The cards may smell of cannabis but anyone hoping for a cheap high will be disappointed. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CrimestoppersUK/status/313953128452063232" title=""&gt;In a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the charity was at pains to point out that they do not contain marijuana's active ingredient, THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tweet said: "Have u received one of our scratch and sniff cards? #weedthesigns #cannabis No THC content, just raising awareness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crimestoppers' director of operations, Roger Critchell, said: "We are distributing scratch and sniff cards because not many people know how to recognise the signs of cannabis cultivation happening in their neighbourhood. Many are also not familiar with the established links between this crime and serious organised crime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/crime/2012/20120430CBACCofCPP.pdf" title=""&gt;UK National Problem Profile report on commercial cannabis cultivation (pdf),&lt;/a&gt; produced last year, identified that commercial or industrial properties are being used less and there has been a significant move towards residential dwellings over multiple sites to grow cannabis plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the areas targeted for distribution of the cards are West and South Yorkshire, London, Greater Manchester and Avon &amp; Somerset, which have all been identified as the places with the highest number of cannabis farms in the UK. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) found West Yorkshire to have the most cannabis farms in 2010/12 with nearly 1,800, while South Yorkshire was second, with over 1,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acpo's lead for drugs, Andy Bliss, said: "Closing down cannabis farms and arresting the criminals who run and organise them is a key focus in drugs policing. This is because we recognise that these farms are often run by organised criminals but also because they bring crime and antisocial behaviour into local communities causing real harm and leaving people feeling unsafe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/drugs"&gt;Drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/haroonsiddique"&gt;Haroon Siddique&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Wilson, who was forced to work unpaid for six months, and up to 231,000 other benefit claimants had been unlawfully punished&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years because the government had failed to give them more than a few lines of regulatory information about the schemes they had to take part in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a move that has upset campaigners and activists, the parliamentary Labour party said it was likely to abstain from any vote expected on Tuesday and was pushing for concessions – including an independent review of the benefit sanctions regime – in return for allowing the &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2012-2013/0149/2013149.pdf" title=""&gt;jobseekers (back to work schemes) bill&lt;/a&gt; to be rushed through parliament at "lightning speed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DWP is keen to see the retroactive bill passed into law in case the supreme court rejects its application for appeal and £130m that was taken away in sanctions has to be paid back to jobseekers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/jobseekers-back-to-work-schemes-bill-impact-assessment.pdf" title=""&gt;In explanatory notes to the bill&lt;/a&gt;, which lawyers and campaigners described as "repugnant", the government said the legislation to overturn the court's findings was needed to "protect the national economy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers acting for Reilly are already preparing to challenge the law as soon as it is given royal assent under article six of the European convention on human rights, which guarantees the right of access to the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://labourlist.org/2013/03/our-young-people-need-a-real-chance-to-work-in-a-real-job-paying-a-real-wage/" title=""&gt;In a blogpost on Monday evening&lt;/a&gt;, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, described the department's inability to draft lawful back-to-work scheme regulations for about half a dozen employment schemes as "incompetence on a truly monumental scale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrne said in return for Labour's support on the bill's emergency timetabling, "ministers must launch an independent review of the sanctions regime with an urgent report to parliament".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour sources said they also wanted to make sure that the legislation was tightened up so jobseekers' regular rights of appeal, separate to the court of appeal judgment, were not also trampled on by the new law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the supreme court appeal, the government has instructed &lt;a href="http://www.blackstonechambers.com/people/barristers/james_eadie_qc.html" title=""&gt;James Eadie QC&lt;/a&gt;, the government's top lawyer – known as the "Treasury devil" – to take charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DWP said regulations had been drafted in a minimal fashion to give job centres and organisations involved in getting the unemployed into work flexibility and latitude for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Green party leader Caroline Lucas said she was working with other MPs to try to get a vote at the bill's second reading, "in order to show our deep opposition to the flawed principles of the bill".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "We are hugely disappointed at the signs coming from the Labour camp which indicate that they will not be joining us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A meek call for a review of the regulations in a year's time is frankly no opposition at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Labour MPs don't join us in voting against this bill, they will be supporting the government in undermining a court of appeal judgment and backing the primary purpose of the bill: to prevent people from rightly claiming back welfare payments that were docked as part of the shambolic workfare scheme that Cait Reilly courageously exposed in the Poundland case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The union Unite, which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jul/17/unite-start-reduced-membership" title=""&gt;also represents unemployed people&lt;/a&gt;, is also calling for MPs to strongly oppose the bill and "stand up for the rights of jobseekers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The union's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: "This is a cynical move by the Tory-led government to avoid giving rightful compensation to jobseekers who have fallen foul of the incompetence of the Department of Work and Pensions. When will they learn that rushed law is bad law?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The courts have told Iain Duncan Smith that his approach is unlawful. And the public accounts committee has decried the woeful success rate of his schemes. Given this, the government ought to be going back to the drawing board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson from campaign group Boycott Workfare, which protests against making unpaid work schemes a condition of receiving benefits, said: "It is just as disgusting to hear Liam Byrne say that the social security people are due must be withheld or the entire welfare budget be cut. Everyone knows abstaining is as good as voting for the bill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings that killed hundreds of Shia Muslims this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security officials said Hai was linked to several attacks on western targets since Pearl's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani court sentenced British-born militant Omar Sheikh to death for killing Pearl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/daniel-pearl"&gt;Daniel Pearl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A revised draft bill seen by Reuters would exempt savings under €20,000, charge a rate of 6.75% for amounts between €20,000 and €100,000 and maintain a 9.9% tax on deposits above that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cyprus's central bank chief said the new deal would raise less than the €5.8bn demanded by eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund as a contribution to rescuing the island's shattered financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government, under its new conservative leader, Nicos Anastasiades, maintains that Cyprus has no choice but to accept the bailout with the levy, or go bankrupt. But the 56-member parliament, scheduled to meet at 6pm on Tuesday, is still expected to vote no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades's party holds 20 seats out of 56; its coalition partner the DIKO, which has a further eight, has ruled out voting in favour of the levy, however. "It looks like it won't pass," a Cypriot government spokesman, Christos Stylianides, told state radio on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejection of the measure would effectively block the bailout that Cyprus needs to keep its banks afloat and pay state wages and welfare bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In France, the finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, urged Cyprus to drop its plan to tax people with less than €100,000 in their bank accounts. He said France was in favour of taxing only deposits over €100,000, which would not have been protected if a bank went bust. But he said the matter was up to the Cypriot government to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The levy on savings over €100,000 will affect thousands of Russians who have bank accounts on the island, which has used tax deals to attract international deposits into a banking system that is now at least eight times the size of the island's €17bn economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An employee at a large Cyprus bank said: "Today is all about politics. The final decision will be a political one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks in Cyprus were expected to remain closed until at least Thursday to avert a possible rush for withdrawals. Cashpoints were replenished on Monday but have a limit of €500 for cash withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.cyprus-mail.com/" title=""&gt;Cyprus Mail&lt;/a&gt; reported that banks were trying to agree a uniform policy on dealing with the expected rush of customers when they do eventually open. Guards are expected to be posted outside branches to ensure security and to prevent overcrowding.Fiona Mullen, an analyst at Sapienta Economics, in Nicosia, said: "The banks staying closed is the only thing they can do for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the parliament can't agree a yes vote, banks could remain closed until politicians can get something that's acceptable to everybody rather than letting the banks fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreas Theophanous, professor of political economy at Nicosia university, described the levy as "shock therapy that may kill the patient". He said the EU deal had undermined the new president's credibility and already damaged the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main opposition party, the Communist &lt;a href="http://www.akel.org.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=1&amp;lang=l3" title=""&gt;AKEL&lt;/a&gt; party, said it would vote against any proposed levy on bank accounts, regardless of any possible changes. A party spokesman, George Loukaides, told the Guardian: "This bill is a disaster. Regardless of whether parliament votes yes or no, Cyprus's banking system and standing as a financial centre has already been hit very badly by this. The damage is already done. If there is a yes vote, our economy will go into deep recession and we will be forced to become even more dependent on international lenders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ratings agency Fitch has put three Cyprus banks – Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular Bank and Hellenic Bank – on rating watch negative while the bailout drama plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Fitch said it had taken the move because of Cyprus's decision to tax savers, by turning a percentage of their deposits into equity. It also suggested that it could downgrade the banks to "restricted default" status, if this actually occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch said: "The negative watches will be resolved after a decision by the Cypriot parliament on the above extraordinary measures, which could come as early as today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/imf"&gt;International Monetary Fund (IMF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking-reform"&gt;Banking reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/angeliquechrisafis"&gt;Angelique Chrisafis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simon-neville"&gt;Simon Neville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Parents may be prosecuted if they still have not paid after 42 days. Some 6,361 parents were prosecuted, compared with 5,629 the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of pupils in primary, secondary, special schools and academies who missed at least a month of school – children known as "persistent absentees – fell to 5.2% from 6.1% the year before. There were 333,850 persistent absentees - 60,000 fewer than the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition changed the definition of a persistent absentee in 2011 from a pupil who missed a fifth of the school year to one who missed a quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a typical school day, 327,000 pupils were out of school, compared with 370,000 the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall absence for holidays, illness and truancy fell to 5.1%, from 5.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 0.5% of lesson time was lost because parents had taken their children on holiday, the same proportion as last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Education spokeswoman said: "If children are not in school they cannot learn. Too many children are still missing too many lessons. We must continue to tackle poor attendance and make sure every pupil gets a good education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting"&gt;Parents and parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/family"&gt;Family&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicashepherd"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Aba, known to Tibetans as Ngaba, has recorded more than 30 such cases. Local authorities there revealed recently they had cut off the internet and text messaging, and tightened control over the sale of petrol and painkillers &lt;a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/767917.shtml" title=""&gt;in their attempts to halt the protests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exile groups said police seized and cremated Kunchok Wangmo's body and handed her husband Dolma Kyab the ashes. They detained him only after he refused to blame the self-immolation on domestic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dzoge Lekshek, an exile with contacts in the region, told Radio Free Asia: "The authorities wanted Dolma Kyab to declare that she burnt herself as a result of a family conflict and when he refused to comply, he was detained and taken away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English-language edition of state newspaper Global Times reported on Tuesday that police were holding him cla because he had strangled his wife and then burned her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aba prefecture spokesman Jiang Zuquan told the newspaper he was certain the case was not a protest against Chinese policy in Tibetan areas. He alleged Dolma Kyab strangled his wife at their home after a row about his alleged alcoholism, before moving her body to a nearby building and setting fire to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated phone calls to the propaganda office went unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alistair Currie, spokesman for the Free Tibet campaign, said it was seeking further information but remained sceptical about police claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no reason to trust Chinese authorities and experience shows they are actively seeking to denigrate those who conduct these protests&amp;nbsp;… This would fit in with that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No one can have any faith in the legal system in Tibet and the only way to ensure a full and accurate account would be if international observers were given free access to the area and allowed to perform an investigation. China has consistently refused to allow any such external involvement, despite repeated requests from governments and the UN."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/31/chinese-court-tibetans-encouraging-immolation" title=""&gt;have jailed people for "encouraging" self-immolations&lt;/a&gt; in recent months &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/16/chinese-police-tibetan-self-immolation" title=""&gt;and have detained many more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese Human Rights Defenders group reported last week that a senior monk from Qinghai province, known only as Yarphel, had been jailed for 15 months for "disrupting traffic" and "disrupting public order" after he carried the ashes of a nephew who had self-immolated in a procession from a monastery to his nephew's home last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Times recently revealed that officials in Xiahe, Gansu province, have required residents to sign letters of commitment against self-immolation following cases there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The families of self-immolators can't keep the bodies, residents are forbidden to offer condolences, and monks are not allowed to chant sutras for the dead," added Bai Weilong, a government worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Hezuo, Gannan prefecture, in the same province, the chief of a township told the newspaper it had driven out 16 monks from its monastery who "misbehaved or violated monastery rules", following the self-immolation of a villager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Chinese authorities confirmed that a Tibetan monk from Kirti monastery in Aba burned himself to death there on Saturday. Lobsang Thokmey was 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio Free Asia said he had wanted to mark the fifth anniversary of a Chinese crackdown on the 2008 Tibetan protests in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese government has blamed followers of the Dalai Lama for the self-immolations. They accuse the exiled spiritual leader of seeking to split Tibet from the rest of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he seeks only meaningful autonomy for Tibet and has blamed the burnings on discontent at the way China rules the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/protest"&gt;Protest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/buddhism"&gt;Buddhism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/religion"&gt;Religion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Their focus has shifted from catching the thieves to bringing home the precious work, including paintings by Rembrandt, Manet, Degas and Vermeer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key goal here is to recover those paintings and bring them back," US Attorney Carmen Ortiz said at a news conference at the FBI's Boston headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just after midnight on 18 March 1990, two men posing as police officers pulled off the heist, stealing 13 pieces of art in 81&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than two decades, the FBI has chased leads around the globe, finally making progress over the last few years so that they now believe they know the identity of the thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI's Richard DesLauriers says the agency believes the thieves belonged to a criminal organisation based in New England and the mid-Atlantic states. He said authorities believe the art was taken to Connecticut and the Philadelphia region in the years after the theft, and offered for sale in Philadelphia about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the attempted sale, the FBI does not know what happened to the art, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortiz said the statute of limitations had expired on crimes associated with the actual theft. She said anyone who knowingly possessed or concealed the stolen art could still face charges, but said prosecutors were willing to discuss potential immunity deals to get the art back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DesLauriers repeatedly rebuffed questions from reporters on the identities of the thieves, saying releasing their identities could hamper the continuing investigation. He refused to say whether the thieves were now in prison on other charges, and would not say whether they were dead or alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a federal prosecutor in Connecticut said the FBI believed a Connecticut man Robert Gentile had some involvement with stolen property related to the art heist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentile, 76, of Manchester, Connecticut, was not charged over the heist, but pleaded guilty in November in a weapons and prescription drugs case. Gentile's lawyer A Ryan McGuigan said at the time that Gentile testified before a grand jury investigating the heist. He said Gentile knew nothing about the heist, but was acquainted with people that federal authorities believe may have been involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortiz said the investigation was "active and at times fast-moving" over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, empty frames hang on the walls of the museum, a reminder of the "enormous loss" and a symbol of hope that they will be recovered, said Ortiz. The stolen paintings include: The Concert by Johannes Vermeer; and three Rembrandts, A Lady and Gentleman in Black, Self-Portrait and Storm on the Sea of Galilee, his only seascape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime"&gt;US crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/fbi"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/art"&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nick Clegg hailed what the prime minister, David Cameron, called "a boost direct to the pockets of hardworking families".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Resolution Foundation thinktank criticised the government for helping richer parents while failing to recognise the barriers faced by poorer families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, childcare minister Elizabeth Truss said the government was supporting low-income families by ploughing £200m in additional income into the forthcoming universal credit system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Truss said that 2.5 million middle-income families also needed help. "What we are recognising is that there are families that are earning between £20,000 and £40,000 where it simply isn't worth their while going out to work at the moment because of the really expensive costs of childcare. And we want to help those families who work hard and want to get on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The £750m scheme – which will be introduced in the autumn of 2015, after the next election – will initially apply to children under the age of five, providing help to 1.3 million families. It will eventually be extended to include children up to the age of 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parents will have to be in work, with neither earning more than £150,000, to qualify. The Treasury confirmed that two parents with a joint income of £299,999.98 would be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truss said only 8% of women earn more than £40,000 but admitted the childcare tax rebate had been capped at £150,000 for a single earner for the sake of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This voucher system is much better than its predecessor because every working family can access it – 2.5 million people can get it rather than the 500,000 at the moment. At the moment it is luck of the draw [because many employers do not make use of the scheme]. It's difficult for middle earners and it is right that they receive that support," the minister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why the government was not directly incentivising parents to stay at home with their children, Truss said: "We believe in marriage, we believe in strong families, but we believe in families making choices about how they look after their children … It's not a black and white choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clegg said: "The rising cost of childcare is one of the biggest challenges parents face and it means many mums and dads simply can't afford to work. This not only hurts them financially, but is bad for the economy too. This announcement of a £1bn investment in childcare will make sure it pays to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An extra £1,200 for each child will make a real difference to families who find themselves constantly worrying about how to juggle their family budget. And extending support for working families on Universal Credit will make sure it is worth working extra hours even if you're on low wages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The £750m costs of the scheme will be funded by new money from the budget and by phasing out the Employer Supported Childcare (ESC), claimed by 450,000 families, which is offered by just 5% of employers. Parents who claim ESC will be able to remain in the scheme, though this will not be open to new claimants after the launch of the new scheme, which will be more generous for parents with more than one child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source said the government already offered a great deal of support to lower-income families as it continued a Labour scheme to offer 15 hours of free universal childcare to all three- and four-year-olds. This will be extended this year to all two-year-olds whose parents are from the 20% most disadvantaged families, later rising to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said that overall most of the extra support will go to parents in the top half of the income distribution. He said: "It is absolutely right that the government is making childcare more affordable for families – it is a massive burden for millions of households. However, spending large sums on tax relief that tends to benefit higher-income families does not recognise that low- and modest-income families face the highest barriers to work from childcare costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly raised concerns that families who receive support through tax credits and the universal credit, which will be introduced in stages from next month until 2017, will not be eligible. He said: "It is vital that the government revises universal credit to ensure that low-income working families, including the large number who work part time on low pay, have an incentive to earn more."&lt;br /&gt;Kelly acknowledged that a further £200m will be provided to less affluent parents claiming universal credit, though greater help will be provided to those in work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government will meet 85% of the costs of childcare for parents on universal credit, provided that both parents are working and that they earn more than the personal tax allowance, which is due to reach £10,000 by 2015.&lt;br /&gt;Parents on universal credit who fail to earn this amount will be eligible for only 70% of the costs of childcare, the current amount on offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, said: "Today's announcement will not make up for the £1,500 that families have lost in cuts to childcare support. Those who have seen their incomes cut because tax credits have been cut will not get any help.

We don't think you can compare the strength of our own brand label with the cut price versions at Tesco and Asda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can be sure we will be pointing out to Tesco where we believe our products are non comparable with theirs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat comes as the country's third-biggest supermarket chain saw a 6.3% surge in sales in its fourth quarter, excluding fuel, thanks to strong growth online and in convenience store sales, as well as picking up customers from rivals tainted by the horsemeat scandal. Like-for-like sales were up 3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the 33rd consecutive quarter of growth for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full year sales were up 4.3% following 14 new supermarket and 87 convenience stores opening. Sales were up 1.8% on a like-for-like basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King said Sainsbury had more customers than ever before, with 22.9m transactions a week, a boost of 800,000. By comparison, rival Morrisons &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/14/morrisons-to-launch-online-food-offer" title=""&gt;revealed it lost 400,000 customers a week&lt;/a&gt; at its full year results last Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He brushed aside any fears that Morrisons may challenge the business for the number three slot, behind Tesco and Asda, after the smaller rival announced plans to launch an online groceries service and convenience stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All competition is good for customers, so we are very happy with the extra competition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online groceries sales were up by nearly 20% year on year, with convenience store trade rising 18%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new distribution site was opened to exclusively supply convenience stores in the south east and London and bosses admitted they looked at snapping up some of the failed HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Rogers, chief finance officer, said: "We did have a look at the stores, but they are all relatively compromised sites and relatively overrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will potentially approach landlords if these spaces come available, but we won't be dealing with the administrators at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a sign of supermarket dominance of the high street, Sainsbury's revealed general merchandise sales, which exclude food and clothes, topped the £1bn mark for the first time, just 10 years after it started selling products from vacuum cleaners to DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/j-sainsbury"&gt;J Sainsbury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/supermarkets"&gt;Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/justin-king"&gt;Justin King&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/simon-neville"&gt;Simon Neville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nash, 67, a former holistic therapist who relies on publicly funded care assistants, has said she fears for her life if responsibility for her support is transferred from the council to the private firm Capita in April. The judicial review of the legality of the contract means the signing of the deal, which was supposed to happen at the end of January, has been delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters from the campaign group Disabled People Against Cuts and the local Barnet Alliance for Public Services (BAPS) are expected to demonstrate outside the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand in London on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirza Waisel, the co-ordinator of BAPS, said: "Maria is a disabled person and is right to be worried about what will happen to her in future. If One Barnet fails, a scheme that was set up ostensibly to save money will end up costing more, and mean further cuts in services beyond the point where Barnet residents can live a decent life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many councils, Barnet has been exploring radical measures to reduce its budget by 10% as a result of declining council tax revenue and a smaller grant from Whitehall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nash's case is that neither the Capita contract, nor a further planned £290m deal to outsource planning, cemeteries, highways, environmental health and other services, are legal because the council has failed to consult on the decisions, has failed to meet its public sector equality obligations and based its decisions on "grossly inadequate assessments of the relative merits and risks involved".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnet is understood to be confident its policy will survive intact and Dan Thomas, council member with responsibility for resources, has said the new support and customer service organisation contract will save the taxpayer £1m a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/localgovernment"&gt;Local government&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-care"&gt;Social care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/localgovernment"&gt;Local politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/disability"&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Nuclear is a crucial part of a balanced energy policy, to stop lights going out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Greenpeace's executive director, John Sauven, said Hinkley Point C failed the test on economic, consumer, environmental and arguably even legal grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "It will lock a generation of consumers into higher energy bills, via a strike price that's expected to be double the current price of electricity, and it will distort energy policy by displacing newer, cleaner, cheaper technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With companies now saying the price of offshore wind will drop so much it will be on par with nuclear by 2020, there is no rationale for allowing Hinkley C to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Giving it the green light when there is no credible plan for dealing with the waste could also be in breach of the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/nuclearpower"&gt;Nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"This will undoubtedly have a chilling effect on everyday people's web use," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she feared thousands of websites could fall under the definition of a "relevant publisher" according to the rules passed in the House of Commons on Monday night as part of the courts bill. Under the rules, sites that generate news and are written by several authors could risk exemplary damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes said: "Bloggers could find themselves subject to exemplary damages, due to the fact that they were not part of a regulator that was not intended for them in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exemplary damages and costs imposed by a court to penalise those who remained outside the regulator could run to hundreds of thousands of pounds, enough to close down smaller publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Cole, one of the journalists involved in &lt;a href="http://order-order.com/" title=""&gt;Guido Fawkes&lt;/a&gt;, said it would not be joining the regulator and believes that because its servers are based in the US it will be excluded from the exemplary damages clauses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see I should join a regulator. This country has had a free press for the last 300 years, that has been irreverent and rude as my website is and holding public officials to account. We as a matter of principle will be opposing any regulator especially one set up and accountable to politicians we write about every day," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carla Buzasi, the editor-in-chief of &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/" title=""&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt; told the BBC: "I can't imagine any politician has had this discussion because they have rushed this through so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does worry me to a certain extent. Someone said this is a carrot and stick approach. There doesn't seem to be too much of a carrot here," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exemplary damages clause was recommended in the Leveson report but has been opposed by newspapers, including the Guardian, which have been given legal advice that it could be contrary to the European convention on human rights, which enshrines the principle of free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Lester, the campaigner for libel reform, warned during the Leveson debate in the House of Lords earlier this year that publications such as Private Eye and local newspapers could face closure as a result of the imposition of exemplary damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday night, the editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger said he welcomed cross-party agreement on press regulation, but said: "We retain grave reservations about the proposed legislation on exemplary damages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under sustained questioning on Monday night during the Commons debate about the courts bill, which includes the Leveson regulations, &lt;a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130318/debtext/130318-0003.htm#13031836000001" title=""&gt;the culture secretary, Maria Miller, said&lt;/a&gt; the "publisher would have to meet the three tests of whether the publication is publishing news-related material in the course of a business, whether their material is written by a range of authors – this would exclude a one-man band or a single blogger – and whether that material is subject to editorial control".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said the new rules were designed to protect "small-scale bloggers" and to "ensure that the publishers of special interest, hobby and trade titles such as the Angling Times and the wine magazine Decanter are not caught in the regime", but Hello! magazine would be subject to regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the "one-man band or a single blogger" would not be affected by the legislation because of the definition of "relevant publisher" in relation to exemplary damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said "student and not-for-profit community newspapers" will not be caught under the new rules and that "scientific journals, periodicals and book publishers will also be left outside the definition and therefore not exposed to the exemplary damages and costs regime".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also confusion about which magazines would come under the remit of the new regulatory body. Miller said scientific journals would fall outside its scope, but the British Medical Journal, for example, is currently regulated by the Press Complaints Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunny Hundal, editor of the &lt;a href="http://liberalconspiracy.org/" title=""&gt;Liberal Conspiracy&lt;/a&gt; blog, said he didn't see a cause for panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a danger we miss the wood for the trees, as bloggers can already face big fines for libel. I'm fairly confident the eventual body will differentiate between Guardian.co.uk and independent bloggers. Trying to regulate the latter, even Leveson admitted in his final report, would be a step too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key will be to differentiate between huge operations such as Huffington Post and voluntary blogs like Liberal Conspiracy. We should be vigilant but I don't see a cause for panic yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/blogging"&gt;Blogging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/press-regulation"&gt;Press regulation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pressandpublishing"&gt;Newspapers &amp; magazines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/regulators"&gt;Regulators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media"&gt;Digital media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lisaocarroll"&gt;Lisa O'Carroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Helicopters could be seen hovering above the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later, in another part of the city, a second blast was audible and another column of smoke a half a mile or so away, this time from an attack in Karrada,.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first bombing took place near a small restaurant in Baghdad's Mashtal neighbourhood, killing four people and wounding 15 at 8am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, two day labourers were killed and eight were wounded when a roadside bomb targeted where they gather each day in an area of New Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One eyewitness to the first bombing, who had just arrived at work at 8am, told the Guardian: "It was a huge explosion at the junction close to where my office was, close to a restaurant. I heard the bomb go off in an area which is crowded at this time of day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A policeman who gave his name only as Ahmed, who was on duty near the scene of another of the explosions, told the Guardian. "It was about 300 metres from me, near where I was on duty in Karrada. It was a car bomb parked by the road close to a place where minibuses park."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks on the 10th anniversary of the first air strikes of the Iraq war, on 19 March 2003, which targeted the Dora Farms where it was thought Saddam Hussein was visiting, have underlined the still bitter sectarian tensions in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago on Tuesday also marked President George W Bush's announcement in the US of the start of the invasion, with troops crossing the border with Kuwait in force the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning's blasts hit largely Shia areas where people were gathering for work or start the day, including small restaurants and bus stops in the Iraqi capital. At least six attacks occurred within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the anniversary of the fall of Saddam is marked by the government, the day of the invasion is generally ignored by Iraqis, many of whom regard it as the beginning of an occupation that prompted the "sectarian war", which pitted Sunni against Shia for five years of brutal bloodletting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, the attacks bore the hallmarks of al-Qaida in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While violence in Iraq has receded in recent years since 2008, tensions have been rising again fanned by Sunni protests over equal rights and human rights abuses in northern and western provinces, in particular in Fallujah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have blamed the slow response of the Shia-dominated Iraqi government to the protests for a resurgence in al-Qaida in Iraq, which, some claim, has boosted the number of new terror recruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sprawling Shia suburb of Sadr City, a sticky bomb placed under a minibus killed three commuters and wounded seven people, while another car bomb exploded in a commercial street in the same Shia area, killing two and wounding 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the north-eastern suburbs of Baghdad, four people were killed and 11 others wounded after a car bomb went off near a small restaurant in Hussainiyah neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Zafarniyah, two car bombs exploded near a police station, killing five people, including a policeman and wounding 27, said police. In northern Baghdad, a car bomb went off near a bus stop, killing three people and wounding 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the city centre, a car bomb exploded near a restaurant close to the well-protected green zone, killing six people, including two soldiers and wounding more than 15. In Shulla, a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market, killing five people and wounding 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the wave of attacks, the prime minister, Nouri al Maliki, announced he was delaying the holding of provincial elections – due in April – in Anbar and Nineveh provinces that have been at the heart of a three-month-long Sunni uprising that has partly driven recent tensions in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterbeaumont"&gt;Peter Beaumont&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

With his surrender, where an embassy official said staff were "shocked" by his sudden arrival, Ntaganda ended a career that saw him fight as a rebel and government soldier on both sides of the Rwanda-Congo border during nearly 20 years of conflict in Africa's Great Lakes region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ntaganda's whereabouts had been unknown after hundreds of his fighters fled into Rwanda or surrendered to UN peacekeepers at the weekend following their defeat by a rival faction of M23 rebels in the mineral-rich eastern Congo. "He specifically asked to be transferred to the ICC in the Hague," US state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington. "We are currently consulting with a number of governments, including the Rwandan government, in order to facilitate his request."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICC spokesman Fadi el-Abdullah said the court would put in place all necessary measures to ensure a swift surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ntaganda faces charges of conscripting child soldiers, murder, ethnic persecution, sexual slavery and rape during the 2002-03 conflict in the Ituri district of northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But according to a UN panel of experts, Ntaganda, nicknamed "The Terminator", was most recently a leader of the M23 rebellion, which has pursued a year-long insurgency that embarrassed Kinshasa and U.N. peacekeepers by seizing the capital of North Kivu province, Goma, in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts said the rebellion was backed by Rwanda and Uganda, both of which deny sending troops to aid the insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Rwanda, Ntaganda grew up in Congo before fighting alongside Rwandan Tutsi rebels who seized control of the small central Africa country, ending the 1994 genocide in which over 800,000 people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ntaganda then returned to Congo, where he took part in a series of rebellions but also served temporarily as a senior general and made a name for himself smuggling minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congolese government spokesman Lambert Mende said Ntaganda had crossed into Rwanda on Saturday with help from the Rwandan army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd prefer to have him judged here, but if he is sent to The Hague, that's no problem either," Mende told Reuters. "The most important thing is that justice is served."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Rwanda nor the United States has an obligation to hand over Ntaganda to The Hague-based ICC since they are not parties to the Rome Statute that established the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
