Pyongyang is also angered by joint US-South Korea defence drills, which are continuing until the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[North Korea] will achieve nothing by threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia," the US military command in South Korea said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the US sent F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets from a base in Japan to take part in the drills. Last week two US B-2 stealth bombers took part in the dummy bombing of an uninhabited South Korean island, prompting a furious response from the North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Washington are confident that the North is unable to mount nuclear warheads on missiles, and that it does not possess even conventional missiles capable of reaching the US mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stream of belligerent rhetoric from Pyongyang has been attributed to attempts by the North's 30-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, to cement his grip on power and to win aid and political concessions from the US, including an agreement not to launch a pre-emptive strike against the isolated state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North and South Korean remain technically at war because their 1950-1953 civil war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. A full-scale war is unlikely but there is clear concern in Seoul about the more realistic threat of a small-scale attack on the South Korean military or a group of islands near the countries' disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government recently changed its rules of engagement to allow its forces to respond immediately to any provocation rather than wait for official approval for a counter-attack. It has vowed to target Kim Jong-un and destroy some of the myriad statues of the ruling Kim dynasty in the event of a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tougher language coming out of the presidential Blue House is seen as an attempt by Park, who has taken a more conciliatory line towards the North since taking office this year, to steer a delicate course between rapprochement and pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, was criticised for what many saw as his slow and inadequate response to Pyongyang's provocations in 2010, when the North torpedoed a naval ship and shelled the frontline island of Yeonpyeong, killing 50 South Koreans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday the most powerful arm of North Korea's ruling party said the state would continue to develop nuclear weapons, and denied that the country was using its nuclear arsenal to win concessions and aid from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, the central committee of the Korean Workers' party said the nuclear programme would be accompanied by economic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The enemies are using both blackmail, telling us that we cannot achieve economic development unless we give up nuclear weapons, and appeasement, saying that they will help us live well if we choose a different path," Kim was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the regime's few sources of hard currency is the Kaesong industrial region, a joint project located six miles north of the border that draws on investment from about 120 South Korean companies and employs workers from both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the weekend North Korea threatened to close the complex, a move that would mark a potentially dangerous deterioration in cross-border ties. Aside from its importance as a symbol of inter-Korean co-operation since it opened in 2005, Kaesong plays a key role in the impoverished North's economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 200,000 North Korean workers and their families reportedly derive income from the complex, which also earns the country about $100m a year in profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zone was operating normally on Monday, despite Pyongyang's threats to close it down. Sudden closure could leave hundreds of South Korean workers, who cross into the North daily, stranded on the wrong side of the heavily fortified border separating the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no idea about what it will be like when I go to the North Korean side. It seems OK to be here, but we will be living there in a tense situation for a week," Kim Won-soo, a manager at the complex, told Associated Press before he left for work from the South Korean city of Paju on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hankyoreh, a left-leaning South Korean newspaper, agreed that Kaesong's closure would heighten the risk of conflict on the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The North of course justifies its threats on the pretext of the ongoing [US-South Korea] combined military exercises. Even so, it was a huge mistake to threaten to shut down the Kaesong industrial complex, which has served as a safety valve keeping the worst-case scenario from actually happening," it said in an editorial on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/justinmccurry"&gt;Justin McCurry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Shortly afterwards he was struck by a train. Ambulance crews declared him dead at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police arrested two men aged 19, from Guildford, and a third man, from nearby Cranleigh, on suspicion of murder. BTP detectives are appealing for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officer leading the investigation, Detective Chief Inspector Iain Miller, said: "Our thoughts are very much with the man's family at this acutely difficult time for them. They're trying to come to terms with what has happened and at this stage, quite understandably, they have asked to be left alone to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The station was cordoned off until the early hours of Sunday morning while forensic officers conducted a thorough search and my team of detectives are working to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death, which we are currently treating as suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Three men were arrested in connection with the incident and they remain in custody being questioned by detectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly the man's family will have many questions about the circumstances leading up to his death but at this time the full sequence of events is unclear. However, we will do everything we can to shed light on what took place on Saturday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll be making local inquiries, including checking whether the incident was captured by CCTV cameras, but we know that there were a number of other people at the station at the time and want to hear from them. If you were there and have any information, no matter how insignificant it might seem, please get in touch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/peterwalker"&gt;Peter Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It killed nine people, including seven police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police at the scene said guards may not have suspected the tanker because fuel trucks arrive every morning to deliver gas and oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tank was stopped just behind the police administration building and partially damaged it. I was injured in my face and stomach because of glass," Captain Mohammed Salih said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intensifying violence has accompanied the political crisis in Iraq, where a power-sharing government among Shia, Sunni and ethnic Kurdish blocks has been all but paralysed since US troops left more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, a Shia, is also facing months of protests in the country's Sunni heartland, which shares a border with Syria. Many Iraqi Sunnis feel their minority sect has been sidelined by Maliki's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security experts say al-Qaida-linked militants have been regrouping in the western province of Anbar and crossing into Syria to fight alongside mainly Sunni rebels against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Shia Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iraq"&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida"&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/terrorism"&gt;Global terrorism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Forecasters predict that the cold snap could last until mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Radcliffe, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said temperatures would reach a maximum of 7C (44.6F) on Monday but in places such as north Wales and Cumbria there would be lows of -4C (24.8F). London was expected to be about -2C (28.4F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "Throughout this week it's going to remain cold, but not quite as cold as we've recently seen. Tomorrow it could get up to widely around 7 to 8C and it will be similar on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There might be some light flurries of snow but it won't be anything significant. There is no clear sign of warmer weather at the moment. Next weekend could be milder but there is a lot of uncertainty around it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average temperature from 1-26 March was 2.5C (36.5F), three degrees below the long-term average, according to the Met Office. This would make it the coldest March since 1962 and the fourth coldest in the UK since records began in 1910.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at individual countries, the Met Office said March would be the fourth coldest on record for England, joint third coldest for Wales, joint eighth coldest for Scotland and sixth coldest for Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday was reported to be the coldest Easter day on record, with the mercury falling to -12.5C (9.5F) in Braemar, in the Scottish Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperatures have varied wildly: on 11 March -12.9C (8.8F) was recorded at Kinbrace in the Highlands and Aboyne in Aberdeenshire; on 5 March thermometers reached 17.5C (63.5F) at Trawsgoed in Ceredigion, west Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average maximum temperatures for the month ranged from 8.3C (46.9F) on the Isles of Scilly to 2.7C (36.9F) in North and West Yorkshire, while minimum temperatures ranged from 5.4C (41.7F) on the Isles of Scilly to -3.4C (25.9F) at Braemar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Mr Bailey said: "He was a very nice man, both he and his wife. He'd lived here a few years and was always helpful and handy. We're just very, very sorry as he was a lovely young man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roman Catholic bishop of Nottingham, the Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, called the death "a tragic loss" and said Taylor would be remembered by many with affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austrian police said Taylor was the last person in a group of his colleagues making their way back, and it was not known why he fell. He went down a steep slope and then fell four metres (13ft) off a high stone wall on to the road below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fall left the IT teacher with serious head injuries, according to the police. Emergency services attempted to resuscitate Taylor, but he died at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austrian authorities have ordered a postmortem to be carried out to try to establish the cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school trip has been cut short and the pupils, aged 14 and 15, are expected to return to the UK on Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon said: "I was saddened to learn of the death in Austria of Jonathan Taylor, an IT teacher at Christ the King Catholic Voluntary Academy in Arnold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My thoughts and prayers are with his wife and family as they begin to come to terms with their tragic loss, the pupils whom he was accompanying on their skiing holiday and the entire community of Christ the King school at this difficult time. Jonathan will be remembered with affection by many people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Austria on March 30. Next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/austria"&gt;Austria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Shoppers swarmed into the Lotte department store, snapping up early-evening discounts in the basement food hall, while TV channels served up an eclectic mix of baseball, period drama and news of a spiralling crisis over government appointees surrounding the new president, Park Geun-hye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little, if anything, was said about North Korea, which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/31/north-korea-south-factory-threat" title=""&gt;has directed a flurry of furious threats&lt;/a&gt; at the South and the US in recent weeks, culminating in the release of a mildly comedic photograph of the regime's 30-year-old leader, Kim Jong-un, seated with his generals in front of a map pinpointing envisioned US targets &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/29/kim-jongun-missiles-standby-attack-us" title=""&gt;for a nuclear strike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kim Jong-un is crazy," said Josiah Jung, a 22-year-old student. "He runs a poor, hungry country â€¦ his threats are just talk designed to get food and money. But if North Korea bombs any part of South Korea, like it did in 2010, this time we should respond with an all-out attack."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While experts believe the North is a long way off building a functioning nuclear weapon, let alone one that can reach the US mainland, Pyongyang gave notice on Sunday that it would push ahead with the development of weapons of mass destruction. In a statement released by the official KCNA news agency, the central committee of the ruling Korean Workers' party slammed charges that the North was using its nuclear programme to win aid and diplomatic concessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclear weapons "are neither a political bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself," the party' top decision-making body said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea's "nuclear armed forces" it added, "represent the nation's life, which can never be abandoned as long as the imperialists and nuclear threats exist on earth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes amid frequent threats to attack South Korea and its allies, the US and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/30/north-korea-state-war-south-korea" title=""&gt;the regime said it had entered a "state of war" with Seoul&lt;/a&gt; and would "settle accounts with the US" after two of its stealth bombers took part in a training mission over an uninhabited South Korean island. Pyongyang said it would retaliate against any provocations by the US or the South "without prior notice".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the unification ministry in Seoul, which is responsible for cross-border relations, said: "North Korea's statement is not a new threat but is the continuation of provocative threats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts believe North Korea, now ruled by a third generation of the Kim dynasty, is reverting to a trusted diplomatic strategy of using threats to win concessions on aid and, ultimately, a peace treaty with the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime, so the received wisdom goes, has neither the capability nor the political will to make good on its threats. It knows that an attack on the US or its overseas assets would invite swift, powerful retaliation against Pyongyang and prompt the collapse of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view is shared by many South Koreans, even those too young to remember similar provocations by Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-il. "This has been going on since the 1950s and 60s," said Lee Jang-won, a 29-year-old employee of a solar power firm who recently completed his national service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think North Korea will do anything major, despite what it says. Kim Jong-un has too much to lose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim burnished his credentials as the North's "supreme commander" with a successful rocket launch last December and a nuclear test last month, but he is still building his reputation at home. The North Korean economy is in ruins after years of international sanctions, and the state can no longer provide for its people, 24 million of whom face regular food shortages, the UN says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North's statement said its nuclear programme would be accompanied by economic development through more foreign trade and investment and a focus on agriculture, light industry and a "self-reliant nuclear power industry".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even dictatorships respond to public opinion and public pressure," said John Delury, a North Korea analyst at of Yonsei University in Seoul. "He's expected to pay attention to, and make improvements in, the common people's standard of living. They've put that promise out in their domestic propaganda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While threats of a nuclear strike or other major attacks are being dismissed as bluster, the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/29/could-north-korean-armageddon-happen" title=""&gt;possibility of a more localised conflict is a growing concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2010, the North shelled Yeonpyeong, a South Korean island near the countries' disputed Yellow Sea border, killing two civilians and two soldiers. Earlier the same year, a torpedo attack blamed on the North sank a South Korean naval ship, killing 46 sailors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seoul did not take action, but promised fierce retaliation if attacked again, raising fears that a naval clash or isolated shelling in the coming days or weeks could quickly spiral out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Snyder, a senior fellow for Korea studies with the US Council on Foreign Relations thinktank, said the US should now help Kim Jong-un find a way to lower the diplomatic temperature. "There is a need for the US and South Korea to offer some clear diplomatic gestures of reassurance toward the North that can help the North Koreans climb down, calm down and change course," Snyder told AFP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, cool heads prevail in Seoul's presidential Blue House. Park, a conservative who took office less than two months ago, has spoken of engagement with the North â€“ a departure from the hardline stance of her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, who cut free-flowing aid and took inter-Korean relations to their lowest point in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Park reportedly wants to begin the process by offering humanitarian aid, followed by huge investment in North Korea's social and economic infrastructure, but only if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kim-jong-un"&gt;Kim Jong-un&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/kim-jong-il"&gt;Kim Jong-il&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/justinmccurry"&gt;Justin McCurry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Patents will be given only for genuine inventions, and repetitive patents will not be given for minor tweaks to an existing drug," Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis did not immediately return calls for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss pharmaceutical giant has fought a legal battle in India since 2006 for a fresh patent for its leukaemia drug Gleevec, known in India and Europe as Glivec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's patent office had rejected the company's patent application because it was not a new medicine but an amended version of its earlier product. The patent authority cited a legal provision in India's 2005 patent law aimed at preventing companies from getting fresh patents for making only minor changes to existing medicines â€“ a practice known as "evergreening".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis appealed, arguing Glivec was a newer, more easily absorbed version of the drug that qualified for a fresh patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anand Grover, a lawyer for the Cancer Patients Aid Association, which has taken the lead in the legal fight against Novartis, said the ruling on Monday prevented the watering down of India's patent laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very good day for cancer patients. It's the news we have been waiting for for seven long years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aid groups, including Doctors Without Borders, have opposed Novartis's case, fearing that a victory for the Swiss drugmaker would limit access to important medicines for millions of poor people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gleevec, used in treating chronic myeloid leukaemia and other cancers, costs about $2,600 (Â£1,700) a month. Its generic version was available in India for around $175 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The difference in price was huge. The generic version makes it affordable to so many more poor people, not just in India, but across the world," said YK Sapru, of the Mumbai-based cancer patients' association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/india"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/cancer"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But now the tiny force of just 535 officers tucked away in the south-west of Scotland has been swallowed up in the largest policing merger of the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Monday, all eight of Scotland's regional forces are being replaced by just one, Police Scotland, which is now the UK's second-largest force after the Metropolitan police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 17,400 officers will cover a patch of more than 30,000 square miles and a population of 5.3m people; its beat is vast, ranging from the housing estates of east end Glasgow to the distant islands of Shetland and Fair Isle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/12/met-commissioner-candidate-stephen-house" title=""&gt;Stephen House&lt;/a&gt;, the tough, uncompromising former head of Strathclyde police and a former assistant commissioner with the Met, is the chief constable of Police Scotland. He says the new force will bring dramatic, much-needed improvements to Scottish policing â€“ particularly on major, complex cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appointed six months ago, House has already merged Scotland's numerous competing CID and specialist units into one national specialist crime division, staffing it with 2,000 detectives. His mission is to provide "highly visible and accessible policing, coupled with improved access to those specialist services which are needed when threat and harm exists in communities".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House, a leading candidate to be Met commissioner two years ago, also believes Scotland's single force will be a model for the "inevitable" mergers of England and Wales's 43 forces. It is a proposal which has been vigorously resisted by English and Welsh chief constables and local councils, but success for Police Scotland could embolden the Home Office to try again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are serious anxieties about the new force's accountability, its centralisation and the future of the 6,200 civilian staff believed to be most at risk from cuts and efficiency savings. Critics say the merger has been rushed by the Scottish government to save money, leaving it without any independent democratic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are fears too about a long-running conflict between the new force's chief constable, Stephen House, and the head of the new &lt;a href="http://www.spa.police.uk/" title=""&gt;Scottish Police authority&lt;/a&gt;, Vic Emery, over his quango's power to set the force's budgets and personnel policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alison McInnes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats' justice spokeswoman, said the merger endangered the tradition of community-based policing and local accountability in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy and strategy will be heavily controlled at national level, even though Scotland is a very varied, diverse country. Plans for local commanders to liaise with local councils and agree local policing plans was no substitute for direct oversight and authority, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All eight independent police authorities, which were made up of local councillors and oversaw the previous forces, agreeing budgets and policing plans, have been scrapped. The new single police authority's 13 members are appointed by the justice secretary, Kenny McAskill, who also approved House's appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInnes questions House's decision to have armed officers on permanent patrol across the country.That might be necessary in urban Glasgow, she said, but outside major cities the policy is alien to Scotland's unarmed policing tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're on a dangerous road here. With much greater control from the centre, the big decisions about what style of policing we have and what the major priorities will be set by a single police authority board, which is a group of 13 unelected people," she said. "There's a democratic deficit now, quite clearly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger, which ministers insist should save Â£1.4bn over 15 years, has been supported by many, often younger senior officers. But several departing chief constables have been openly critical. One, Colin McKerracher, until Friday the chief constable of Grampian, said he was "horrified" when the merger was first proposed in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/2407108/" title=""&gt;In his final interview with the Aberdeen Press &amp; Journal&lt;/a&gt; last week, McKerracher said he believed policing had become a "political football" at Holyrood, and feared policing was becoming politicised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government are saying that this new service will be locally focused," McKerracher said. "But the one thing that is changing is that there is no local police board able to select a chief constable and style of policing for the area. There will also be no power to hold their chief constable to account. So they are now fairly toothless policing committees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the only genuine democratic oversight of the new service has been forced on the government by MSPs at Holyrood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graeme Pearson, a Labour MSP who was head of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency and an assistant chief constable at Strathclyde, oversaw a move by Holyrood's justice committee to set up a sub-committee specifically to monitor the new single force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It plans to call House and Emery to give evidence in open hearings about the force's performance and question council leaders about local accountability. Even so, it has no legal authority over the police or the SPA. Pearson said he hoped a future government would make its role legally binding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pearson said he been an advocate of a single force for over a decade, and believes some English forces should be merged, but this model had been rushed by the Scottish government. It should have had greater independent oversight and been set up more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SPA's control over the force's budgets and personnel could threaten House's operational independence, he said. "If something does go wrong with policing in Scotland, then who's to take responsibility for that? Certainly, it's a fudge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacAskill disputes those criticisms and insists the new structure was "overwhelmingly" approved by Holyrood. The SPA would hold House to account, while it was held to account by parliament. Each council has the statutory right to approve and scrutinise local plans, he said, and would liaise directly with area commanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will continue to be strong local accountability in the new landscape and the new arrangements will lead to more local scrutiny of police services," he told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Union leaders estimate up to 2,000 civilian staff, including highly experienced forensics experts, scene of crime officers and control room staff, will need to be cut to meet the government's Â£1.4bn to Â£1.7bn savings targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House agrees cuts "in the low thousands" will be needed, but has hinted police officer numbers might be cut â€“ a political challenge as Alex Salmond, the first minister, has made having 1,000 extra police officers on the streets &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-21980816" title=""&gt;a priority&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 civilian jobs have already been cut in the last year. George McIrvine, the force's Unison branch officer, said: "For all Kenny MacAskill saying that they're not interfering with Scottish policing, but if you're handcuffing the force to keep 17,400 officers, then any cuts fall on civilian staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House openly argues that the 17,400 level could still prove unaffordable and is irritated by the SPA's high degree of control over his finances. But he &lt;a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/public-safety/Police/ConsultationFuturePolicin" title=""&gt;insists&lt;/a&gt; the new force will be far more effective than its eight predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House has been openly critical of the often patchy, top-heavy system before, making enemies of other chief officers. He &lt;a href=" http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/sep/12/met-commissioner-candidate-stephen-house" title=""&gt;told the Guardian in 2011&lt;/a&gt; that a single force would allow policing to be far decentralised, because local commanders would have more discretion and authority with one single national chief constable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Northern Constabulary covered the biggest area of any UK force â€“ some 12,000 square miles â€“ without its own forensics lab or autopsy facilities; it had to use Grampian's in Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While overall crime in Scotland is at a 37-year low, detection rates are varied. Some forces' records on solving complex crimes is poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have reformed from a position of strength, high performance levels and increasing public confidence," House said last week. "The principles of public service and a code of ethics which captures our approach to integrity, fairness and respect are at the core of our business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scottish-independence"&gt;Scottish independence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scotland"&gt;Scottish politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/severincarrell"&gt;Severin Carrell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Working age housing benefit and unemployment claimants deemed to have one spare bedroom in social housing will lose 14% of their housing benefit and those with two or more spare bedrooms will lose 25%. An estimated 1m households with extra bedrooms are paid housing benefit. Critics say it is an inefficient policy as in the north of England, families with a spare rooms outnumber overcrowded families by three to one, so thousands will be hit with the tax when there is no local need for them to move. Two-thirds of the people hit by the bedroom tax are disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings: Â£465m a year. As many as 660,000 people in social housing will lose an average of Â£728 a year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 1 April &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands lose access to legal aid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branded by Labour a "day of shame" for the legal aid system, the cutoff to claim legal aid will be a household income of Â£32,000, and those earning between Â£14,000 and Â£32,000 will have to take a means test. Family law cases including divorce, child custody, immigration and employment cases will be badly affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings: a minimum Â£350m from Â£2.2bn legal aid bill.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 1 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Council tax benefit passes into local control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Council tax benefit, currently a single system administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, is being transferred to local councils with a reduction in funding of 10%. Council tax benefit is claimed by 5.9 million low-income families in the UK. The new onus on councils has come at a time when local government funding, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has fallen by 26.8% in two years in real terms. A Guardian survey of 81 councils last week found many claiming they face difficult cuts, with almost half saying they were reducing spending on care services for adults. This also comes at a time when 2.4m households will see a council tax rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings: up to Â£480m a year, but depends on decisions of local councils. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 1 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NHS commissioning changes for ever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NHS commissioning board and a total of 240 local commissioning groups made up of doctors, nurses and other professionals will take control of budgets to buy services for patients. They will buy from any service providers, including private ones so long as they meet NHS standards and costs. Strategic health authorities and primary care trusts disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs: Â£1.4bn, mainly in redundancies, followed by savings as high as Â£5bn in 2015 owing to fall in staff numbers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 1 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulation of financial industry changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority, housed in the Bank of England, replace the Financial Services Authority. The Bank promises these changes do not represent the death and Easter resurrection of the same body. A new, proactive supervisory approach towards the City is promised, focused on outcomes rather than a tick-box culture. It has powers to prosecute, throw people out of the industry and withdraw a bank's licence. Above all it monitors risk to the financial system as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Saturday 6 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50p tax rate scrapped for high earners &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announced in the 2012 budget. George Osborne said the 50p rate, introduced in April 2010, caused massive distortions in 2010-11 and raised only Â£1bn, rather than the Â£2.5bn forecast by Labour back in 2009. HMRC found Â£16bn was deliberately shifted into the previous tax year, largely by owner/directors of companies taking dividends in the previous year when the highest rate was still 40p. Labour claims 13,000 millionaires will get a Â£100,000 tax cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 8 April &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disability living allowance scrapped &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The personal independence payment (PIP) replaces the disability living allowance and, according to the DWP, is not based on your condition, but on how your condition affects you, so narrowing the gateway to the PIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will contain two elements: a daily living component and a mobility component. If you score sufficient points, a claim can be made. Assessments will be face-to-face rather than based on written submissions, starting in Bootle benefits centre, handling claims across the north-west and north-east.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 8 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefit uprating begins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in history welfare benefits and tax credits will not rise in line with inflation and will instead for the next three years rise by 1%. Had there been no change benefits would have risen by 2.2%. Disability benefits will continue to rise in line with inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savings: Â£505m in the first year, rising to Â£2.3bn in 2015-16. Nearly 9.5 million families will be affected, including 7 million in work, by Â£165 a year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday 15 April&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welfare benefit cap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most popular of the welfare reforms will begin on 15 April in the London boroughs of Bromley, Croydon, Enfield and Haringey. The intention is that no welfare claimants will receive in total more than the average annual household income after tax and national insurance â€“ estimated at Â£26,000. Other councils will start to introduce it from 15 July and it will be fully up and running by the end of September. Some estimate 80,000 households will be made homeless. The DWP says around 7,000 people who would have been affected by the cap have moved into work and a further 22,000 have accepted employment support to move into work. Households where someone is entitled to working tax credits will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Savings: Â£51m over three years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;28 April &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal credit introduced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new in- and out-of-work credit, which integrates six of the main out-of-work benefits, will start to be implemented this April in one jobcentre in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester. The aim is to increase incentives to work for the unemployed and to encourage longer hours for those working part-time. It had been intended that four jobcentres would start the trial in April, but this has been delayed until July, and a national programme will start in September for new claimants. They will test the new sanctions regime and a new fortnightly job search trial, which aims to ensure all jobseeker's allowance and unemployment claimants are automatically signed onto Job Match, an internet-based job-search mechanism. Suspicion remains that the software is not ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-housing"&gt;Social housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/legal-aid"&gt;Legal aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/counciltax"&gt;Council tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/regulators"&gt;Regulators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/taxandspending"&gt;Tax and spending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/disability"&gt;Disability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He was released on bail of 15,000 Egyptian pounds (Â£1,500) after being questioned for three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the latest in a series of arrests of opposition activists, lawyers and politicians this week â€“ and according to Egypt's foremost human rights campaigner, it heralds the most serious affront to free speech since associates of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood assumed power last year. "This is the crackdown," said Heba Morayef, director of Human Rights Watch in Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youssef rose to prominence after the country's 2011 uprising. His show has more than 30 million viewers across the Middle East and he has been sued several times by private individuals. But this is the first time that the prosecutor general, Talaat Abdallah, has followed up one of the complaints with legal action â€“ a symbolic gesture that suggests President Mohamed Morsi's Islamist-led regime is now prepared to take a more authoritarian stance against its critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youssef's show, al-Bernameg, critiques both fundamentalist clerics and Morsi â€“ whose face Youssef once projected on to a pillow â€“ and is seen as a triumph for free speech in the post-Mubarak era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that rosy view has been rocked by the prosecutor's intervention, the significance of which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/06/egypt-jon-stewart-al-bernameg" title=""&gt;Youssef explained in an interview with the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, when he said: "You can't prevent people from suing us. The tipping point would be if these lawsuits are activated by the attorney general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend that moment arrived and it has been received furiously by the government's opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pathetic efforts to smother dissent and intimidate media is a sign of a shaky regime and a bunker mentality," tweeted Mohamed ElBaradei, the leader of Egypt's main opposition coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youssef himself characteristically focused on the lighter side of his plight, arriving at court in a comically outsized version of a graduation hat worn by Morsi at a ceremony in Pakistan this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While inside, he said in tweets he later deleted: "Police officers and lawyers at the prosecutor-general's office want to be photographed with me, maybe this is why they ordered my arrest?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowds massed outside the court chanted: "Bassem, Bassem" after he was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's targeted, it's planned, and obviously it comes after a couple of speeches by Morsi where he made very clear threats," said Morayef&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Sunday, Morsi gave a speech and published a series of tweets in which he promised to take necessary measures against opposition figures who incited what he called &lt;a href="http://time100.time.com/2013/03/28/time-100-poll/slide/heba-morayef/" title="as violence and rioting"&gt;violence and rioting.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youssef's arrest is doubly concerning for Egypt's disparate opposition because it comes just a day after nine opposition activists and four lawyers were arrested in Alexandria â€“ and less than a week after Abdallah launched legal proceedings against five prominent activists (including the siblings Alaa Abdel-Fattah and Mona Seif) for inciting violence against the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also raised the possibility of a wider censorship of the media. For several months, the prosecutor-general has summoned journalists for questioning on charges of criminal defamation. But no related legal proceedings have yet been set in motion, which is why this week's developments have so alarmed the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been the first step, the Alaa and Mona case, and the Bassem Youssef case," said Morayef. "And that's why this is so serious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdallah's actions also renewed concerns about Egypt's "Brotherhoodisation", a term used by critics of the regime to imply that the Muslim Brotherhood has used its influence to appoint its allies to administrative positions whose roles are intended to be politically neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdallah himself has long been considered such a politicised appointment, after Morsi circumvented constitutional protocol to promote him in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdallah's decision to arrest the activists and Youssef adds to this impression, particularly as it immediately followed Morsi's speech last Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add to the mess, a judge this week ruled that Abdallah's appointment was illegal â€“ but Abdallah refused to stand&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bassem-youssef"&gt;Bassem Youssef&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mohamed-morsi"&gt;Mohamed Morsi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/censorship"&gt;Censorship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/muslim-brotherhood"&gt;Muslim Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrick-kingsley"&gt;Patrick Kingsley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

On January 31, Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse was also shot and killed near the courthouse in the small Texas town outside Dallas. McLelland (pictured below) had vowed to arrest the "scum" responsible for that murder. No arrests have been made in that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheriff David Byrnes said precautions were being taken to protect other local officials and there would be increased security at the courthouse. "It's pretty obvious it's unnerving," he said at a press conference Sunday. "We are striving to assure the community that we are providing public safety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Dallas Morning News, the bodies of the McLellands were discovered in the hallway of their home Saturday by a police officer friend who had come to check on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darren Rozell, mayor of nearby Forney, said the attack "appears to be a targeted act" and urged the unincorporated area's 40,000 residents to stay calm. "Everybody's a little on edge and a little shocked," Rozell said. "It appears this was not a random act."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Rosander, who lives in the same unincorporated area of Kaufman County as the McLellands, told the Associated Press that sheriff's deputies were parked in the district attorney's driveway for about a month after Hasse was killed. The DA had also armed himself for protection, telling reporters that he carried a gun everywhere and took extra care when opening the door at his home following his assistant's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm ahead of everybody else because, basically, I'm a soldier," the 23-year army veteran boasted in an interview less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrnes declined to comment on security arrangements ahead of the shooting and would not go into detail as to the measures now being brought in to protect other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there was nothing that indicated a link between the two incidents "for sure" but others indicated that investigators are working on that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaufman police chief Chris Aulbaugh told The Dallas Morning News: "It was a shock with Mark Hasse, and now you can just imagine the double shock and until we know what happened, I really can't confirm that it's related but you always have to assume until it's proven otherwise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December the Texas department of public safety issued a state-wide bulletin warning that authorities had received "credible information" that white supremacist group the Aryan Brotherhood was planning retaliation against law enforcement officials following indictments of dozens of its members in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High ranking members â€¦ are involved in issuing orders to inflict 'mass casualties or death' to law enforcement officials who were involved in cases where Aryan Brotherhood of Texas are facing life sentences or the death penalty," the bulletin stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLelland himself had raised the possibility that his assistant was gunned down by the white supremacist gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasse was formerly the chief of the organised crime unit in Dallas County and he handled similar cases in Kaufman County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killings also follow the March 19 murder of Colorado Department of Corrections head Tom Clements, who was shot dead after answering the doorbell at his home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US authorities have linked Evan Spencer Ebel, a former Colorado inmate and white supremacist, to the death of Clements and a pizza deliveryman two days earlier. Ebel was killed in a shootout with Texas deputies about 100m (160km) from Kaufman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLelland and his wife have two daughters and three sons. One son is a police officer in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime"&gt;US crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime"&gt;Gun crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominic-rushe"&gt;Dominic Rushe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

At 9am on Tuesday morning, the 19-year-old will report, as instructed in his draft papers, to a military base near Tel Aviv. There he will state his objection to serving in the Israeli army. Following his refusal to enlist, Blanc expects to be arrested and sentenced to between 10 and 20 days in jail. He will then be taken to Military Prison Number 6 to serve his time. And then, following his release, the cycle will begin over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why Blanc knows what to expect is that this will be the eighth time the teenage conscientious objector has been jailed in the past 19 weeks. Since the date of his original call-up for military service, Blanc has spent more than 100 days in prison; on one occasion, he was released on a Tuesday and re-imprisoned two days later on a Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanc began to consider the possibility of refusing the draft several years ago. "It was a very hard decision, it took me a long time to get to it," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turning point was Operation Cast Lead, the war in Gaza that began at the end of 2008 and ended three weeks later with a Palestinian death toll of around 1,400. In a statement issued when he was first imprisoned, Blanc said: "The wave of aggressive militarism that swept the country then, the expressions of mutual hatred, and the vacuous talk about stamping out terror and creating a deterrent effect were the primary trigger for my refusal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government, he said, was "not interested in finding a solution to the existing situation, but rather in preserving it&amp;nbsp;â€¦ We will talk of deterrence, we will kill some terrorist, we will lose some civilians on both sides, and we will prepare the ground for a new generation full of hatred on both sides&amp;nbsp;â€¦ We, as citizens and human beings, have a moral duty to refuse to participate in this cynical game."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Guardian, he says: "The war going on in this country for more than 60 years could have ended a long time ago. But both sides are giving into extremists and fundamentalists. The occupation was supposed to be temporary, but now no one speaks of it ending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli state, he adds, keeps people "under our control" without democratic rights. Palestinians are subject to "collective punishment" for the actions of a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Israelis grow up knowing that compulsory military service â€“ three years for boys, two for girls â€“ lies at the end of their school days. "Going to the army" is a deeply ingrained, collective experience in Israeli national identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, it's an eagerly-anticipated patriotic duty; for others, a rite of passage; for a few, a difficult moral dilemma. But it is rare for people to refuse on grounds of conscience. Blanc says that since November, he has been the only conscientious objector among the 300-400 inmates in Military Prison Number 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of his friends have come to accept his position â€“ "we had the arguments a long time ago" â€“ and some who are currently serving as combat soldiers now say they admire it. His parents, despite some anxiety, are supportive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanc rejected the option taken by some objectors of claiming a medical condition that would exempt him from military service. "I didn't want to lie. This is a point of principle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither could he seek exemption of the grounds of pacifism. "The army has a narrow definition of pacifism â€“ someone who would never apply force in any circumstances. The [IDF's] conscience committee asks tough questions, and I would not be able to say never. I think force should be used rarely, but it can't be completely ruled out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanc is willing to undertake national service in lieu of the compulsory stint in the army, but thus far the military has refused to countenance this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the IDF said it could not comment on Blanc's specific case, but conscription was a result of Israel's security situation. Although there were limited grounds for exemption, those called up were "fully aware of their responsibilities towards the military and the consequences for failing" to carry them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanc hesitates when asked if he would describe himself as a patriot. "I feel a strong connection to this country, and I'm proud of it in many ways. But I have an aversion to nationalism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prison life has taken some adjustment. Blanc, who shares a tent with around 20 other prisoners, is woken for roll call around 5am and works eight hours a day in the kitchen. The inmates, who wear surplus US military uniforms, can make calls on a public phone but are forbidden to keep their mobiles. There is a prison library, but no gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no idea how long this will go on for," said Blanc. "The bad scenario is that I will be put in front of a military court and sentenced to something like a year in prison. The better scenario is that they'll get tired of this, and will let me do national service instead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard for Blanc to see beyond the game of cat-and-mouse in which he and the IDF are currently engaged, but he says: "I don't want to deal with politics and conflict all my life." He would like to study science or technology at university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He brushes aside a suggestion that his current stance could harm his future prospects. "I'm proud of what I'm doing.

It is a great institution that does a huge amount for the north-east, and I wish the team very well over the next vital seven games. However, in the light of the new manager's past political statements, I think it right to step down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politician had been serving as vice-chairman and a non-executive director at Sunderland, whose board he joined in 2011 after losing out on the Labour leadership to his brother, Ed. He confirmed last week he was quitting as MP for South Shields to become CEO of the International Rescue Committee in New York, as he sought to end the "soap opera" surrounding his relationship with his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time Di Canio's political views have led to controversy and break-ups at clubs he has worked with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GMB trade union also cited his political views when it withdrew its sponsorship of Swindon Town after he was appointed its manager in 2011. The former Italian international, whose club career has included stints at Juventus, Napoli, AC Milan, Lazio, Glasgow Celtic, Charlton Athletic, West Ham and Sheffield Wednesday, has spoken openly in the past about his far-right leanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005 he told the Italian news agency Ansa: "I am a fascist, not a racist." He has been pictured giving a straight-arm salute in front of fans of the Rome club Lazio, which has a strong following among the far right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his autobiography, he wrote of the Italian dictator Mussolini: "His actions were often vile. But all this was motivated by a higher purpose. He was basically a very principled individual."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also courted controversy for his actions as a player, including when he pushed a referee to the ground in 1998 after being sent off in a match between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal. However, some praised him for his conduct as a West Ham player when he picked up the ball during a match with Everton after the opposition's goalkeeper lay injured. He was awarded Fifa's fair play award in 2001 in recognition of his "special act of good sportsmanship".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunderland's chairman, Ellis Short, endorsed Di Canio as the manager, who he believes can prevent the club from being relegated from the Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Paolo is hugely enthused by the challenge that lies ahead of him. He is passionate, driven and raring to get started," Short said in a statement on the club's official website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miliband's announcement on Sunday was praised by many, including Labour MP Stella Creasy, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stellacreasy/status/318468711315025920" title=""&gt;who said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that his decision to part company with Sunderland was "all the more powerful" given how much the role meant to him. However, the commentator andformer footballer Stan Collymore&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/318476200517435393" title=""&gt; tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: "Faux outrage as always on twitter. No Italian ex footballer every called me N*****. Just plenty from the wonderful UK shires."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/paolo-di-canio"&gt;Paolo Di Canio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sunderland"&gt;Sunderland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/benquinn"&gt;Ben Quinn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

For example, simply by looking at the outside of a restaurant or cinema and pointing, the user can call up relevant Guardian reviews of the food or current films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For some time, our users have been telling us they want an even more immersive Guardian experience, without the hassle of having to reach for their phones, or switch on their iPads, and Guardian Goggles are the answer," a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, when you're out shopping, you needn't have memorised our recent features on ethically sourced foods. Just call up the 'Mini-Monbiot' app, and the products you're looking at will be rated in front of your eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related software can detect the destinations featured in holiday brochures, warning wearers before they book trips to countries with problematic human rights records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectacles also feature optional built-in anti-bigotry technology, which prevents exposure to non-Guardian opinions by blacking out columns by Melanie Phillips or Richard Littlejohn, among other writers, as soon as the user attempts to look at them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media analysts predicted that the Goggles could have a tectonic effect on the media landscape. "This is the easily biggest development in news technology since newspapers opened 'virtual bureaus' in Second Life in 2006, transforming journalism forever," said Paul McMullan, the former tabloid journalist who is now Professor of Disruptive Thinkovation at City University in London. "I frankly wouldn't be surprised if this were an even bigger success than Google+."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Goggles app, currently in development, will allow readers with strong feelings about postings on the Guardian's Comment Is Free site simply to yell their objections out loud, for example in the street, or on a bus. A voice-recognition system will then add their opinions to the relevant web page within 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An algorithm designed to detect frequently recurring viewpoints -- for example, that the Guardian should not be wasting valuable internet space by running blog posts about fashion or celebrities -- will enable those to be added to the site even faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A still more ambitious project could see the G2 columnist and psychotherapist Pamela Stephenson Connolly delivering sex-related advice in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limited-edition designer model, evoking the shape of the letter "g" from the Guardian's masthead, has been specially created by a collective of avant-garde designers working in association with Christopher Biggins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already the glasses, a limited number of which have been given to prominent public figures for testing, have attracted a number of high-profile fans, including at least one cabinet minister.

This concerns doctors because they are very uncomfortable with having to take rationing decisions," Porter said. "The General Medical Council's 'duties of a doctor' says the first one is to make the care of your patient your first concern, and we're being dragged away from that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most doctor-patient relationships would be unaffected by the restructuring of the NHS, he said, "the risk is there that what will creep into it is the thought in the patient's mind that the doctor's recommendations or decisions have not been based on the patient's best interests but on some local policy which restricts the NHS there rather than somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But when you bring that sort of thing into the doctor-patient relationship, it destroys the trust that is so important for being able to successfully work with the patient to manage a condition. So the GPâ€‘patient relationship could be threatened," said Porter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPs, who often top polls of most trusted professionals, could see their reputation harmed by such a difficult role, which Porter blamed on government underfunding of the NHS. The overhaul has created hundreds of local and national NHS organisations. "Doctors are being asked to be agents of the state in implementing public-sector resource restrictions," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS's duty to make Â£15bn-Â£20bn of "efficiency savings" by 2015 through rationing access to procedures such as IVF, cataract removals and exploratory knee operations was likely to be extended to other procedures by CCGs as more savings had to be made, added Porter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPs on the Commons public accounts committee said last month that patients were paying the price of the savings drive as NHS bodies sought to restrict entitlement to care rather than money-saving innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter said the need to save money had become so great that some hospital doctors could not simply "cross-refer" â€“ ask a colleague in another speciality to examine a patientabout whom they are concerned, â€“ without the PCT first approving it, a break with the tradition of consultants' judgment being trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, only GPs have been subject to trusts using such "demand management" mechanisms for patients who doctors want to send for examination at a local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, endorsed Porter's warning and said disputes between GPs and patients over restrictions on treatments were unavoidable in the new era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The relationship with patients and their GP is unique. Patients place their trust in their GPs and their decisions around care. We are concerned that the creation of CCGs will fundamentally alter this relationship between patients and their doctors, with breakdown relating to funding decisions almost inevitable," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCGs' responsibility to stick to their budgets could cause further problems, she added. "Will the GP always act in the best interest of his/her patient or will he put the finances of his organisation first? Will patients have the most appropriate investigations undertaken at the right time and will National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence-approved drugs be prescribed, or will we see a huge rise in the postcode lottery of prescribing?", she said. GPs and CCGs face "a temptation to put economics and business principles ahead of quality and safety in patient care", Murphy added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals and many CCGs, said the new NHS set-up was "a big opportunity to improve care and the way things work. The clinical expertise of commissioning organisations will be a huge asset and we need to take full advantage of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added, the service's tough financial position â€“ "coping with a flat budget and rising demand and costs" â€“ represented its biggest challenge. "Organisations have a tough job on their hands to continue providing quality care within a much tighter financial envelope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department of Health spokesperson said: "There are already examples up and down the country of the new GP clinical commissioning groups improving care, all being achieved because care is being directed by the healthcare experts who know patients best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have always been absolutely clear that b eing efficient does not mean cutting or rationing services â€“ it means getting the best value for every pound the NHS spends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The NHS has done well to see more patients, reduce the number of patients waiting over a year to start treatment and remain on track to save over Â£5bn this year. Any NHS underspend will still be available for NHS organisations to ensure high-quality, sustainable health services are delivered to patients now and in the future.," the DoH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gps"&gt;GPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/doctors"&gt;Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deniscampbell"&gt;Denis Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But researchers found that women with a degree born in 1958 earned nearly three times as much (198%) as women in unskilled jobs born in the same year â€“ compared to a difference of less than half (45%) between men in the same groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalia Ben-Galim, associate director of the IPPR, said: "While feminism has delivered for some professional women, other women have been left behind. Many of the advances for women at the top have masked inequality at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The 'break the glass ceiling' approach that simply promotes women in the boardroom has not been as successful in changing family-friendly working culture or providing opportunities for other women to advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gender still has a strong independent impact on women's earnings prospects â€“ but class, education and occupational backgrounds are stronger determinants of a woman's progression and earnings prospects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motherhood was also a key factor, with women who had children earlier seeing their earnings prospects decrease compared to those who postponed starting a family, the study found. For men, the reverse was true, as fathers enjoyed a "fatherhood pay bonus" that saw them earn more than men without children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPPR called for a more progressive parental leave system, more affordable and accessible childcare and better paid part-time jobs to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also warned against the "decoy effect" of focusing on women in high-profile positions, and said the breaking-down of stereotypes should be the priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that the number of "house husbands" in Britain has trebled over the last 15 years, with 62,000 men staying at home to care for their family and remaining economically inactive. But most women (77%) said they do more housework than their husbands, with just one in ten (10%) married men doing an equal amount and 13% doing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And researchers discovered that British men and women increasingly marry partners from the same social group, with a decline in women "marrying up" and a small increase in women "marrying down".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/equality"&gt;Equality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gender"&gt;Gender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/pay"&gt;Pay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feminism"&gt;Feminism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/maternitypaternityrights"&gt;Maternity &amp; paternity rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/work-and-careers"&gt;Work &amp; careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

We have heard he may have had a heart attack, maybe as he was being wrestled to the ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of staff at John Gowing Jewellers told the Oxford Mail: "All members of staff are okay â€“ this has been a shock, absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/oxford"&gt;Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Are you worried?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from some of his constituency's most vulnerable residents, all of whom stand to lose up to Â£100 a week from benefit cuts coming into effect this month, is a loud and unanimous "Yes!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 15 April, about 900 families in Lammy's north London constituency â€“ one of the most deprived in the country â€“ will be hit by the household benefit cap, which limits the total weekly amount each unemployed household can receive in benefits to Â£500. Haringey, the local authority, is one of four councils testing the cap, which will be rolled out across the rest of the country over the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lammy had written to all 900 and nearly 200 turn up on this chilly March morning, many of them mothers with young children in tow. There is palpable anxiety, and an undercurrent of anger. The first some of them knew of the imminent cut to their income, says Lammy, was when they opened his letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half such families will lose between Â£50 and Â£100 a week in housing benefit as a result of the benefit cap, he estimates. Those who face smaller losses may be able to scrape together the shortfall and keep their tenancy, but at the cost of buying food or heating their home. Others will be unable to pay their rent, and will end up in arrears, then homeless or forced to move out of London to low-rent areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those present are technically homeless, and have been living in council-provided temporary accommodation, often for years. Lammy is asked if Haringey will evict people who can't afford to pay the rent: "The answer is yes â€¦ Let's be brutally honest. If in a year's time people have huge arrears, Haringey will be put in a very difficult position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families can sidestep the cap if they find a job that offers 16 hours a week for single parents, or 24 hours for couples. But jobs are scarce in Tottenham, and as one mother points out, even if work is found, childcare is expensive. There is widespread alarm. "In each face here I can see fear, worry and anxiety," says Maurice, 57, an unemployed courier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the meeting Lammy says the welfare changes have generated a "real fear" about homelessness among his poorest constituents: "The local authority will have to think very hard about its responsibilities. We cannot evict people on to the streets with no alternative: this is not America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The household benefit cap is just one of nine changes coming in this month, laying bare the sheer enormity and complexity of the coalition's welfare reforms. Others include the bedroom tax (typical weekly loss per household, Â£14), the abolition in many areas of the country of council tax benefit (Â£3 a week), and the 1% cap on benefit increases (Â£3 a week). Six of these changes will take Â£2.3bn from the pockets of the poorest households in 2013-14, according to the charity Child Poverty Action group (CPAG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure does not include the replacement of disability living allowance with personal independence payments, to be phased in over three years from April. By 2016, an estimated 500,000 will lose this benefit, squeezing an estimated Â£1bn a year out of the incomes of disabled people. Disabled people will be disproportionately affected by the wider changes, with tens of thousands being hit simultaneously by up to six different welfare cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CPAG figure does not include two other changes: the localisation of the social fund, which has been replaced by 150 council-operated local welfare schemes; and the biggest reform of all, the introduction in October of universal credit, the ambitious attempt by work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith to merge a string of unemployment benefits and tax credits into a single payment for working-age people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan Smith argues universal credit will simplify the system, making it easier for people on benefits to make the leap into work. According to the government, a third of the 8 million households it covers will be better off. But about &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19966370" title=""&gt;450,000 disabled people&lt;/a&gt; will lose financially, according to Disability Rights UK, while &lt;a href="http://welfarenewsservice.com/poorest-400000-families-worse-off-under-universal-credit-finds-report/#.UVRjORxEzdw" title=""&gt;400,000 of the poorest households&lt;/a&gt; â€“ such as single parent households with children â€“ will be worse off by 2015, according to the Chartered Institute of Housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest phase of benefits reform will bring to 42 the bewildering number of social security cuts introduced by the coalition since May 2010. Collectively, these cuts mean households will cumulatively receive Â£16bn less than in 2010-11, says the CPAG. By 2015, ministers are aiming to save Â£18bn a year from the welfare budget, and they have signalled a further Â£10bn cut from 2016. The spending review in June is expected to set out further measures to contain the growing welfare bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social analysts are concerned that deprivation levels are going back to those of 30 years ago, with the poorest families worse off than they were under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Debt and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/27/london-food-poverty-fears-grow" title=""&gt;food poverty&lt;/a&gt; are growing, homelessness is increasing, and demand on food banks is soaring â€“ a sign of more people falling through the welfare net. The social impact of this impoverishment of Britain's poorest families â€“ with more than 60% of such households in work â€“ will unravel recent achievements in tackling poverty, say campaigners. According to Alison Garnham, chief executive of the CPAG, the coalition "is on course to leave behind the worst child poverty record of any government for a generation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others see the welfare agenda as presaging a profound shift in the relationship between the state and its most vulnerable citizens. "Last year I warned that we risk a decade of destitution. Some thought I was being over-dramatic," says Julia Unwin, head of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. "I am more convinced than ever that we have a perfect storm brewing; the reforms to welfare, the economic slowdown and spiralling costs, together with an increasingly spiteful tone in how we describe people in poverty, risks the UK becoming a nation where people face destitution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/bedroom-tax"&gt;Bedroom tax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/tottenham"&gt;Tottenham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/david-lammy"&gt;David Lammy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing"&gt;Housing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/housing-benefit"&gt;Housing benefit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-finance"&gt;Public finance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/policy"&gt;Public services policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/public-sector-cuts"&gt;Public sector cuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickbutler"&gt;Patrick Butler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The sums are far higher than original estimates that Bank of Cyprus depositors would take a 30% or 40% hit. The conditions were imposed when Cyprus was told to find â‚¬5.8bn as a condition of a â‚¬10bn loan from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades has braved the wrath of the influential Orthodox church by declaring that he will allow casinos to operate in Cyprus. Gambling has until now been legal only on the northern, Turkish side of the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president's other initiatives, outlined in an interview with the newspaper Fileleftheros Sunday, include tax exemptions on business profits reinvested in Cyprus and encouraging homeowners to reduce rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anastasiades, who came to power after elections in February, was understood to be holding talks with the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, who backed demands from the European troika that Cyprus pay for its bailout with a raid on bank deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To persuade Greece to hand over some of its own â‚¬48bn rescue loan, he planned to meet also with Samaras's coalition partner Evangelos Venizelos, as well as opposition party leaders and Greek president Karolos Papoulias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of Cyprus customers with deposits of more than â‚¬100,000 learned at the weekend that 37.5% of any money they hold over that threshold will be converted into shares in the country's largest bank, which are currently almost worthless. A further 22.5% of their savings will be put into a fund that earns no interest and could be confiscated should the bank need further funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining 40% of large deposits at the Bank of Cyprus will be "temporarily frozen for liquidity reasons", but continue to accrue existing levels of interest, plus another 10%, the central bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The savings converted to bank shares would theoretically allow depositors to recover their losses. But the stock now holds little value and may never regain a value equal to the depositors' losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses have been particularly affected by the measures. Fast-growing digital company Viber is headquartered in Cyprus and offers a service similar to Skype, designed for mobile phones. Its CEO, Talmon Marco, said he was considering leaving the island. "This is an extremely poor decision. We are considering all options at the moment," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus' finance minister Michalis Sarris said the measures were taken to put the Bank of Cyprus on a solid footing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We suffered a serious blow without doubt â€¦ but we now have a bank which is reformed and ready to assume its role in the Cypriot economy," the state-run Cyprus News Agency quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers have accused some of the 17 European countries that use the euro of wanting to see the end of Cyprus as an international financial services centre. They have also been accused of trying to send a message that European taxpayers will no longer shoulder the burden of bailing out problem banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Germanfinance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤euble challenged that notion, insisting in an interview with the Bild newspaper published on Saturday that "Cyprus is and remains a special, isolated case", and doesn't point the way for future European rescue programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recovery gambles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades, will introduce 12 measures to relieve the crisis, to be implemented over the next six months. In a plan reminiscent of Spain's project to create a EuroVegas gambling resort on farmland near Madrid, Cyprus wants to put forward legislation to allow its own casinos. This would be a public policy reversal for the island, which only last year banned online casinos and exchange betting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other measures include: forcing the housing department of housing to license development projects within at least 30 days; exempting company profits reinvested in Cyprus from tax; encouraging banks to lend for longer terms at lower rates; compelling businesses to ensure at least 70% of staff are Cypriot; finding ways to cut the cost of electricity; and nudging landlords to reduce rates with the threat of urgent interim measures if they do not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/gambling"&gt;Gambling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/juliette-garside"&gt;Juliette Garside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Met Office confirmed it had registered a temperature of -12.5 in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, in the Scottish Highlands. With modern records dating back to 1960, Sunday's freezing weather beat the previous record of -9.8, set in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The freezing temperatures, deep snowdrifts and bitter easterly winds stand in stark contrast to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/27/uk-warm-sunny-weather-continue" title=""&gt;last year's mini-heatwave&lt;/a&gt;, when the mercury in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, reached 22.9C on 26 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office said the month of March &lt;a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2013/cold-march-statistics" title=""&gt;still looked set to be the coldest since 1962&lt;/a&gt; and the fourth coldest since 1910.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1-26 March the UK mean temperature was 2.5C, three degrees below the long-term average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March is likely to be the fourth coldest on record for England, joint third coldest for Wales, joint eighth coldest for Scotland and sixth coldest for Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The week ahead is likely to remain extremely cold but snow is likely to hold off in most places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Dewhurst from the Met Office said: "We've got high pressure remaining in charge throughout this week so most places will be dry with sunny spells. But we stay on the cold side, especially for this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most places maximum temperatures would be between 6C and 8C with a blustery easterly wind in southern and eastern areas to be expected, he said. Wintry showers are expected to be "few and far between".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/malik-shiv"&gt;Shiv Malik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Teachers have until the middle of next month to suggest changes. They will be expected to teach the new curriculums from September 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olver, who is also chair of E4E, an organisation of 36 engineering institutions, said the draft proposals for design and technology did "not meet the needs of a technologically literate society".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of introducing children to new design techniques , such as biomimicry (how we can emulate nature to solve human problems), we now have a focus on cookery. Instead of developing skills in computer-aided design, we have the introduction of horticulture. Instead of electronics and control, we have an emphasis on basic mechanical maintenance tasks," he told a conference of educators earlier this month. "In short, something has gone very wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olver said the UK was at "crisis point". "We have to double our output of engineers from the education system now. We have to increase engineering graduates from 20,000 to 40,000 each year â€¦ for the economy to stand still. This is just to keep the lights on and the infrastructure ticking over."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers' advice to the DfE on the design and technology curriculum had been "completely ignored", he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olver is the latest in a long line of critics of the new curriculum. Last month, Steven Mastin, who stood as a Tory candidate in the last general election and is a history teacher, said the proposed curriculumfails to offer children a broad and balanced education. Presidents of the Royal Historical Society, the Historical Association, the higher education group History UK and senior members of the British Academy have also criticised the draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olver's remarks come as teaching unions labelled the curriculum "a pub-quiz primer" with an "exhaustive list of topics and age-inappropriate concepts". Andy Stone, a teacher from Wandsworth, told the National Union of Teachers' annual conference in Liverpool that it left no opportunity for teachers to respond when pupils asked questions about stories their grandmother had told them about the war or the news story they had read on Richard III's skeletal remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delegates adopted a motion stating that the curriculum would reduce "creativity and enjoyment at school, alienate young people and lead to more school absence â€¦ and disaffection".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Swift, from the NUT's executive committee, said she feared teachers would be forced to make children learn facts by rote, with inspectors turning up to test the children's knowledge of the continents, chronological order of history and times tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will be â€¦ a test every week to check that the empty vessels are filling up with facts, facts and more facts, ready for the tests, tests and more tests. Why does Mr Gove want to return to a curriculum more reminiscent of yesteryear?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DfE spokesman said the draft national curriculum was "challenging and ambitious" and would give every child "the broad and balanced education they need to fulfil their potential".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Education spokesman said the draft design and technology curriculum would give pupils the "skills and expertise to develop the innovative and creative designs and products of the future".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will consider views on how we can create a curriculum that will embody high expectations and give every child the broad and balanced education they need to fulfil their potential," he said, adding that the government had engaged with academics and experts and carefully analysed the world's most successful school systems before "building a curriculum which embodies high expectations".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/curriculums"&gt;Curriculums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching"&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/baesystems"&gt;BAE Systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/computerscienceandit"&gt;Computer science and IT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove"&gt;Michael Gove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/education"&gt;Education policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicashepherd"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It would appear that this police inquiry continues precisely that process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaz said that he was very surprised that the police report had been leaked and that Mitchell was right to feel that he had been badly treated by the police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the home affairs committee had always thought that the Met should not be in charge of investigating its own officers and the latest development confirmed that. "This is a good opportunity for the IPCC to take over this investigation and use the information that has been gathered so far as background," Vaz said. "We cannot have an investigation of this importance being done on the basis of leaks and innuendo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The allegation that Mitchell had called officers "plebs" ultimately led to his resignation as chief whip. However, after CCTV footage was broadcast casting doubt on the original account of what happened, Scotland Yard launched an investigation that led to the arrest of three Met diplomatic protection officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the IPCC decides there is some substance to Mitchell's complaint, it will have to decide whether its own independent investigators should try to find the source of the alleged leak or whether the police should carry out the inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of IPCC's first tasks is to examine the file submitted last week by the Met to prosecutors to see if the media reports were correct that it contained no evidence that police lied about the confrontation with Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPCC investigations can lead to internal police disciplinary cases or criminal charges such as misconduct in public office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The criticism from Mitchell and other senior Tories underscores the poor, and at times poisonous, relationship between sections of the police and the Conservative party. A host of issues have led to a deterioration in relations, from government cuts to police pay and conditions, with officers feeling their worth and work has been denigrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008 the Conservatives were infuriated when the Met arrested the shadow immigration minister at the time, Damian Green, as police tried to hunt down the source of leaks from within the Home Office. Green was not charged and Tory anger eventually helped to oust Bob Quick, the police chief who oversaw the arrest and the country's most senior counter-terrorism officer. Green is now minister of state for policing and criminal justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday. the Met referred inquiries to the IPCC, who would only confirm that they had received Mitchell's complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/andrew-mitchell"&gt;Andrew Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/metropolitan-police"&gt;Metropolitan police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewsparrow"&gt;Andrew Sparrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vikramdodd"&gt;Vikram Dodd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In some cases these caused devastating droughts across Africa; in others they increased rainfall in the region but left huge areas of Brazil parched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The massive complexities associated with geoengineering, and the potential for winners and losers, means that some form of global governance is essential," said &lt;a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/jim-haywood" title=""&gt;Jim Haywood&lt;/a&gt; at the Met Office's Hadley Centre in Exeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning builds on work by scientists and engineers to agree a regulatory framework that would ban full-scale geoengineering projects, at least temporarily, but allow smaller research projects to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoengineering comes in many flavours, but among the more plausible are "solar radiation management" (SRM) schemes that would spray huge amounts of sun-reflecting particles high into the atmosphere to simulate the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcanoes can blast millions of tonnes of sulphate particles into the stratosphere, where they stay aloft for years and cool the planet by reflecting some of the sun's energy back out to space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://royalsociety.org/policy/publications/2009/geoengineering-climate/" title=""&gt;In 2009, a Royal Society report&lt;/a&gt; warned that geoengineering was not an alternative to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, but conceded the technology might be needed in the event of a climate emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Climate Change, Haywood and others show that moves to cool the climate by spraying sulphate particles into the atmosphere could go spectacularly wrong. They began by looking at the unexpected impacts of volcanic eruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1912 and 1982, eruptions first at Katmai in Alaska and then at El ChichÃ³n in Mexico blasted millions of tonnes of sulphate into northern skies. These eruptions preceded major droughts in the Sahel region of Africa. When the scientists recreated the eruptions in climate models, rainfall across the Sahel all but stopped as moisture-carrying air currents were pushed south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having established a link between volcanic eruptions in the northern hemisphere and droughts in Africa, the scientists returned to their climate models to simulate SRM projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists took a typical project that would inject 5m tonnes of sulphate into the stratosphere every year from 2020 to 2070. That amount of sulphate injected into the northern hemisphere caused severe droughts in Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Chad and Sudan, and an almost total loss of vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same project had radically different consequences if run from the southern hemisphere. Rather than drying the Sahel, cooling the southern hemisphere brought rains to the Sahel and re-greened the region. But Africa's benefit came at the cost of slashing rainfall in north-eastern Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unintended consequences of SRM projects would probably be felt much farther afield. "We have only scratched the surface in looking at the Sahel. If hurricane frequencies changed, that could have an impact on the US," said Haywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/earthsciences/people/matthew-m-watson/index.html" title=""&gt;Matthew Watson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the &lt;a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/7895.html" title=""&gt;Spice project&lt;/a&gt; at Bristol University, said the study revealed the "dramatic consequences" of uninformed geoengineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper tells us there are consequences for our actions whatever we do. There is no get-out-of-jail-free card," he told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whatever we do is a compromise, and that compromise means there will be winners and losers. That opens massive ethical questions: who gets to decide how we even determine what is a good outcome for different people?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you get a consensus with seven billion-plus stakeholders? If there was a decision to do geoengineering tomorrow, it would be done by white western men, and that isn't good," Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/geoengineering"&gt;Geoengineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iansample"&gt;Ian Sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
