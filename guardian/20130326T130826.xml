From dark chocolate to milk chocolate, from non-dairy to jelly sweet-encrusted, our panel picks the tastiest organic and ethical ovoids this Easter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;DARK CHOCOLATE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Green--Blacks-Organic-Thick-Shelled-70-Dark-Chocolate-Egg/24915011"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green &amp; Black's Organic Thick Shelled 70% Dark Chocolate Egg (180g, £6.29)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every single taster remarked on the hints of spices in this offering. The nice thick shell was complimented on by many, as was the pleasantly bitter aftertaste. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/Easter-Eggs-In-Store-Treats-MS-Foodhall-Food-Wine/b/2562811031"&gt;Marks &amp; Spencer Fairtrade Dark (290g, £10)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This egg was generally decreed to be "bling". "Silver balls? Was this designed by a four-year-old?" asked one taster. Despite grave reservations on the decor, however, most approved of the chocolate itself. &lt;strong&gt;7/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cocoaloco.co.uk/acatalog/Dark_Chocolate_Raspberry_Splat_Easter_Egg.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Loco Organic Fairtrade Dark Raspberry Splat Easter Egg (225g, £11.99)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chocolate was variously described as "a tad burnt-tasting", "smoky", "lingering on the palate" and by several as "bitter". Opinions varied over whether the super-thick shell was a good thing or not, but all agreed on the high quality of the chocolate itself. The raspberries also divided the panel: "over-scented" or "too tart" said some, while others thought the balance was "unusual and appealing". &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Montezumas-Dark-Chocolate-with-Cocoa-Nibs-Eco-Egg/82205011?from="search&amp;tags&amp;param=montezumas+dark&amp;parentContainer=SEARCHmontezumas+dark_SHELFVIEW""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Montezuma's Dark Chocolate With Cocoa Nibs Eco Egg (150g, £7.99)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Nothing much to see here, move along," was the general consensus. "OK but nothing special", "less of a cocoa hit than some" and "could use a more complex flavour" were some of the fairly apathetic comments. Nothing wrong with it, but no one's favourite. &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sainsbury's Freefrom Dark Chocolate Easter Egg (200g, £3.99)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Too short on the palate," said one taster who has spent too much time watching Masterchef. "Superficial crowd-pleaser," said another. All agreed that for dark chocolate it was "too sweet" and "too creamy" - interesting, given that it's actually a vegan product. Tasters were also unconvinced by the chocolate discs inside. "What's the point when it's exactly the same chocolate as the egg?" carped one. Another suspiciously asked, "Is there cocoa butter in this?" A dark chocolate egg ideal for a frustrated vegan milk chocolate fan, then. &lt;strong&gt;5/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Divine-Dark-Chocolate-Egg-with-Dark-Ginger--Orange-Bar/66212011"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Divine Dark Chocolate Egg with Dark Ginger &amp; Orange Bar (260g, £10)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chorus of "average" and "bland" for this Fairtrade offering. "Not great, not terrible," and "middle of the road: if Chris Rea was an egg … " were also heard. Others were unimpressed by the thickness of the shell. "If I'd bought this, I'd feel a bit duped," said one. &lt;strong&gt;4/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MILK CHOCOLATE&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/shop/easter-eggs/luxury-easter-eggs/milk-chocolate-easter-egg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hotel Chocolat Cow Beastie Egg (190g, £15)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A universal proclamation of "yum!" for this Hotel Chocolat offering, which comes with mini-eggs of both praline and salted caramel varieties. Of the shell itself, the panel declared it "creamy", "not too sweet" and "delightful", with a "rich buttery aftertaste". The mini-eggs also went down a storm, particularly the pralines. &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cocoaloco.co.uk/acatalog/Jellied_Sweets_Easter_Egg.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Loco Organic Fairtrade Jellied Sweets Easter Egg (225g, £11.95)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jellied fruit-studded egg was greeted with approval, with the panel liking it's "pretty and unusual" appearance. The taste didn't disappoint: "The jellies really taste of fruit juice" and "a really refreshing change" cooed the panel of the sweets. The chocolate shell also got the thumbs up. "Very thick", "great hazelnut aftertaste" and "muscular: like a classy Yorkie bar in an egg form," they raved. &lt;strong&gt;8/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.co-operativefood.co.uk/deals/Shopping-List/Easter/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Co-operative Truly Irresistible Fairtrade Butterscotch Easter Egg (270g, currently £5; was £7.50)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another middle-of-the-road offering, with our panel generally shrugging their shoulders and giving this Co-operative egg a big, fat "OK". "Nothing special" and "a bit too sweet" were among the comments. &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.co-operativefood.co.uk/deals/Shopping-List/Easter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cooperative Truly Irresistible Fairtrade Raspberry and Pecan (285g, currently £5, was £7.50)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Quite nice for a milk chocolate," sniffed one chocolate snob. But generally this confection was met with approval. "Really don't need the white chocolate as well," said one, but the thickness of the shell and the quality of the milk chocolate got the thumbs up. The pecans seemed to have gone awol, though. &lt;strong&gt;6/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Montezumas-Organic-Milk-Chocolate-with-Butterscotch-Eco-Egg/82203011"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Montezuma's Organic Milk Chocolate with Butterscotch Eco Egg (150g, £7.99)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between reviews of this egg was how many times the judges put the word "very" before the word "sweet". "Makes my teeth ache," said one; "white chocolate masquerading as milk," said another. "Too thin a shell, and the butterscotch is just overkill." &lt;strong&gt;3/10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/chocolate"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/easter"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/katecarter"&gt;Kate Carter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

She was 48. Her death prompted a nationwide police investigation after dozens of former pupils from Chetham's and other music schools and conservatoires came forward to accuse other music teachers of sexually abusing them or their peers as children or young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many told the Guardian they had suffered the effects of the abuse for decades and finally plucked up the courage to go to the police after hearing of Andrade's suicide. "I do not want Frances to have died in vain," one alleged victim told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Brewers' convictions last month, one of Andrade's sons, Oliver, said of his mother: "One of her hopes was that the bravery she exhibited, and the other stories she knew would come out during the trial, would mean that other students who had also suffered abuse at Chetham's would be able to receive justice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allegations have since been made against at least 10 current or former teachers from Chetham's, as well as tutors from the Royal Northern College of Music (RNCM), Guildhall and the Royal Academy of Music in London, Wells Cathedral school in Somerset and the Purcell school in Hertfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far one other teacher as been arrested as part of the inquiry. In February Wen Zhou Li, 57, a world renowned violin tutor who has worked at Chetham's and the RNCM since at least 1996, was arrested on suspicion of rape. He denies the charges and is currently on police bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also under investigation is Malcolm Layfield, who until recently was head of strings at the RNCM. He was forced to step down last month after admitting his position had become "untenable". During the Brewer trial Andrade had talked of Layfield's penchant for sleeping with his young charges while teaching at Chetham's in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three women subsequently told the Guardian as well as the police that Layfield had initiated sexual activity with them when they were as young as 16, which damaged their mental and physical wellbeing. In 2003 it became a criminal offence for teachers to have sex with pupils aged 16 or 17. This was not the case when Layfield taught at Chetham's. He insists now that he regrets his behaviour but that he only slept with pupils who were over the age of consent, and that all relations were consensual at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrade, a mother of four, was abused by Michael Brewer when she was a vulnerable teenager at the Chetham's in the early 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the witness box Andrade explained how "Mike", as the teacher liked to be known by students, systematically groomed her, telling her she was "bewitching" and "beautiful". Brewer listened to her, she said, and she would often go to see him for chats in his office, which was on the ground floor of the music block and contained a grand piano and a settee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was just 14 when he initiated sexual activity. It started with hugs, said Andrade. But soon Brewer went further, she said. "Very quickly Mike would tell me that I bewitched him. That he found me irresistible, that he found me wise and wonderful, hugely talented and that these feelings could not be wrong because they felt so right," she said. She liked it, she admitted. She said: "I felt cared for and nurtured."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was 14 when he started touching her in his office. She would usually be in her school uniform, she said, and he would get her to strip naked while she gave him oral sex. He always kept his clothes on, she told the jury, just unzipping his flies. She was happy with it at the time, she said. "I did not feel at the time I was a victim," she said. "It was a relationship that developed in a completely normal way. We would kiss, he would touch me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrade also told of how Brewer would get her to perform oral sex with him in his camper van as he drove around Manchester city centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, was found guilty of indecently assaulting Andrade at the Brewer's family home in Chorlton, south Manchester. Andrade was 18 at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenpidd"&gt;Helen Pidd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

An &lt;a href="http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Angler-fights-life-swept-rocks-west-Cornwall/story-18521232-detail/story.html#axzz2OdchdEfo" title=""&gt;angler had been swept off the rocks&lt;/a&gt; at Trewarvas Point near Helston in Cornwall and, without help, would have been dead within minutes in the surging sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescue &lt;a href="http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Air-Stations/RNAS-Culdrose" title=""&gt;193 helicopter launched from the naval air station&lt;/a&gt; at Culdrose and took seconds to spot the man, winch him up and whisk him to the Royal Cornwall hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was typical," said Helston councillor Judith Haycock. "That man would not have had a chance if he had been in the sea for any longer at this time of year. We're proud of the navy's search and rescue service here. Would that man have survived if the helicopter had been based further away? It's a dangerous coast along there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sight of the red and grey navy Sea Kings clattering out of RNAS Culdrose in Helston is beloved of local people and holidaymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was concern and sadness in the town as the government announced not only the name of the private company that will take over search and rescue (SAR) from the navy and the RAF, but also that the Cornish operation will be moved to Newquay airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew George, the West Cornwall MP, said he was "very disappointed". He expressed concern that the UK's often wild western approaches would not be as accessible to the new privatised operation and was unhappy that there would be no military influence on the new service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly there was no word from the most famous SAR pilot, Prince William, who is based at &lt;a href="http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafvalley/" title=""&gt;RAF Valley&lt;/a&gt; on Anglesey in north Wales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MP for the island, Albert Owen, however, was angry both that there would no longer be military involvement and because the new service would fly not from Valley but from the civilian airport at Caernarfon on the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen claimed the move was "purely down to cost" and said it meant that state-of-the-art facilities at Valley would no longer be used for SAR operations. "It's like moving Manchester United from Old Trafford to Accrington Stanley," he said. "All that infrastructure, personnel, capability is being lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as at Culdrose, it meant that a hugely respected military service that local people had great pride in would be lost. "This is a privatisation too far. It is a bad day for search and rescue," said Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the south coast there was anger that the base at Portland in Dorset, currently a civilian service run by the coastguard, was being axed under the plans. Ian Mew, the clinical director for major trauma at Dorset county hospital, said: "It's a great shame. I do feel that lives will be lost because of this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger Macpherson, a spokesman for the Save Our Helicopter campaign group in Portland, said he was upset a base was being lost that served one of the busiest shipping lanes and leisure sailing areas in the world. "They just didn't listen to our concerns," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Drax, the MP for South Dorset and a former army officer, said: "I simply can't understand the thinking behind the closure of Portland." And though he accepted Bristow has an "extremely good reputation" it was a shame that military expertise would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key element of the new service is bound to be how it works with organisations including the RNLI and mountain rescue teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Margeson, vice chairman of Mountain Rescue England and Wales and a team leader at Duddon and Furness in the Lake District, said it was "a little cautious and apprehensive" that the new service would be as good as the largely military one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Scotland SAR operations at RAF Lossiemouth will cease and instead the new service will operate out of Inverness airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Hart, chairman of the Mountain Rescue Council of Scotland, the umbrella body for the country's 27 volunteer, dog, police and RAF rescue teams, said the appointment of Bristow was "very welcome", arguing the new helicopters would be more agile, faster and more capable than the MoD's fleet of ageing Sea Kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sea Kings, the new helicopters would be able to fly higher, taking them over mountain ranges, because they had modern de-icing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siting one of the Bristow bases at Inverness airport would also be far better for many mountain rescue teams in the north and Highlands, he said. "Introducing new, modern airframes is good news for everybody, whether your mountaineering or whether you're involved in a road traffic collision," Hart added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can get you to hospital faster, they can fly over mountains rather than round them because of the de-icing equipment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual mountain rescue teams remain very nervous about how Bristow's service will respond to very difficult weather conditions, or complicated and lengthy rescues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staff fear the privatised service will mean the company will be much more reluctant than RAF and Royal Navy aircrews to agree to particularly costly or risky rescues because of the threat to their profits: military aircrew are trained and keen to undertake dangerous missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Willie Anderson, chairman of Cairngorms mountain rescue team, one of the UK's busiest, said it was unclear how many casualties and rescuers the new helicopters could carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Scottish National party was angry at the move. The Westminster SNP leader and defence spokesman, Angus Robertson, MP said: "The privatisation of military helicopter search and rescue services is misguided. It will end the role of military aircrew from these life-saving flights, which is a bad move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevenmorris"&gt;Steven Morris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/severincarrell"&gt;Severin Carrell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But in spite of modern protective measures including plastic jackets to warm young lambs, rescue has often come too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/mar/26/army-helicopters-northern-ireland-animals" title=""&gt;Northern Ireland helicopters have been deployed to carry out food drops to animals in isolated rural areas&lt;/a&gt; cut off by the snow. At the height of the extreme weather, up to 140,000 homes and businesses were without power as heavy snow and ice brought down power cables in counties Down and Antrim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With power restored to most households and businesses, the focus has switched to the plight of thousands of livestock cut off in snowbound mountainous areas without food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinn Féin's agriculture minister, Michelle O'Neill, said: "It is a severe situation. People have said that this is worse than 1963. Some of the scenes are harrowing – to see farmers bring in sheep that have died in the snow. People are angry and concerned. We have an animal welfare issue. Farmers need a food drop. We have a surveillance helicopter so that we can see where the livestock are and then we have an MoD helicopter which is prepared to make a food drop."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blow to agriculture and the economy has been worsened by the scale of power failures which saw more than 3,000 people cut off for a fifth day in parts of Argyll and the island of Arran. For the first time in Scottish and Southern Energy's history two large metal pylons were toppled by snow and ice. The last to fall was in 1987 in the far north of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drifts are still blocking roads in hilly areas with continuing fierce cold and occasional snow flurries doing nothing to ease the situation. The &lt;a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/weather/cold-weather-alert/" title=""&gt;Met Office&lt;/a&gt; issued further yellow "be aware" alerts for ice in Scotland and north-east England and snow in the north-east, Yorkshire and the east Midlands and said that severe cold weather and icy conditions would last at least until Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bitterly cold easterly winds will persist this week, bringing snow showers to north-east England and light snow flurries across other areas of England," it forecasted. "With lying snow and partial snow melt during the daytimes, icy conditions are likely during the nights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social service departments in affected areas are stretched to reach isolated homes to check that all is well and the Age Sector Platform called for an emergency winter fuel payment to pensioners as the chill persists. The prevailing easterly winds are forecast to keep temperatures exceedingly cold until late April, except in the south-west where their clash with milder Atlantic fronts promises weeks of rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Mott, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said drier conditions were likely for most of the country in the runup to Easter but a slow thaw at the end of the week would be able to make little progress. He said: "We should see temperatures creeping up to 4C or 5C (39F or 41F) during the days by about Friday but there is still going to be a very sharp frost during the night. For the foreseeable future it is going to stay cold, and the snow on the ground is likely to last for some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transport problems also persist with the AA attending 16,000 callouts on Monday, 6,000 more than the seasonal average. Rail services have been better on Tuesday but drifting snow has blocked trains in the Midlands between Rugeley Trent Valley and Hednesford and signalling problems have disrupted services in East Anglia between Thetford and Norwich and in Kent between Queenborough and Swale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm Roberts, a farmer in Oswestry, Shropshire, had been expecting 600 lambs before the end of the month but is now having to pile up small victims of the snow while rescuing his 200 ewes. He said: "Every day since the snow hit, and surely for days to come, I'm having to go and pick up lamb corpses from ewes who have given birth outdoors. Newborns can only survive for around half an hour in the freezing temperatures – and the snow is so thick that some are even buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to get through it, what else can you do? But there's no doubt the financial impact will be absolutely devastating. This is my living and if you're not successful raising lambs you can't survive – that's the bottom line. We spend more trying to feed the animals, more on fuel, more to run the farm but as livestock die you end up having less produce to sell and are hit hard."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farm does not have enough room for indoor lambing, a problem widely shared by small sheep breeders. Vegetable crops have also been affected. Tim Gilbert, who grows fruit and vegetables on the edge of Hereford, said: "After last year's horrendous rain-filled summer we had been hoping that 2013 would be much better. It's always disastrous when it snows. We've had to stop completely for at least a fortnight. The effect not only hits us but also impacts on our customers who rely on us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: "Severe weather warnings are still in place and the majority of farmers are out there, battling freezing temperatures, to protect their livelihoods, families and income. It's relentless."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power blackout in Scotland has been described as the worst for 30 years with 400 engineers working to repair lines. A spokesman for Scottish and Southern Energy said: "Scottish Hydro Power Distribution engineers are continuing their intense and brave efforts to restore power to homes in Argyll and Arran following unprecedented weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instances of significant damage to the electricity network infrastructure have been among the worst seen for 30 years, with the weight of line icing pressurising the transmission lines around Crossaig where transmission towers were felled by the conditions.

The company has set up eight field kitchens in Argyll and Arran and delivered 18 large generators and 50 smaller ones to supplement existing resources such as the generator at Arran War Memorial which is keeping power going.

Firm proposals are expected in a green paper within two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other proposals being considered are a minimum learning period before candidates are permitted to sit their test, increasing the probationary period from two to three years for new drivers' licences to be revoked if they receive six or more penalty points, making the driving test more rigorous, and incentives for young drivers to take up additional training after passing their test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport secretary, &lt;a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/people/patrick-mcloughlin" title=""&gt;Patrick McLoughlin&lt;/a&gt;, said: "It is alarming that a fifth of people killed or seriously injured on our roads in 2011 were involved in a collision where at least one driver was aged 17 – 24. "Improving the safety of our young drivers is therefore a real priority and will not only reduce casualties but should also mean a reduction in the sky-high insurance premiums they pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been clear that I want to see insurance premiums reflecting conditions, performance and risks on the road. We have already done much as a government to address the concerns around motor insurance but more still needs to be done before young drivers feel satisfied they are getting value for money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.abi.org.uk/" title=""&gt;Association of British Insurers (ABI)&lt;/a&gt; has called for a one-year minimum learning period for young drivers, curbs on the number of young passengers and restrictions on night-time travel for young motorists for a period after passing their test, although with exemptions for those driving to and from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also says there should be a zero blood-alcohol driving limit for an initial period after a young person passes their driving test. The ABI suggests such measures could lead to a 15-20% fall in premiums for young drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-safety"&gt;Road safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport"&gt;Road transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/car-insurance"&gt;Car insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/insurance"&gt;Insurance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/motoring"&gt;Motoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople"&gt;Young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Asked whether Cyprus's banks will reopen on Thursday, Cyprus's finance minister Michalis Sarris said: "Yes, I think they will."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on Radio 4's Today Programme, Sarris said capital controls will be imposed on Cyprus "for several weeks", restricting the flow of money around the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The freezing of the Cypriot banking system follows an international rescue deal that involves restructuring the country's two largest lenders, with heavy losses for wealthy savers. President Nicos Anastasiades acknowledged on Monday that the country had come "a breath away from economic collapse" before its last-minute bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This involved an agreement to radically restructure the country's largest lender, the Bank of Cyprus, and shut down its second largest bank, Laiki, in return for a €10bn bailout from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the IMF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a radical departure for a eurozone bailout, depositors in Laiki Bank could lose any savings above €100,000. Bigger savers in Bank of Cyprus will also be forced to contribute to the lender's recapitalisation. Sarris suggested on Monday they could face losses of around 40% on their assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an initial rally on relief that Cyprus had secured a deal, markets took fright when the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers indicated that the rescue could be a template for similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro dropped 1% against the dollar on Monday and remained below $1.29 in early trade on Tuesday. Shares across the eurozone regained some of their losses. The FTSE 100 was up 0.1% and the German DAX was 0.3% higher, but Spain's IBEX was 0.4% lower in early trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who heads up the euro group, said the relative market calm in recent months, coupled with the lack of market panic following the decision to force private investors and depositors to pay for the bailout of two large Cypriot banks, allowed the eurozone to go after private money more aggressively when banks failed. He later attempted to water down these remarks, indicating that Cyprus was a unique case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is designed to shrink the Cypriot banking sector, which had grown to eight times the country's €17bn economy. Finance minister Sarris said to Bloomberg on Monday: "We acknowledge that we allowed things in Cyprus to get out of hand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said Cyprus was disappointed by the reaction of some of its eurozone partners, when faced with the potential meltdown of its economy. "This is the European Union. It is supposed to be a community, where you get support from your partners. We got some from some partners; there was a definite hardline from others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere in the negotiating room on Sunday night was, he said, "very, very tense". He added: "We felt under tremendous pressure. When you know that the alternative to reaching a solution would be that your economy is destroyed, that it turns into ruins, you clearly are at a definite disadvantage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cypriots had reacted to the agreement with relief as it appeared that at least deposits below €100,000 had been spared the levy. In the streets and cafes of Nicosia, and on TV chat shows, the feeling was that the country had been saved but at a high price. On Tuesday, schoolchildren spilled onto the streets to protest against the bailout deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were warnings the impact could reach beyond Cyprus, particularly with repercussions from Russia, where the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, speaking on Monday, said: "They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen." This was a phrase Lenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era expropriation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For sure there is anger," said Marios Cosma, head of K Treppides, a firm that serves international clients, mainly rich Russians. "For the first time in Europe, you have a situation where depositors are being called to 'bail in'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Cyprus banking sector has exploded, other countries have even larger banking sectors relative to GDP. Malta's banking sector is relatively larger, and Luxembourg's is more than 20 times its GDP. Malta's finance minister wrote an article in the Malta Times expressing concern about what would happen if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cyprus there were calls for a referendum on the bailout package. "It is illegal and undemocratic," said Christos Tombazos, general secretary of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour. "We're talking about massive changes to the banking system. It should go to referendum for the Cypriot people to decide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials tried to assuage fears over its nationals' investments in Cyprus. Russian Commercial Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned bank VTB, would "not be affected or its losses will be insignificant", said Igor Shuvalov, a deputy prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Cyprus is 9.7% owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian based in Monaco whose wealth is estimated at $9.1bn, according to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, played down the amount he stood to lose in Cyprus as no more than $10,000. "It's not worth talking about," he said. "Cyprus was always a transit jurisdiction – money would pass through and then go to Lithuania, Latvia, Belize, Switzerland, everywhere. There are plenty of ways [to avoid capital controls], they can split accounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multimillionaire owner of the Evening Standard and Independent expressed doubts that capital controls to be imposed by the Cypriot government in order to stem a bank run would work. "Certain schemes can be put into place," Lebedev said by telephone from Moscow. "This is how Cyprus was making money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/savings"&gt;Savings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil"&gt;Market turmoil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/dowjones"&gt;Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/ftse"&gt;FTSE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/luxembourg"&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/malta"&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephine-moulds"&gt;Josephine Moulds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith"&gt;Helena Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor"&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He has previously admitted that he knew the presenter had once spent a night in a hotel with a girl who was probably 10 at the time, and claimed he had warned Savile that he was living dangerously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about this by Today host John Humphrys, De'ath said Savile had just "brushed me off" . Though he was shocked and appalled by Savile's behaviour, he said, "I have to be honest and say I wouldn't have dreamed of going and grassing him up".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De'ath said: "I was actually physically frightened of Savile. He was a very intimidating physical presence. He had been a boxer and a wrestler … and he was in with some very, very rough people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he did "slightly regret" not reporting the presenter to authorities, "it was common talk in the corridors of Broadcasting House that Savile liked young girls".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De'ath, who claimed to be "full of self-loathing" that he did not do more over Savile, said society had changed in the past 50 years. "We were all womanisers. I was a womaniser … As far as I know, womanising is not a criminal offence. I never went underage. No girl that I ever slept with was underage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You proposition maybe a hundred women on the chance that maybe two or three would say yes. Now that may be regarded as a shocking statement. That was what it was like in the 50s and 60s, when I was – whatever the word is – a young blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/jimmy-savile"&gt;Jimmy Savile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/social-care"&gt;Social care&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He also rejected publishing an interim report since it was likely to be misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no clear trend in the proportion of the caseload which receives sanctions, pointing out that prior to 2007, the rate was running at around 4% and since then it has fluctuated between 3% – 5%. "There is not the clear trend in the growth of sanctions which some people have been claiming," Freud told peers in a debate on the emergency jobseekers bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also denied that the government or the DWP managers set staff targets for the rate at which claimants are sanctioned in particular offices. In a carefully worded response, he said "we have internal management information. It is vital that we keep it, and we publish a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to understand why some areas, some jobcentres, have higher rates than others and why some have lower rates. Some may have very good reasons for having lower or higher rates, while others may not. We therefore need this information to correct the anomalies, and that is normal business practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on: "It may be that in particular cases a jobcentre manager is told" 'You are running very high or very low figures, and you cannot justify the reason for that, so you need to get more into line'. It may happen. I have not got the particular details." He denied it was policy to threaten managers that were not meeting targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freud easily fought off a Labour attempt to include a reference to the use of targets by jobcentre managers in the terms of reference of the proposed inquiry into sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lord McKenzie the Labour employment spokesman, said: "Recent revelations about targets and league tables are deeply worrying and reinforce concerns that the sanctions regime is being used to control benefit expenditure rather than for its proper purpose of supporting conditionality and changing behaviour. Ministerial denials will cut no ice until these matters have been fully and speedily investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "We should be appalled if the reports of the suggested behaviour are true, as it demonstrates not only that a climate of fear is being created within jobcentres but that staff are being actively encouraged to refer customers for sanction, especially to fine customers that they can claim are not fully available for work if they make mention of looking after a grandparent or having informal arrangements sharing custody of children. Jobcentre Plus is supposed to support vulnerable people not try to trip them up on technicalities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/unemployment-and-employment-statistics"&gt;Unemployment and employment statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/lords"&gt;House of Lords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/job-hunting"&gt;Job hunting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A key part of that strategy will be identifying those trees which have a natural resistance to the disease so that we can restock our woodlands in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In England, grants will be made available in a bid to stop the spread of the disease from the east of the country to the west. The amount the government will spend on replacing young trees will depend on demand, said a spokeswoman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landowners will be paid to remove recently planted ash from high priority areas – a band running from Cornwall and Devon and then north through Gloucester and up to the Midlands – and replace the trees with other species. The &lt;a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara" title=""&gt;latest official map of the disease's spread&lt;/a&gt; shows it has now reached 427 sites across the UK, up from &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/23/ash-dieback-infected-nurseries-map" title=""&gt;309 just before Christmas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the relief of some ecologists, the plan also suggests mature trees should not be felled in a bid to slow the disease's spread. An import ban, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/26/ash-dieback-imports-banned" title=""&gt;introduced last October&lt;/a&gt; to stop the disease – which is believed to have potentially arrived via imports of European-grown ash saplings – will stay in place, Defra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Pryor, director of natural environment at the National Trust, said: "It is too late to eradicate this disease, but this plan could buy us time. If we – government, landowners and foresters – can all work together to reduce the rate at which it spreads across the country we can find ways to ease its impact on our landscapes and wildlife. But we must use this time energetically, to explore every possible way in which we can increase the resilience of our trees and woods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Woodland Trust welcomed the grants and the suggestion that mature trees should not be felled. Sue Holden, Woodland Trust chief executive, said: "We will be providing land on two of our sites as part of the long-term study Defra has announced today into finding resistant strains of ash. We are also working alongside a number of partners as part of our own plan and commitment to determine a joint and practical way forward for our native woods and trees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, the government said it would identify and grow resistant populations of ash, by planting 250,000 trees at up to 25 sites, mostly in East Anglia. In Denmark, the disease has already been detected in more than 90% of the country's ash trees, many of which will die as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the plan broadly rejected the use of treatments or cures as a silver bullet for stopping the disease. "We are advised against expecting to find a treatment which can be widely applied to protect woodland or treat an infected wood or forest. Treatments may have a role, though, in protecting individual trees or groups of trees, or reducing production of spores, level of damage and rate of spread in some circumstances," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harriet Tupper, who chairs the International Dendrology Society, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/9948411/Government-ash-dieback-management-plan-criticised-for-failing-to-stop-disease.html" title=""&gt;has written to Paterson criticising the lack of a search by government scientists for a treatment&lt;/a&gt;: "It is pessimistic not to try to find a cure/antidote. Over the centuries, scientists have discovered cures for many diseases, of humans, animals and plants. There is no reason why this cannot also happen for &lt;em&gt;Chalara fraxinea&lt;/em&gt;. No antidote was found in Poland or Denmark, but of the trees in those countries, ash represented only a tiny fraction unlike the situation in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's plan is an updated version of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/dec/06/ash-dieback-infection-sites-double" title=""&gt;an interim "control" plan published in December&lt;/a&gt;, which was prompted in part by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia" title=""&gt;the discovery of the disease in the wild in Norfolk and elsewhere in the country last October&lt;/a&gt;. The disease's spread will become clearer when summer arrives and leaves grow back – infected trees can be identified by diamond-shaped lesions on stems and crowns to "die back", with the fungus causing infections between June and October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New ash control plans will be published annually in the future, Defra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ash-dieback"&gt;Ash dieback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/"&gt;Conservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/forests"&gt;Trees and forests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-vaughan"&gt;Adam Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Its decision was not based on the presumed guilt or innocence of Knox or Sollecito, but was intended to hinge solely on whether or not the appellate trial had been properly conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial, which will be held at Florence's court of appeal, will be a repeat of the appeal trial held in Perugia in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move came after prosecutors had argued that the court that acquitted Knox, 25, and Sollecito, who turns 29 on Tuesday, had "lost its bearings" in the case and had erred in numerous ways, including insufficient forensic evidence tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court had heard six hours of arguments from both prosecutors arguing for the case to be reopened and their defence lawyers insisting the pair had been rightly cleared two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Knox nor Sollecito was in court to watch the proceedings. The Kercher family did not attend, but Sollecito's father, Francesco, was present on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of the ruling, Knox issued a statement condemning the arguments on which it appeared to be based as "unfounded and unfair".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was painful to receive the news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for revision when the prosecution's theory of my involvement in Meredith's murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and unfair," Knox added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution. The prosecution responsible for the many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for Raffaele's sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hearts go out to them. No matter what happens, my family and I will face this continuing legal battle as we always have, confident in the truth and with our heads held high in the face of wrongful accusations and unreasonable adversity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franceso Maresca, the Kercher family lawyer, said he had spoken to Stephanie Kercher, Meredith's older sister, who he said was "very happy and satisfied" with the ruling. The family would continue to try to "get to the bottom" of the case, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the panel of five judges paves the way for future friction between Italy and US over Knox's fate. Since returning to her home city of Seattle in autumn 2011, she has enrolled at the University of Washington, found a new boyfriend and written her memoirs, clinched in a deal reportedly worth $4m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she will not have to be present for the Florence retrial, her lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said Italy could request her extradition if she were convicted a second time. It would then be up to the US to decide whether to agree to the move, something some observers say is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giulia Bongiorno, defence lawyer for Sollecito, told Italian television channel Sky TG24: "As today is his birthday I would have liked to tell him that this affair was over … and to give him this joy. Quashing an acquittal does not imply a belief that the accused are guilty but indicates a desire by the judges of the court of cassation to request further analysis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kercher, a University of Leeds student on a year abroad in the historic town of Perugia, was found dead in a pool of blood in her bedroom on 2 November 2007, partially clothed and with her throat slashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2008, Rudy Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher, and is serving a reduced sentence of 16 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2009, after a separate trial, Knox and Sollecito were also convicted of the killing and were sentenced to 26 and 25 years in jail respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four years in prison, the pair were acquitted in a dramatic ruling in October 2011. The court found that DNA evidence used to convict them had been unreliable. Four months later, prosecutors lodged an appeal in which they claimed the verdict contained numerous omissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/amanda-knox"&gt;Amanda Knox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/meredithkercher"&gt;Meredith Kercher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/raffaele-sollecito"&gt;Raffaele Sollecito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lizzydavies"&gt;Lizzy Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Revenues at the Bertelsmann-owned company, which is awaiting final clearance on a merger with Pearson's Penguin, grew 22.5% year-on-year to €2.1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James' Fifty Shades of Grey and sequels Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed became the book publishing phenomenon of 2012, shifting more than 70m copies between March and December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 50% of revenues from the trilogy were from ebooks, compared to Random House's global average of about 20% from digital sales. Fifty Shades accounted for almost one in 10 of the 750m books Random House sold globally in print or online across the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The runaway success of Fifty Shades helped Bertelsmann maintain overall group profit levels, despite tough advertising conditions for its TV, magazine and music publishing businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2012 our profits and sales hit an absolute record level, a historic all-time high," said the Random House chairman and chief executive, Markus Dole. "Our success has shown again one thing very clearly, that the core of our business in the 21st century, in a digital age, remains the same. It is so important to continually invest in content and creativity and to market that well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bertelsmann chief executive, Thomas Rabe, also hailed the success of Fifty Shades, adding that Random House had 33 books top the New York Times 2012 bestseller list, including John Grisham's The Racketeer and Rod Stewart's autobiography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly Fifty Shades was the main driver but it was not the only one," Rabe said, speaking in Berlin on Tuesday morning as the company unveiled its 2012 results. "In the middle of May we have Dan Brown's Inferno coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall Bertelsmann nudged group profit up slightly to €619m in 2012, as total group revenues rose 4.5% year on year to €16.1bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe said he expected revenues to hit €17bn this year and €18bn in 2014, as the benefits of moves such as the merger with Penguin fuel Bertelsmann's bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior executives are quietly confident of gaining European competition regulator approval for the Random House/Penguin deal from Brussels in the next month. Clearance is also yet to be given in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bertelsmann is back on a growth trajectory after years of declines and portfolio adjustments," Rabe said. "We will maintain this accelerated pace, particularly in the expansion of our growth platforms, such as television production, financial services, rights management and education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertelsmann is also the majority shareholder in pan-European broadcaster RTL, the parent company of London-based The X Factor co-producer FremantleMedia, and owns music publisher BMG and magazine business Gruner + Jahr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe is seeking to raise funds for acquisitions through the sale of a 17% stake in RTL starting next month. He said Bertelsmann could go on a buying spree, spending as much as €3bn over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not looking at the big acquisitions of several billion euros, that is not in the strategic profile of Bertelsmann," he said. "We are looking at medium-sized platforms of €500m to €700m, and we are looking at options out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe identified areas including TV production and BMG, of which Bertelsmann took full control from partner KKR earlier this month, as two divisions that will have money for acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RTL had a mixed year with revenues up 3.2% to €6bn, thanks primarily to its flagship German business. Operating profits, however, were down 5% to €1.1bn. RTL, which owned UK broadcaster Channel 5 before selling it to Richard Desmond in 2010, saw declining TV ad revenues in almost all its other European markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertelsmann remains heavily dependent on its TV division. It accounted for 63% of the parent company's roughly flat total operating profits of €1.74bn last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FremantleMedia, which makes shows including The Price is Right and The Apprentice, fuelled the revenue boost, particularly with the performance of American Idol in the US. Operating profit at Fremantle "declined slightly" last year, according to Bertelsmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RTL notched up more than 2.4bn online video views with 300m on mobile devices in 2012. There were about 4.5bn views of FremantleMedia content, such as The X Factor clips, on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gruner + Jahr continued to struggle with revenues down 3% year on year to €2.2bn and operating profit down almost 28% to €168m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate investments division, which includes BMG, reported revenues of €471m, down from €507m in 2011, with an operating loss of €38m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertelsmann derives around 80% of its revenues from the European region, and Rabe said he was targeting other growth regions such as China, India and Brazil. RTL recently launched a TV channel in India, its first outside Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertelsmann's net debt fell by almost a third €1.2bn. The company took a €405m charge relating to its declining magazine business and its other media operations in the ailing markets of southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company employees 104,000 staff, with just over 20% outside Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

But he won't be moving to the company's California headquarters just yet … because he wants to finish his A-levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick D'Aloisio, from Wimbledon, south London, created the app, called &lt;a href="http://summly.com/" title=""&gt;Summly&lt;/a&gt; – which provides bite-sized summaries of content from news and other sites – a little over a year ago from his bedroom and now joins an elite group of teenagers who have become internet millionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Aloisio, who is still too young to be a director of his own firm, said he had begun tinkering with apps for mobile devices as a hobby and had not expected to profit from it. The money from the sale of the business will go into a trust fund, although he said he does intend to get a new computer, as well as some new trainers. "I'll be staying in London," said D'Aloisio. "I want to finish my A-levels, and I couldn't really live on my own out there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His mother, Diana D'Aloisio, appeared to still be somewhat in shock. "I knew he was a little out of the box, but I didn't expect it to happen all of a sudden like this," she said. "From a young age he displayed abilities in technologies I frankly didn't understand. He was doing 3D programming, and we bought him a book called C Programming For Dummies. My husband and I just used our computers for work, he was doing totally different stuff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price tag is understood to be £18m, 90% in cash and 10% in Yahoo shares, though other reports suggested the total could be up to £40m. Neither D'Aloisio nor Yahoo would confirm the details of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Aloisio began using computers at the age of nine, making films, and then moved to programming at the age of 12 when Apple opened its App Store for the iPhone. The teenager's success comes less than five years after he released his first app, called Fingermill, an onscreen virtual treadmill for fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summly, launched in November 2012, won one of Apple's best apps of 2012 awards. The app produces summarised versions of news stories, with the number of words tailored to fit into a single smartphone screen; so far 90m summaries have been read, the company says. But it will not be available much longer – as part of the acquisition, the app will be shut down and integrated into Yahoo's business as it tries to remould itself for the fast-growing mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Aloisio, whose father is a commodities trader and mother a lawyer and director of the company, is taking maths and philosophy A-levels at King's College school, and trying to decide whether the third one should be physics or history. "He still wants to go to Oxford University," his mother said. "He's just a normal kid really. When he's at home, he tidies his room. He's quite neat — very organised, in fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the takeover is finalised, he will work in Yahoo's Soho offices by day, where he will be the company's youngest employee, and continue studying for his A-levels in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Aloisio got the idea for the app in 2011 when revising for his exams and finding himself frustrated with web pages that broadly repeated the same content. He produced an early version of Summly, called Trimit, which was downloaded more than 200,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publicity from the Apple award attracted the attention of Hong Kong investor Li Ka-shing and his venture capital firm, Horizon Ventures. External investors – others are said to include actors Stephen Fry and Ashton Kutcher and artist Yoko Ono – bought a third of the company's share capital, according to documents filed at Companies House last October. The rest is owned by D'Aloisio's mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was those investors who brought in a savvy team of directors, engineers, business managers and PR professionals who have been working to turn Summly into a potential world-beater, including older staff such as the chief technology officer, Eugene Ciurana, who boasts 20 years' experience in the technology business, and the head of R&amp;D, Inderjeet Mani. Both of them will be moving to Sunnyvale, close to San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is one of the oldest names on the web but has struggled to keep pace with more nimble rivals. Chief executive Marissa Mayer is trying to refocus the business around mobile technology. Sites such as Facebook and Twitter are now more used on smartphones than on the desktop and she has made a string of small acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D'Aloisio told the Guardian that it had not been the price that had determined who he would sell to after months of negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was spending time on the campus. Marissa Mayer wants to reinvent the company, and they have a big opportunity. They have a really strong focus on mobile and taking daily habits and reinventing them for a mobile device. I can't wait to work on that level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other web youth sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Tew &lt;/strong&gt;In 2005 Tew, 21, from Swindon, was looking for a way to pay his student loan from the University of Nottingham. He came up with the &lt;a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com" title=""&gt;Million Dollar Home Page&lt;/a&gt;: sell a million pixels at a dollar (or so) each. Advertisers bought on the guarantee that the site would stay up for at least five years. Hundreds of others tried (and failed) the same idea in his wake. It's still going today. Tew, meanwhile, has moved to San Francisco where he is head of calm.com, which offers online relaxation sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Hadfield&lt;/strong&gt; In 1994 Hadfield, 12, and his father Greg created Soccernet – a sports internet company – at a time when most people in the UK hadn't even heard of the internet, and fewer still were online. Five years later they sold a 60% stake to Disney's ESPN for £15m. They then set up Schoolsnet, an education website, which they still control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian Owens&lt;/strong&gt; In 2008, aged 14, Owens, from Corby, began Mac Bundle Box, selling discounted bundles of software for Apple computers; he said it took £700,000 in revenue. By 2010 he had set up an internet advertising network called Branchr and was claiming to be an internet millionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; In 2004, aged 19 and studying at Harvard University, Zuckerberg created "Facemash to let users vote on which of two students was the more attractive. He then developed TheFacebook.com, aimed only at US colleges; new colleges were only added once a certain level of demand was reached. That became Facebook, which opened to the wider world, went public in 2012 and is worth about $14bn (£9.2bn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Fanning&lt;/strong&gt; In 1999 Fanning, 18, released a public version of a program called Napster, which helped people share music between computers. Use exploded at Northeastern University, in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was studying, and soon Napster the company was shaking up the music business, which responded with lawsuits.

The insurgents followed up the blast with small arms fire on the base in Nad Ali, one of the districts where UK troops have been based during their time in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five insurgents were killed in the attack on the base on Monday night, which is jointly operated by the Afghan army and troops from Nato's International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though no Isaf troops died in the attack, it is understood one British soldier was severely wounded and airlifted by helicopter to Camp Bastion, the main UK base in the province. Most of the others were "walking wounded". Members of the Afghan national security force were also among the injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack is the boldest the insurgents have undertaken during the winter months – no UK soldiers have been killed here since January, making it one of the quietest tours the British have experienced since troops were deployed here in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaf said: "We can confirm that last night in Nad Ali district, Helmand province, insurgents attacked a combined Afghan and Isaf patrol base with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device and small arms fire. A number of insurgents were killed. Several Isaf service members were wounded in the attack. There were no Isaf fatalities. The base is secured and fully operational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nad Ali was a Taliban hotbed when the UK first arrived, but has been regarded as one of the success stories in recent years, as British and Afghan forces have taken control of the populated areas, driving the insurgents into the desert hinterland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is of the districts in Helmand that has been "transitioned" to Afghan control as Isaf steps back from frontline duties, leaving security almost entirely in the hands of the Afghans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nickhopkins"&gt;Nick Hopkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Many are expected to apply to join the new service but there are &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/jan/31/search-rescue-helicopters-privatisation-fears" title=""&gt;concerns jobs could be lost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the government has argued that it needs to act because the famous and much-loved Sea King helicopter fleet is approaching the end of its useful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government argues that faster and more modern helicopters will be able to provide a better service than the current one. At the moment the RAF and navy operate eight bases around the UK while four are a civilian service run by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there will be anguish in some places famous for search and rescue, including RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall and RAF Valley in north Wales, where Prince William is based. The new service will be run from civilian sites nearby instead of from military bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: "Our search and rescue helicopter service plays a crucial role, saving lives and providing assistance to people in distress on both land and on sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With 24 years of experience providing search and rescue helicopter services in the UK, the public can have great confidence in Bristow and their ability to deliver a first class service with state of the art helicopters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the transport department, under the new contract, 22 "state-of-the-art helicopters will operate from 10 locations around the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department insisted the new service would be better than the current one. It said: "There will be an overall improvement in flying times to incidents of around 20% (from 23 to 19 minutes). Presently, approximately 70% of high and very high-risk areas within the UK search and rescue region are reachable by helicopter within 30 minutes. Under the new contract, approximately 85% of the same area would be reached within this timeframe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten Sikorsky S92s will be based, two per site, at Stornoway and Sumburgh in Scotland and at airports in Newquay, Cornwall, Caernarfon, north Wales, and Humberside. Ten AgustaWestland AW189s will operate, two per site, from Lee-on-the-Solent in Hampshire and out of a new hangar at Prestwick airport, Glasgow, while new bases for it will be established at airports at St Athan, south Wales, Inverness, in the Scottish Highlands, and Manston in Kent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department added: "Following 70 years of outstanding service from the RAF and RN search and rescue squadrons, military involvement in search and rescue in the UK is to cease, and with the Sea King helicopter nearing its 40th year of operations, the time has come to change the way the service is provided and the aircraft used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contracted search and rescue services have operated alongside the RAF and RN since 1983 with great success, and contracted search and rescue crews have won numerous awards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the contract would be managed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency in the same way as the existing contract that operates the coastguard helicopter bases on the south coast and on the Western and Shetland Isles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the new fleet will be built in Yeovil and the contract will have a significant impact on the UK supply chain, providing and sustaining jobs and apprenticeships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition for the contract has been keen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristow already &lt;a href="http://www.bristowgroup.com/helicopter-services/search-and-rescue/" title=""&gt;operates search-and-rescue operations in the UK and also in the Netherlands, Norway, Trinidad, Australia, Russia, Brazil and Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in Houston, it was the first civilian helicopter service to operate in the North Sea and remains one of the main service providers to the oil and gas industry, including search and rescue operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has flown more than 44,000 operational hours in the UK, conducted more than 15,000 missions during which more than 7,000 people have been rescued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Imlach, Bristow Helicopters Ltd's managing director, said: "We will be introducing new, hi-tech helicopters to the UK, equipped with the latest search and rescue technology, resulting in unprecedented levels and quality of SAR coverage across the country. The existing expertise and local SAR knowledge is immensely valuable and we will ensure that this is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the department for transport awarded Bristow Helicopters Ltd a &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/preview/phoenix.zhtml?c=91226&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1658397&amp;highlight=" title=""&gt;"gap" contract to provide search-and-rescue services with the British coastguard agency ahead of the start of the new wholly privatised service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a training arm it also &lt;a href="http://www.fbheliservices.com/content/about-us" title=""&gt;provides helicopter training to UK military pilots and crewmen&lt;/a&gt; before they move to operational squadrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/royal-air-force"&gt;Royal Air Force&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/royal-navy"&gt;Royal Navy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stevenmorris"&gt;Steven Morris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's like a child in a candy shop: if you haven't bought him a lolly and don't pay attention to his tantrums he tries to intimidate you with things – even if they are self-harming," said Leonid Petrov, an expert on North Korea at the Australian National University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"North Korea really doesn't have the capability to strike the US, though they could strike US interests in north-east Asia and South Korea. They can spur another round of the arms race, as they have already done successfully. I don't know who benefits from that, but it's obviously not the North, because they can't afford it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "It is more of a message to the domestic population. Despite all the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jan/01/kim-jong-un-calls-better-ties-south-korea" title=""&gt;promises of the last year about people leading a better life&lt;/a&gt;, the imperialists are about to attack so you have to forget that. The North is trying to seal the loyalty of the people, insulate the country and buy more time for the regime to survive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters at a daily briefing that it hopes all sides on the Korean peninsula can exercise restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported last week that &lt;a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/03/21/china-norkor-oil-idUKL3N0CD1L020130321" title=""&gt;China did not export any crude oil to the North in February&lt;/a&gt;, the first such instance of its kind for a year, and there have been &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/china-punishes-north-korea-us-asks-more-052151901.html" title=""&gt;reports of tightened restrictions on trade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the North's main ally and Pyongyang remains heavily dependent on trade and aid with its neighbour. But many analysts say it is too early to tell whether Beijing's approach has changed and stress there is no sign of a fundamental or long-term shift in policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think philosophically they don't really like sanctions and when I talk to the Chinese none of them seem to think sanctions will work," said John Delury, an expert on Chinese-North Korean relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that a clampdown on cross-border deals may be part of a more general desire to clean up trade, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added that ties between the two countries appeared weaker than they were towards the end of Kim Jong-il's rule, probably reflecting Pyongyang's concerns about the relationship as much as Beijing's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were getting into a red zone where all the economic ties and diplomatic ties were with China," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the military alert, Kim Jong-un has found time for civilian-focused duties as leader in recent days, according to the North's media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported that in addition to his visits to the army, he toured a new restaurant boat on Sunday, "feasting his eyes on the deck and handrails around it" and expressing concern that the view and air-conditioning should be satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In other words, she had a right to be offensive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading between the lines, I imagine the commission took the view that it was a matter of taste and therefore lay within the editor's prerogative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/jan/18/julie-burchill-and-the-observer"&gt;An internal Observer inquiry,&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the readers' editor, Stephen Pritchard, accepted that the column had broken the paper's own code, which states that it "should not casually use words that are likely to offend". He said that it was published due to "a collective failure of editing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days later, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/jan/17/transgender-protest-observer-offices-burchill"&gt;a peaceful protest about the publication&lt;/a&gt; was staged outside the offices of The Observer and The Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editors of both papers, along with other journalists (including me), have since been invited by a transgender group, &lt;a href="http://www.onroadmedia.org.uk/work/all-about-trans-the-interactions/"&gt;On Road&lt;/a&gt;, to meet young trans people in order to understand the problems they face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pcc"&gt;Press Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/transgender"&gt;Transgender&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/julie-burchill"&gt;Julie Burchill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/theobserver"&gt;The Observer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/theguardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/john-mulholland"&gt;John Mulholland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/roygreenslade"&gt;Roy Greenslade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Cyprus is the first of five bailouts in the eurozone where depositors have been hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we've done last night is what I call pushing back the risks," Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, told Reuters and the Financial Times after clinching an agreement for Cyprus. "If the bank can't do it, then we'll talk to the shareholders and the bondholders, we'll ask them to contribute in recapitalising the bank, and if necessary the uninsured deposit holders," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of Cyprus and Laiki, the two largest domestic banks, will remain shut until Thursday while the latter is split into a good and bad bank and a levy – of potentially 40% – is imposed on accounts of more than €100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big percentage of those deposits belong to Russians. On Monday the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said there would be a deal to rework the terms of a €2.5bn loan to the Mediterranean island, which had become attractive for its low tax regime and lax vetting laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades made a televised address in which he admitted that measures would be in place to stop money pouring out of the banks when they reopen. "The central bank will implement capital controls on transactions. I want to assure you that this will be a very temporary measure that will gradually be relaxed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markets were initially buoyed by news of the "painful" bailout for Cyprus, clinched late on Sunday night following threats by the European Central Bank to switch off liquidity to Cypriot banks, which, carried by international deposits, had grown to eight times the €17bn economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But markets reacted badly later in the day after Dijsselbloem's remarks. As markets tumbled, he issued a clarification insisting that bailout programmes were "tailor-made" and that "no models or templates are used".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, all markets erased their early gains to close down on the day. The FTSE 100 index lost 0.2% and the German stock market fell 0.5%. Bank shares fell across Europe while the euro, which had nudged up through $1.30 initially, fell back to below $1.29. US markets, which had largely shrugged off the Cypriot problem, were also lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 70 points, 0.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cypriots had reacted to the agreement with European leaders with relief as it appeared that at least deposits below €100,000 had been spared the levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the streets and cafes of Nicosia, and on TV chat shows aired in homes across the nation state, the feeling was that the country had been saved but at a high price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior minister Sokratis Hasiko encapsulated the mood, describing the EU-IMF-backed bailout as the best of a bad range of choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had got to the point where we were discussing a [depositor] haircut of between 50 and 60%," he said, adding that the Cypriot parliament's rejection of the first accord, with its highly controversial levy on depositors big and small, had been hugely negative for the country's banks. "So this is the best we could get."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were warnings the impact could reach beyond Cyprus, particularly with repercussions from Russia, where the prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said: "They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen." This was a phrase Lenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves. Russian officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era expropriation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For sure there is anger," said Marios Cosma, head of K Treppides, a firm that serves international clients, mainly rich Russians. "For the first time in Europe, you have a situation where depositors are being called to 'bail in'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cyprus' banking sector has exploded, other countries have even larger banking sectors relative to GDP. Malta's and Luxembourg's banking sectors are relatively larger, more than 20 times' GDP in the case of Luxembourg. Malta's finance minister wrote an article in the Malta Times expressing concern about what would happen if it encounters similar problems in the eurozone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cyprus there were calls for a referendum on the bailout package. "It is illegal and undemocratic," said Christos Tombazos, general secretary of the Pancyprian Federation of Labour. "We're talking about massive changes to the banking system. It should go to referendum for the Cypriot people to decide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials attempted to assuage fears over Russian investments on the Mediterranean island. Russian Commercial Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned bank VTB, would "not be affected or its losses will be insignificant", said Igor Shuvalov, a deputy prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Cyprus is 9.7% owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian based in Monaco whose wealth is estimated at $9.1bn according to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Russian oligarch, Alexander Lebedev, played down the amount he stood to lose in Cyprus as no more than $10,000. "It's not worth talking about," he said. "Cyprus was always a transit jurisdiction – money would pass through and then go to Lithuania, Latvia, Belize, Switzerland, everywhere. There are plenty of ways [to avoid capital controls], they can split accounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multimillionaire owner of the Evening Standard and Independent expressed doubts that capital controls to be imposed by the Cypriot government in order to stem a bank run would work. "Certain schemes can be put into place," Lebedev said by telephone from Moscow. "This is how Cyprus was making money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/stock-markets"&gt;Stock markets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/savings"&gt;Savings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-sector"&gt;Financial sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/emu"&gt;European monetary union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/euro"&gt;Euro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith"&gt;Helena Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iantraynor"&gt;Ian Traynor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But the bidding had to be scrapped after serious mistakes by Department for Transport civil servants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to two independent reviews - one on the west coast fiasco and the other on the whole franchise process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement is the direct result of the reviews and effectively sets the franchise process back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McLoughlin said: "This programme is a major step in delivering tangible improvements to services, providing long-term certainty to the market and supporting our huge programme of rail investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Above all, in future franchise competitions we are placing passengers in the driving seat by ensuring that their views and satisfaction levels are taken into account when deciding which companies run our railway services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Franchising has been a force for good in the story of Britain's railways, transforming an industry that was in decline into one that today carries record numbers of passengers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail unions reacted with dismay to the east coast news, pointing out that the private sector had twice given up the franchise, with GNER pulling out some years ago. They also highlighted the fact that the taxpayer is likely to have to foot a bill as high as £50m over the botched west coast franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association rail union, said: "The Tories are just like the Bourbons when it comes to rail – they ignore all the lessons of history. The £50m west coast line fiasco revealed that private franchises are a shambles. So they go and privatise the only successful publicly owned franchise, the east coast line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an act of political spite to reward their friends in the City and to tie the hands of an incoming Labour government in 2015. The most expensive rail network in Europe is about to get even more expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RMT general secretary, Bob Crow, said: "Despite wasting hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on the franchising circus, and instead of learning the lessons of the privatisation disasters on the east and west coast main lines and across the rest of the network, the government has this morning given the green light to a whole new wave of profiteering that will have the train companies laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proposed reprivatisation of the east coast, after the public sector rescued the service following two private failures, proves conclusively that the political class have learned absolutely nothing when it comes to our railways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a politically inspired wrecking move designed to flog off this publicly owned intercity route before the next election regardless of the consequences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "With this news coming just a day before the 50th anniversary of the Beeching Report that ripped Britain's railways to pieces, the ConDem administration is setting up yet another sell-off of state assets in a further act of grotesque rail vandalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The public need to know that, while fares are going up and safety is being compromised, the government's priority remains the profits of the greedy train operating companies. No wonder 70% of the people now support RMT's call for full renationalisation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/west-coast-mainline"&gt;West coast mainline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nationalexpressgroup"&gt;National Express&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/travelleisure"&gt;Travel &amp; leisure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/privatisation"&gt;Privatisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Pathologists will now carry out further tests, including toxicology and histology, which are likely to take several weeks. A formal identification process, which has not yet been carried out, will be completed today. The Guardian understands Berezovsky's ex-wife Galina saw the body on Saturday and saw marks around his neck consistent with strangulation of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky had been suffering from depression after a shattering high court defeat last year by his former business partner, Roman Abramovich. He was also financially stricken, with assets frozen and legal bills of up to £100m. He was found dead by his bodyguard on Saturday afternoon in a mansion owned by his ex-wife in Mill Lane in an exclusive area of Ascot. The bathroom had been locked from the inside and a scarf is understood to have been found next to his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had reportedly told a Russian journalist the previous day: "I have lost the meaning of life", telling him at a meeting at the Four Seasons Hotel on Park Lane: "I am 67 years old. And I don't know what to do any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the postmortem surprised Lord Bell, Beresovsky's PR adviser and one of his closest friends, who had spoken to him regularly over the last few months as he struggled with the judge's findings in the Abramovich case that he was an "unimpressive, and inherently unreliable witness".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He struck me as very low, but not that low," Bell said last night. "It is very sad. It is horrible. It won't stop people writing about [other theories of] how he died, because people don't understand suicide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said his thoughts were with Berezovsky's family – he has six children by two wives and a long-term partner. "You would rather think somebody had died by accident," he said. "But we have lost him. How he died is almost beside the point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends had said they felt he had got over the worst of his depression, which was treated with medication and a spell at the Priory clinic. He had started to travel into London more regularly for lunches and meetings and earlier this month held a conference with his lawyers to prepare for his testimony at the inquest into the death by radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. However, he still lacked his usual ebullience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sasha Nerozina, a close friend of Galina Berezovsky, said the family were keen for a speedy conclusion to the official process so they could bury Berezovsky and get on with their grieving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said they had been distressed by speculation in Russia about the cause of death. "They are trying to be as quiet as possible and grieve on their own,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nerozina said: "For the children it is the most tragic time. They are extremely shocked and devastated. If you look at Russian TV, some are saying he was killed, some are saying he may have staged his own death to appear as if it came from Putin's hand. There are a lot of conspiracy theories and when you lose someone you love, you don't want them to interfere with your grief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikolay Glushkov, another friend of Berezovsky, was among those who had feared that he may have been murdered, and the finding by the UK government pathologist that Berezovsky's injuries were consistent with hanging is unlikely to end speculation entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the third suspicious death in the past five years to befall a businessman from the former USSR in the area. Less than 10 miles away, Russian supergrass Alexander Perepilichnyy died while jogging last year – his death remains unexplained – while 15 miles away, Berezovsky's former business partner, Badri Patarkatsishvili, died suddenly in 2008, sparking fevered speculation. A pathologist concluded that he died of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lukeharding"&gt;Luke Harding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But the US military's bases in the Pacific area are in range of its medium-range missiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's defence ministry said it had detected no signs of unusual activity by the North's military but will monitor the situation. The South and the US military are conducting drills until the end of April, which they have stressed are strictly defensive in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North has previously threatened to strike back at the US military, accusing Washington of war preparations by flying B-52 bombers over the Korean peninsula as part of the drills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few weeks, North Korea has said it has abrogated an armistice that halted the 1950-53 Korean war and threatened a nuclear attack on the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-national-security"&gt;US national security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-military"&gt;US military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

who had a calm authority about them for more than an hour-and-a-half at the start of another glorious day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Root appeared keen to rotate the strike, but Bell remained in block-and-leave mode almost throughout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Boult accounted for Root, both Bell and Bairstow needed help from the fielders to survive even until lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell was dropped at fourth slip by Dean Brownlie on 40, and then Bairstow put down at gully by Kane Williamson two balls later, in the last over of the session from Boult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bairstow could not take advantage, edging Tim Southee to slip in back-foot defence three overs into the afternoon – and Prior then had a series of scares against the same bowler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He accounted for one of New Zealand's DRS chances, used up with no edge to vindicate a caught-behind appeal, and then survived by the same recourse himself when he did get bat on ball this time before initially being given out lbw by Rod Tucker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior was still on only 20 when he then mis-pulled Southee from high on the bat and saw the ball drop just out of Wagner's reach as he raced towards midwicket from mid-on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior's next scrape, eight runs later, was an uncanny defiance of physics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very good short ball from Wagner dropped down off his bat handle on to the bottom of the stumps - but somehow did not dislodge the bails. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a moment in which it could easily be construed fate was on England's side, a premise which gathered credence and held firm for the remainder of a surprising match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inside-edge past leg-stump for four off Southee was to make Prior England's top-scorer in both innings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad also survived a comical muddle to a yorker from Boult, reviewing Paul Reiffel's lbw decision while on his knees in the crease – after dropping his bat and being hit in the throat by the handle, through his helmet grille. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crucial consolation was that DRS demonstrated Broad, still on nought of course, had hit the ball and therefore managed to overturn the decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwi captain Brendon McCullum, limping into position because of a hamstring injury whenever he chose to make a change in a packed attacking field, tried everything he knew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Broad and Prior, who completed his hundred with a pull off Wagner for his 18th four, had every answer until the hard-working number nine edged Williamson (four for 44) to slip – and then James Anderson went in an action replay two balls later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It fell to Prior therefore, in company with Panesar for the final three overs, to keep England unbeaten in a series many predicted they would win at a canter to set themselves up for their double Ashes year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/england-in-new-zealand-2012-13"&gt;England in New Zealand 2012-13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/matt-prior"&gt;Matt Prior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/england-cricket-team"&gt;England cricket team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/new-zealand-cricket-team"&gt;New Zealand cricket team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/cricket"&gt;Cricket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Even members of Reilly's own party weighed in to support the website and its threesome-advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine Gael's youth wing said it fully endorsed the charity and the work it does for young people in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Young Fine Gael supports SpunOut.ie publishing information about sex, including information regarding threesomes," the president of the party's youth wing, Patrick Molloy, said tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also criticised one of his own fellow party members, Michelle Mulherin, for raising the matter of the threesome advice, reminding her that whether she "accepts it or not, the reality is that young people are having sex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molloy added: "According to HSE research, young people start having sex at 17. It is therefore important for young people to be informed of how to have safe sex and about the consequences of becoming sexually active, rather than pretending that sex doesn't happen. Keeping young people in the dark about sex education is not a solution, and will only lead to young people making uninformed decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversial article includes a definition of a threesome as "getting sexually intimate with two people rather than just one person" involving "any combination of guys and gals" as well as the pros and cons of taking part in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowing only slighty to the "down-with-this-sort-of-thing" style pressure emanating from the conservative wing of Fine Gael, SpunOut.ie said certain terms in the article like "shenanigans" and "spiced up" had been edited out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ian Power, a spokesman for the youth charity, stressed they have no intention of making any changes in response to further criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We just removed a certain word. The substance of the article has not changed, it will not change and it will remain on the website."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ireland"&gt;Ireland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/henrymcdonald"&gt;Henry McDonald&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
