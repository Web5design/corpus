The EEA includes all 27 members of the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister's spokesman said the NHS should recoup a further £10m to £20m towards the costs of treating EEA nationals on the NHS under reciprocal agreements. "We are looking at how you can better recoup costs from EEA countries," the spokesman said. "It is a question of the NHS getting better at being able to take and follow up the information it needs in order to recoup those costs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid criticisms that £10m to £20m was relatively small figure on which to make such a major policy announcement– the NHS budget is more than £100bn a year – the health secretary disputed the No 10 claim. Appearing on Radio 4's The World at One as the prime minister was still speaking, Hunt said: "It is a huge issue. I don't think those numbers are at all accurate. The reason is because hospitals, if they treat someone who is not entitled to NHS care – if they declare that person is a foreigner who is not entitled to that care then they have the responsibility to collect the money from that person. Whereas if they declare that person as a UK national then the money is paid for by the NHS. So we have created a strong incentive for hospitals in the system not to pick out the people who aren't entitled to free NHS care. That is one of the things we need to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how much he thinks the NHS is losing, Hunt said: "I don't want to speculate on what that number might be. But the number we have heard is actually not £20m, it is £200m. I think it is significantly more than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street also struggled as it emerged that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Of the 2m net migrants to the UK from the eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 people have claimed Job Seeker's Allowance (JSA). This figure was not disputed by No 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• A claim by No 10 that there has been a 40% increase in the number of social lettings taken up by migrants between 2007-08 and 2011-12 appeared to gloss over the fact that this was only an increase from 6.5% to 9% in the proportion of such lettings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister insisted that it was important to act on immigration as he set out plans to restrict access to benefits for immigrants from the EEA and beyond. He announced, as expected, that JSA would only be available to those genuinely seeking a job for a maximum of six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also announced that EEA immigrants would have to show a decent command of English. Cameron said: "We're going to make that assessment a real and robust one, and yes, it's going to include whether your ability to speak English is a barrier to work. And to migrants who are in work but then lose their jobs the same rules will apply. Six months, and then if you can't show you have a genuine chance of getting a job, benefits will be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that EEA migrants who don't have a genuine chance of getting work after six months will lose their right to access certain benefits. So yes, they can still come and stay here if they want to, but the British taxpayer will not go on endlessly paying for them any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister was scathing about Labour's record. "Under the previous government immigration was far too high and badly out of control. Net migration needs to come down radically from hundreds of thousands a year to just tens of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And as we bring net migration down so we must also make sure that Britain continues to benefit from it. That means ensuring that those who do come here are the brightest and the best, the people we really need with the skills and entrepreneurial talent to create the British jobs and growth that will help us to win in the global race."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habib Rahman, chief executive of the JCWI, said: "This rhetoric may curtail rights to benefits on a minor scale, but relatively few migrants compared with 'indigenous' people actually claim benefit anyway. The real effect of this speech will be to further increase the intolerance and the hostile reception that immigrants are facing from some sections of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing new about people from these countries coming to live and work in the UK. This media hysteria denies the fact that immigration helps our economy and is a great boon to tackling the coming demographic imbalanced posed by our ageing population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/immigration"&gt;Immigration and asylum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Analysts said Cyprus could see its economy contract by 10% or more in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European shares lost early gains, as initial enthusiasm over the bailout deal faded. The FTSE 100 was up just 3 points at 6396 and the German DAX was 0.2% higher. After a brief rally, Italy's FTSE MIB moved sharply into negative territory and was down 2.4% on Monday afternoon. In the US, the Dow dropped 0.25% to 14,476. The euro dropped 1% against the dollar, meaning €1 is worth $1.2874.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Paris-based trader said: "The loss of confidence in the European banking system stemming from the Cypriot crisis will not only weigh on the banks but also on the economy of the region."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final deal came close to what the IMF chief, Christine Lagarde, had demanded a week ago but which was rebuffed by the Cypriot president, Nicos Anastasiades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laiki, or Cyprus Popular Bank, is to be closed. Its €4.2bn in deposits over €100,000 will be placed in a "bad bank" and could be wiped out entirely. Those with smaller deposits will see their accounts transferred to Bank of Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot government reportedly fought hard for Bank of Cyprus to be spared, but the island's biggest bank will face huge restructuring. No bailout money will be used to recapitalise it; instead shareholders and bondholders will be hit. It is thought depositors with more than €100,000 at the bank will also be involved in the recapitalisation, and are expected to face losses of around 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the bank up to healthy EU-mandated capital levels will be made harder by the fact that Bank of Cyprus will inherit a €9bn debt Laiki had with the European Central Bank (ECB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bailout deal does not need approval from the Cypriot parliament because it has been achieved by restructuring the country's two largest banks, rather than levying a new tax on citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations got under way on Sunday amid a hardening of stance by the IMF and Germany, which insisted that depositors must take the hit for bailing out the eurozone's latest crisis economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports suggest that Anastasiades threatened to resign amid demands for a deep restructuring of Cyprus's banking system, but he remained in his post on Monday morning: "I'm happy because we shall have a programme and it's in the best interests of the Cyprus people and the European Union," he said, on leaving the building in Brussels where talks were held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECB had threatened to cut off funds propping up Cypriot banks on Monday, which would have precipitated the island's exit from the euro if the emergency meeting had not reached an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany's finance minister, said the deal agreed in Brussels overnight is "much better" from a German point of view than the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the goal was to shrink the Cypriot banking sector to the European average of three-times national output, rather than its current size of seven times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyprus had hoped to secure a rescue package from Russia, but the government was forced into fresh negotiations with its troika of lenders – the EU, the IMF and the ECB – after the Cypriot finance minister, Michalis Sarris, returned empty-handed from two days of talks in Moscow last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bailout deal will hit foreign investors, particularly Russians, hard. Russian nationals are estimated to hold more than €20bn of the €68bn deposited in Cypriot banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia's prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Monday: "They are continuing to steal what has already been stolen," using a phrase Vladimir Lenin used to answer the allegation that the Bolsheviks were thieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials have repeatedly compared the Cypriot bank levy to Soviet-era expropriation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were signs of panic over the weekend as a €100 limit was imposed on ATM withdrawals in Cyprus. Officials said they believed the country would now need strict controls on money transfers in and out of the economy, cutting off its citizens and companies from much of the rest of the eurozone's financial system. Europe's economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, said: "The near future will be very difficult for the country and its people." The EC said these controls will, however, only be enacted "exceptionally and temporarily" as requested by the Cypriot authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cyprus the mood is grim. Cypriots realise that their economy will take a huge hit and there are worries of long-term unemployment, as big foreign investors are expected to seek ways to flee from the country. Anger remains directed at the EU, and Germany in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexandra Salmani, 32, moved to Cyprus eight months ago to escape the financial crisis in Greece. She said: "We came here to find a better life, and it's exactly the same thing as in Greece. Everywhere I go there's crisis – I'm telling all my friends that I'll go to Germany next. Someone has to learn to say no to Merkel. They saw a rich country, decided to take their money, and destroy them.

The two men, both of Manchester, deny charges of conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to rob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving evidence on Monday, Bradshaw told his defence counsel, Martin Meeke QC, that he had not known where he was going when the pair set off seven hours before their arrest in Devon. He said he had never heard of the 25-year-old pop star before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeke said: "The day you were arrested, you and Liverpool set off from his flat in Manchester, didn't you?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradshaw replied: "I think so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked who had the idea to go, Bradshaw said he could not remember. Meeke asked Bradshaw where the pair were going, to which the defendant replied: "We were just going on a day out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he did not remember what time they left, or where they were going. Meeke asked: "Do you remember what you were going to do when you arrived where you were going?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradshaw, dressed in a dark hooded top, said: "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defendant told the court he used to listen to R&amp;B and hip-hop with his co-accused. Asked by Meeke whether he had ever heard Liverpool mention the name Joss Stone, Bradshaw said: "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial continues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The issue is likely to be debated in the Lords later on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couling in his letter says: "We do keep management information on the numbers of referrals but that is to monitor for anomalies, for example it might highlight where there are higher numbers of sanctions than one might expect. They are not league tables." He defends the tougher conditionality regime introduced in September including greater requirements to provide regular evidence of efforts to seek work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He states: "Sanctions and conditionality are important tools for advisers in helping people back to work. The international and national evidence shows they play an important role in making the system work effectively and people return to work more quickly and spend less time on benefits where public employment systems make use of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where sanctions are appropriate they should, without hesitation, be used. So if you are an adviser you should not be surprised if, from time to time, your manager does challenge you about whether you are applying the sanctions regime appropriately. That is right and proper and that will continue. This challenge though does not constitute a target, nor is it evidence of one."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concludes by saying: "Whilst sanctions in some form or other have been part of the system of unemployment benefits since 1911 we should not be surprised if there is considerable political and public scrutiny of us here. I intend to defend robustly you, and our appropriate use of sanctions going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous jobcentre staff have contacted the Guardian since last Friday's story on targets for sanctions to claim such targets are part of the jobcentre culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be a dispute about definitions that is fuelling the disjuncture about what is being said at national level, and what is reported at local level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couling told the Commons' public accounts committee (PAC) last week: "We do track sanctions. We are quite keen to avoid any misunderstandings that there are targets attached to these."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Work and Pensions permanent secretary, Robert Devereaux, also told the committee: "Imagine you are the manager in a particular office and you can see that many of your advisers are sanctioning at a particular rate and by and large it is 5%, 8% or something like that, and Fred in the corner is doing 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you are down to is managers making judgments, but one of the things they would look at – this seems to me perfectly reasonable – is do you think it is easy to do a sanction? It is much easier to just let it wash. People must put themselves into a difficult place on the part of society to do a sanction, so all the manager is trying to do when looking at the rates at which people are sanctioned is to try to think whether that sounds reasonable." Couling also said he did have management information on which offices did the most sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said he did not use this information "to go round to other offices and say they should be at this level, or that". Asked by the committee chair, Margaret Hodge, what he did use it for, Couling replied: "I do it mostly because people ask parliamentary questions about it, and if I don't have it I am told it is terrible that I don't have it. What I want to try to get across to people is that there is no right level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 25 March 2013. The original version wrongly gave Neil Couling's name as Rob Couling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The veteran activist Lev Ponomarev's For Human Rights movement was visited by officials and an NTV crew on Monday. He wrote a letter to the Moscow prosecutor's office calling the search illegal, since prosecutors had provided no evidence that his organisation had broken the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Verdict, a human rights law group, was also searched on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin has long been suspicious of non-governmental organisations, especially those with American funding, which he has accused of being fronts for US meddling in Russian politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Putin returned to the presidency in May, parliament rubber-stamped a Kremlin-backed law requiring all NGOs that receive foreign funding to register as "foreign agents", a term that many Russians find pejorative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian officials have searched up to 2,000 NGOs in the past month, according to Pavel Chikov, a member of the presidential human rights council. The searches began after Putin gave a speech urging the Federal Security Service to focus attention on groups receiving foreign funding, which he said were "putting pressure on Russia".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The justice ministry said earlier this year that the policy was unenforceable, but on Monda it told the Interfax news agency that the searches were being carried out in line with the foreign agents law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikov said many organisations had been checked under another, vaguely worded law on "extremism", including by agencies that have nothing to do with enforcing it, such as the fire service and the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US embassy, Amnesty, the presidential human rights council and Public Verdict have all expressed concern over the searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/amnesty-international"&gt;Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The trip comes after years of stalled discussions with the US, Pakistan and the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Karzai's trip, a US official told reporters: "I wouldn't want to overplay it but I think that it's a very positive sign. It's another step on a continued path toward … getting to some sort of reconciliation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody is expecting that he will open an office there in a week. Nobody is expecting that he will be sitting down with Taliban in a week. This is a long process and this is one more small but positive step in that … process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions between the United States and Afghanistan have deepened in recent years over a range of issues, including civilian casualties during air strikes, night raids and the transfer of prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official acknowledged the difficulties in the US-Afghan relationship but said he believed the countries had resolved a number of them with moves including an agreement to remove US forces from part of Wardak province, where they were accused of mistreating local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the US believed that the two nations had moved beyond an incident in which Karzai recently accused Washington of colluding with the Taliban to keep foreign forces in Afghanistan, marring the first visit by the US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, to Pakistan since he took on the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will always be bumps in the road … It's a relationship that can withstand those," the US official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The process of winding down our current position and role in Afghanistan and stepping into more of a support role … is not going to be a smooth process at all times. Issues of sovereignty and security are always going to be difficult."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday, the US military &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/25/us-military-parwan-prison-afghanistan" title=""&gt;ceded control of its last detention facility in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;, a year after the two sides initially agreed on the transfer. Karzai demanded control of the Parwan facility, located near the US-run Bagram military base north of Kabul, as a matter of national sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top US commander in Afghanistan, General Joseph Dunford, handed over Parwan at a ceremony there after signing an agreement with the Afghan defence minister, Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. "This ceremony highlights an increasingly confident, capable and sovereign Afghanistan," Dunford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerry flew to Afghanistan from Amman, Jordan, where he spent the night after visiting Iraq on Sunday. In Baghdad, Kerry confronted the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, for continuing to grant Iran access to its airspace and said Iraq's behaviour was raising questions about its reliability as a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before leaving Amman for Kabul, Kerry met the head of Pakistan's army, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/john-kerry"&gt;John Kerry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hamid-karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Teachers described Gove and Wilshaw as showing "abject failure to improve education or treat teachers, parents and pupils with respect".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATL is the most moderate of the classroom unions and it is the first time in its history that delegates have passed a motion of no confidence in an education secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gove stoked teachers' anger this weekend by writing in the Mail on Sunday that they were against his plans for performance-related pay because they "resented the recognition of excellence". He also said headteachers of academies, unlike other state schools, "put the needs of children ahead of the demands of shop stewards".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Roberts, from London, told the conference of 300 teachers: "We have no confidence in Gove or Wilshaw. If any of us behaved to our pupils the way they behave to our profession, we would be sacked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers are angry at changes to their pay and pensions and the scale of reforms to all parts of the curriculum. They are expected to voice their fury at Gove and Wilshaw at their annual conferences over the next week. The National Union of Teachers will also propose a vote of no confidence in Gove and call on Wilshaw to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Bousted, the ATL general secretary, said Gove and Wilshaw were "sucking the life and hope out of our education system and the teachers who work within it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jesse Ratcliff, from Lincolnshire, told delegates to wait until the general election to show their displeasure with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference also heard that some families were so poor that children were having to choose between catching a bus and having lunch. Teachers had to delve into their own pockets to ensure children had something to eat during the school day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not talking about sweet-stuffing Billy Bunters," said Clare Kellett, from West Somerset Community College. "Some of these students may not be sure of having a decent meal once in the day. Increasingly, teachers have to put their hands in their own pockets to lift children out of poverty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers expressed outrage that sixth-formers whose joint family income is under £16,000 a year were entitled to free school meals if they attended a school sixth form, but not if they went to a sixth-form college or further education college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One college teacher said her students had fainted from hunger on several occasions. "There is no centralised way of identifying who may qualify for free meals, so the provision is very hit and miss," Tricia Elliott, who works in a college in Warwickshire, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey of 300 college teachers by ATL found a fifth had offered to buy food for their pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Department for Education spokeswoman, reacting to the no-confidence vote said for too long other countries had been outpacing England: "We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust and rigorous, with exams and qualifications that match the world's best. This ambition is surely something the ATL should be supporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good teaching is critical to the success of our education system and we are making sure that it is properly recognised. We have put in place measures specifically to support teachers through increased funding for disadvantaged pupils and better opportunities for professional development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove"&gt;Michael Gove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/education"&gt;Education policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/teaching"&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/schools"&gt;Schools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tradeunions"&gt;Trade unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jessicashepherd"&gt;Jessica Shepherd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It was also a sadistic attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am satisfied that in behaving in the way you did, you were aping the conduct in a film of which you were obsessed, namely The Loved Ones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said that he and the jury had "the misfortune" of watching the movie's murder sequence during the trial and added: "I regret to say that, as in this film, you committed many acts while the unfortunate Mr Nall was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that included the substance in his eyes, be that cleaning fluid, and the carving of marks upon his chest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George, wearing a navy blue jumper, stood bolt upright in the dock with his arms behind his back and showed no emotion as his sentence was passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recorder described Nall, also an alcoholic, as "vulnerable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "He was vulnerable because of the amount of drink he had taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You knew he had, you took advantage of it and, putting it in a nutshell, he was no match for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You killed him in a most cruel and sadistic way and you enjoyed doing so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nall, a former supermarket worker, was described to the jury by Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, as a "pleasant, polite and friendly man".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the victim was also a heavy drinker who was in regular contact with the probation and support services, Unsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the trial Nall was subjected to a "brutal, ruthless and sadistic attack" in his own home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was beaten, kicked and stabbed on dozens and dozens of occasions," Unsworth said. "A strange long wound was carved into his abdomen, salt was found on his wounded body. He was tortured."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George, the barrister told the trial, had a keen interest in witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsworth added: "He watched horror films. One film in particular that he liked to watch was called The Loved Ones, a violent horror film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a chilling precursor to what befell Andrew Nall, one scene depicts a man being stabbed on multiple occasions, his chest having a letter carved into it before salt was thrown on to the wound."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George was caught when he was arrested for assaulting another man 10 hours after the murder of Nall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his police interviews he disclosed that he had murdered someone, levelling false accusations that his victim was a paedophile and a rapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George's co-defendant, Christine Holleran, 50, was cleared of murder and manslaughter by the jury on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holleran, who told the jury she witnessed the attack but played no part in it, shouted "justice, justice" as their majority verdict was returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving evidence, she said George was growling as he stabbed Nall, and said: "He was like the devil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she then ran away from Mr Nall's flat "in a state of shock".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/horror"&gt;Horror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I think the relevance of Labour as a party would be brought into sharp contrast," McCluskey told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that unless Labour set out a clear economic vision that "rejected the failed neo-liberal experiment of the past 30 years" and focused on growth and jobs, Unite and other unions would be forced to re-examine their relationship with the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In many respects Labour is at the crossroads of its future, of its purpose … if it doesn't stand up for the aspirations of ordinary people – the 99%, if you like – then what is its purpose? If we don't win the next election, that will be critically examined and the political landscape could change dramatically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unite, which has about 1.5 million members, backed Miliband's leadership bid in 2010 and has since donated £6m to the party through membership fees. Any withdrawal of financial support would be financially crippling for Labour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCluskey expressed his anger over the Labour leaderships's failure to oppose the coalition's emergency welfare bill this week. Forty-four Labour MPs rebelled during the Commons vote and McCluskey has written to them to offer Unite's support, saying they "saved the party's honour".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unite has put forward detailed alternatives to the government's austerity measures, including the creation of a British investment bank, a house building programme and an increase in the minimum wage. McCluskey said he was hopeful that Labour would take notice and begin to flesh out a more radical programme over the next 18 months, giving confidence to those struggling under coalition policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reality is we need the Labour party to put forward what looks like hope, what looks like a vision of hope, because at the moment there is nothing but fear and despair by this government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCluskey, who is engaged in a leadership election at Unite, added: "If it doesn't, if we fail, then it won't only be Unite, it will be other unions as well that will have to seriously consider that relationship … there may be another workers' party, another party of labour may emerge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to influence the future direction of the Labour party Unite is attempting to get candidates who share the union's principles of "collectivism, solidarity and community" selected as parliamentary candidates before the next general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would hope, if we get a Labour government back into power next time, we would have quite an influential group, maybe 50 or 60 Labour MPs, who had our values," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The union is also trying to build its presence in communities around the country, working with local campaigns and direct action groups such as UK Uncut. It plans to offer a credit union and welfare advice service and has launched a community membership scheme for people who are out of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is to link our members in work to the communities in which they live so that Unite is seen as being there for them. Because if we just recognise that 80% of the governments cuts are still to come in … what you will have is millions of people with nowhere to turn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/edmiliband"&gt;Ed Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/unite"&gt;Unite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/tradeunions"&gt;Trade unions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matthewtaylor"&gt;Matthew Taylor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The weekend's disruption saw soaking weather play a major part in disruption, with flooding and avalanches in the most affected regions, Wales and the south-west of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death toll stands at two. The body of 25-year-old Gary Windle was found in snow at Briarfield near Burnley, in Lancashire, a day after he set out to walk home after midnight following an evening out with friends. In Looe, Cornwall, a woman named locally as Susan Norman died when part of her house collapsed in a landslip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, a pause in the snow is expected, helping power engineers working on downed cables and snowploughs tackling drifts on minor roads to some villages in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north-west. Generators have been shipped to Scottish islands, and water has been reconnected to 1,000 homes in Northern Ireland. Power there may not be fully back on for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 homes in Scotland and Cumbria are not expected to be reconnected until late on Monday in spite of more than 200 engineers working throughout Sunday night in Dumfries and Galloway alone. Drivers who abandoned cars in Cumbria and north Wales have been asked not to return to them without police help, and the A595 along the Cumbria coast remains closed after 70 people were rescued and housed with local people or at community centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cut-off areas have managed on such neighbourliness and stocks of essentials, and there were no complaints at England's highest pub, the Tan Hill Inn on the Durham border with North Yorkshire, where a backgammon circle is flourishing among guests who have spent four days snowed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likely return of snowfall on Good Friday suggests the UK may get its first white Easter for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow "be aware" warnings are now a regular feature – along with a brave snapshot of daffodils – of the Met Office's online maps. The forecasters are concentrating on the danger of ice and wind chill, warning that "lying snow in many areas will melt on roads and pavements by day, refreezing by night to give icy patches. The public should be aware of the potential for disruption to travel due to icy patches and snow blowing back on to roads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://" title=""&gt;MeteoGroup&lt;/a&gt; forecaster Andy Ratcliffe said: "Monday's snow will be mainly confined to the east of Scotland and north-east England where there will be a dusting, but nothing significant. Elsewhere there will be some snow showers but nothing like the accumulations we've seen over the last few days, and it will remain very cold and breezy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Into the week there will be more scattered snow flurries and there is the potential for more widespread snow returning at the end of the week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things are limping back towards normality on the Scottish island of Arran, which suffered a complete loss of power at the weekend, and in Kintyre where 3,500 homes were still blacked out on Sunday night. Helicopters have been used to find faults on power lines unreachable because of gale-force winds and drifting snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland's transport minister, Keith Brown, told BBC Radio Scotland: "There are ferries going on new routes, from Kennacraig to Campbeltown, taking generators. There's food being supplied to local shops. There are individual burger vans and food vans being established to try to help people, and contact is being made with anybody who might be in a vulnerable situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult. The A83, which is crucial to getting the infrastructure repaired, has only reopened this morning. It opened to emergency vehicles last night and, more generally, under police convoy this morning so it is taking some time. Contact has been made with those people who are in extreme circumstances to make sure they have, if they need it, heat and also food. That's being supplied by local responders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail problems added to the dislocation as people went back to work on Monday morning, with speed restrictions of 5mph in parts of south-west London at the height of the commuter rush and delays in Surrey, Sussex and on the east coast mainline near the capital. Services to the north from King's Cross have been reduced and there have been signalling problems and breakdowns between Ipswich and Felixstowe, Northampton and Rugby and Sheffield, Huddersfield and Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland has had rail delays of up to 90 minutes between Inverness and Aberdeen. Services were held up between Bridgend and Swansea in Wales and halted altogether on the Cumbrian coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butterfly Conservation warned of a second worrying year for UK species after a fall in numbers last year because of wet weather at key times in the breeding cycle. The group's head of monitoring, Tom Brereton, said: "Butterflies have proved that given favourable conditions and the availability of suitable habitat they can recover, but with numbers in almost three-quarters of UK species at a historically low ebb any tangible recovery will be more difficult than ever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bets on snow at Easter have seen odds fall to 4/6, with 5/1 offered against the holiday being the coldest since records began. More specialised punts at Ladbrokes include 16/1 against icebergs on the Thames disrupting the Oxford and Cambridge boat race and 8/1 against the Queen wearing snowshoes to go to church on Easter Sunday – down from 20/1 before the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather's white lining is being enjoyed by ski resorts in Scotland where business is close to breaking records in spite of regular disruption from blizzards. In a reverse of TV pictures showing the UK basking in sun a year ago, the &lt;a href="http://ski.visitscotland.com/centres/cairngorm/" title=""&gt;CairnGorm&lt;/a&gt; and other resorts have rerun videos of last March's bare pistes, which this year have clocked up more than 175,000 skiers and snowboarders with another two months to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/martinwainwright"&gt;Martin Wainwright&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Unlike assault, which often takes place in public and sometimes within sight of CCTV cameras, rape is an offence for which there are usually no independent witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reece told the Guardian: "I don't think most people are subject to rape myths. I'm not saying that no one [is influenced by] them but the vast majority of jurors, police, prosecutors and judges have decent attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rape myths are used as a convenient label to explain away low conviction rates. Rape is a very serious crime, but I don't think it right to focus on [low conviction rates] as a problem particular to rape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a lot of [rape] cases where there's no other evidence than one person's word against another. Both sides are saying they had sexual intercourse but [don't agree that it] took place in the [same] way … I don't think there's much more we can do to increase the conviction rate. I would like to see a more straightforward debate about the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011/12 there were 14,767 recorded female rapes but only 1,058 convictions. In 1985, by comparison, there were 1,842 recorded rapes but 450 convictions. In other words, en eightfold increase in the reporting of rape over the period has resulted in little more than a doubling in the conviction rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those cases that result in a full crown court trial, 51.1% resulted in a conviction in 2011/12. That, Reece said, is also not out of line with other serious offences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She takes issue with the idea that many of the myths are widespread and questions whether all are mistaken. One of the most frequently discussed is the "coffee myth", in which people are said to wrongly believe that if a woman invites a man home for coffee after a night out, it generally means an invitation to have sex with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reece said: "Most participants [in surveys on attitudes to rape] probably mean that an invitation for coffee is by convention a signal of consent and/or that women tend to signal consent in this way. "Interestingly, rather than providing evidence of the prevalence of rape myths, those who agree with this statement are providing evidence of its truth … the best evidence we have of how women show consent to sex is how people say women show consent to sex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commonly advanced argument was that law reform had proved ineffective because judges, police, jurors and even the general public hold "rape myths", Reece said, but there was less evidence of people blaming victims than is often supposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One survey frequently referred to was carried out by Amnesty in 2005. The word "blame" was not used in the questionnaire. "So the 30% of respondents to the Amnesty survey who thought that being drunk made the woman to some extent responsible for being raped may have meant that she was in some way culpable," Reece said. "But they may [alternatively] have meant that her drunkenness was causally implicated in the rape, in the sense that she might not have been raped if she had been sober, that being drunk increased the risk of being raped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not only is this a far more benign belief than victim-blaming, but the rape research provides solid evidence that it is also an accurate belief, with one proviso. Most rape researchers prefer to talk in terms of women 'enhancing their vulnerability' to rape, rather than in terms of any causal connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/rape"&gt;Rape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott"&gt;Owen Bowcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Family and friends who arrived at the house have told the press there was no sign of blood, he was fully clothed and there was a scarf lying beside his body. He had been suffering from depression for several months after a shattering &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/boris-berezovsky-roman-abramovich-legal-fees" title=""&gt;high court defeat last year to his former business partner, Roman Abramovich&lt;/a&gt;, and amid mounting debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives have said there is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/24/evidence-boris-berezovsky-killed-police" title=""&gt;no evidence of any third-party involvement in his death&lt;/a&gt;. A paramedic's radiation monitoring device went off when leaving the property on Saturday, causing the property to be sealed off for checks by specialist police officers trained in handling chemical, biological and radioactive material. The property was given the all-clear on Sunday morning and scene-of-crime officers are continuing investigations at the house on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's former wife Galina, who owns the house and had allowed him to live there, arrived while a paramedic was on the scene and saw the scarf. Nikolai Glushkov, one of Berezovsky's oldest friends, spoke to her afterwards and told the Guardian: "Boris was strangled. Either he did it himself or with the help of someone. [But] I don't believe it was suicide. This was not just a normal death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yuli Dubov, a writer and one of Berezovsky's closest friends, &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/9951797/Boris-Berezovsky-left-no-suicide-note.html" title=""&gt;told the Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;: "Boris's personal bodyguard noticed Boris's mobile telephone lying somewhere in the Ascot house on Saturday afternoon shortly after 3pm with several missed calls on it going back to 11.30am that morning. It was very unusual for Boris to miss calls like that. He realised something was wrong and rushed to check the bathroom but found the door locked and when nobody answered his knock he broke it down. He found Boris lying on the floor dead, in his clothes. The bodyguard touched him and felt he was cold. He checked for signs of blood and found none before rushing to call the emergency services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard is understood to have been the only other person in the house at the time. Berezovsky did not leave a suicide note, according to an unnamed source &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/europe/for-homesick-russian-tycoon-instant-of-ruin-came-in-court.html" title=""&gt;reported in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. He had reportedly suffered from heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thames Valley police have said his death remains "unexplained" and said on Sunday that officers were now "building a picture of the last days of Mr Berezovsky's life, speaking to close friends and family to gain a better understanding of his state of mind".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DCI Kevin Brown, of Thames Valley police, said: "It would be wrong to speculate on the cause of death until the postmortem has been carried out. We do not have any evidence at this stage to suggest third-party involvement." He added: "We are at the early stages of the investigation and we are retaining an open mind as we progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the last people to see Berezovsky was Ilya Zhegulyov, a Russian journalist from Forbes magazine, who interviewed him at the Four Seasons hotel in Park Lane, central London, on the day before his death and reported he looked "very depressed and very lost".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's prominence as a critic of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and his repeatedly expressed fear of assassination attempts fuelled speculation that he may have been targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His was the third suspicious death in the past five years to befall a businessman from the former USSR in the affluent crescent of suburbia just beyond the M25 in Surrey and Berkshire. Less than 10 miles from the scene of Berezovsky's death, the Russian supergrass Alexander Perepilichnyy died while jogging last year – his death remains unexplained – while 15 miles away, at Downside Manor near Leatherhead, Berezovsky's former business partner Badri Patarkatsishvili died suddenly in 2008, sparking fevered speculation. A pathologist concluded he died of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Berezovsky met his lawyers in London to prepare for his testimony at the inquest into the death in London by radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. An associate at the meeting described him as seeming "quite low" and "not as ebullient and chipper as usual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Bell, a PR adviser and friend who saw him for lunch in London two weeks ago and spoke to him again by phone more recently, said Berezovsky was "very depressed and very low" after the judge in his case against the Chelsea football club owner ruled he was "dishonest" and "deluded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was very shocked by the decision in the Abramovich case," added Andrew Stephenson, a lawyer who has represented him for the past 20 years. "To have an English judge say 'I don't believe you' really destroyed his confidence and the platform he had [to campaign against Putin]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said he did not think it likely Berezovsky would kill himself and said his friend's heart problems would be the most likely cause. "I don't think there's foul play," he said. "I can't see any reason why they [Moscow] would bother. They had managed to destroy him and they would have preferred to see him in misery and they will be rather upset he has escaped it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lukeharding"&gt;Luke Harding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"I was indeed retained by Aisha Gaddafi for one discrete issue; namely, seeking the opening of an investigation at the ICC into the murder of Muammar Gaddafi," he told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news of their disappearance comes as Egypt and Morocco announce the arrest of several prominent Gaddafi-era figures who had fled Libya, including Gaddafi's cousin Ahmed Gaddafi al-Dam, captured in Cairo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three siblings fled Libya with Safia during the Arab spring revolution as rebel forces entered Tripoli in August 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aisha lost her husband and two children in the Nato bombing of Tripoli in 2011 and gave birth to a baby girl the day after arriving in Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three, Libyan authorities are keenest to arrest Hannibal, formerly head of Libya's maritime transport authority and who they say was part of Gaddafi's inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the revolution, Hannibal, 37, became known for his brushes with the law in Europe. In 2008 he and his wife, Aline Skaf, a Lebanese model, were arrested by Swiss police after being accused of attacking members of their staff in a Geneva hotel. They were later released after Libya arrested two Swiss businessmen in apparent retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later police were called to reports of a woman screaming from the hotel room the couple shared at Claridge's in London. Three bodyguards were arrested by police for obstruction and inside Skaf was found battered and bleeding and was treated in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/muammar-gaddafi"&gt;Muammar Gaddafi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/libya"&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/africa"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/algeria"&gt;Algeria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chris-stephen"&gt;Chris Stephen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The paper published a report last week which claimed that at least 12 sections in the book were lifted from other websites, and which included an admission from Goodall of her failure correctly to cite her sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now publisher Grand Central and Goodall have released a statement to American media announcing the book's postponement "so that we may have the necessary time to correct any unintentional errors".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to me that the proper sources are credited, and I will be working diligently with my team to address all areas of concern," Goodall said. "My goal is to ensure that when this book is released it is not only up to the highest of standards, but also that the focus be on the crucial messages it conveys."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeds of Hope, an examination, according to its publisher, of "the critical role that trees and plants play in our world", combines Goodall's own stories with more detailed information about plants. It is in the latter sections, found the Washington Post last week, that "the instances of borrowing creep in". Goodall, famous for her studies of chimpanzees in the wild, admits in the book that she has "spent a lifetime loving plants, even though I have never studied them as a scientist".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples cited by the paper include a section on organic farming. "According to Oxfam, a British non-profit agency working to put an end to poverty worldwide, the spraying of pesticides on tea estates is often done by untrained casual daily-wage workers, sometimes even by children and adolescents," writes Goodall – a sentence that &lt;a href="http://www.choiceorganicteas.com/whyorganic.php" title=""&gt;also appears on the website Choice Organic Teas&lt;/a&gt;, word for word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia also appears to have been used for a source: talking about the American botanist John Bartram, who lived during the 1700s and shipped seeds to Europe, Goodall informs her readers that "'Bartram's Boxes,' as they came to be known, were regularly sent to Peter Collinson for distribution to a wide list of European clients." The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bartram" title=""&gt;Wikipedia entry on Bartram&lt;/a&gt; contains a virtually identical sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it also points to passages borrowed from a website about the history of tobacco, and from an astrology site, perhaps the most damning instance of "borrowing" is Goodall's use of a quote from the botanist Matt Daws. "'If seeds can survive that long in such poor conditions, then that's good news for the ones that are stored under ideal conditions in the Millennium Seed Bank,' Matt Daws said to me," she writes. Daws appears to have said something very similar in &lt;a href="http://www.kew.org/news/200-year-old-seeds.htm" title=""&gt;a 2009 article&lt;/a&gt;: "If seeds can survive that long in poor conditions, then that's good news for those in the Millennium Seed Bank stored under ideal conditions." And he told the Washington Post that "to be perfectly honest I have no recollection of speaking to her".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodall initially responded to the accusations in an email to the paper last week. "This was a long and well researched book, and I am distressed to discover that some of the excellent and valuable sources were not properly cited, and I want to express my sincere apologies," she wrote. "I hope it is obvious that my only objective was to learn as much as I could so that I could provide straightforward factual information distilled from a wide range of reliable sources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/scienceandnature"&gt;Science and nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/publishing"&gt;Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/jane-goodall"&gt;Jane Goodall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonflood"&gt;Alison Flood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The BBC sank about as low as it could."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson Sr told presenter Nick Ferrari: "His grilling people about their personal lives, accusing them of guilt by association, openly abusing them in a legitimate interview. Frankly, I don't know where we are coming to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have no idea who Eddie Mair is or what he does. But frankly, there is such a thing as respecting the office, even if you don't respect the man and that did not come through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson Sr, a former Tory MEP, described Mair's interview as a "travesty" and suggested he would not have "openly abused" Labour leader Ed Miliband in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "As for saying he thought Boris was a nasty piece of work, well, honestly. I don't know where Eddie Mair's politics come from but I suspect he would not have treated the leader of the Labour party in that way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he felt "great anger" watching the interview on Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the issue of Johnson Jr's misquote when he was a journalist at the Times, Johnson Sr said: "I know about that quote. This was Boris 25 years, 30 years ago, ringing up actually his godfather, a historian, and he got it wrong. He got what his godfather said wrong. Later on various things happened as a result of that, good heavens …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If that's the worst you can dig up, something 30 years ago, most journalists I know make up quotes all the time and I don't think they go down the drain for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked why his son had looked uncomfortable during the interview, Johnson said: "He was told he was coming on to talk about issues which really matter to London. There are quite a lot of them he could have talked about … instead he dug up totally irrelevant things which have been dealt with ages and ages ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson Sr said he believed the BBC had overstepped the mark, and added: "One of the issues Eddie Mair totally failed to address was the Leveson thing. The more I think about it, the more I think what a travesty that interview was, not of Boris but of good broadcasting standards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speaking in London on Monday, Johnson Jr said: "Eddie Mair did a splendid job. There is no doubt that is what the BBC is for – holding us to account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I fully concede it wasn't my most blistering performance, but that was basically because I was set to talk about the Olympics and housing in London and he wanted to talk about other things, some of them – my private life and so on – of quite some antiquity, the details of which I wasn't brilliant on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was perfectly within his rights to have a bash at me – in fact it would have been shocking if he hadn't. If a BBC presenter can't attack a nasty Tory politician what's the world coming to?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Mair should get Jeremy Paxman's lead anchor role on Newsnight, Johnson Jr added: "I should think he'll get an Oscar, it was an Oscar-winning performance. I think he'll get a Pulitzer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferrari, speaking after Johnson Sr's appearance on his show this morning, said: "He was, as you would expect, a father defending his son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did a phone call and it started off with people defending the BBC and saying he was fair game. But by the end more people said they supported Boris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of the interview was seen as absolutely legitimate until the line about "nasty piece of work". It was felt by listeners that wasn't the role of the BBC reporter or interviewer to say that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC said it had received 384 complaints about the interview, which was watched by about 1.7 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for BBC News said: "We believe this was a fair interview which took in issues facing London and the wider political landscape as well as looking towards tonight's TV portrait programme [Boris Johnson: The Irresistible Rise by film-maker Michael Cockerell, which will air on BBC2 on Monday at 9pm].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the documentary is biographical exploring controversial episodes in the mayor's life was considered appropriate. Eddie's line of questioning attempted to elicit responses to direct questions that were not being answered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of the 15-minute interview, Johnson Jr admitted he had "sandpapered" quotes as a Times journalist, failed to deny he had lied to then Tory leader Michael Howard about an affair and conceded that he had humoured an old friend when he asked for a phone number in the knowledge that the friend intended to beat up the owner of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video of the interview was one of the BBC's most-requested on-demand programmes on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mair is one of a number of guest hosts of the Sunday morning politics slot while presenter Andrew Marr recovers from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BBC insiders said there was broad support for Mair's interview from within the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was sort of his style, he will just say those sort of things. Eddie Mair is very different to someone like Andrew Marr," said one BBC News journalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other people might have begun that line ["You're a nasty piece of work, aren't you?"] by saying "Some people might think …" But that's not his style, it's not the way he operates. He was physically very close to him, leaning right in and almost touching him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporation insiders said Mair was justified in going into Johnson's background, and the historic accusations about him, because of the BBC2 documentary about his life, in which he had taken part, which airs tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were even questions within the BBC, given the scale of the response today, why it did not make more of the interview yesterday in its news bulletins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people [in BBC News] think it was a good interview and he did well. They were impressed that he managed to get through the bluster that normally sweeps interviewers away," said a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That particular ["nasty piece of work"] line does look a bit odd if you pull it out in isolation but in context, if you watch the whole thing, it does seem justifiable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

But &lt;a href="http://www.centrica.com/index.asp?pageid=1041&amp;newsid=2693" title=""&gt;the deal struck by energy company Centrica&lt;/a&gt; marks the start of a new era in gas use in the UK, because it opens up the market to cheap supplies from the US, as North Sea gas fields run out and pipelines to Europe remain expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shale gas exploitation &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/apr/21/pennsylvania-ground-zero-shale-gas" title=""&gt;has been blamed for environmental problems in the US&lt;/a&gt;, including water, ground and air pollution and leaks of methane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Centrica will pay £10bn over 20 years for 89bn cubic feet of gas annually – enough to heat 1.8m homes – from Cheniere, one of the first US companies to receive clearance from the federal government to export shale gas in the form of LNG (liquefied natural gas). The first deliveries, by tanker, are expected in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement of the deal comes at a crucial time, as Britain's gas reserves have been severely depleted by the unseasonable cold snap, which has increased demand. Last week, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/21/gas-price-warning-short-supplies" title=""&gt;it emerged that there were only two days' worth of gas left in storage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though there was no immediate danger of a cut-off, because of imports through pipelines connecting to supplies from Russia and Norway, the tightening of supply raised grave concerns. The failure of a key pipeline on Friday morning &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/mar/22/wholesale-gas-prices-soar-after-pipeline-forced-to-close" title=""&gt;caused an immediate doubling of gas prices in the spot market&lt;/a&gt; – though prices fell back later as the problem was resolved, the incident highlighted the vulnerability of the UK to energy shocks, because of the high dependence on gas imports for heating and power generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister, David Cameron, was forced to intervene last week to reassure households that there would be no cut-off. On Monday he said: "I warmly welcome this commercial agreement between Centrica and Cheniere. Future gas supplies from the US will help diversify our energy mix and provide British consumers with a new long-term, secure and affordable source of fuel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, said: "In an increasingly global gas market, this landmark agreement represents a significant step forward in our strategy … helping to ensure the UK's future energy security."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will not make a difference to gas prices or consumer bills in the short term, as the first deliveries are not expected until September 2018 at the earliest, but in the longer term the tanker imports may help to ease any supply crunch, similar to that seen in the last few days. Average household energy bills for gas and electricity are currently about £1,300 a year and set to rise to about £1,400 next year, according to the energy regulator Ofgem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been other deals on US gas imports to the UK in the past two years, including a deal struck by BP and one from British Gas, but they are unlikely to reach the volume of the Centrica deal and may take longer to reach delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, said of current imports: "Emergency gas shipments to maintain Britain's energy security are yet further evidence of our shambolic energy strategy. It makes no sense for the UK to rely increasingly on overseas shipments of ever more expensive gas while ministers sideline the vast potential of homegrown energy from the wind, waves and sun. It's time to pull the plug on our fossil fuel dependency and switch to a 21st century energy policy based on clean power and slashing waste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/12/us-biggest-oil-producer" title=""&gt;Shale gas has brought about a revolution in US energy&lt;/a&gt;, with thousands of wells drilled across the country releasing billions of tonnes of fuel. Gas prices have plummeted as a result, to about $2 a unit, compared with about $10 to $12 in Europe and Japan, but those price falls have not yet affected the international market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because the US has behaved, in the words of the International Energy Agency, as a "gas island". Exports have been restricted, in part by government regulation that has favoured domestic use, and by the lack of infrastructure for converting the gas to liquid and transferring it to tankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if these vast supplies of fossil fuels are burned, they &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/15/shale-gas-freedom-security-trap" title=""&gt;could put global climate change targets of holding warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels out of reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/shale-gas"&gt;Shale gas and fracking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/fossil-fuels"&gt;Fossil fuels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/gas"&gt;Gas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/centrica"&gt;Centrica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/utilities"&gt;Utilities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/fiona-harvey"&gt;Fiona Harvey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The most recent was imposed by O2, which increased monthly mobile bills by 3.2% for up to 7 million people from 28 February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ofcom has prompted an industry row over one of its proposed remedies, which the phone companies claim would require them to notify customers of changes to any "third party" prices such as premium rate numbers, international calls, 118 numbers and other so-called non-geographic numbers beginning with 08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/gc9/summary/condoc.pdf" title="Ofcom: Price rises in fixed term contracts (PDF)"&gt;Ofcom's consultation document (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; sets out several proposals, one of which states that companies would have to "give adequate notice not shorter than one month … to every consumer and small business customer of any price modification".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also proposes that customers would be able to cancel their contract without penalty if their company announces any price increase during their deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its submission to Ofcom, Vodafone, which &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/05/vodafone-fixed-contracts-outrage?INTCMP=SRCH" title="Vodafone's 'fixed' contracts provoke outrage"&gt;increased bills for as many as 10 million customers&lt;/a&gt; by up to £1.55 a month in November 2012, argued that the regulator's plans would have serious unintended consequences for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the company did not object to restrictions on "core" price rises within the fixed terms of a contract, but added that Ofcom had failed to realise there was a fundamental distinction between the prices it controlled, which were included in the headline monthly cost figure, and those which it did not control, which were not included in the monthly price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vodafone said that under the proposals, mobile phone companies would have to send texts to all their customers – including those on pay as you go deals – regardless of whether they had ever used the service whose price was changing. This would result in hundreds of essentially "spam" texts being sent every year to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its submission, Vodafone states: "As written, Ofcom's proposed draft … would require communications providers to 'spam' notify every customer of every change to the price of any service, including clearly inappropriate notifications such as advising children of changes to adult premium rate prices or notifying rate changes for obscure international destinations that a customer had never called." This would include children with "adult content bars" on their devices, Vodafone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such texts would have to provide some detail of what the price change related to, though it is not clear if the name of the service would have to be given or whether a generic form of wording such as "premium rate adult lines" would suffice. The text message would disclose the phone number of the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofcom expects to publish its decision in June. A spokesman for the regulator said: "Ofcom's plans are not for consumers to receive age-inappropriate or large amounts of text messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our proposals are aimed at ensuring consumers are better protected from mid-contract price rises. The consultation has only recently closed and we will consider all responses before publishing our decision this summer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/internetphonesbroadband"&gt;Internet, phones &amp; broadband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/ofcom"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/mobilephones"&gt;Mobile phones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/telecoms"&gt;Telecoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/vodafonegroup"&gt;Vodafone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/telecoms"&gt;Telecommunications industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rupertjones"&gt;Rupert Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Berezovsky had been suffering from depression for several months after a shattering high court defeat last year to his former business partner, Roman Abramovich, and amid mounting debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's former wife, Galina, who owns the house and had allowed him to live there, arrived while a paramedic was on the scene and has told friends that a scarf was found next to his body. Nikolai Glushkov, one of Berezovsky's oldest friends, spoke to her afterwards and said last night: "Boris was strangled. Either he did it himself or with the help of someone. [But] I don't believe it was suicide. This was not just a normal death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glushkov, a former deputy director of Aeroflot, who like Berezovsky fled from Russia to Britain, said Galina emerged from the scene believing Berezovsky may have been murdered. Other friends were also sceptical about suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DCI Kevin Brown, of Thames Valley, police said: "It would be wrong to speculate on the cause of death until the postmortem has been carried out. We do not have any evidence at this stage to suggest third-party involvement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We are at the early stages of the investigation and we are retaining an open mind as we progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staff member who discovered the body and called the emergency services is understood to have been the only other person in the house at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears that Berezovsky was poisoned were raised late on Saturday when police officers trained in handling chemical, biological and radioactive material were called in. Lanes around the gated lakeside property were sealed off to vehicles and pedestrians after a personal electronic dosimeter, a device worn by the paramedic that typically picks up abnormal levels of radiation, was triggered. After specialists gave the property the all-clear on Sunday morning, scene-of-crime officers went in to continue the investigation around Berezovsky's body, which remained in situ. A Home Office pathologist is expected to carry out a postmortem early this week. Berezovsky had reportedly also suffered from heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky's prominence as a critic of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and his repeatedly expressed fear of assassination attempts fuelled speculation that he may have been targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His was the third suspicious death in the past five years to befall a businessman from the former USSR in the affluent crescent of suburbia just beyond the M25 in Surrey and Berkshire. Less than 10 miles from the scene of Berezovsky's death, Russian supergrass Alexander Perepilichnyy died while jogging last year – his death remains unexplained – while 15 miles away, at Downside Manor near Leatherhead, Berezovsky's former business partner Badri Patarkatsishvili died suddenly in 2008, sparking fevered speculation. A pathologist concluded he died of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Berezovsky met his lawyers in London to prepare for his testimony at the inquest into the death in London by radiation poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. An associate at the meeting described him as seeming "quite low" and "not as ebulliant and chipper as usual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said she was too upset to comment on Berezovsky's death. Berezovsky had supported Litvinenko after he fled to Britain. He had accused Putin of orchestrating Litvinenko's murder by polonium in 2006, allegedly carried out by two former KGB agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berezovsky had been suffering from depression after his legal defeat last year by Abramovich, which left him facing legal bills estimated at £100m. Lord Bell, a PR adviser and friend who saw him for lunch in London two weeks ago and spoke to him again by phone more recently, said Berezovsky was "very depressed and very low" after the judge in his case against the Chelsea football club owner ruled he was "dishonest" and "deluded".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was very shocked by the decision in the Abramovich case," added Andrew Stephenson, a lawyer who has represented him for the past 20 years. "To have an English judge say 'I don't believe you' really destroyed his confidence and the platform he had [to campaign against Putin]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said he didn't think it likely Berezovsky would kill himself and said his friend's heart problems would be the most likely cause. "I don't think there's foul play," he said. "I can't see any reason why they [Moscow] would bother. They had managed to destroy him and they would have preferred to see him in misery and they will be rather upset he has escaped it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the months after the Abramovich ruling, Berezovsky holed up in his mansion with his sole remaining bodyguard, having laid off the rest to save money. He often refused to take phone calls and was admitted to the Priory for two days of treatment, friends said. He also spent some time in Israel, where he kept a yacht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently he had started to emerge from his shell, although he remained preoccupied by how to meet debts and losses with many of his assets frozen as a result of Kremlin legal actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said Berezovsky's children were "totally distraught" at the news, saying that a family friend had told him Berezovsky's son, Artem, was "in tears and unable to speak".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• This article was amended on 25 March 2013 to clarify the fact that Berezovsky was discovered by a member of his staff who had not seen his boss for 17 hours, not 11 hours as originally stated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lukeharding"&gt;Luke Harding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

People in remote areas were told it could be days before their electricity is restored as a result of the continuing bad weather, but most of the 1,000 homes that lost their water supplies have been reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people in Cumbria also remain without power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met Office still has yellow weather warnings in place across Wales, central and northern England and southern Scotland, advising of the danger of ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning said: "Lying snow in many areas will melt on roads and pavements by day, refreezing by night to give icy patches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The public should be aware of the potential for disruption to travel due to icy patches and snow blowing back onto roads."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Ratcliffe, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, the weather division for the Press Association, said: "Today the snow will be mainly confined to the east of Scotland and north-east England where there will be a dusting, but nothing significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Elsewhere there will be some snow showers but nothing like the accumulations we've seen over the last few days and it will remain very cold and breezy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Into the week there will be more scattered snow flurries but there is potential for more widespread snow returning at the end of the week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Transport has warned motorists to take precautions and only set off from home if they have checked the latest travel conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman said: "The unseasonal weather is affecting transport networks. Our staff and other transport operators are working tirelessly around the clock to keep roads open and keep other services running."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drivers in Cumbria who were forced to abandon their cars over the weekend have been urged not to go back for them, but to contact police to arrange for their vehicles to be recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday night Cumbria police said the A595 was still closed and weather conditions were still challenging in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 70 people were put up in hotels and at a local high school after heavy snow stranded them in their cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roads in north Wales were still experiencing problems, with access into residential areas a cause for concern, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man found dead in deep snow after he started walking home in severe weather has been named by police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body of Gary Windle, 25, was found by a farmer in Brierfield, near Burnley in Lancashire at about 1.30pm on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lancashire police said his death was not being treated as suspicious and there were indications it was a "very tragic incident" after he started walking home from a night out with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe weather is also thought to have led to the death of a woman in Cornwall on Friday. The woman, named locally as Susan Norman, died when her house in Looe collapsed during a landslip following torrential rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/snow"&gt;Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It sounds like a hyperbolic headline from a buffed-up health magazine; an unattainable promise uttered through Hollywood teeth on late-night satellite TV. Then you attempt Dr Izumi Tabata's training protocol – 20 seconds of all-out effort, 10 seconds of rest, repeat eight times – and between sounding like Darth Vader as you desperately suck in oxygen and collapsing in a messy bundle of sweat and defeat, you realise just how wrong you were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabata has seen it all before. "They were dead!" he chuckles as he recalls the first time he inflicted the system that bears his name on his university students in the early 1990s. "After four minutes' hard exercise they were wiped out. But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. We&amp;nbsp;all were."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research followed extensive monitoring of Japan's speed skating team in the early 1990s when he – along with the team's coach &lt;a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/eng/html/research/areas/feat-researchers/interview/izumi_t.html/" title=""&gt;Irisawa Koichi&lt;/a&gt; – noticed that short bursts of brutally hard exercise seemed to be at&amp;nbsp;least&amp;nbsp;as effective as hours of moderate training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabata set out to show this with a simple experiment. One group of moderately trained students performed an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on a stationary bike five times a week. The other group did a 10-minute warmup on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata intervals, four times a week – plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were startling. After six weeks of testing, the group following Tabata's plan – exercising for just 88 minutes a week – had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max, a key indicator of cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. The control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max, but by 10% – and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the protocol," says Tabata. "And there is also forthcoming research that shows that it lowers the risk of diabetes in humans, something we have already shown in rats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are no half-measures here. You can't go steady on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of Hello! The regimen demands head-down bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints or suchlike. Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? Imagine doing eight of them with only a 10-second break to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All-out effort at 170% of your VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max is the criterion of the protocol," says Tabata. "If you feel OK afterwards&amp;nbsp;you've not done it properly. The first three repetitions will feel easy&amp;nbsp;but the last two will feel impossibly hard. In the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only lasted six or seven."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one commenter on the popular &lt;a href="http://www.t-nation.com/" title=""&gt;exercise forum T-Nation &lt;/a&gt;puts it: "When done correctly you should meet God. Most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldn't even try."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tabata doesn't completely agree. "Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them," he explains. He says that he will soon publish research showing that doing the programme just twice a week, less than half the volume in the original research, still provides significant health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another soon-to-be-published finding, which Tabata describes as "rather significant", shows that the Tabata protocol burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest, due to the effect of excess &lt;a href="http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/exercises/understanding-post-exercise-oxygen-consumption.html" title=""&gt;post-exercise oxygen consumption&lt;/a&gt;. So while it is used by most people to get fit – or by fit people to get even fitter – it also burns fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's slightly surprising, therefore, that the plan is still the preserve of the serious athlete and musclehead crowd – although that may change now that Tabata has agreed a deal with &lt;a href="http://www.universalstudios.com/" title=""&gt;Universal Studios&lt;/a&gt; that will lead to a network of instructors and a DVD range released towards the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I am honoured that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they don't realise the intensity you need to work at," says Tabata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should we all start incorporating this plan into our fitness regimens? Richard Scrivener, a former assistant strength and conditioning coach at Northampton Saints rugby club, says that while the benefits are clear, Tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from skill acquisition and putting in the miles," says Scrivener,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But they could effectively ease off the long runs and reduce the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training. This will unload the skeleton and give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if one is prone to niggles or has a history of injuries – and you would probably therefore get more out of the long runs when you do undertake them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the rest of us can build up session by session, week by week, all the time knowing that it will never get easier because every session calls for maximum effort. That's the dastardly genius of the protocol: it is unrelenting – and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/training-programmes"&gt;Training programmes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/fitness"&gt;Fitness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing"&gt;Health &amp; wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/running"&gt;Running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/seaningle"&gt;Sean Ingle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
