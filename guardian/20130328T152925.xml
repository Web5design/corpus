They were also told they would be deported after serving their sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said the gang had entered the UK as EU citizens with the intention of robbing jewellery shops of large amounts of high-quality gold. Only a fraction of their haul had been recovered from the six raids or attempted raids – leaving the robbers with £1m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pontius said: "None of the defendants appear to have done an honest day's work while they were here. All will be deported, and rightly so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there were fears that an influx of people from Romania and Bulgaria when restrictions are lifted next year would lead to an increase in crime. He warned: "Anyone who comes to the UK, irrespective of whatever part of the world, wanting to commit serious crime must clearly understand such abuse of the hospitality of this country and its people must be seriously punished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It follows that the more grave the crime, the more severe the retribution will be. No one should think for a moment that courts in the UK will be a soft touch. Sentences such as these must be a powerful deterrent not only to homegrown but imported criminals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gang carried out seven raids in six months, emptying display cabinets and fleeing in minutes before police could respond to alarms. They were caught after officers kept watch on a makeshift campsite they were using on waste ground near the A12 in Essex. After being arrested, Ovidiu Gabor, 25, told police: "I don't care, I go to prison to go on holiday."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gang pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Polnay, prosecuting, said: "This was a sophisticated, well-planned conspiracy deliberately targeting jewellers. All the defendants are Romanian. These are all relatively young men who came to this country to rob."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They targeted Asian and Turkish jewellers where there was a large quantity of high-carat gold that could be melted down and sold. The usual plan involved one of the gang, dressed in pinstripes and a trilby, being buzzed in and holding the door for an accomplice to smash his way in with a sledgehammer. The rest of the gang would then run in and smash display cabinets with bats and hammers before fleeing with jewellery. They would make off over railway lines, discarding their weapons and outer clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gang netted more than £1.1m last year but only £135,580 has been recovered. In March last year, £500,000 of goods was taken from a shop in Wembley, north London, which was "trashed". Nothing was recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, part of a £248,648 haul was found in a hole the gang had dug to hide evidence near a shop in Ilford, east London, said Polnay. In August, £341,435 of goods was taken from a shop in East Ham, east London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other attempted robberies were abandoned and the gang were captured after being caught red-handed during a £62,580 robbery in Turnpike Lane, north London, in September. An elderly man was injured when he was struck with a hammer before Flying Squad officers made arrests using Taser guns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/romania"&gt;Romania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/immigration"&gt;Immigration and asylum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Other members of staff have received similar communications from Mr Chapman which have been forwarded to the BBC," Harlequin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Panorama made no attempt to contact Harlequin prior to making serious (yet entirely false) allegations to others about Harlequin's alleged conduct and failed to provide any evidence to support these allegations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harlequin added that it appreciated the BBC's swift reaction to its the complaint and launching an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also published the email it alleges that Chapman sent to Ghent, who is described in an email reply as "global head of security and risk", on 13 March and includes what it claims is "an attempted bribe".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman admits in the email, according to Harlequin, that he is being "a bit cheeky here", before suggesting to Ghent that the company may soon be unable to pay its staff and he may be able to get security work at the BBC. The BBC man then asks Ghent if he can help out with information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's unlikely that [Harlequin chairman David] Ames and maybe Harlequin will be around for much longer, nor will he have the money to pay people for much longer," Chapman is alleged to have said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a long list of creditors already I understand. Panorama and the BBC is always using security and protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way. Or we could work together on stories. Its [sic] always good to keep one eye on the future! How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way? Only the two of us would know of your involvement here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapman allegedly signed off with: "I'm a Bafta award-winning producer so I don't mess about with offers like this – nor would I piss you about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harlequin also expressed concern about the behaviour of the Panorama team in the Caribbean and said it believed many of the allegations made to the BBC came from Padraig O'Halloran and the company's former Wilkins Kennedy accountant, Jeremy Newman. Harlequin is suing O'Halloran for alleged fraudulent misappropriation and has a separate libel action against Newman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC had not responded to a request for comment about the Harlequin statement and allegations at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late on Wednesday the corporation issued the following statement: "In light of information received late in the production process of this film the BBC decided to postpone broadcast. We are currently reviewing the facts. As a result a member of the team has been suspended and a disciplinary procedure is under way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

What exactly keeps them going?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a band that has sold more than 100m albums and had dozens of top 40 hits, Depeche Mode rarely trouble the tabloids. But last November songwriter Martin Gore caused a minor fuss when he jokingly told Music Week: "I think somebody should shoot Simon Cowell." The grand poobah of primetime karaoke took great exception to this. "Why I am angry about weirdo Gore is a ton of people have got shot this year and people like weirdo Gore encourage this," &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SimonCowell/status/272990872382087168"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; from his fainting couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suggest to Gore that this wasn't quite the crushing riposte Cowell thought it was. "Absolutely," he hoots. "I don't think I've ever tried to be anything other than a weirdo. That's the sad thing today. Most people who get involved in music are so normal. It's supposed to be full of weirdos."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depeche Mode formed in 1980 during a golden age of weirdos, made possible by punk rock and cheap synthesizers. But as the 80s wore on, most of them grew either less weird or less successful. Only Depeche Mode and the Cure evolved into cult megastars with a fervent fanbase stretching from Monterey to Moscow. Depeche Mode's evolution from gauche synth-poppers to brooding electro-rock giants (their songs have been covered by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQcNiD0Z3MU"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vte4HUoRDSI"&gt;the Saturdays&lt;/a&gt;) was unforeseeable, unrepeatable and inexplicable even to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're pessimists. We're always unsure," says Gore, his Cheshire-Cat grin at odds with his Eeyoreish tone. "We've been saying since Black Celebration [1986] that we can't guarantee there'll be another record. When it comes to communication we're still not the best. We're still slightly dysfunctional but maybe that's what makes us tick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gore lives in Santa Barbara, frontman Dave Gahan in New York and keyboardist Andy Fletcher (aka the Sensible One) in London. Today they have converged on Berlin, where the grandeur of the Hotel du Rome, its high-ceilinged corridors thronged with journalists and TV crews, affirms that Depeche Mode aren't in any danger of downsizing. Their 13th album, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2013/mar/21/depeche-mode-delta-machine-review"&gt;Delta Machine&lt;/a&gt;, is their most vigorous and urgent in years and yet another world tour is almost sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside, Berlin is solemn with snow. "We've made records here when it's been like this," Gahan says fondly, peering out of the window of an enormous drawing room adjacent to Gore's. Despite myriad health issues during the last Depeche Mode tour, he's fizzing with energy, holding forth in an accent that's one part Manhattan to four parts Basildon. His earliest ambition, he says, was simply to get out of Essex. "We started very young, and thank God, because I'd probably be digging ditches in Basildon right now. We dug our way out of that town."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 17 he was a hard-core David Bowie fan who earned his place in Depeche Mode with a rendition of Heroes; now, he says with some amazement, his children attend the same school as his idol's and they see each other at school plays. They met properly a few years ago when Gahan was summoned backstage after a Bowie concert in New York. "I sheepishly looked at him and he said: 'I know you.'" Gahan mimics a knowing grin. "I think it was more than a reference to music. It was something to do with our personalities – constantly trying to find something outside of yourself so you can be yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Bowie, Gahan didn't christen his rock star alter ego but he certainly developed one after the staggering success of 1990's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/apr/14/popandrock.shopping"&gt;Violator&lt;/a&gt;. Relocated to Los Angeles, he arrived at sessions for 1993's torturous Songs of Faith of Devotion looking like a Russell Brand impersonation of an expat hellraiser, all hair, tattoos and trackmarks. Initially concealed from his bandmates, his burgeoning heroin habit became unignorable during a nightmarishly long tour and culminated in a near-fatal overdose in 1996. At this remove the gory details no longer interest him, but the psychology does – how he ended up acting out Gore's songs of sin, guilt and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Martin's words were like an internal dialogue that helped me to recognise myself, to the point where I lost myself in the character within the songs," says Gahan. "That whole redemption thing, the collapsing and rising out of the ashes: we will be saved. But I wasn't getting saved. I was drowning." He laughs. "I got the first bit but not the second!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gahan's public unravelling gave the impression that the quieter Gore had been drawing lyrical inspiration from his bandmate's life, but Gore denies this with a twinge of embarrassment. "I had a lot of things to feel guilty about. I was a horrible alcoholic for years. I knew at quite a young age that I had an issue with drinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet his problems attracted far less attention than Gahan's. "Well, it's accepted, isn't it? More than accepted, it's encouraged for rock stars to be out of control. It's funny for people if they see their idols completely drunk, singing in hotel bars. It's fun. And, up to a point, it is, and then you cross a line and it's not so much fun any more. When you're waking up to two double vodkas for breakfast it's gone beyond the point of fun." He laughs so often as he says this that I can't tell if he finds the memory perversely comical or mortifyingly uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's proud that he never missed a show ("probably trying to appear normal when you're not") but his drinking worsened while making 2005's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/oct/16/popandrock.shopping"&gt;Playing the Angel&lt;/a&gt; in the midst of a divorce. "He'd just become stupid," remembers Gahan. "When Martin came in the studio we knew we had a few hours: he's a little drunk right now, he's going to get drunker. [Producer] Ben Hillier put a guitar around his neck and ran around getting as much out of him as he could."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, equilibrium was finally restored. Gore sobered up while Gahan, after initially broaching the subject in "a very fucked up way", established himself as a songwriter as well as a singer. The most recent threat to Depeche Mode's existence was, for once, not a self-inflicted wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2009, during the tour for their &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/19/depeche-mode-review"&gt;Sounds of the Universe&lt;/a&gt; album, a tumour was discovered in Gahan's bladder and he flew home for treatment. "For a while there I almost turned to my manager and said I'm not coming back," he admits. "I spent a lot of time with my wife and kids. It was beautiful in New York, the blossom was on the trees, everything seemed a little brighter. It was similar to the feeling of waking up after a week or two in rehab. You notice shit. I was noticing a lot of stuff that I liked in my life and I was afraid to leave it in case I didn't get the chance to come back to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fear passed and Gahan convinced his oncologist to let him resume the tour, arranging treatment en route. "It was an uphill battle. I had numerous sicknesses, I lost my voice a lot, I blew out my calf on stage. I felt like I was always repairing something. It was the first tour I felt like: I can't do this any more. This is fucking hard." But, he says after a rare pause, "I was very lucky. The cancer hadn't spread through the walls of my bladder so all the chemo was localised. It still made me sick but I didn't lose all my hair. I think my denial about what was really going on in my life was firmly in place, as usual, but it was quite useful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carried this far by fruitful amounts of denial and dysfunction, both men describe making Delta Machine as an unusually "joyous" experience. "I don't know if people expect us to be gloomy bastards but we have a lot of fun in the studio," insists Gore. "We're actually starting to feel quietly optimistic about this record." He grins, struck by a novel proposition. "I think, after 33 years, we should stop worrying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/depeche-mode"&gt;Depeche Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/electronicmusic"&gt;Electronic music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dorianlynskey"&gt;Dorian Lynskey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

They came to you. You did not approach them but there is more than one kind of predator. Some predators hunt down their victims, others lie in wait for them. Your victims in this case were all desperate people and people who, because of their desperation, were vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also noted that, while this case is about money, "it is also about something different and great – it is about the real distress you caused to so many people".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You had no regard for them nor for their anguish," he said. "Your only concern was to line your own pockets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

There had been a running war between the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, and Hayes over renewable energy policy, especially on windfarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new permanent secretary may have realised that the department was becoming dysfunctional, and those in the energy business said it was increasingly difficult to understand the direction of government policy, including on subsidies, prices and targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon is a free marketeer and no supporter of green energy subsidies, but he has the ability to get on with a range of ministers and is generally seen as one of the most effective ministers of state. He is regularly deployed to act as a general party spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes is said to be close to the mood in the Commons tearoom and is likely to make sure that Cameron gets to hear messages from disgruntled backbenchers on time. There is a cadre of Tory backbenchers who feel dispossessed and increasingly fearful that Cameron is not a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations between Davey and Hayes deteriorated so badly at one point that Davey disclosed to the Guardian that he asked the prime minister to remove responsibility for green energy from Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote to Cameron warning him that if Hayes continued in the role they would be open to legal challenge over any decision he made on the subject, since his views were so prejudiced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey sought legal advice from his department, which confirmed that Hayes's presence increased the danger of the department's decisions on renewable energy being exposed to judicial review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey's private secretary sent the formal warning to the prime minister's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey told the Guardian he feared even an unsuccessful legal challenge could be disruptive at a time when the government was trying to create certainty for energy investors. Davey had wanted to remove Hayes from all responsibility for renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister rejected the warning and refused to remove Hayes from his post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that Hayes's move will allow the prime minister to improve relations within the coalition and shore up his position within his own party. Hayes would be one of the first to know if any serious plot was under way to unseat Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon will retain his job at the business department, renewing the idea that it should take a direct interest in energy. At one point the bulk of energy issues were kept inside the business or trade departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes will keep his ministerial salary and be elevated to the privy council, in two concessions designed to soothe his disappointment. He will be based in the Cabinet Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fallon has a track record of supporting green energy in less difficult economic times. He brought forward a green energy private member's bill in 2008 that would have allowed councils to set targets for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are bound to be questions over Hayes being paid a ministerial salary at the taxpayer's expense to carry out what is clearly a party political job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes had difficulties with others in the energy department besides Davey. The other energy minister, Greg Barker, also a Tory, was at odds with Hayes over policy, suggesting the decision to bring him into the department to replace the highly regarded Charles Hendry was misconceived. Davey fought a constant battle to ringfence Hayes's work and limit the scope of his portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barker defended renewable energy only this week, condemning Daily Mail "hysteria" over the impact of renewables on energy prices. He told Sky News: "The average family fuel bill is just under £1,300. The cost of windmills is £9 – £9 for onshore wind currently and about another £9 to support the expansion of offshore wind. Now, that figure is going to rise through to 2020, yes, but let's have a little bit of perspective and not Daily Mail hysteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministerial change comes at a bad time for the department, as it battles with energy shortages, doubts over new nuclear power stations and an energy bill that still awaits passage through parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government hopes the changes will help to join up work on low-carbon industries such as nuclear and offshore wind and the supply chain. A full outline of changes to ministerial portfolios will be confirmed in due course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davey said: "John and I have worked well together as an effective team, and I'm especially grateful for his work on steering the energy bill through parliament. I wish him well in his new post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am delighted to welcome Michael Fallon to DECC. He brings with him a wealth of business experience and will make an excellent addition to the team."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberal-conservative-coalition"&gt;Liberal-Conservative coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/windpower"&gt;Wind power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy"&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/energy-industry"&gt;Energy industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-politics"&gt;Green politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ed-davey"&gt;Ed Davey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Table emerges after ministers deny existence of targets for sanctioning benefit claimants over jobseeking efforts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/interactive/2013/mar/28/jobcentre-sanctions-scorecard-full-table" title=""&gt;See the scorecard here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department for Work and Pensions produces a national sanctions "scorecard" that contains precise information about how jobcentre districts are performing on stopping people's benefits, it has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scorecard for January 2013 was sent to the Guardian after ministers and senior management denied that its information collection could be described as a "league table".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It breaks down the sanctions performance by district, and includes a column headed "direction of travel", with red and green arrows showing whether a district is up or down on the previous month's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DWP ministers have acknowledged that they collect this data, but on Monday night Lord Freud told peers this was purely in order to "correct the anomalies".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A leaked email from the Walthamstow jobcentre in north London, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/21/jobcentre-set-targets-benefit-sanctions" title=""&gt;reported last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, appears to suggest the scorecard can be further broken down into individual jobcentres, but no clear evidence of this has yet been seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The email described Walthamstow as being "95th in the league table", with the manager telling his team that they had to improve their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior Jobcentre Plus manager Neil Couling made clear &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/25/jobcentre-boss-targets-sanctions-jobseekers" title=""&gt;in a letter to staff last Friday&lt;/a&gt; that this information did not constitute league tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are quite keen to avoid any misunderstandings that there are targets attached to these," he told the Commons public accounts committee last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the mounting documentary evidence and reports from staff suggest that on the ground these scorecards result in targets and pressure on staff who are not meeting apparently expected levels of sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous jobseekers who have had their benefits stopped for weeks or months after being told they are not doing enough to find work have &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/mar/22/jobseekers-story-benefit-sanctions" title=""&gt;told of the hardship&lt;/a&gt; of being penalised and have disputed the fairness of the sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the scorecard are revealing. They indicate that in January alone more than 85,000 sanctions were applied or upheld against claimants, and that most districts were down on the previous month's performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet shows detailed further information on sanctions: 24,000 of these "adverse decisions" came from referrals by work programme providers. Almost 1,400 decisions were made against recipients of employment and support allowance (sickness benefit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures include referrals to mandatory work activity (MWA), with 1,442 claimants sent to work for their benefit during January. Arrows show almost all districts were increasing the numbers of people they sent to MWA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of many jobcentre advisers to contact the Guardian in recent days has given a full explanation of the atmosphere and rules inside jobcentres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said: "There is officially no target to achieve referrals to DMA [decision-making and appeals] officers, but in Greater Manchester central and Cheshire district the target we don't have is 6% of our live load. Furthermore, despite not having a target to achieve these figures, all but two jobcentres within the district have had office-wide PIPs [performance improvement plans] imposed by the district manager specifically focused on increasing DMA referrals to increase 'off-flow' – the term used to mean ceasing to claim jobseeker's allowance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Across the north-west region the story is similar, with Greater Manchester east and west district having similar targets, now referred to as benchmarks, imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whilst my work colleagues and I fully understand and support the need for sanctions to be applied to those claimants who are not actively seeking employment, who become unemployed voluntarily, who refuse reasonable offers of employment and those who fail to participate in courses, schemes and provision to help them into employment, the reality is that when targets are imposed, the focus shifts not to those abusing the benefits system but to the most vulnerable and easy-to-hit claimants, those with language barriers, caring responsibilities and those moving from other benefits having been found capable of working."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued: "Such is the focus on off-flow, the pressure to meet the targets creates perverse behaviours … but sadly is in no way reducing unemployment. To illustrate, a claimant who receives a four-week sanction for failing to show proof of actively seeking employment may then fail to attend the jobcentre to sign for their benefit, as no there is no financial benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After the sanction is served, they will make a fresh claim to jobseeker's allowance. The office in question will claim the off-flow, and the statistics look favourable. However, the cost of making a fresh claim to benefit in real terms is around £500 and is therefore [a] false economy at its worst in order to try to climb up the league table – which, despite all assurances, do exist within clusters, districts and regions for all departmental targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Simply put, the targets imposed for sanctions is a way for district managers to fudge figures in order that they are seen to be doing their jobs, whereas the government continues to stress that the off-flow should always be into sustainable employment and is being kept in the dark about the reality. All advisers at my place of work and most in the district have been given mid-year review statements (on which performance-related pay is based) which include a target to achieve 6% DMA referrals, although again this has been widely denied."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second adviser to contact the Guardian said he worked in a medium-sized jobcentre in the north-east of England, and said he was appalled at the attitude of management towards sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have been an adviser for many years and have always prided myself on the help I have given claimants, whilst still testing their conditionality and ensuring they were aware of their responsibilities. Now, however, the emphasis seems to be about persecuting claimants and all advisers are being pressured into referring claimants to the decision-makers in the hope that people will sign off and contribute to the off-flow target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At my last review I was told in no uncertain terms that I needed to start identifying more people to refer for sanctioning and, as my next review looms, I feel under pressure now to start picking on people, otherwise I will be put on a performance improvement plan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/benefits"&gt;Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/job-hunting"&gt;Job hunting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/work-and-careers"&gt;Work &amp; careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johndomokos"&gt;John Domokos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

I'm an innocent man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the judge told him: "Keep quiet!" and continued his sentencing remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In effect you have executed your own parents," he told Seddon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One can only imagine the horror of your parents' last moments in this life, when they realised what a monster their son, whom they loved, had become. Mercifully their deaths were swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason for the attempted murders and the murders was greed. You needed money. You had lost your job. You had a mortgage. You had a family to support. You had some grand plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite the fact that your parents had always been very generous in supporting you, you wanted more and you wanted it now – hence the plan to kill them and get your inheritance up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The attempt at murder having failed, you decided on a more ruthless and definitive method of killing. You obtained a sawn-off shotgun from criminal associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Greek mythology, someone who killed a parent would be pursued until death by the Furies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Throughout time it has been recognised as a terrible and unnatural crime. You have killed not one parent but both of them. You have done so for gain. You have done so having first tried unsuccessfully to kill them by other means. You have done so by the barbaric act of shooting them at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside court, Detective Superintendent Denise Worth, from Greater Manchester police (GMP), said: "I actually find it difficult to put into words – someone who could kill and murder their own parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is hard to describe somebody prepared to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He portrayed himself as a devoted and loving son and told lie after lie after lie. He's just an evil, wicked man who did it all for greed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC Bryn Jones, the family liaison officer, read out a statement on behalf of the Seddon family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It read: "The past nine months have been a very sad and emotional time for our family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The shock of having both Pat and Bob taken from us in such horrifying and tragic circumstances has left us feeling numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pat and Bob were a kind, loving and selfless couple who will be missed by their family, friends and especially their grandson Daniel, who they cared for with great love and affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would like to now be left in peace to mourn the deaths of Pat and Bob and be allowed to remember them as the loving couple that they were."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gun-crime"&gt;Gun crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found in a report published on Thursday that he had a case to answer for "discreditable conduct and abuse of authority", breaches which would justify dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solicitors for Bettison questioned the fairness of the IPCC investigation and said he had himself wished to be investigated by the watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPCC concluded that Bettison had attempted to influence his police authority when it was considering referring him to the police watchdog over his alleged part in a "black propaganda" campaign in the aftermath of the football stadium disaster that killed 96 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report indicates Bettison wanted to make himself look good by taking control of the process. "At issue was his professed desire that he refer himself to the IPCC," it says, "whether it was appropriate for him to try to do this and how he attempted to make it happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bettison, the IPCC found, did not attempt to stop the referral happening, but the contact he made with Fraser Sampson, the chief executive of West Yorkshire police authority, and Mark Burns-Williamson, its chair, were attempts to influence and manipulate their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report says Bettison's account of what happened contrasted with that of the chief executive of the authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By his own account Sir Norman was anxious for the complaints against him to be referred to the IPCC, but the evidence demonstrates that he wanted to control the process," the IPCC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the content of the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report which implied that he may have been involved in manipulating the facts and supplying misinformation to the media, parliament and the public following the Hillsborough disaster, the evidence suggesting that he has attempted to manipulate public messages can only be damaging to his reputation. It is concerning that his first thoughts appear to have been to protect his own position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bettison – who retired last October – was, when the report came out, the most senior serving officer to have been involved in the Hillsborough disaster. He is still the subject of a more substantial IPCC investigation into allegations that he played a role in a propaganda campaign in the aftermath of the disaster that involved South Yorkshire police – the force at the centre of the Hillsborough disaster cover-up – attempting to smear the fans and to put itself in a positive light. Bettison was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire police at the time of the 1989 disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IPCC published its findings on Bettison because he will not face a disciplinary hearing as he is no longer serving. The watchdog said it had published to let "the public judge".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass, said: "His attempts to manipulate and manage the perception of the referral of complaints about him, for his own self-interest, is particularly concerning. It is also conduct that falls far short of what should be expected of a chief constable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was the IPCC's view at the start of the investigation, as it was the view of his police authority, that Sir Norman's actions, if proven, fell so far short of what is expected of a chief constable that dismissal would be justified. The evidence uncovered during the investigation supports that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we cannot bring this case to misconduct proceedings, we can publish the evidence so that the public can judge for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case should also serve as a salutary reminder to chief officers everywhere of how much public confidence is damaged when the conduct of leaders is called into question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bettison's solicitor John Harding said: "The IPCC has recognised that my client, Sir Norman Bettison, did himself wish to be investigated by the IPCC in connection with allegations made in respect of Hillsborough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He remains keen to see that the investigation into the substantive matters is progressed as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The IPCC has decided that it considers my client acted improperly in seeking approval from the police authority to refer himself to the IPCC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision that there is a case to answer is not a finding of guilt. This point is accepted, explicitly, in the foreword of the IPCC report and it therefore sits, uncomfortably, with some of the comments in the investigator's report, made after an incomplete investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sir Norman voluntarily attended interview, provided a written statement and invited the IPCC to interview witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since there can be no formal misconduct hearing, my client is denied the opportunity to call those witnesses, which the IPCC declined to interview, and is denied the opportunity to put his case and challenge other evidence, which calls into question the fairness of such a process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/norman-bettison"&gt;Norman Bettison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/hillsborough-disaster"&gt;Hillsborough disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ipcc"&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/liverpool"&gt;Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sandralaville"&gt;Sandra Laville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He has said he was shocked when officers suddenly turned on him, and believes he was targeted because of his skin colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan police investigated Kennedy-Macfoy's complaint internally, with supervision from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Its conclusions about the incident, contained in a report compiled by the force's complaints department, was handed over to the IPCC this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the IPCC revealed it had rejected those findings and ordered a new and fully independent inquiry. It is believed to be the first time in the history of the IPCC that a decision has been taken to wholly reject the conclusions of an internal police report and initiated a fresh investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After all these months I am still waiting to see if any officers will be prosecuted for what happened to me," Kennedy-Macfoy said. "I hope the IPCC will conduct a thorough investigation. Its failure to take this step at the outset means that it has a lot of work to do to restore my faith in this process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy-Macfoy was driving through Harrow at 3.30am on 4 September 2011 when he saw a young man hurl a missile at a police van. After noting a description of the young man, Kennedy-Macfoy – who also trained as a police constable – flagged down the van driver and approached a line of officers to pass on the information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was wearing a three-piece pinstriped suit and driving a white Audi when he encountered the police, who were forming a roadblock. He alleges that officers suddenly turned on him, hurling abuse, charging at his car and grabbing him "viciously" through the windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he was dragged from the car and in the ensuing melee the officers repeatedly encircled him and shouted profanities. Kennedy-Macfoy said he replied calmly and showed his palms to the officers, telling them: "Listen guys, I haven't done anything wrong. I'm a firefighter – I work with you lot and I just want to explain something. I've showed no aggression toward any of you." He was eventually shot with a Taser stun gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy-Macfoy was found not guilty in February last year of obstructing police. During a two-day trial at Brent magistrates court, the police officer who discharged the weapon conceded he did not warn Kennedy-Macfoy that he was about to be shot – an apparent contravention of Home Office guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another officer present on the night, Inspector David Bergum, said his officers had been in a "stressful" situation, dealing with a group of partygoers who were throwing missiles at them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said of Kennedy-Macfoy: "I couldn't say he was anything to do with the party. The party was all black. He was black. He had driven through the cordon. I had to do a quick risk assessment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April last year &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/19/metropolitan-police-accused-racism-firefighter?INTCMP=SRCH" title=""&gt;the Guardian revealed&lt;/a&gt; how the case was being treated as a potentially racially motivated incident after details of the inspector's comments in court were sent to the Met police. The case was then referred to the IPCC, which announced it would supervise the investigation, deciding against conducting a full, independent inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing that decision on Thursday, the IPCC commissioner Jennifer Izekor said the watchdog would thoroughly review the evidence already obtained and "conduct further inquiries" as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to be satisfied that Mr Kennedy-Macfoy's serious allegations have been comprehensively examined," she said. "We have informed Mr Kennedy-Macfoy's solicitors that our independent investigation is under way and will be conducted as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy-Macfoy, who was once set to become a police officer but left the Hendon police training academy after his mother became ill with cancer in 2005, has said he hopes his complaint will make police think twice before stereotyping black men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the firefighter worked alongside police "almost every day" for six years, and has a number of close friends in the police, he said he had struggled to return to work since the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Shamik Dutta, of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, said: "This is a vote of no confidence by the IPCC in the Met's ability to investigate its own officers. Although we have not been shown the Met's internal findings, the fact the IPCC has taken the highly unusual step of independently investigating the case at this late stage speaks volumes about the standard of the police's own initial inquiry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/metropolitan-police"&gt;Metropolitan police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/police"&gt;Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/ipcc"&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/race"&gt;Race issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paullewis"&gt;Paul Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He must provide authorities with his travel plans at least a week before he leaves the country, and must return his passport to the court within 24 hours of returning to South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyer Barry Roux said Pistorius had no desire to return to the track now, but "this might and this will change".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistorius claims he killed Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house. Prosecutors say he shot the model and reality TV star intentionally after they argued, and they have charged him with premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistorius was not required to attend his appeal hearing and neither he nor any of his family members were present at North Gauteng high court in Pretoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/reeva-steenkamp-shooting"&gt;Reeva Steenkamp shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/oscar-pistorius"&gt;Oscar Pistorius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Pier Carlo Padoan, deputy secretary general and chief economist of the OECD, said: "The situation [in the UK] is still fragile. I think the policy course, both in terms of monetary and fiscal policy, is going in the right direction and improvements are beginning to be seen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view was reinforced by a survey of the UK's services industry that showed it improved in January, offsetting a weakening picture in the construction and manufacturing sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office for National Statistics said services, which account for three-quarters of economic activity, expanded by 0.3% on the previous month and 0.8% ahead of the same month a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for ministers hoping to see an improvement in private sector businesses, the strongest element of the services index in recent years has proved to be government spending. The financial services sector has almost recovered to its pre-recession peak, leaving the distribution, hotels and restaurants, and transport, storage and communication sectors well below their pre-recession high watermark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Williamson, chief economist of financial data provider Markit, said services data combined with strong retail sales would persuade the Bank of England to stay its hand when it meets next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OECD said economic activity was picking up in many major economies. It expected the US to rebound in the first three months of this year, while Japan has been boosted by a new growth strategy and stimulus package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it said improvements in financial markets around the globe had not been fully reflected in real economic activity, in part because confidence remained low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Padoan warned that the flood of cheap money into the system, via generous stimulus packages, had also led to some "excessive risk-taking".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have now learned that imbalances build up in a way we tend to ignore," he said. "Let's watch prices of assets going up which are not warranted by fundamentals. Let's be very careful. At the same time, let's be careful of not putting a brake on the recovery that is slowly materialising. It's a delicate balancing act." In its interim assessment of the global economic outlook, the OECD said a meaningful recovery in Europe would take longer than in the rest of the G7. It blamed this on a deteriorating jobs market, which had depressed consumer confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Especially in Europe, the rise of long-term unemployment, with more of the unemployed moving off unemployment insurance on to less generous social benefits, is worsening poverty and inequality," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinktank also highlighted the growing divergence between Germany, which it expects to pick up strongly in the first half of this year, and other economies, which are forecast to either contract or show minimal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany is expected to grow by 2.3% on a yearly basis in the first quarter, and then 2.6% in the second. By contrast, France is forecast to shrink by 0.6% on a yearly basis in the first quarter, followed by 0.5% annualised growth in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in emerging markets is still much faster than in the G7 and these countries will drive the global economy this year. The OECD said annualised growth in China was expected to continue to be well above 8% in the first half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economicgrowth"&gt;Economic growth (GDP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/oecd"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/global-economy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephine-moulds"&gt;Josephine Moulds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phillipinman"&gt;Phillip Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sorry, I meant to say 'Merry Christmas'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its ruling the ASA said it was banning the ad under harm and offence rules in the advertising code, on the grounds that it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a submission to the ASA Amazon said that it should not have been banned because "the card was not offensive, aggressive or lewd in its message. It was meant as a bit of light-hearted, irreverent fun".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that the wording of the card "did not target any particular group, nor was it likely to cause offence to any particular race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nicola Mendelsohn, chairman of ad agency Karmarama and one of the most senior women in UK advertising, said she was stunned at Amazon's attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is one of the most vulgar, dreadful words and I'm really surprised that Amazon don't think it is offensive to people, to women," she said. "Germaine Greer said it is one of the few remaining words in the English language with the genuine power to shock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that just because a "small minority" might find the word offensive the product should not be banned from being made available for the "wider public" to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The humour might not be to everybody's taste [but] the subjective values of a small minority who might find it distasteful should not dictate a product's availability or the method of its advertisement to the wider public," the company said in its submission to the ASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon also queried whether the ASA should be ruling on the card at all, as it was a product not an ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ASA said that the product listing was an advertisement and therefore it was "entirely appropriate" to investigate the complaint that it was inappropriate and offensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smellyourmum.com, the company behind the card and the ad, said that as the BBC had broadcast a documentary devoted to the word it was acceptable for the company to use it in its advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company added that the documentary, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jan/12/broadcasting.bbc" title=""&gt;The History of the C-Word&lt;/a&gt;, broadcast on BBC3 in 2007, used the word repeatedly and reached a bigger audience than its ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SYM said that because the word was used with a "positive qualifier" – Merry Christmas – it "could convey a positive sense of the person or object referred to".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the ASA said that consumer research showed that the use of the word was "so likely to offend it should not be used at all in marketing communications even when it was relevant to the name of the product".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

But high street banks were not inundated as they reopened, despite the fact that wealthy savers could face losses of at least 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra security has been drafted in from G4S to manage any trouble, and some banks are limiting the number of people allowed in each branch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to cash my salary," said Christina Andreou, wielding a cheque for €1,300 at a Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no point being anything but patient. Fighting is going to get us nowhere," said Dinos Volides. "Everyone in the bank is trying to be as helpful as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the people turning up at branches were older customers who do not have bank cards and need to withdraw cash for daily expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At other branches, bank staff asked for calm from customers, saying they too were "victims of the actions and or failures that caused this catastrophe." Employees of Laiki, the country's second largest bank, are likely to lose their jobs when its toxic assets and large deposits are placed in a 'bad bank' and run down, with smaller deposits transferred to the Bank of Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The population remains deep in shock, with one Cypriot describing the crisis like the sudden death of a loved one. "We're feeling the same sort of emptiness," said Afrodite Elisaou, a doctor whose husband works at Laiki and still has no idea whether he will have a job tomorrow. "It's the shock of it happening overnight, of going to sleep thinking you have a job and waking up not having one. Had all this happened to us gradually, and not in a day, it would have been much better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the capital controls, cash withdrawals will be limited to €300 a day, although in recent days banks have restricted withdrawals to €100 per customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yiangos Demetriou, the head of internal audit at the island's central bank, told the Cypriot state broadcaster that a limit of €5,000 would be set on the use of credit cards abroad and said the measures would be imposed for just four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone leaving the country will be unable to carry more than €1,000 in banknotes, while families with members studying abroad will not be able to send more than €5,000 a quarter, plus tuition fees, to their relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time a member of the single currency has faced such emergency measures to keep cash within its borders since the euro was launched in 1999. "The rationale is that these measures will be reviewed on a daily basis, so if there is the possibility of relaxing them we will," Demetriou said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Lyddon, the general secretary of IBOS, an international banking association, described the controls as "more reminiscent of Latin America or Africa". "These are permanent controls until the economy recovers," said Lyddon, casting doubt on any suggestion the capital controls could be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cypriot financial sector has exploded in size to eight times the size of its €17bn economy, inflated by deposits from wealthy foreigners. Much now hinges on the reaction of Russians who have made huge deposits in Cyprus in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, New York's powerful financial services industry has already benefited from a silent Cyprus bank run. "This past year, we've been seeing a shift in investments in the United States as a result of the financial state of the European Union," said Ed Mermelstein, a New York real estate lawyer who advises wealthy Russians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks in Cyprus were closed 12 days ago shortly before president Nicos Anastasiades announced the terms of its bailout, which included skimming all savers to raise €5.8bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terms have since been altered to ensure that those with less than €100,000 in their accounts are not forced to take a cut, in a move that the European authorities hope will restore faith in the bank guarantee scheme across the 27 EU nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the bailout with the EU, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund – known as the troika – Laiki will be closed down, while the nation's biggest bank, the Bank of Cyprus, faces a major restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depositors with more than €100,000 in their accounts, the level at which savings are guaranteed across Europe, face a levy to raise billions of euros towards the bailout. According to some estimates, this could be between 40% and 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Britain, the government has been working on ways to keep Laiki's four branches being drawn into the Cypriot bailout, but there was little indication on Wednesday night that a solution had been found for the 13,000 customers potentially affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Pavlou, the former vice-chairman of Laiki, told Channel 4 News that Anastasiades was given little option by the troika but to accept the draconian terms, which force savers to take a hit for the first time in the fifth bailout of a eurozone country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pavlou said: "It's not very nice actually, to see two or three people half your age, clever people, coming over there and shaking their hands at the president and saying: 'You have to do this, otherwise we bring you down.' It is very painful for someone who's just been elected to actually face that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meltdown of the Cypriot financial system came as no surprise to well-connected, wealthy Russians, who bundled some of their money to the US. "Many of our clients had a heads-up on this issue," said Mermelstein. "Cyprus had started having the conversations about what it was intending, and that's been going on for half a year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michalis Sarris, the Cypriot finance minister, has admitted that Cypriot banks were suffering "substantial outflows" for weeks before the meltdown, indicating that Russians were already anticipating the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to investment bankers, lawyers and wealth advisers in the US, Russians have been seeking property developments in the US over the past year. Lawyers and advisers have been making construction loans and sinking money into the concrete foundations of the big real estate developments in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, Mermelstein said, a Russian client took several million dollars from a Cyprus account and made a loan to a commercial project in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Cyprus announced an overnight bank raid into the deposits of rich customers, Mermelstein said his client "was happy the loan came out of Cyprus and doesn't have to go back any time soon". Such investments, ranging in size from $5m to $25m, have "gone up substantially", the real estate lawyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ink on the Cypriot bailout barely dry, the focus was turning to which countries might face the same fate, following Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Howat, European economist at Capital Economics, said: "Cyprus has shown that even the smallest members of the eurozone can rock the single currency area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Slovenia is probably the next country most likely to be forced into a bailout programme, but Malta and Luxembourg are also vulnerable given the size of their banking sectors relative to their economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is already evidence of market stress in Slovenia, with government bond yields rising from 4.5% to 6.5% over the last two weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, tried to limit fears of contagion, saying Cyprus was a very special case and the EU had found the right solution for it. He said Luxembourg had a completely different business model to Cyprus and any comparison of the two would be absurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts at Fathom Research said that the relief surrounding the Cyprus deal would be temporary. "The relief is misplaced and will be shortlived, since the 'doom-loop' undermining the euro, between insolvent banks and their indebted sovereigns, has not been broken but emphatically reaffirmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/debt-crisis"&gt;Eurozone crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/cyprus"&gt;Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/europeanbanks"&gt;European banks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/eu"&gt;European Union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jilltreanor"&gt;Jill Treanor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenasmith"&gt;Helena Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephine-moulds"&gt;Josephine Moulds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The court's usual swing vote on social issues, Justice Anthony Kennedy, aligned with the four liberal judges to strongly question the legitimacy of the law and the authority of the federal government to impose a definition of marriage as only between a man and a woman on those US states which permit same-sex unions. The law prevents same-sex spouses from receiving federal benefits, tax breaks and some legal protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/mar/27/supreme-court-gay-marriage-doma-live"&gt;Kennedy bolstered the expectations of Doma's opponents&lt;/a&gt; by emphasising his concerns that the law intrudes on the rights of individual states to recognise gay marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it has 1,100 laws, which in our society means that the federal government is intertwined with [its] citizens' day-to-day lives, you are at real risk of running in conflict with what has always been thought to be the essence of the state police power, which is to regulate marriage, divorce and custody," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge to Doma was brought by Edith Windsor, who was married to Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. The couple lived in New York, where their marriage was recognised by the state government. But when Spyer died in 2009, the federal government invoked Doma to force Windsor, who is now 83 and in poor health, to pay $363,000 in taxes on her late wife's estate – a charge she would have been exempt from had she been married to a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liberal justices at times found themselves in the unusual position of backing Kennedy's emphasis on states' rights – a position usually defended by the court's conservatives – as they painted Doma as unreasonably discriminating against legally married same-sex couples. Nine states and Washington DC recognise gay weddings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really diminishes what states have said about marriage," said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dismissed descriptions of Doma as merely having an administrative impact, saying it "affects every area of life" for gay couples, and creates "two kinds of marriage".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The full marriage, and then this sort of skim-milk marriage," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Elena Kagan questioned the motivation for the law, saying Congress passed it in a climate of "animus" and "dislike" of homosexuals, and of "moral judgement".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Stephen Breyer asked why it is necessary to single out gay people as subject to a law barring them from equal treatment. He called the discrimination "irrational" in law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's statements had opponents of Doma predicting he will ally himself with the liberal justices to strike down the law. But even if it is ruled unconstitutional, that will not establish a right to gay marriage – merely an obligation on the federal government to recognise it in those states where it is legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has already repudiated the legislation and supports federal court rulings against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, told the supreme court that refusing to recognise gay marriages is not like other forms of discrimination because of the impact on people's lives, and said it breaches equal protection clauses in the constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verrilli said gay people were a "persecuted minority" and asked why the spouse of a gay soldier killed in the line of duty should not receive the same benefits as those given to heterosexual couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question before the court is whether the exclusion that Doma imposes violates equal protection, and it does violate equal protection because you can't treat this as though it were just a distinction between optometrists and ophthalmologists, as the Lee Optical case did. This is a different kind of a situation because the discrimination here is being visited on a group that has historically been subject to terrible discrimination," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Verrilli faced questions over whether obliging the federal government to recognise same-sex marriages where they are legal would not create another kind of discrimination against gay couples in states where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Clement, the former US solicitor general who argued and lost the case against Barack Obama's healthcare reforms, defended Doma as merely creating uniformity in how same sex couples are treated across the country for administrative purposes. He said the law does not intrude on states' rights because it does not regulate marriage but creates a framework for the implementation of policies on benefits and taxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The federal government is saying that within its own realm in federal policies, where we assume that the federal government has the authority to define the terms that appear in their own statute, that in those areas, they are going to have their own definition," said Clement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan questioned the idea that the law is merely administrative by quoting from the House of Representatives' own report on the debate during the passing of Doma in 1996, which states that "Congress decided to reflect an honour of collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clement said that was not enough to make the legislation unconstitutional. "Does the House Report say that? Of course the House Report says that. And if that's enough to invalidate the statute, then you should invalidate the statute. But that has never been your approach, especially under rational basis or even rational basis-plus, if that is what you are suggesting," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kagan said that the motivation behind the legislation should cause the court to give it special scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following: which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favourite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some rigour to say: do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: "I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, coming a day after the supreme court considered the constitutional legitimacy of a California referendum that overturned same-sex marriage in the state, pitted the White House against Republican leaders in Congress angered that the Obama administration will no longer defend Doma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the justices heard arguments over the law's constitutionality, they considered opinions over whether Congress had the right to defend Doma. The court appointed its own lawyer, Vicki Jackson, to present the case for why Congress does not have "standing" to take legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson told the justices that once Congress passes laws, responsibility for enforcing them shifts to the executive, and the legislature ceases to have active involvement. Jackson also said the supreme court should not consider the case because it was resolved by the Obama administration's decision not to challenge federal court rulings overturning Doma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Justice Antonin Scalia waded in to suggest that the supreme court has a role to play, because the federal government has taken the unusual step of no longer defending a law still on the statute books even while enforcing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm wondering if we're living in this new world where the attorney general can simply decide: yeah, it's unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that I'm not willing to enforce it. If we're in this new world, I don't want these cases like this to come before this court all the time," said Scalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Clement over whether a committee founded by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives specifically to defend Doma — the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, known as Blag — has the legal authority to act in the name of Congress. "Can you tell me where the authorisation is here?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clement said Blag had been authorised by a vote of the entire House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edith Windsor's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, questioned whether a majority could strip a minority of their rights — referring specifically to the case the court heard on Tuesday over the Proposition 8 referendum in California, which reversed a gay marriage law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts pressed her on whether change came about because of political lobbying or popular attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact of the matter is, Mr Chief Justice, is that no other group in recent history has been subjected to popular referenda to take away rights that have already been given or exclude those rights, the way gay people have," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights"&gt;Gay rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-supreme-court"&gt;US supreme court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/us-constitution-and-civil-liberties"&gt;US constitution and civil liberties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/human-rights"&gt;Human rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/washington-dc"&gt;Washington DC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chrismcgreal"&gt;Chris McGreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Only 8% under-estimated which category they fell into, while 27% thought they weighed more than they did – versus just 12% of men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could suggest women are more influenced by images of thin women shown across the media, are more worried and aware about their health, or could be tied to a myriad of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The categories are based on Body Mass Index (BMI), an approximate (and simplified) measure of someone's body shape based solely on their height and weight. Generally, a score of under 18.5 is regarded as underweight, 18.5 to 25 is 'ideal', and more than 25 signifies someone who may be overweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also revealed stark differences in self-knowledge between people of different weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, people whose BMI fell into the healthy range were the most likely to guess their weight correctly, with 70% of respondents in this group correctly guessing their category. Those who did get it wrong generally thought they were heavier than they actually were: about five times as many wrongly thought they were overweight as thought they were underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As respondents' BMI increases, accuracy of guesses drops. Overweight respondents were only very slightly less likely than those in their healthy range to correctly guess their weight, with 67% getting it right. However, those who got it wrong generally thought they were thinner than they really are: 27% guessed their were healthy (or under) weight, versus just 7% who wrongly thought they were obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the obese and morbidly obese categories, the majority of people did not correctly guess their weight, at 44% and 46% correctly. In both cases, more people underestimated their BMI group than got it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But – as the chart below reveals, these weren't the people who were least likely to get their BMI right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, in reality, those people with a BMI of less than 18.5 – underweight people, who are least likely to correct guess their grouping. Of the respondents in the Guardian research, only 40% of underweight people correctly placed themselves in that group. The majority guessed they'd be normal weight, or even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings – though only indicative, rather than formal research – show the importance of breaking down the data: even though overall most of us know our bodies, the people most likely to get it wrong are in the groups most as risk of health consequences as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a thorny dilemma for public health advocates on obesity: is there a way to make men worry more about their waistlines, while at the same time making women worry at least slightly less?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/interactive/2013/feb/21/do-you-know-what-size-you-are"&gt;Guardian's BMI test&lt;/a&gt; yourself, or read more on the issues in the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/series/the-obesity-crisis"&gt;obesity crisis series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/obesity"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing"&gt;Health &amp; wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesball"&gt;James Ball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Prosecutors say they oppose any relaxing of the bail restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roux said that Pistorius has no desire to return to the track now, but "this might and this will change". He said Pistorius should be allowed to travel to international competitions under controlled circumstances, under which he would require permission to travel from police and would have to give details of his schedule before leaving South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roux also argued against the ruling that Pistorius was not allowed to return to his home in a gated community in the eastern suburbs of Pretoria, where he shot Steenkamp dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyers say he must be allowed to consult residents in order to prepare his defence against the murder charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistorius claims he killed Steenkamp accidentally when he fired shots through a door in his bathroom in the pre-dawn hours, fearing there was an intruder in his house. Prosecutors say he shot the model and reality TV star intentionally after they argued, and they have charged him with premeditated murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pistorius was not required to attend his appeal hearing and neither he nor any of his family members were present at North Gauteng high court in Pretoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said he would rule on Pistorius's appeal later on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/reeva-steenkamp-shooting"&gt;Reeva Steenkamp shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/southafrica"&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/oscar-pistorius"&gt;Oscar Pistorius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

His body was identified by his daughter from his first marriage, Elizaveta Berezovskaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquest at the Guildhall in Windsor, which was opened and adjourned by the coroner for Berkshire, Peter Bedford, heard Berezovsky could have been dead for up to 18 hours before he was found by his bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was last seen alive at approximately 9.05pm on the evening of 22 March by the same employee [who discovered him on Saturday afternoon]," said Detective inspector Mark Bissell of Thames Valley police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bissell said it was not possible to eliminate completely the involvement of a third party while the investigation continues, but the coroner confirmed with him that "at the moment there was nothing to support such suspicious circumstances".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pathologist has found nothing to indicate a violent struggle nor anything to suggest the involvement of a third party," said Bissell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police are continuing investigations at Beresovsky's home on Mill Lane near Ascot. Toxicology and histology tests have yet to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The scene is currently under police control and a search of the property remains in progress and is likely to do so for the next few days," said Bissell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coroner said Berezovsky had formally changed his name in 2003, and was described in court as Platon Yelenin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedford said once he had appropriate information from Beresovsky's family he would sign a certificate allowing for a funeral to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boris-berezovsky"&gt;Boris Berezovsky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/robertbooth"&gt;Robert Booth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The company had previously warned passengers to expect disruption on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 7 million motorists are expected to head for a break in the UK or Europe over the Easter Break, and British airports are expecting around 2 million passengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 10% more trains than last Easter will be running, but there will be engineering work at Reading and on the west coast mainline in the west Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Tanzer, the chief executive of the travel association Abta, said: "After two wet summers and no end in sight to the winter, many Brits are desperate for some sunshine. We've seen a surge in last-minute bookings to warm destinations and ski lovers are also in for a treat with some of the best snow conditions seen for years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With British summer time due to begin on Sunday, there may be a touch more sun in some areas, less strong winds and rising temperatures over the weekend, but the latter will still be well below normal for the time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather should remain dry at least, the Met Office said, but snow will be slow to thaw, which could mean tricky driving conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/ferrytravel"&gt;Ferry travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/weather"&gt;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesmeikle"&gt;James Meikle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"We are currently reviewing the facts. As a result a member of the team has been suspended and a disciplinary procedure is under way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Harlequin confirmed on Thursday that Matthew Chapman, who described himself as an "award-winning Panorama producer" had emailed Sean Ghent, a consultant to the company, suggesting that it may go out of business soon and that he may get work with the BBC1 current affairs programme. The spokesman said the message came from a BBC email address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times reported that the email allegedly said: "I was wondering if I could be a bit cheeky here. It's unlikely that Ames [Harlequin's chairman David Ames] and maybe Harlequin will be around for much longer, nor will he have the money to pay people for much longer. Panorama and the BBC is always using security protection officers and although I cannot guarantee anything we may be able to put things your way. How would you feel helping me out in a totally confidential way?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghent told the Times that he was shocked by the person's approach to him via business network LinkedIn on 13 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was suggesting my job might disappear," he said. "It seemed to me he was trying to offer me an enticement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to the BBC's litigation department Harlequin said: "On any sensible interpretation, the message to Mr Ghent is simply staggering. It appears to constitute a flagrant and in out view highly improper attempt by [the journalist] to induce Mr Ghent into disclosing information about Harlequin in return for the potential reward of future work from the BBC. In short, it appears to be tantamount to an attempted bribe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month the Serious Fraud Office and Essex police &lt;a href="http://www.ifaonline.co.uk/ifaonline/news/2252690/sfo-requests-details-of-advisers-who-recommended-harlequin" title=""&gt;launched a joint investigation&lt;/a&gt; into complaints relating to Harlequin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of investors have put as much as £200m into a scheme run by Essex-based Harlequin, which builds luxury villas on islands including St Lucia, Barbados and Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SFO has opened an online questionnaire asking investors for details about their introduction to the group and their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January the Financial Services Authority &lt;a href="http://www.ftadviser.com/2013/03/06/regulation/regulators/sfo-launches-harlequin-probe-following-fsa-warning-2XSiyLSVT5l7rF5CC2LESK/article.html" title=""&gt;issued a warning to financial advisers&lt;/a&gt; about investing large sums of clients money in Harlequin's overseas property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBC's anti-bribery policy states: "The BBC takes a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption and is committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all its business dealings and relationships wherever it operates. The BBC is committed to implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bribery Act 2010 outlaws financial offers to a person in the knowledge that acceptance would constitute "improper performance'' of their duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;•&amp;nbsp;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@guardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

The quality of advice being given out has also been questionable in some instances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "The BMA has been warning the government about the problems with NHS 111 for almost two years. They must finally act to ensure that patient safety is guaranteed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling for a delay of the launch until it is "fully safe for the public", he said: "We cannot sacrifice patient safety in order to meet a political deadline for the launch of a service that doesn't work properly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers admitted on Tuesday the introduction of the 111 telephone service had "teething problems".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour spokesman Lord Hunt of Kings Heath warned of reports "up and down the country" of staff shortages and long waiting times to get through to the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged the government to look at it again, saying that combined with a poor quality out-of-hours service, it was putting pressure on acute hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health minister Lord Howe said he was aware of problems in two particular areas, but said pilots of the new service showed a high rate of patient satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHS England – formerly the NHS Commissioning Board – said it was aware of difficulties in introducing the new number in some areas, but that it was "confident that measures now in place will ensure resolution of these early problems".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman said: "The service has great potential to be a fast, efficient, all-round service that ensures patients get the right care for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a very important service for the public and we will make sure everything is in place to make a safe, high quality service that patients and the public can trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many sites are already up and running, but in areas where NHS 111 is not yet available we will make a thorough assessment of readiness before new sites are introduced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 111 service is aimed at helping people who urgently need medical help or advice but are not facing a life-threatening 999 emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/doctors"&gt;Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gps"&gt;GPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Celebrate the good stuff instead by making some delicious truffles – but will you top them with sea salt, cocoa or yet more chocolate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Easter, a time when we rejoice in the new life popping up all around us: those gaily gambolling lambs and chirping yellow chicks, the jaunty hymns and multicoloured eggs. But most of all, this is now the season of chocolate, an annual celebration of the most outlandish of cocoa confections. And while I like an &lt;a href="http://www.chococo.co.uk/products/detail.php?prodid=572" title=""&gt;edible ammonite as much as the next seven-year-old&lt;/a&gt;, it's sadly true that, as this time of year, more thought tends to go into form than flavour; Easter seems to have become little more than an international festival of crap chocolate. If that makes you happy, then by all means, &lt;a href="http://asteroid.divnull.com/2006/04/easter-turducken/" title=""&gt;gorge yourself silly&lt;/a&gt;. If, however, you fancy something a little more sophisticated, but lack the wherewithal for this &lt;a href="http://www.hauteliving.com/2012/03/most-expensive-non-jeweled-chocolate-egg-created-by-william-curley-auctioned-for-10000/267175/" title=""&gt;$10,000 gold-encrusted number&lt;/a&gt;, try these homemade truffles instead. They may look rather ordinary, but, rather like the homely speckled egg, they have hidden depths. Pointless overpackaging and accompanying novelty egg cups entirely at your discretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is the most important part of any truffle recipe – basically, if you don't like the chocolate, you won't like the truffle it makes. Perhaps that's why plain dark chocolate is as far as most recipes go in terms of specifics (indeed, Nigel Slater vaguely speaks only of "fine chocolate" in Real Food) – with the important exception of the classic truffles in Rococo: Mastering the Art of Fine Chocolate. Here, the company's own Grenada Chocolate Co &lt;a href="http://www.rococochocolates.com/Grenada-Chocolate-Company-Organic-Dark/dp/B005PW73XA" title=""&gt;71% cocoa solids&lt;/a&gt; is cited as the only stuff that will do. Once I track some bars down, I find it has a very distinctive, fruity flavour, which divides my testers: some, myself included, love it, others find it too acidic. This experience confirms my suspicions: it's impossible to be prescriptive here – find a dark chocolate you like, and start from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark yes, but, as you'll be sweetening it, there's no need to go as far as American blogger Ree Drummond, also known &lt;a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2009/10/chocolate-truffles-with-sea-salt/" title=""&gt;as the Pioneer Woman&lt;/a&gt;, and use a mixture of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolates. You need a generous hit of bitterness to prevent the finished product from being cloyingly sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly Drummond and I differ in the sweetness of our teeth, however, because, instead of the cream or butter the other recipes use to dilute the chocolate, she goes for condensed milk, which makes the truffles far, far too sugary for my liking – they're more like Fudge bars. (Definitely easier than making Easter eggs for your children though.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolatier &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/13/chocolate-truffles-recipe" title=""&gt;Paul A Young&lt;/a&gt; and Slater both keep things simple by using only chocolate and cream for the base of their truffles – Slater uses whipping, Young double – while Rococo goes for a mixture of butter and whipping cream, and Delia Smith really thinks outside the box with her butter, &lt;a href="http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/sweet/home-made-chocolate-truffles.html" title=""&gt;thick double cream and Greek yoghurt combo&lt;/a&gt;. This gives her creations a tangy freshness and moussey texture that, while not unpleasant, is not quite what I'm looking for in a truffle. While the all-cream truffles have a delectable richness meanwhile, I prefer the melt-in-the-mouth texture of the less dense butter and cream versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Franco-American blogger Tartelette (or Hélène Dujardin),&lt;a href="http://www.tarteletteblog.com/2009/12/recipe-dark-chocolate-truffles.html" title=""&gt; who adapts a recipe from a Parisian friend of her late grandmother's&lt;/a&gt;, uses butter and egg yolks instead. This makes them intensely rich and chocolatey – and after a couple of bites, I miss the moderating effect of the cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweetener&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both American recipes are too sweet for my taste: no dark chocolate could stand up to the sugary heft of Drummond's condensed milk or Dujardin's icing sugar. By contrast, neither Slater nor Smith employ any sweetener at all, and indeed, it's not necessary unless you use a chocolate with very high cocoa content, but I love the flavours that &lt;a href="http://blog.rococochocolates.com/2010/bbc-food-rococo-truffles-recipe/" title=""&gt;Rococo's honey&lt;/a&gt;, and Young's light muscovado sugar, bring to the confections. In the end, however, the latter's caramel flavour wins out for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm tempted by the easy option – Smith, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/18/nigel-slater-classic-chocolate-truffles" title=""&gt;Slater&lt;/a&gt; and Dujardin all simply roll their truffle mixture in cocoa powder to finish them off – but I love the crisp snap of Rococo, Young and Drummond's chocolate coating. Young doesn't specify what variety of chocolate to use, but I think Drummond and Rococo are on the right track with their tempered milk chocolate – it's a lovely creamy contrast to the bittersweet interior. A little cocoa on top helps to makes them look attractive, while adding an extra hint of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Extras&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith adds rum to her truffles – a good idea if you fancy it, but I'm going to leave it out for the classic version. Ditto Drummond's sea salt topping: I absolutely love the contrast in flavours, but it changes the character of the truffle completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a slightly different way of making their truffles; Smith uses a food processor, Rococo, Drummond and Dujardin a bain marie, and Slater and Young go for what is by far the easier option as far as I'm concerned, and let the hot cream do the hard work of melting the chocolate. Less washing-up too. On the subject of washing up, Rococo also pipes the mixture into "chocolate kisses" – mine, sadly, look more like chocolate cowpats, so I'm going to roll them by hand like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slater suggests whipping the chilled mixture if you prefer "a softer lighter" truffle – I quite like this idea, but it does make the truffles dangerous easy to eat, which means it probably isn't wise. After much thought, and even more testing, the rich, butteriness of the unwhipped version wins the day; after all, you wouldn't want to overindulge, would you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The perfect chocolate truffles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Makes around 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100ml double cream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40g light muscovado sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;110g dark chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25g butter, softened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;250g milk chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cocoa, to dust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat the cream and sugar together over a gentle heat until it comes to the boil. Allow to simmer for a minute, then take off the heat and leave to cool for a couple of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, smash the chocolate into small pieces (slamming the bars against a work surface is a satisfying way to do this) and cut the butter into small dice. Put in a large heatproof bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour the cream and sugar mixture on to the chocolate and butter and leave for a couple of minutes, then stir until smooth and glossy. Add a pinch of salt and allow to cool, then cover and refrigerate until set (about 2 hours).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a teaspoon to scoop out truffles, then roll them by hand into spheres. Chill your truffles while you &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/15/how-why-temper-chocolate" title=""&gt;temper the chocolate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put two thirds of the milk chocolate into a heatproof bowl over, but not touching a pan of simmering water and allow to melt. Remove from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate. Stir to melt, and use a thermometer to check when the temperature reaches 31C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the chocolate has reached the right temperature, dip each truffle into it to coat, sprinkle with cocoa and place on a piece of greaseproof paper to set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give them away before you eat them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/chocolate"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/felicity-cloake"&gt;Felicity Cloake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
