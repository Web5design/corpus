The last time a copy came up for sale was in 1947, when it set a world record price for any printed book. At $151,000, it fetched more than anyone had then paid for rarities such as a Shakespeare first folio – a good copy sold in the same auction season for only $22,000 – a Gutenberg bible or the gigantic, dazzlingly illustrated Audubon's Birds of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psalm book was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the congregationalist puritans who wanted a version of the psalms which they believed closer to the Hebrew original than the ones they brought with them from England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although an almanac may have been printed earlier, possibly on the same press, the Whole Booke of Psalmes is generally agreed to be the earliest bound true book and – because of the scholarship of members of the community, including John Cotton, Richard Mather and John Eliot – the first book written in America as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funds were raised in England and a printing press, paper and a printer were sent to the new world in 1638. By 1700 Boston had become the second most prolific printing centre of English books, surpassing Oxford and Cambridge, and second only to London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Redden, chairman of Sotheby's books department, described it as not just a landmark in printing but in political history: "This little book of 1640 was precursor to &lt;a href="http://www.history.com/topics/battles-of-lexington-and-concord" title=""&gt;Lexington and Concord&lt;/a&gt;, and, ultimately, to American political independence. With it, New England declared its independence from the Church of England."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nancy Taylor, senior minister and chief executive of the&lt;a href="http://www.oldsouth.org/content/about" title=""&gt; Old South church&lt;/a&gt;, said the money from the sale would allow the church to increase its grants and outreach programmes, and also to keep the historic building open and free to the public seven days a week. The congregation opposed the infamous witchcraft trials, published the first anti-slavery tract, baptised Benjamin Franklin, and hosted the meetings that led to the Boston Tea Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book is being sent on a touring exhibition across the US before the &lt;a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2013/the-bay-psalm-book-sale-n09039/overview.html" title=""&gt;auction in November at Sotheby's in New York&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/heritage"&gt;Heritage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/maevkennedy"&gt;Maev Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"It shows that we are building on our human rights as a country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was widely expected to pass, given similar support for the change in a preliminary vote held last month. It is likely to come into effect in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand becomes the 13th country to legalise same-sex marriages, after Uruguay passed the law last week. Australia rejected a similar proposal last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countries where such marriages are legal include Canada, Spain, Sweden and some US states. France is close to legalising same-sex marriage despite increasingly vocal opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill was opposed by the Roman Catholic church and some conservative religious, political and social groups, which said it would undermine the institution of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law makes it clear that clergy can decline to preside over gay marriages if they conflict with their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation comes after New Zealand gave same-sex relationships partial recognition in 2005 with the establishment of civil unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a boyfriend, so it means we can get married, which is a good thing," said Timothy Atkins, a student who was among a crowd listening to the hearing in the parliamentary lobby. "It's important to be seen as equal under the law."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/newzealand"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/gay-marriage"&gt;Gay marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gay-rights"&gt;Gay rights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/marriage"&gt;Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sexuality"&gt;Sexuality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The storm of conflicting opinions centres on the Mrs Thatcher, who became a symbolic figure – even an ism. But the funeral of Margaret Hilda Thatcher is not the time for debate on her legacy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chartres, a friend of Thatcher's, went on: "Lying here, she is one of us, subject to the common destiny of all human beings. There is an important place for debating policies and legacy; for assessing the impact of political decisions on the everyday lives of individuals and communities. Parliament held a frank debate last week – but here and today is neither the time nor the place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This, at Lady Thatcher's personal request, is a funeral service, not a memorial service with the customary eulogies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At such a time, the parson should not aspire to the judgments which are proper to the politician; instead this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is also the place for the simple truths which transcend political debate. And above all it is the place for hope."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body of Britain's first female prime minister had been borne with full military honours to St Paul's Cathedral as thousands lined the streets of central London to pay respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draped in a union flag, with a simple wreath of white flowers atop and the tribute "Beloved mother, always in our hearts", it was carried by gun-carriage drawn by six black horses, to the cathedral where a congregation from all over the world were gathered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gun salute was fired for each and every minute of the procession, while a single half-muffled bell at St Paul's tolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national anthem heralded the arrival of the Queen at St Paul's at 10.45am, her presence elevating Thatcher's ceremonial funeral to that of state funeral in all but name. It was the first time she has attended the funeral of one of her prime ministers since Sir Winston Churchill's in 1965.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was welcomed by lord mayor of the City of London. Roger Gifford, the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and Chartres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher's American granddaughter, Amanda, 19, read from St James's Bible, Ephesians 6: 10-18, while the prime minister, David Cameron, gave the second reading, John 14: 1-6, "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choir sang the Sentences, which had been sung below St Paul's famous dome on many occasions, including at Lord Nelson's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving the bidding, the dean of St Paul's, said the congregation was gathered to remember Thatcher and commend her into God's hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recall with great gratitude her leadership of this nation, her courage, her steadfastness, and her resolve to accomplish what she believed to be right for the common good".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service, planned many years ago in consultation with Thatcher, and with her relatives since, was traditional and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Thatcher chose the hymn He Who Would Valiant Be, while the Charles Wesley hymn Love Divine, All Loves Excelling reflected the influence of her Methodist upbringing, and the final hymn, the patriotic verse I Vow To Thee My Country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organ played Psalm 84, set to the music of Johannes Brahms, which is the same piece Lady Thatcher chose to be played at the funeral of her husband, Sir Denis Thatcher, in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1.5-tonne gun carriage, escorted by the Kings troop Royal Horse Artillery, and a tri-service military procession, had arrived at the cathedral shortly before 11am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd applauded as the cortege made its way along the Strand past Fleet Street and up Ludgate Hill to the cathedral. Some booing too could be heard, with a handful of protesters turning their backs as the coffin went past. Angry exchanges broke out between supporters and demonstrators as the gun carriage made its way along the Strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single gun was fired in salute from Tower Wharf for each minute of the procession as the muffled bell of St Paul's tolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher's children, Sir Mark Thatcher and his twin sister Carol, had arrived just after 10.30am, as the procession was making its way to St Paul's. They were accompanied by the former premier's grandchildren, Michael and Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Guard of Honour from the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, alongside the Band of the Welsh Guards and Massed Corps of Drums plus Drum Major of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, met the funeral procession at St Paul's as the coffin was carried by a bearer party up the steps lined with Chelsea Pensioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher had left parliament for the last time at 10am as her coffin was taken by hearse from the crypt of St Mary Undercroft, where it rested overnight, to the RAF church of St Clement Danes in the Strand .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortege drove slowly through the cordoned off streets in central London, past Westminster Abbey and into Parliament Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Ben fell silent, but crowds applauded as the hearse passed the Cenotaph and Downing Street, the home she inhabited for 11 years – the longest tenure of any modern British prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a police motorcycle escort, the cortege drove past Trafalgar Square – where the poll tax demonstrations, which had a profound impact on her government, took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her coffin was borne into St Clement Danes and placed in the centre of the church.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prayers were said before it was transferred to the gun carriage for the military procession to St Paul's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the cathedral, many hundreds of spectators stood in the light drizzle and amid a sea of union flags, some of whom had camped out overnight to witness the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dignitaries from 170 countries are attending the service, Downing Street said, included 11 serving prime ministers, and 17 serving foreign ministers from across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Union flags and national flags of the UK were lowered to half mast above Downing Street and at landmark buildings around the UK at 8am, and will remain so until dusk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The congregation had begun arriving before 9am, when the cathedral's doors opened. Early arrivals included broadcaster Terry Wogan and the Duchess of York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Geoffrey Howe, Thatcher's ex-chancellor who many believe played a significant role in her eventual political downfall, was in attendance, as well as the current chancellor, George Osborne, Tory grandee Ken Clarke and the London mayor, Boris Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former prime ministers John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown arrived shortly before 10am as did former party leaders David Steel and David Owen. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, was among foreign dignitaries. Guests also included the classical singer Katherine Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Guests included the Labour leader, Ed Milliband, the deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, Lady Warsi, chief secretary to the Treasury, and former Tory Party chairman Norman Tebbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior military figures at the service included the defence secretary, Philip Hammond, the chief of the defence staff, General Sir David Richards, the first sea lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, and the chief of the general staff, General Sir Peter Wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview for the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, David Cameron defended the ceremonial funeral as a fitting tribute to a major national figure, and urged political opponents to show respect during the event. "I think other countries in the world would think Britain had got it completely wrong if we didn't mark this in a proper way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added Britain's first female prime minister had created a new consensus during her time in power. "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/17/margaret-thatcher-funeral-cameron-respect" title=""&gt;In a way, we are all Thatcherties now," he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the service, the coffin will travel by hearse to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and a private cremation at Mortlake crematorium will take place in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies"&gt;Caroline Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The only other alternative was for the Jordanian prosecutor to prove "to a high standard that the statements were not procured by torture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling followed a decision by the European court of human rights made final last May that while Qatada did not face a risk of being tortured if returned to Amman he did face the real possibility of a trial based on torture-tainted evidence. The Strasbourg judges said that would amount to a "flagrant denial of justice". The home secretary did not appeal against that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The law lords – the UK's highest appellate court until the creation of the supreme court – have already considered Qatada's case. In February 2009, six months before the new court was established, they unanimously approved his deportation to Jordan after accepting the country's assurances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abu-qatada"&gt;Abu Qatada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/extradition"&gt;Extradition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/criminal-justice"&gt;UK criminal justice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/owenbowcott"&gt;Owen Bowcott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In a meeting with former state governors from the reformist and moderate camps, Rafsanjani is reported to have put to rest any speculation that he might declare his candidacy for the upcoming presidential election, saying that he did not foresee a situation in which he and Khamenei could work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting, according to Saham news agency, was organised by the ex-governors in an attempt to persuade the 78-year-old politician to add his name to the list of candidates. According to those present, he referred to his recent sit-down with Khamenei, saying that the supreme leader apparently does not perceive the country as facing the same problems that concern Rafsanjani. Since the last presidential election in 2009, which was followed by massive protests and a harsh crackdown, Rafsanjani has repeatedly said he believes Iran to be in a state of crisis, both internally and externally, and that only a more pluralistic and moderate approach can solve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rafsanjani's tenure as president, from 1989 to 1997, was by all measures a repressive period, characterised by tight media control and political assassinations. But after he left office, perhaps as a way of maintaining a foothold in a regime in which Khamenei and his hardline allies have played an increasingly dominant role, he placed his weight behind the reform movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, both men have voiced their disagreements through proxies, save for the one occasion, following the disputed 2009 poll, when Khamenei publicly declared that his views were "closer to Mr [Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad's" than Rafsanjani's. Ahmadinejad had built much of his 2009 re-election campaign around opposition to Rafsanjani, who was widely seen as a symbol of economic corruption. As the relationship between the supreme leader and Ahmadinejad began to sour, the latter ceased his rhetorical attacks on Rafsanjani. But the conservatives in Khamenei's camp have managed to systematically isolate and marginalise the former president. Two years ago Rafsanjani lost his position as head of the assembly of experts, the one body in the Islamic Republic's constitutional system with the theoretical power to supervise and remove the supreme leader. Rafsanjani's daughter, Faezeh, was &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/01/news-rafsanjanis-daughter-6-months-jail-for-propaganda-against-system.html" title=""&gt;sentenced to six months in jail&lt;/a&gt; for her open support of the opposition Green movement; and his son, Mehdi, has &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2012/09/mehdi-hashemi-rafsanjani-center-son.html" title=""&gt;been in and out of Evin prison&lt;/a&gt; on similar, even more serious, charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting with the ex-governors, Rafsanjani is reported to have said "the leader no longer trusts me, though I acted as a brother toward him".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reflected further on the history of their relationship, which began as an extremely close political collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was the one who brought Mr Khamenei to Tehran from [the provincial city of] Mashhad and, despite opposition from many revolutionary friends, I facilitated his joining the central committee of the revolution … The rest is well-known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rafsanjani apparently referred to his role in Khamenei's unlikely ascendency to the supreme leadership. After the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, when Rafsanjani recognised that he did not have sufficient support among the senior clerics to attain the position himself, he played an indispensable role in strong-arming the Guardian Council to appoint Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rafsanjani also reportedly lashed out at the Revolutionary Guards during the meeting, criticising the military organisation's vast economic and political influence. The Guards became a significant economic force during Rafsanjani's presidential tenure, when he exerted great sway over them. He apparently underplayed this point in his talk, saying that during his presidency the extent of the Guards' activity was limited to its engineering corps and projects such as national road building. "Now," he said, "they control the economy as well as domestic and foreign policy and they will not be satisfied with anything short of the entire country."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the supreme leader could rein in the Revolutionary Guards, he added, and seeing how there is no hope for collaboration between himself and Khamenei, "it would not be wise" for him to run for the presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than two months before the 13 June election, the list of candidates is still uncertain. A host of different individuals and coalitions have declared their intention to run or put forward a nominee, but the Guardian Council, an oversight body half of whose members were appointed directly by Khamenei, reserves the right to pick and choose among the candidates. Some reformists had hoped that either Rafsanjani or another former president, Mohammad Khatami, whom the regime would have a hard time disqualifying, would enter the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have called for a boycott. While speculation about Khatami's decision persists, the hardliners seem unconcerned. The only likely competition seems to be between representatives of the conservative groups already in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei"&gt;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad"&gt;Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The North has made &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/16/north-korea-threats-domestic-discontent" title=""&gt;a series of threats against South Korea and the US&lt;/a&gt; and cut off co-operation at the joint industrial park it operates with Seoul, reflecting its anger at tightened sanctions due to its third nuclear test and joint US-South Korean military drills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secretary of state, John Kerry, earlier said that the US was prepared to reach out but the North would have to demonstrate good faith by taking steps to meet its previous commitments as he wrapped up his tour of Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said he anticipated that "North Korea will probably make more provocative moves over the next several weeks, but our hope is we can contain it and we can move into a different phase, in which they try to work through diplomatically some of these issues so they can get back on a path where they're actually feeding their people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in Seoul have said the North appears to be ready to carry out a mid-range missile launch – presumed to be a test – in contravention of UN security council resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with NBC, shown on Tuesday, Obama said the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was using the same pattern of behaviour as his father and grandfather, adding: "Since I came into office, the one thing I was clear about was, we're not going to reward this kind of provocative behaviour. You don't get to bang … your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, the state department spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, told reporters that North Korea had to make the first move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They know what they need to do in terms of stopping their provocations and showing a seriousness of purpose," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a foreign ministry spokesman in Pyongyang said that while the North was not opposed to dialogue, it would not sit "at the humiliating negotiating table with the party brandishing a nuclear stick", according to a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also warned that it would intensify unspecified "military countermeasures" unless the US halts joint military drills with the South – due to run until the end of this month – and withdraws military assets that Pyongyang says threaten it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement also rebuffed the proposal of dialogue with the South again, saying it would refuse talks unless Seoul apologised for its "monstrous criminal act" – a protest by 250 people in the capital on Monday during which effigies of the North's former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, were burned. Such protests are fairly common in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The North can sit and wait for more offers," said Leonid Petrov, an expert on the North at the Australian National University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is the game that Kim Jong-un is pursuing and whatever happens he is going to win. He creates the crisis; he goes through launches and tests; he consolidates people behind his rule and shows he is a strong leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He knows the North won't be attacked because they have at least a capable missile programme and no matter how many angry United Nations security council resolutions there are, they are going to survive because of China. Isolation? So what? It's been isolated for 60 years. The more isolated it is, the longer the regime can survive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the US does not want to pursue dialogue it can opt for benign neglect, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But in that case they should be prepared that the North will continue to test nuclear weapons and launch rockets. Every decision comes at a price," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinkston, of the International Crisis Group, said that to meet all the North's conditions would be political suicide for a US president and "insanely dangerous", probably leading to further demands in any case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's next: a permanent seat on the security council?" said Pinkston. "To me it's just a matter of time. It might be six months, six years, 30 years. But with a very repressive security apparatus, extreme economic inefficiencies, misallocated resources, policies and activities that alienate most of the world leaving them in isolation … I don't see how that's sustainable for ever. Either the world has to change or they do, and why is the world going to change for North Korea?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-korea"&gt;North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/asia-pacific"&gt;Asia Pacific&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Minutes of the central bank's April monetary policy committee, released on Wednesday, revealed a six-three majority in favour of maintaining interest rates at 0.5% and the level of quantitative easing at £375bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MPC has remained split for several months despite the governor, Sir Mervyn King, regularly voting for a £25bn boost to QE. King has lost the vote an unprecedented three times since February when he sided with the Bank director Paul Fisher and external committee member David Miles, a former City economist, in calling for an injection of funds into the economy to boost lending and stagnant growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its bi-annual review, the IMF said that the UK would suffer slower growth this year and next as a result of poor export growth and a clampdown by the government on investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady fall in the claimant count has cut government costs and that continued in February when the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell 7,000 to 1.53 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a steep fall in manufacturing and construction output this year has undermined hopes of a strong resurgence in growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low level of pay rises will be a particular worry to the chancellor after the rate fell to 1%, the lowest since records began in 2001 and well short of the 2.8% inflation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending in the economy has picked up in recent months, but analysts worry that it will peter out if the gap between pay and inflation continues to erode disposable income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds also remained a concern after it pushed back towards the 1 million mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three months to February the number of young people out of work reached 979,000, pushing the unemployment rate to 21.1%, up 0.6 percentage points from September to November 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said it was likely that further moves by the Bank of England would be delayed until after the new governor, Mark Carney, arrives from Canada in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More QE in May is still possible, especially if the Q1 GDP figure is worse than expected. But it may be that we have to wait until Carney arrives before the MPC will take more action. Note, though, that even those voting against QE this month still seem open to further action to boost bank lending, with the committee seeing merit in possible extensions to Funding for Lending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "Despite a 7,000 drop in claimant count unemployment in March, the labour market data are clearly softer overall compared to a couple of months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the data fuels concern that the labour market's recent strength is fraying as the economy continues to struggle for even modest sustained growth. Meanwhile, earnings growth remained very weak in February. While weak earnings growth is clearly helping to keep unemployment down, the flip-side of this is that it continues to limit consumers' purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Indeed, with total earnings growth limited to 0.8% in February itself, pressure on people's purchasing power has intensified recently given that consumer price inflation has risen back up to 2.8% in March and could well hover around 3% for much of 2013."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/unemployment-and-employment-statistics"&gt;Unemployment and employment statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/unemployment"&gt;Unemployment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bankofenglandgovernor"&gt;Bank of England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/phillipinman"&gt;Phillip Inman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The forensic examination of the crime scene has begun to bear fruit, though officials concede that they still have no suspects and no motive for the bombing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI agents leading the investigation are pitting their hopes on the public as they believe the instigator of the attack may well have revealed themselves to others. "The person who did this is someone's friend, co-worker or relative. Someone knows who did this," said Rick DesLauriers, special agent in charge of the Boston FBI, which is leading the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic examiners have recovered fragments of black nylon cloth they believe to have come from backpacks used to carry both bombs. They have also found what DesLauriers described as "fragments of nails that could have been contained in a pressure cooker". He added that he was talking about a basic household pressure cooker of the sort found in many kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devices exploded at about 2.50pm on Monday, within seconds of each other and 50 metres apart, causing a current casualty toll of 176 injured, 17 critically, and three dead. Two of the dead have been named: Martin Richard, an eight-year-old boy from Boston's Dorchester neighbourhood, and Krystle Campbell, 29, who had been at the finish line to watch her boyfriend complete the race. The Chinese consulate in New York said that the third fatal victim was a Chinese citizen whose identity was not being made public at the request of their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement from the White House briefing room, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2013/apr/16/boston-marathon-explosions-hunt-begins-for-perperators-live-updates" title=""&gt;President Barack Obama underlined the lack of hard information&lt;/a&gt; about what he called the "heinous" acts in Boston, but pointedly made clear the US was now viewing it as "an act of terror".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do not know if this was an act of an organisation, an individual or individuals, and we don't have a sense of motive yet," he said. "Everything else is speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday to attend a multi-faith service for the victims, the White House said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As details of the bomb devices began to emerge, the full horror of the incident became clearer. Investigators said the blast sites were massive, with debris found on nearby rooftops and embedded in the walls of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the injured underwent amputations overnight – four at Massachusetts General hospital alone. It was also revealed that the devices had been packed with metal fragments and placed close to the ground, leading to a high number of amputations and serious lower body injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Velmahos, chief trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital – where many of the injured were taken – said nails and pellets were removed from the bodies of those hit in the blast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detectives clearly think that the heavy nature of the backpacks carried by the bomber or bombers could provide an essential clue that might trigger someone's memory. "We are postulating they would need to have been heavy bags to carry the device inside them. They would not have been light bags," the FBI chief said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sight of someone carrying a heavy black bag might also be significant in terms of video footage recovered from the crime scene. Forensic experts from the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, who specialise in the analysis of digital film, have arrived in Boston and will be involved in the massive task of combing through the voluminous mobile phone videos handed in from citizens as well as footage retrieved from security cameras in the vicinity of the bombing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the forensic developments sound promising, a large vacuum remains at the heart of the investigation: there remains no knowledge about the perpetrator or perpetrators and what motivated them. DesLauriers said in this regard that the hunt remained in its infancy. "At this time there are no claims of responsibility. The range of suspects and motives remains wide open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there was no idea whether those responsible were "a person or persons".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Boston tried to get back to normal business on Tuesday, it was like a town cut in half. On the one hand, the historic town centre was looking its beautiful best, with visitors dining on the sidewalks under a cloudless sky and the brownstone streets adjacent to the bomb site lined with magnolia trees in bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Swat teams armed with machine-guns were posted on most street corners and outside the hospitals, and a 12-block area around Boylston Street that formed the crime scene looked as though it had been subject to a military coup. The zone was swarming with detectives, the streets jammed with armoured vehicles, and the air resounded with the barking of sniffer dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public officials gave conflicting information about the possible use of pressure cookers. DesLauriers would not specify whether they believed a pressure cooker was used in both devices. But after the press conference ended, the US prosecutor Carmen Ortiz told reporters that a pressure cooker may have been used at both sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI chief said he wanted to hear from any member of the public who had come across a friend, colleague or acquaintance who had expressed in recent months a desire to target the marathon; who had engaged in suspicious research on explosive devices; or who appeared to be carrying an unusually heavy dark bag in the vicinity of the blasts on Monday. DesLauriers also asked people to come forward if they had heard noises of explosions before yesterday that might have been test runs for the outrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner, denied that the force had made any errors in the lead up to the marathon. He said the number of police officers had been increased at this year's marathon, particularly at the finish line, to match the large crowd that assembled to watch the end of the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a soft target," he said. "Anybody can go into a church service and do this kind of thing. When you have an event like this, it can't be closed down like a military operation – by virtue of the event, it requires that we don't turn it into a police state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of the public focus the day after the bombing is focused on the hunt for those who carried it out, the city is also working hard to support the victims and their families. Thomas Menino, the mayor of Boston, said he had visited wounded people in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are hanging in there," he said. "I saw a woman who had lost a leg – she showed a lot of courage. These families are going through very difficult times, and we have to show them all the help we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston-marathon-explosions"&gt;Boston Marathon explosions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/massachusetts"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-crime"&gt;US crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/boston"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/edpilkington"&gt;Ed Pilkington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt"&gt;Adam Gabbatt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dan-roberts"&gt;Dan Roberts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/matt-williams"&gt;Matt Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Elsewhere, however, coal use has soared, particularly in Europe, where its share of the power generation mix increased at the expense of gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the world still reliant on fossil fuels, the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is critical, but there are no commercial plants in operation, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IEA has envisaged that CCS, which buries and traps CO2 underground, should play a major role in cutting global emissions and had forecast 63% of coal power plants should be equipped with the technology by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are only 13 large-scale demonstration projects in operation or being built, with the capacity to store about 65m tonnes of CO2 a year. This represents only a quarter of the storage capacity needed by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New nuclear plant construction is also well behind target and global biofuel production stalled in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government policies and the EU's emissions trading scheme need to be strengthened to enable more energy efficiency and clean technology uptake, the IEA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless we get (carbon emissions) prices and policies right, a cost-effective clean-energy transition just will not happen," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IEA did see some positive developments, however. From 2011 to 2012, the more mature renewable energy technologies of solar photovoltaic and wind power grew by an impressive 42% and 19% respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/renewableenergy"&gt;Renewable energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/energy"&gt;Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/climate-change"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange"&gt;Climate change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The situation is potentially explosive and any harm that comes to him will undoubtedly lead to a serious eruption of violence that will make any sort of political progress unlikely," wrote Erekat on the eve of Prisoners' Day, marked by Palestinians on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "Should Mr Issawi die, we will&amp;nbsp;… hold the international community partly responsible for its tolerance of Israel's appalling actions which have created this terrible situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three thousand Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails refused meals to mark Prisoners' Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issawi was arrested on 7 July 2012 at a checkpoint and was accused of being in breach of the terms of his release from jail in October 2011 as part of the prisoner swap deal that secured the release from captivity of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Issawi had been sentenced in April 2002 to 30 years in prison for membership of an illegal organisation, attempted murder and possession of explosives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his arrest, he has been held without charge, although he has appeared at special hearings at which any evidence against him has not been disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issawi began refusing food on 1 August last year, his mother Laila told the Guardian last month. Her son – who is in the Kaplan hospital in Tel Aviv – was taking water, vitamins and infusions, she said. "I am forbidden from seeing him. I last saw him in court in February but I wasn't allowed to speak to him. All I could see was skin and bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nothing inside him is functioning. His kidneys are not right, his heart is not right, he has headaches all the time, he can't take himself to the bathroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issawi has lost at least 45kg in weight, and his heart rate has slowed to 28 beats a minute, according to Addameer, a Palestinian prisoners' rights organisation. It said his lawyers had been banned from visiting him in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sivan Weizman, spokeswoman for the Israeli Prison Service, said Issawi's condition was stable. She declined to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His case has generated widespread support and clashes across the West Bank. "Samer has put the prisoners' issue on the table. He shows the whole world that thousands of Palestinian prisoners are in Israeli jails unjustly," said Laila Issawi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 5,000 Palestinian prisoners are held in 27 Israeli jails and detention centres, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club. They include more than 100 who have been in prison for more than 20 years, and 235 children. About 200 are "administrative detainees", prisoners held without charge, including 14 elected members of the Palestinian legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of prisoners is a visceral one among Palestinian families, nearly all of whom have experienced the jailing of a relative. Of Laila Issawi's eight children, six – including a daughter – have spent time in prison, and a seventh was shot dead aged 16 by Israeli soldiers. Laila Issawi, 65, spent six months in prison in the 1970s accused of "supporting terrorism" after treating wounded militants as a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, there were clashes and protests in the West Bank following the death from cancer of a 64-year-old prisoner, Maysara Abu Hamdiyeh. &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/02/palestinian-leaders-israel-negligence-death" title=""&gt;Palestinian officials accused Israel of negligence in his diagnosis and treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hunger-striking-palestinian-prisoner-calls-on-israelis-to-push-for-his-release.premium-1.514729" title=""&gt;message to Israeli activists and intellectuals&lt;/a&gt;, posted last week on Facebook, Issawi wrote: "I invite you to visit me in the hospital and see me as a skeleton handcuffed to the bed. Three exhausted jailers around me eat and drink by my bed. The guards follow my pains and gradually growing weight loss. Occasionally they look at their watches and ask: 'How can such a body have anything left to survive?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't heard a single one of you intervene and try to silence the voice of the growing death as all of you have turned into gravediggers, wearing military uniforms: the judge, writer, intellectual, media, merchant, academic, poet. I am unable to believe that an entire society has turned into the jailers of my death and life, to the protectors of the settlers who are pursuing my dreams."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of intellectuals, including the celebrated authors Amos Oz and AB Yehoshua, pleaded with Issawi to end his hunger strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/top-israeli-authors-plead-with-palestinian-security-prisoner-end-hunger-strike.premium-1.515276" title=""&gt;We are horrified by your deteriorating condition&lt;/a&gt;," the message said. We feel that the suicidal act you are about to commit will add another facet of tragedy and desperation to the conflict between the two peoples, a conflict that peace-seekers on both sides wish to end. Please, Samer Issawi, don't pile more despair on the despair already in existence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article published by the Guardian last month, Issawi wrote that his hunger strike was "&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/03/hunger-strikers-fighting-for-palestinians-israel" title=""&gt;my last remaining stone to throw at the tyrants and jailers&lt;/a&gt; in the face of the racist occupation that humiliates our people&amp;nbsp;… If I die, it is a victory; if we are liberated, it is a victory, because either way I have refused to surrender to the Israeli occupation, its tyranny and arrogance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/palestinian-territories"&gt;Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israel"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/harrietsherwood"&gt;Harriet Sherwood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Some were equipped with folding chairs, and had camped out overnight to witness the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dignitaries from 170 countries are attending the service, Downing Street said, included 11 serving prime ministers, and 17 serving foreign ministers from across the globe. The Queen will lead the mourners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher's body had rested overnight at the chapel of St Mary Undercroft at the Palace of Westminster where MPs, peers, and those who had worked with her were able to pay their respects following a short private service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cameron hosted a dinner for a small group of guests at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday night. Those in attendance included the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, former US vice president Dick Cheney and former US secretary of state James Baker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coffin was due to be moved by hearse from Westminster to St Clement Danes, the RAF chapel, in the Strand, where it will be transferred to a gun carriage and borne to St Paul's, escorted by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview for BBC Radio 4's Today programme , Cameron defended the ceremonial funeral as a fitting tribute to a major national figure, and urged political opponents to show respect during the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think other countries in the world would think Britain had got it completely wrong if we didn't mark this in a proper way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher's coffin is expected to arrive at St Paul's at 11am, when the funeral service will begin and is due to last just under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thatcher's request prior to her death, Britain's longest serving prime minister will deliver a reading at her funeral. Cameron will recite a lesson from the King James Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service is a traditional affair and includes a selection of well-known hymns, including Charles Wesley's Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, as well as poems by Wordsworth and TS Eliot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the service, the coffin will travel by hearse to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and a private cremation at Mortlake crematorium will take place in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the numbers outside St Paul's swelled throughout the morning, protesters were thin on the ground. Most were there to pay tribute, and some had travelled from afar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Robert Cunningham, 29, diverted his holiday in Norway to make it to the funeral. He said: "She was a foreign prime minister, regardless of the good, bad or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She did a lot for our country, a lot for the relationship between the UK and the US. Respect is due to the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Kittle, 79, said she travelled from Canada for the funeral as soon as she heard of Lady Thatcher's death, taking up her position outside the historic landmark at 8am yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a cold night, the damp goes through you," she said. "But I always said I would come to the UK for Margaret Thatcher's funeral because I respect her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think she did a lot for the world. She was an intelligent lady – a chemist and a lawyer – and a lovely lady as well. Apparently, she always made her husband Denis's breakfast."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flags were lowered at half mast above Downing Street and other government buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside Downing Street, the first spectators began gathering as early as 6.30am. "Mrs Thatcher was a gutsy woman, especially over the Falklands," said Trevor Fearson, 83, who with his wife Doreen, 85, had travelled from west Kensington in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a good prime minister," said his wife. "At the end she didn't have the backing of her ministers. I hope they feel badly about that now, but I doubt it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security was intense with more than 4,000 police on duty. Teams of officers arrived on the Strand at 7am and had closed the road to traffic by 8am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers would be placed at intervals of 10 metres – or seven barriers – along the whole route, with more at crossings, one said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others patrolled the road on motorbike and horseback, with more on the pavements on foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small group of protesters arrived to demonstrate against the "glorifying" of the funeral and cuts to the welfare state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Winslow, 22, an anthropology student from Durham, was joined by three others at Ludgate Circus, next to St Paul's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding an acrylic placard reading "rest of us in poverty" and wearing a T-shirt with the messages "power to the people" and "society does exist", he said up to 200 demonstrators were expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We plan to turn our backs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to maintain a dignified protest, it's counter-productive to cat call and sing Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "The government wants to glorify this. It is a massive propaganda campaign to idolise Margaret Thatcher."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Welsh, a 69-year-old retired youth worker, joined the Facebook-organised protest at the junction of Ludgate Hill and Ludgate Circus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: "I am absolutely furious that prime minister David Cameron has decided to spend £10m on a funeral when normal people are having to face cutbacks, libraries are closing and the NHS is being cut - for the funeral of a Conservative woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like anyone else she deserves a decent funeral, but not at the expense of the taxpayer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/carolinedavies"&gt;Caroline Davies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Those hurt were treated in local hospitals. A helicopter was sent to the scene where firefighters battled to put out the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A local police spokesman said: "There was apparently a problem with the coach's brakes. The driver seems to have lost control on a steep bend in the road and his vehicle crashed into rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It burst into flames but everyone is now out. Some passengers escaped by jumping out the windows."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/road-transport"&gt;Road transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In &lt;a href="http://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2013/04/16/shift-2013-mirror-titles-and-mailonline-will-not-go-behind-paywalls/"&gt;a report on his speech by MediaTel&lt;/a&gt;, he said there were no plans to place MailOnline's content behind a paywall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he did speak of experimentation involving Daily Mail Plus, its interactive app, for which readers already pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is quoted in the Telegraph report as saying: "At the moment we've got no hard and fast plans to do anything… but we have started to look at premium content and we are trying to understand how we might find a mechanism to start charging for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the MediaTel report he is quoted as saying: "The birth of the internet...[and] the growth of tablet and mobiles represents a sea-change for our business, but the core belief [for our Daily Mail brand] is that we should not stop people viewing Mail content."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, MailOnline boasts around 7.5m global browsers each day. In January this year, the website achieved 127m hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Rothermere's statements, analysts at the global investment banking firm &lt;a href="http://www.jefferies.com/"&gt;Jefferies International&lt;/a&gt; said they applauded his "open-minded approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: "Mail Plus presents DMGT with a perfect test bed for the paid content model, and reading between the lines here it seems that the inclusion of high quality video content may be the tipping point." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9998519/Daily-Mail-actively-considering-online-charge.html"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2013/04/16/shift-2013-mirror-titles-and-mailonline-will-not-go-behind-paywalls/"&gt;MediaTel&lt;/a&gt;/Jefferies International&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/viscount-rothermere"&gt;Viscount Rothermere&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/charging-for-content"&gt;Charging for content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dailymail"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mail-online"&gt;Mail Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/national-newspapers"&gt;National newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dailytelegraph"&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/dmgt"&gt;Daily Mail &amp; General Trust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/paywalls"&gt;Paywalls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/newspapers"&gt;Newspapers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediabusiness"&gt;Media business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/digital-media"&gt;Digital media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/roygreenslade"&gt;Roy Greenslade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He also distanced himself from the more divisive side of her legacy by saying he was seeking to give a "big boost" to social renewal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As protesters planned to register their opposition to Thatcher on the funeral route, Cameron said people had a right to disagree. But he said they should appreciate that the nation was paying tribute to the longest serving prime minister of the 20the century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said: "Of course people have a right to disagree and take a different view. But when you are mourning the passing of an 87-year-old woman who was the first woman prime minister, who served for longer in the job than anyone for 150 years, I think it is appropriate to show respect. There will be times, there have been times, when political figures who have died that I might profoundly disagree with. But when they pass you show respect and do so in a dignified way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister defended the costs and scale of the funeral after the Today programme presenter Evan Davis said some people believe feared there had been a "tampering with the constitution" to give Thatcher "something akin to a royal funeral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said: "She achieved some extraordinary things in her life. I think what is happening today is absolutely fitting and right. Looking from overseas I think people who respected and revered Margaret Thatcher and what she did – I think people would think we had taken an extraordinary view if we somehow didn't commemorate this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron agreed the funeral would not be a political or triumphalist event. He said: "It will be quite a sombre event. But it is a fitting tribute to a great prime minister respected around the world and I think other countries around the world would think Britain had got it completely wrong if we didn't mark this in a proper way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said Thatcher's political settlement had been accepted by all mainstream political parties when he declared that everyone was a Thatcherite. But he was careful to avoid saying he is personally a Thatcherite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said: "In a way, we are all Thatcherites now. One of the things about her legacy is that some of those big arguments that she had everyone now accepts. Nobody wants to go back to trade unions that are undemocratic or one-sided nuclear disarmament or having private sector businesses in the public sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the prime minister made clear he would not repeat Thatcher's mistakes as he said he would place greater emphasis on social renewal. "I have always felt it is important you learn from all of political history. What we have needed to do is take that great inheritance and then add to it. As well as an economic renewal there has been a need for a great social renewal. That side of Conservatism needs to have a big boost and that is what I have tried to do over the last seven years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron's careful remarks show that he understands that her legacy is a mixed blessing for the Tories. He drew a distinction with Thatcher by placing himself in the mould of Lord Heseltine, whose leadership challenged ended her premiership, in devolving powers to Britain's "great cities".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very understandable why Margaret Thatcher and her governments had to take quite such a tough approach to local government. You had these loony left authorities running Lambeth, Liverpool and elsewhere. So it wasn't really an age for decentralisation. But I have always felt that a true Conservative should be following the Thatcher logic of giving people more power over their lives, you should be giving our great cities and our local authorities greater power and greater control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron said the best approach to Thatcher's legacy for Conservatives was voiced by George Osborne who said everyone lives in the shadow of the late prime minister and the party should embrace that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister said: "She was an extraordinary leader. She still casts a great influence on the Conservative party today. But what is important is that we remember all of Margaret Thatcher and all the way she approached politics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicholaswatt"&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But the case is widely seen as a means of silencing the man who has become Putin's loudest critic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We say this simple truth – that Putin is a thief – and that's why this trial is happening," Navalny told supporters gathered for a small protest before entering the courtroom on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge, Sergei Blinov, adjourned the case after 45 minutes and called a subsequent session for 24 April. Navalny's defence had argued that they were not given enough time to prepare for the trial. However, a delay had been expected as the state seeks to dampen attention on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems that this is how this trial will be conducted – we will arrive and leave, arrive and leave," Navalny said after the short hearing. "They are interested in making this trial so that everyone gets sick of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than 1% of Russian court cases ending in not-guilty verdicts, it is almost certain Navalny will be convicted. He faces up to 10 years in prison – or a suspended sentence, which would forbid him from running for office and kill any hope of a legitimate political career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny's popularity grew on the back of mass anti-Putin protests that swept Moscow early last year. He has since announced presidential aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of his public support, however, has receded amid a Kremlin crackdown that has sown widespread fear among those opposed to Putin. Dozens of protesters have been arrested in the past year and a new legal framework has increased sanctions for those who dare to speak out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This trial has the same meaning as the one against Khodorkovsky," said Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister turned opposition leader, referring to the jailed oligarch &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/mikhail-khodorkovsky" title=""&gt;Mikhail Khodorkovsky&lt;/a&gt;. "Khodorkovsky was tried in order to frighten business. Navalny is being tried in an attempt to scare and stop civil society, protest and activism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navalny, represented by two defence lawyers, will argue that he did not lead a criminal group to embezzle 16m roubles (£333,000) from Kirovles, a state-run timber firm, while advising the region's liberal governor, Nikita Belykh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I plan on fully showing my innocence and that this is a political trial," Navalny said. He thanked journalists and supporters for making the voyage to Kirov despite Wednesday's quick hearing: "It's not for nothing – we are fighting for ourselves, for our families, for our freedom. We will be victorious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100 local and visiting supporters occupied a square near the courthouse as Navalny's trial got underway. "We came here to support Navalny and to be a part of history – we will be telling our children about this," Denis Svidayev, 26, a small business owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can't say that Putin is guilty of absolutely everything that is wrong in the country but yes, he and his team are also guilty," he said. "The worst punishment that thieving officials in our country face is a fine. And every year it becomes more and more obvious that those loyal to government face no punishment in these corruption situations – and this all pours into our deep unhappiness with what is going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alexei-navalny"&gt;Alexei Navalny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/vladimir-putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/miriam-elder"&gt;Miriam Elder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The measures also ban abortion based on genetic selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abortion-rights activists say the measures, which come into effect on 1 August, are aimed at closing the state's sole abortion clinic, the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 10 states have passed bills banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy on the premise that a foetus can feel pain at that stage, but research is split on the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota politicians also moved last month to seek a referendum defining life as starting at conception, in effect banning abortion in the state. The measure is likely to come before voters in November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Reproductive Rights has said it is committed to challenging the foetal heartbeat bill on behalf of the Fargo clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based group is representing the clinic for free in a trial that started on Tuesday over a 2011 law banning the widely accepted use of a medication that induces abortion. A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of that law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Reproductive Rights also was part of a lawsuit filed on Tuesday that seeks to overturn the more restrictive of Arkansas's two new abortion laws, saying the near-ban of abortions from the 12th week of pregnancy onward is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group joined with the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas (ACLU) to file the lawsuit on behalf of two doctors who provide abortions at a Little Rock clinic. The lawsuit says Arkansas's ban clearly contradicts the standard of viability established by the US supreme court's Roe v Wade decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are asking the court to block an attempt to essentially outlaw all abortions past 12 weeks, so early that a woman might not know the complete health and status of her pregnancy," said Rita Sklar, executive director of Arkansas's ACLU chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit contends that the two doctors could lose their licences if they provide abortions starting at the 12th week of pregnancy, meaning the law denies "patients their constitutionally- guaranteed right to decide to end a pre-viability pregnancy." It names members of the state medical board as defendants because the board is responsible for licensing medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas's 12-week ban is tied to the date at which a foetal heartbeat can typically be detected by an abdominal ultrasound. The ban includes exemptions for rape, incest, the life of the mother and highly lethal foetal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose Mimms, the executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said anti-abortion groups were hopeful that the new abortion restrictions being passed in conservative-leaning states will land before the supreme court and be considered against new discoveries regarding foetal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't have that kind of information when they decided Roe v Wade," Mimms said. A foetus is generally considered viable at 22 to 24 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12-week ban is scheduled to take effect 90 days after the legislature formally adjourns, which is expected to happen next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/abortion"&gt;Abortion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/north-dakota"&gt;North Dakota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-politics"&gt;US politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans"&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/women"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Its full-year results also showed that growth in its core home market had slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The announcements made today are natural consequences of the strategic changes we first began over a year ago and which conclude today," the chief executive, Philip Clarke, said. "I've been working for Tesco for nearly 40 years and I can tell you this – it already looks, feels and acts like a different and a better business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's third-largest stores group said on Wednesday it made a pretax profit of £1.96bn in the year to 13 February, down 51.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reported a 14.5% fall in underlying full-year profit, largely reflecting the cost of a turnaround plan for the UK market, launched after a shock profit warning in January last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite heavy investment, the group said fourth-quarter sales at British stores open over a year, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, grew 0.5% – a slowdown from growth of 1.8% in the six weeks to 5 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was, however, at the top end of a range of forecasts of 0-0.5% and the strongest quarterly growth for three years, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesco's £1bn pound fightback plan for Britain focused on more staff, refurbished stores, revamped food ranges and price initiatives – all aimed at reversing years of under-investment and halting a loss of market share to rivals like Sainsbury's and Asda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it reviewed the British business, the company also took a writedown of £804m on its property investments. The writedown on the operations in Poland, Czech Republic and Turkey hit half a billion pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesco also said it had increased its provision to cover the possible mis-selling of insurance products at its Tesco Bank to £115m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings have also been hit by the impact of the eurozone debt crisis on eastern European markets, restrictions on store opening times in South Korea, and losses at the US business Fresh &amp; Easy. It has decided to exit the US altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh &amp; Easy, which trades from 199 stores and employs about 5,000 people, has absorbed more than £1bn of capital since its 2007 launch when Tesco was run by Clarke's predecessor, Sir Terry Leahy, but has never turned a profit in a market where it competes with the likes of Trader Joe's, Whole Foods Market and Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tesco's ignominious exit from the US will grab all the headlines but the truth is that even without the Fresh &amp; Easy debacle the supermarket would probably still have seen its profits fall for the first time in 20 years," said Phil Dorrell, director of retail consultants Retail Remedy. "Slowly, things are getting back on track in the UK. The question now is can Tesco sustain its newfound momentum and increase profits in a still challenging global climate? 2013 is shaping up to be a critical year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarke put the venture, which contributes just 1% of group turnover, under review in December, saying an exit was likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tesco's chief financial officer, Laurie McIlwee, said there was "a lot of interest" in Fresh &amp; Easy, with possible suitors for the whole business or parcels of stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're most interested in is those buyers that are interested in buying the complete business that we have in the US," he said, pointing out that a complete sale would remove redundancy and onerous leasehold issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Tesco would not conclude the process for at least another three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group made an underlying pretax profit of £3.55bn. That compares with analysts' consensus forecast of £3.5bn, according to a company poll, and with £3.92bn made in 2011/12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/supermarkets"&gt;Supermarkets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/retail"&gt;Retail industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The package was then sent to a Maryland lab for further testing, according to the law enforcement source. CNN said Wicker was now being given extra security protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said: "This time the system worked … it tested positive but the letter did not reach Senator Wicker's office."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no evidence that the ricin incident was linked to the attack in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ricin is very targeted, almost assassin-like, it does not cause mass casualties so would be inconsistent with the terrorist philosophy," McCaul told CNN. "A lot of members of Congress have threats and this is one to be taken seriously. Roger is a very nice guy and I don't know why anyone would want to do this to him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/04/roger-wicker-letter-ricin-90171.html?hp=t3_3" title="Letter sent to Roger Wicker tests positive for ricin"&gt;The website Politico reported &lt;/a&gt;that lawmakers had been told that the letter sent to Wicker's office came from an individual who frequently writes to politicians and have been told what to look for if there are more letters containing the toxic substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither US Capitol police nor Wicker's office could be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate speaker Harry Reid also confirmed the incident separately and Senator Mary Landrieu said lawmakers were informed of the fact at a closed-door briefing about the Boston Marathon bombings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident will rekindle painful memories in Washington of when two Democrat senators were targeted with envelopes containing anthrax spores in a wave of attacks across the US shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In total, five people were killed by the anthrax attacks and Congress was shut for weeks to allow offices to be decontaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the envelope testing positive for ricin follows another terrorist attack and comes as much of Washington is in a heightened state of alert following the Boston bombings. Tourists are still prevented from approaching the White House and there is a heavy security presence across the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, previous suspected ricin tests have turned out to be false alarms as a similar test response can be caused by paper byproducts, not the deadly poison. Non-toxic byproducts of the castor bean plant – the raw material for ricin – are sometimes used in making paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report for prepared for Congress in 2010 warned of the potential use of ricin for terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Persons exposed to ricin exhibit different symptoms depending on the route of exposure," it said. "Ingestion of ricin causes nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastric haemorrhaging and shock. With a sufficient dose, death occurs within three to five days. Injection of ricin produces severe internal bleeding and tissue death, which can result in the collapse of major organ systems.

However, it was the biggest earthquake in Iran for 40 years and there were fears of massive casualties yet to be reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani military official said his initial information was that 34 people had been killed and 80 injured in the country, saying all of the dead and injured so far were in the town of Mashkal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Geological Survey said it had measured the earthquake at magnitude 7.8 and gave its location at 50 miles east-south-east of the town of Khash, in Iran. Though the area is largely desert and mountains, there are several major cities, including Zahedan, 125 miles away, which has more than half a million inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Iranian told the Guardian that the small town of Hiduj, which had a population of around 1,000 according to a 2006 census, had been badly damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian semi-official news agency Fars quoted Tehran University's geophysics centre as saying the quake had hit the south-eastern city of Saravan in Sistan and Baluchistan province at 3.14pm and initially reported that it had killed at least 40 people. However, TV stations later downgraded their estimate to "several feared dead".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the Iranian Students News Agency (Isna), Hatam Naroee, the governor of Sistan and Baluchistan province, reported no fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Except for a limited number of villages, telecommunication services and electricity wires and water pipelines of other villages close to the epicentre are safe," he said, explaining that the region was sparsely populated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An official from Iran's Red Crescent Society told Isna that 22 search and rescue teams, including 17 rescue dogs, had been dispatched to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Pakistan side, the situation also seemed confused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have reports of three deaths near the Pakistan-Iran border in Mash Khel area of Panjgore district," said a local government official, requesting anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said about 40 people had been injured when wooden roofs and mud walls collapsed. The thinly populated district is one of Pakistan's most underdeveloped, with minimal telecommunication and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close to magnitude 8 means a powerful quake on a level with the one that killed an estimated 68,000 people in Sichuan province, China, in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said the depth of the earthquake may have saved many lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The earthquake in Iran was strong but fortunately its source was quite deep, about 80km [50 miles] ... the intensity of the shaking was less than it would have been for a shallower earthquake of the same magnitude," said Dr David Rothery, chair of the Open University's volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saleh Mangi, from the NGO Plan International, said he was in a meeting with staff in an office in Thatta, around 65 miles from the Pakistani port city of Karachi, when the ground shook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are afraid to go back to their homes and the government is telling fishing communities not to go into the sea as that would be very dangerous," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was concern that facilities associated with Iran's nuclear programme might have been affected. But the Bushehr nuclear power plant was not damaged, said an official at Atomstroyexport, the Russian firm that built the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iran"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East and North Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pakistan"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/earthquakes"&gt;Earthquakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/natural-disasters"&gt;Natural disasters and extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jasonburke"&gt;Jason Burke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/saeedkamalidehghan"&gt;Saeed Kamali Dehghan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Speaking on Tuesday, Very Rev Dr David Ison, who will give the bidding at the ceremony, said: "Mrs Thatcher wanted something that was very simple and it is not at all triumphalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At its heart it's a funeral like any other funeral, bearing in mind people have to remember that it's not a celebration of somebody's life, it's not a memorial service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an occasion to do the last thing that we can for a human being, which is to commend somebody to God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 2,300 guests have confirmed their attendance, including 32 current cabinet-level ministers and about 30 from Thatcher's government between 1979 and 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will also be more than 50 guests associated with the Falkland Islands, including veterans, to mark the significant chapter the war played during Thatcher's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Argentina's ambassador to London, Alicia Castro, has declined an invitation to attend the funeral, in what was being seen as a mark of continuing sensitivity over the islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US government's official presidential delegation will be led by George Shultz and James Baker, who both served as secretaries of state during the Thatcher era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, around 170 countries will be represented by dignitaries such as members of royal families, politicians, and senior diplomats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher's coffin is expected to arrive at St Paul's at 11am, when the funeral service will begin and is due to last just under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Thatcher's request prior to her death, Britain's serving prime minister will deliver a reading at her funeral. Cameron will recite a lesson from the King James Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service is a traditional affair and includes a selection of well-known hymns, including Charles Wesley's Love Divine, All Loves Excelling, as well as poems by Wordsworth and TS Eliot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the service, the coffin will travel by hearse to the Royal Hospital Chelsea and a private cremation at Mortlake crematorium will take place in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/margaretthatcher"&gt;Margaret Thatcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cass-jones"&gt;Cass Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He denounced the two-day anti-government street protests as part of a US-led coup attempt reminiscent of the April 2002 coup that saw Chávez ousted from power for two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That march will not enter Caracas. It is my responsibility as president not to allow this march – I am defending them from themselves," Maduro said from the headquarters of the state-run oil company PDVSA. "While we conducted a campaign within the principles established by our constitution, they [the opposition] waged an electric warfare, an economic warfare."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "We have proofs of a US-led plot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The march was called by Capriles after Maduro was proclaimed president on Monday without the manual recount previously agreed by both candidates. It is to be replaced with nightly &lt;em&gt;cacerolazos&lt;/em&gt;, a popular form of protest where pots and pans are banged for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capriles, who accused the government of planning to infiltrate tomorrow's march to generate street violence, had made frequent complaints about unfair conditions during the campaign. His objections included Maduro's use of state resources for campaigning purposes and his unlimited air time in the state-controlled media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[The government] are trying to hide the undeniable – people's discontent at all the abuse that's happened," Capriles said. "Our request has not been to change the results. Our petition is to have a vote-by-vote count." He said he would honour the results of a total recount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both camps made references to the April 2002 coup where Chávez returned to power after being ousted for two days following a deadly clash between protesters and government forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A group of Venezuela's fascists is trying to subvert the order just like they did on 11 April [2002]," said Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly, adding that the street marches and nationwide protests were a replay of the "&lt;em&gt;carmonazo&lt;/em&gt;", the attempt to establish a transitional government following the coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of a series of nationwide televised broadcasts, Maduro claimed the opposition had set in motion a US-backed coup against his government which had included boycotting the country's electric system during the 10-day campaign and more recently failing to recognize the elections' results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maduro, who was endorsed by Chávez before the former president died of cancer last month, had a 14-point lead at the beginning of the campaign but by the time he won two weeks later this had fallen to a 1.6 margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp drop in what many had predicted would be a comfortable victory was seen by analysts as a result of the disillusionment of Chávez supporters dissatisfied with the country's frequent power outages, looming economic crisis, chronic food shortages and soaring crime rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the country seemed set for a major political crisis, Néstor Reverol, the minister of defence, said 12 people armed with mortars seeking to destabilise the country had been detained. Reverol warned that no acts of vandalism would be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are obliged to exercise the legitimate authority that our laws confer upon us," Reverol said. "We will not allow one millimetre of destabilising efforts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capriles reiterated that he had called for peace to be maintained and emphasised that all he wanted was a recount of the votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The country needs calm, and that we know that we can exercise our rights without violence," Capriles said from his party's headquarters. "We are asking that votes be counted one by one. That an audit of this process exists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post-election crisis has left seven dead and more than 50 people wounded across the nation as pro and anti-government protestors clashed outside CNE headquarters in different states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The close margin prompted a call for reflection from leaders on Maduro's side, but Capriles insisted the government "was not reading the results". "They don't have the majority, we have two halves. And this isn't about one half running over the other one, This is about the two halves seeking out a solution so the country can move forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Maduro addressed the nation, Venezuelans across the nation took to their balconies and rooftops to show their discontent with a clatter of pots and pans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The town I live in is tiny and the opposition doesn't have any force. Yet the pots can heard loud and clear," said Marisa Bello from Elorza, a town of 24,000 people in the flatlands of Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/venezuela"&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolas-maduro"&gt;Nicolás Maduro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hugo-chavez"&gt;Hugo Chávez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/americas"&gt;Americas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/virginia-lopez"&gt;Virginia Lopez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

He said big corporations used the libel laws "to take journalist out of the game".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey Brown from Sense about Science which has campaigned for doctors and scientists who have been sued after they criticised big health companies said she was "deeply disappointed" the clause was removed but that support from many MPs on the issue had led to the government concession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amendment also included a clause, now struck out, which would have banned local councils and their subcontractors from suing anyone who criticised them in their performance of public duties, paid for by the taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley made an impassioned plea with his fellow politicians not to vote to remove this clause said that although case law had established, under the so-called Derbyshire principle, that councils could not sue, this did not extend to private companies such as Atos Healthcare, a company employed by the department of work and pensions, which has threatened disability blogs and websites with legal action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing with Bottomley, Khan said: "Just because a school, prison or hospital is run by a private company doesn't mean it should be insulated from public criticism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;English PEN, whose campaign for libel reform has been backed by high-profile figures including Stephen Fry and William Boyd said: "We're depending on the Lords now to deliver the reform that all the parties signed up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's essential that companies are no longer allowed to exploit libel law to bully whistleblowers into silence. This has always been a key demand for the campaign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/libel-reform"&gt;Libel reform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/defamation-law"&gt;Defamation law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/liberaldemocrats"&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/lisaocarroll"&gt;Lisa O'Carroll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; 2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
