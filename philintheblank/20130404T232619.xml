I have spent a lot of time in this neighborhood over the past several years. I hope this offers an accurate picture of that place. <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2013/02/20/red-roofs-of-yop-city/">Click here</a> to read part 1.</i></p><p>Both doors to Mr. Konate&#8217;s house lock from the inside, but not the outside. In other words, the house can only be locked when there&#8217;s someone in it.</p><p>The first door opens into a walled rectangular area of chipped concrete and dirt. A banana tree leans against the far wall and a few sagging clotheslines occupy the opposite end. In between, there is a tiled platform with a sink above it, a few orange-headed lizards doing push-ups, and the door to the house itself.</p><p>Fatou, the oldest daughter in the half-Malian, half-Ivorian family that lives in the front room of the house, is sitting by the door on a small wooden stool, slicing plantains while humming that <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N2my7aSjlM" target="_blank">Chidinma song</a> and occasionally yelling at her younger brothers, Abou and Ismo.</p><p>It is because of Abou and Ismo that the following phrases are heard more often than any others in the Konate house: &#8220;<b>Y a QUOI!?</b>&#8221; (literally &#8220;there is what?,&#8221; but in this context you can think of it as &#8220;what are you doing you crazy fool?!&#8221;), &#8220;<b>Il FAUT laisser!!!!</b>&#8221; (leave it alone!!), &#8220;<b>QUITTE la!!!</b>&#8221; (get out of here!!!) and &#8220;<b>SAUVAGES!!</b>&#8221; (Savages!! &#8211; often directed at both boys simultaneously). At 8 and 11-years-old, Ismo and Abou are highly skilled when it comes to unleashing terror and disturbing the peace.</p><p>Nico is the mother of Fatou and the two boys. If you find yourself sitting in her proximity (which you will because she will have offered you a chair upon your arrival), it won&#8217;t be long before you are digging into a titanic portion of rice and tigadigana or, if you&#8217;re lucky, foutou and sauce graine.</p><p>Nico is married to Ali, a tall, broad-shouldered Fulani from Mali. He is bald, and he has a moustache that confers great authority. Ali makes a modest income working for a small credit agency, but you would have no way of knowing this if you saw him on Friday afternoon when he strides home from the mosque in a regal boubou of shimmering bazin.</p><p>Mr. Konate&#8217;s house has four rooms. Ali, Nico and the kids in the first room, Mr. Konate&#8217;s daughter in the second, his other daughter and his son in the third, and him in the fourth. The second room was previously occupied by a Dioula (or Jula) man that was always late on rent, but never without a variety of females paying him daily visits.</p><p>Mr. Konate allowed him to stay for a time. They shared similar politics and Mr. Konate felt a certain amount of sympathy for his Jula tenant, who had lost his nephew during the post-election crisis of 2010-11 (accused of being a rebel at a Yopougon roadblock manned by Gbagbo partisans, he was dragged from a car and beaten to death).</p><p>I am also an occasional resident in the house, having stayed in the third room, an airless shoebox, with Faty (Konate&#8217;s oldest daughter), her cousins, her brother, friends of mine passing through Abidjan, and random couchsurfers &#8211; not all at once, but sometimes almost.</p><p>After Mr. Konate kicked out the Jula man and his girlfriends, Faty made his room smell like a swimming pool and I took up temporary residence in it. My girlfriend was with me at the time and the total occupancy of the house reached 11 persons.</p><p>But it didn&#8217;t feel like 11 people were living in the house. The living room swelled during champions league matches and nightly screenings of dubbed soap operas, but otherwise life took place outside the house. Under the mango tree between Madou&#8217;s kiosk and the garbadrome; in the hair salon or the barbershop; along the broken sidewalk. Nearly every meal was prepared outside and the kitchen itself was rarely used.</p><p>But you could (and can) almost always find Mr. Konate in his room. If he&#8217;s not there, he is doing one of four things: jogging around the neighborhood in a faded blue and yellow tracksuit that is two sizes too big (he does this every other night), visiting his mother in Sicogi (another neighborhood of Yopougon), watching football in the living room, or going to mosque on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Konate is somewhat reclusive, but he is not anti-social. Greet him in Jula and you&#8217;ve bought yourself a 10 minute conversation. Bring up Koranic scholarship and you might as well pull up a chair. And if you find yourself in the living room when Mr. Konate is watching an Arsenal match, you will hear a lecture on Gervinho&#8217;s tendency to alternate between brilliance and incompetence that may last as long as the match itself.</p><p>But for a long time, there was one person that Mr. Konate refused to talk to &#8212; his daughter&#8217;s boyfriend. Faty&#8217;s boyfriend (D) was a Gbagbo partisan, and while he was not manning Yopougon checkpoints and attacking anyone that spoke Jula, he was militant in his own way. Mr. Konate, who is originally from Bouake, the former capital of the Forces Nouvelles, was an outspoken supporter of Alassane Ouattara, Gbagbo&#8217;s opponent in the final round of 2010 presidential elections.</p><p>D was not welcome in Mr. Konate&#8217;s house. They rarely saw each other, but when they did, no words were spoken, no eye contact was made. I remember standing at Mr. Konate&#8217;s door with D, waiting for Faty. She walked out with her father at her side. Mr. Konate greeted me, looking past D as if he wasn&#8217;t there. For his part, D turned and walked away. For those who have been to Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, this scene &#8212; two people, standing less than 1 meter apart, refusing to acknowledge each other&#8217;s presence &#8212; may be unimaginable.</p><p>After close to two years of this, Ali intervened. Ali was a Ouattara supporter, but not an outspoken one. He was tired of watching two people whom he respected behave in this way.</p><p>Ali was an ideal candidate to facilitate a mediation. Few people in the neighborhood have more integrity (that&#8217;s in part because of his friendliness, work ethic, and love for his family, but also because of his moustache).</p><p>And so a Malian called upon two Ivorians — one from the south, one from the north — to sit down together in Mr. Konate’s living room. After a 30 minute discussion with Ali at the helm, Mr. Konate and D shook hands and shared a laugh.</p><p>No one told me about Ali&#8217;s mediation when it happened. I was in Bamako at the time. I would be in Abidjan several weeks later.</p><p>When I arrived at Mr. Konate&#8217;s house, I took to my usual post-36-hour-bus-ride routine: find the most abrasive piece of woven twine (the West African sponge, effective and less painful than it sounds) and seal myself in the shower for 20 minutes of laborious bathing.</p><p>When I opened the bathroom door, D was sprawled out on one of the couches in Mr. Konate&#8217;s living room. Mr. Konate was sitting next to him, watching an Olympique de Marseille match and eating peanuts. I was apparently bewildered. D smiled and began to laugh. Mr. Konate turned to me and said &#8220;i sigi, na dumini ke.&#8221; Sit down, come and eat.</p><p><i>I will post the final part of this story next week.</i></p><p><b>**NOTE**</b> This post touches on the 2010-11 post-election crisis, but it is not meant to be political in any way. If anything, I hope it offers a clearer picture of Yopougon, which is a more complex neighborhood &#8212; politically and otherwise &#8212; than many people think.</p><p><a

I will finish that post up in the next few days, but right now I want to write a short note about something that I think some travelers to West Africa are missing out on.</p><p>I spent a good part of last Thursday laying on a carpet, taking tea, falling in and out of sleep, talking and joking with a family and a couple of friends. I spent Sunday doing more of the same, only with a few card games thrown in and the carpets moved to an outdoor patio to profit from the cool evening air.</p><p>Travelers who are chasing sights and attractions have a tendency to miss this &#8212; the simple pleasure of sitting and being with people. Perhaps they don&#8217;t know that you can make discoveries about a place while lounging around a living room. Maybe it sounds too much like &#8220;doing nothing.&#8221;</p><p>If you are planning on visiting the region, go ahead and pencil in some time to post up in a living room, under a tree, on a street corner, wherever, with new friends and the only objective being to enjoy each other&#8217;s company. It will be worthwhile. Promise.</p><p><a

The best way to do that is to take your time, get comfortable, re-visit. The following is part 1 of a piece on Toits Rouges, a neighborhood in the Yopougon quartier of Abidjan. I have spent a lot of time in this neighborhood over the past several years. I hope this offers an accurate picture of that place.</i></p><p>When you arrive at the Cinema Boissy intersection, your taxi will descend off a small cliff. It&#8217;s hard to imagine where this crater came from, but it&#8217;s there and it&#8217;s unavoidable. It has been festering since at least 2010.</p><p>You will hear many insults at this intersection. Shared taxi drivers are pressed. They make 20-40 cents on every passenger. They need to get rid of their clients and find new ones. They will accelerate towards this intersection, searching for that perfect channel in which they can avoid both bottoming out and downshifting to first gear.</p><p>Sometimes drivers try maneuvers that are too ambitious. Sometimes they drive too slow. Once I had a driver that attempted to squeeze between the curb and a teetering truck, but the truck drifted to the right and blocked our path before easing off the cliff like an old man descending a flight of stairs. Our driver was irate. <b>&#8220;What is this!! ARE THERE EGGS IN THERE?!?!&#8221;</b></p><p>It&#8217;s not easy for aging woro woros to recover from this intersection. The clutch squeals. The coins rattle in the ash tray. But more seismic vibrations await outside of the car; the double-digit decibels of boissy&#8217;s maquis, a row of open-air bars, each one flanked by towers of speakers.</p><p>It is early evening and the maquis are mostly empty. Women are slicing tomatoes and onions and starting charcoal fires. In a few hours <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/05/24/kedjenou-recipe/">kedjenou</a> will be simmering and the whole block will be perfumed with poulet braisé.</p><p>Further down the street, there is a line to buy fried igname and alloco from a <i>vrai dame</i>, a woman that can cut down a group of kids with the slightest measured squint of her eyes, a woman that you&#8217;d be wise to address as Madame or La Vielle Mere.</p><p><a
href="http://philintheblank.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aloco_lady.jpg"><img
src="http://philintheblank.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/aloco_lady.jpg" alt="aloco_lady" width="700" height="933" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5343" /></a></p><p>She will smile and address you as <i>ma fille</i> (my daughter) or <i>mon fils</i> (my son) and for 200 CFA (40 cents), you can buy a filling portion of fried plantains smothered in chili and onion.</p><p>A good idea would be to take that alloco down to the end of the street. Odile runs a maquis there and she will gladly serve you a liter of beer for $1.40. There is a sandy tree-covered patio. The breeze is constant, and so is Odile&#8217;s chatter, which is mostly hilarious neighborhood gossip, with a few words of Baoulé thrown in.</p><p>A damp pagne may caress your neck while you enjoy your grosse bière and alloco. Boundaries between properties are vague here and Odile&#8217;s neighbors have a clothesline that runs along the back of her patio. They also have a small stand where they sell Mapouka (think Irish cream) and koutoukou, the local moonshine made from palm wine.</p><p>Decades ago, the lot across the street was a patch of forest and young boys would form hunting bands to kill snakes and lizards. Now it is a tired apartment building, streaked with mildew. On the ground floor, there is another maquis. On Christmas day, we shared a beer with Maurice here. He was on a date:</p><p><a
href="http://philintheblank.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yop_maquis.jpg"><img
src="http://philintheblank.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yop_maquis.jpg" alt="yop_maquis" width="700" height="933" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5287" /></a></p><p>It is dusk now and everyone is outside. If you (somehow) tire of Odile&#8217;s company, Madou&#8217;s kiosk is next door and a crowd is gathering for a Champion&#8217;s League match. You sit down next to Jean-Paul, who offers to share his spaghetti with you. <i>On mange</i>, <i>venez faire comme moi</i>, <i>je vous invite</i> &#8211; Ivorians have many ways of saying &#8220;come and and eat with me.&#8221; Learn them, because you should make the same offer when you have your own plate in front of you.</p><p>But before you eat (hey, the alloco was just a snack), you should greet the Vieux Pere and the Konate&#8217;s. Their houses are separated from Madou&#8217;s kiosk by a narrow strip of concrete, broken in places.</p><p><i>Part 2 next week</i></p><p><a

Another 36 hour ride with Sama Transport in the books. Previous trips from Abidjan to Bamako (in 2012, at least) foreshadowed traumatic events in Mali. I arrived in Bamako a few hours before the coup last March. Several weeks later, I had a flight canceled because a red haze had swallowed Bamako. The flight was rescheduled and then canceled once again &#8211; counter-coup attempt. But there was nothing to foreshadow this time. The war started before I left.</p><p>In Bamako, life goes on as normal (more or less).</p><p><b>This is normal:</b> I was in a SOTRAMA (Mali&#8217;s take on the minibus, a green shell ringed with wooden benches, infinite division of space, unlimited passengers) the other day and I watched a guy scoop up a baby from the arms of a mother who was burdened with several bags and a large plastic bowl overflowing with toothbrushes and tubes of toothpaste.</p><p>After she climbed into the SOTRAMA and arranged her merchandise, she did not ask for her baby back. Her baby remained in the arms of a stranger, who was now smiling and laughing with the woman&#8217;s daughter on his lap.</p><p>Two other women &#8211; strangers to each other &#8211; began a conversation that ended with reciprocal benedictions when they parted ways.</p><p>Everyone sucked their teeth in unison when a policeman stopped the SOTRAMA and asked to see IDs. But everyone quickly laughed when the prentike mocked the policeman and then dodged the outstretched hand intending to give him a playful slap on the head.</p><p>This scene of social harmony belies what&#8217;s happening elsewhere in the country. Cell networks have been cut by jihadists in Gao and Timbuktu, and those towns &#8211; and many others &#8211; may soon be facing <a
href="http://www.irinnews.org/Report/97320/Food-insecurity-the-next-crisis-for-northern-Mali" target="_blank">severe food shortages</a>. Timbuktu has reportedly been <a
href="http://maliactu.net/mali-tombouctou-privee-deau-et-delectricite-apres-le-depart-des-islamistes-temoignages-3/" target="_blank">without electricity or water</a> for 3 days (as of yesterday). Reprisals on the side of the Malian military have been <A
href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/23/us-mali-reprisals-idUSBRE90M1HR20130123" target="_blank">reported in Sevare</a>. And despite the precision of French bombing and the robust force that has been promised by other African countries, the jihadists are not planning on laying down their arms anytime soon. <b>*Update*</b> Many reports today indicating that Timbuktu and Gao could be in the hands of Malian/French/Chadian forces in the very near future.</p><p>While Mali settles into its temporary place on the airwaves, here are a few recommendations:</p><p><b>1. Be on the lookout for people who don&#8217;t know shit about Mali, but are using the current situation to reinforce their worldview.</b> I actually think much of the reporting from Mali has been quite good. Editorials, on the other hand, have been mostly awful. If you want to call the intervention a war on Islam or a French neocolonial adventure, make sure that you are, you know, informed about what is really happening in Mali.</p><p><b>2.

I was also here on this day one year ago. It&#8217;s quite a fun place to be on the 31st of December.</p><p>In early January 2012, I traveled from Abidjan to Bamako. I went to the <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/02/03/2012-festival-au-desert-in-words-and-photos-update-from-bamako/">Festival in the Desert</a> in Timbuktu a week later, where I profited from close proximity to camels and listened to Tuareg guitar as it traveled far into the dunes. On the bus ride back to Bamako, MNLA launched their rebellion in Menaka.</p><p>I was in Bamako for several large rebellion-related protests in early February. The protests targeted the government, but some turned their attention to Tuaregs in Bamako, considering them complicit in the rebellion. Many Tuaregs fled the city over fear of reprisals. But at the <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/02/20/festival-sur-le-niger-salif-keita/">Festival sur le Niger</a>, held in mid-February, Mali&#8217;s orbit seemed intact.</p><p>In the early part of the year, I was back and forth between Mali and Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. I <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/03/20/what-its-like-to-start-a-restaurant-and-catering-business-in-abidjan/">started a business with two former couchsurfing costs in Abidjan</a>, a restaurant and catering company that now has nearly 20 employees. We had our first <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/11/06/our-first-major-setback/">major setback</a>, which we have now recovered &#8212; and learned &#8212; from, and we have had plenty of smaller frustrations along the way. But 2013 is looking like a big year for us and we are ready to take this project to the next level.</p><p>In late March, I flew from Abidjan to Bamako. While in the air, low ranking soldiers in Mali&#8217;s army made their way from Kati to Bamako and began what would turn into a coup d&#8217;etat. Not long after I landed, the airport was shut and the borders were closed. Curfew in place, I spent the night with my landlord&#8217;s family. We ate brochettes and tried to identify where the different bursts of gunfire came from.</p><p>The north collapsed not long after the coup. MNLA lost out to armed Islamist groups and the region now flies the black flag, as they say. A separate Abidjan to Bamako trip was delayed when a counter-coup was attempted in Bamako and more recently, the Prime Minister was arrested and forced to resign. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has tentatively approved a foreign-backed military intervention in north Mali.</p><p>Throughout all of this, Bamako has been calm and mostly free of worry for a semi-expat tubabu like myself. But tourists have stopped coming and outside the mining industry, few people are heading to Mali to do business. Journalists now make up a significant portion of visitors.</p><p>I don&#8217;t have much to say about what has happened in Mali. I have no idea how things are going to turn out. What&#8217;s clear right now is that Malians, in both the north and the south, don&#8217;t have a hand in their country&#8217;s near future, a fact that is deeply sad and frustrating.</p><p>This year also involved two visits to the US, one wedding-filled and the other a chance to visit family and to send off my grandpa. On the first trip home, I stopped off in <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/06/14/walking-on-a-crocodiles-belly-in-lisbon/">Lisbon</a> for a first-time visit that included lots of Cape Verdean and Angolan food, cherry brandy, and a random reconnection with an Al Jazeera cameraman I met in Bamako.</p><p>A few other 2012 memories come to mind: saying <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/08/24/what-a-real-party-looks-like/">goodbye to my former DC residence</a>; becoming the partial owner of a <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/12/13/my-babe-maimouna/">handful of sheep</a> in Mali; <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73OY8NO2uyg">drawing camels with 100 people</a> in Bamako; visiting <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/12/04/kita-mali/">Kita</a>; enjoying Bamako nightlife with new and old friends; and spending another Christmas in Abidjan.</p><p>In 2012, my French and Bamana got stronger. I made some new friends, heard some new music, and managed to spend less time on the computer, where the majority of my income still originates. Most notably, I became a partner in a business that began in my former couchsurfing host&#8217;s mother&#8217;s kitchen and now has close to 200 loyal customers.<b><H3>2013</b></h3><p>Next year is going to be a busy one for the food biz, as we plan on relocating and becoming a more substantial restaurant sur place, while also moving into event catering. Many of our clients have asked if we can cater baptisms, weddings, workshops, etc. We have done so to the extent that we can, but our capacity is limited. Next year, we change this.</p><p>I have spent the past two weeks delivering a portion of our plates to clients, to see how we can improve our delivery system and to spend some time interacting with our customers (Faty and David did the same). One thing I have learned is that most of our clients really appreciate our service. It&#8217;s clear that they are willing to vouch for us and many of them have already spread the word about what we are doing.</p><p>I am very grateful to work with the people on our team and I think 2013 is going to be a big year for us.</p><p>In terms of travel, I plan on visiting Guinea and Sierra Leone in the first half of next year. I&#8217;m also planning for another stopover in Lisbon on my next trip back to the states. I&#8217;m overdue for a visit to Ghana, and I will make that happen one way or another. Other travel plans may be more spontaneous. In between, I will most likely be in Mali and Cote d&#8217;Ivoire.</p><p>Other projects for 2013 include: taking on another language; a new website; a collaboration with two Malian sister photographers on a mobile photo studio in Bamako; and some work with a dance studio. I also have big plans for my ping pong table, which is being housed at a friend&#8217;s in Bamako. If all goes well, you may see custom ping pong tables shipped from Mali in 2014.</p><p>Oh, and my sheep. I hope to have a lot more sheep in 2013. I hope <a
href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/12/13/my-babe-maimouna/">Maimouna</a> stays healthy and becomes a matriarchal figure in the herd. Or is it flock?</p><p><b>Also for 2013:</b> learn more about sheep.</p><p>2012 made possible by:</p><div

An armoire filled with fake plants, decorative plates and stuffed animals, with a TV as the centerpiece. This is where Arouna stays when he&#8217;s not in Bamako.</p><p><a

He carries this tool on his moto in case he needs to castrate a bull.</p><p>To buy a new sheep, you will spend 25,000 &#8211; 35,000 CFA ($50-70. In Bamako the prices are higher). That price is for a sheep that is several months old. A full grown male can be sold for as much as 150,000 CFA ($300 &#8211; and sometimes more than that) in Bamako around the Tabaski holiday. Housing and feeding the sheep costs very little if you are in a place like Badugu Djoliba, so you could theoretically make a decent income raising your sheep en brousse and selling them in the city.</p><p>Maimouna, however, will never be eaten or sold. Promise.</p><p>On my way to Abidjan tomorrow. Update on the food biz soon.</p><p><a

I spent time in 10 different Bamako neighborhoods. And I drew camels with 100 different people.</p><p>I conceived this project as part of a fundraising effort. I created an <a
href="http://www.indiegogo.com/camel-drawing-for-malian-refugees?c=activity&#038;a=335282" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">IndieGoGo page</a> and said that if I could raise $1,000 for Relief International, an organization that is currently providing targeted aid to several Malian refugee camps in Niger, I would teach 100 different people how to draw camels in 24 hours in Bamako. The final amount raised was $1,162.</p><p>In some ways, the video below is just as important as the fundraiser itself. There are many people around the world who have recently been introduced to Mali for the first time. They have come to know the country as poor, land-locked and crisis-ridden. The north is filled with terrorists and hardline Islamists and the south is a picture of state dysfunction &#8212; this is the story.</p><p>Here is what is missing from that story (note: it doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with camel drawing):</p><p><center><iframe
width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/73OY8NO2uyg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>I recommend watching the video in HD. If you are reading this in a RSS reader, the link for the video on youtube is <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73OY8NO2uyg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a></p><p>This project was one of the more worthwhile things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. Camel drawing provides an excuse to interact with people, to approach strangers, to sit down and laugh with them. It is a silly thing, but sometimes we need silly things. On Sunday, I was just as sore from laughing as I was from dancing. But I knew beforehand that this project was going to be fun. What I didn&#8217;t know was that it would also be a means to explore Mali&#8217;s ethnic and cultural diversity.</p><p>Thank you to everyone that supported the fundraiser. And a special thanks to <a
href="http://brendansadventures.com" target="_blank">Brendan</a> who took many of the pictures and clips in the video (the blurry ones are all me).</p><p>Feel free to share the video. Whether you care about camels or not, I hope this video makes you fall in love with Malians.</p><p><a

href="http://philintheblank.net/2012/08/15/25-kg-of-potatoes-a-day/">here</a>). When I wrote the last update, we were going through 25kg of potatoes a day and delivering 100 plates of food every afternoon.</p><p>In the past several weeks, we had been delivering between 180-200 plates of food a day and we were receiving more and more requests from businesses that were outside our original delivery zones. Things were good.</p><p>We have dealt with a few obstacles since we started this business. High food prices during Ramadan, a taxi strike, closure of the border with Ghana, and countless hiccups resulting from adjustments we&#8217;ve made on the fly. None of these can compare to what happened recently, however.</p><p>A while back, one of our delivery guys (we&#8217;ll call him D) was promoted to manage the other delivery guys and to prospect for new clients. We promoted him because, even as a delivery guy, he was recruiting new clients and expanding our business. D was friendly, charismatic and &#8212; we thought &#8212; exceedingly honest.</p><p>One day, D called into work sick. Several of our other delivery guys also called in sick. They said they had stomach pain, GI-type illness, etc. We scrambled and found a few back-ups, but many of our deliveries were late. Clients were unhappy.</p><p>The next day, we had a quarter of our normal phone volume. Clients weren&#8217;t placing orders. We thought that perhaps people were upset over the late deliveries. In any case, we had already started with food preparation (we start at 7AM), so we decided to pay our clients a visit (with food in hand) and see what was going on.</p><p>When we arrived at our clients that hadn&#8217;t called earlier in the morning, they told us that their food had already been delivered. Say what? They said that <i>our delivery guys</i> had already delivered their food.</p><p>We explained that we did not actually deliver any food to them and furthermore, we didn&#8217;t receive any phone calls with orders in the morning. Our clients didn&#8217;t understand. They told us that <i>they did</i> call in the morning to place their order and they had no problems doing so. <i>Wtf</i>??</p><p>Then Faty and David ran into D and a few of our other delivery guys. All looking rather healthy. All making deliveries.</p><p>It took several days to unravel the entire story, but here is what happened. D had approached a restaurant owner in Plateau with a proposition. D told him that in a day&#8217;s time he could find him over a hundred delivery clients. The restaurant owner was obviously interested and they worked out a deal. D then talked to several of our other delivery guys and promised them a larger sum of money than what they were making chez nous.</p><p>It gets worse. D then went around to our clients, distributing new menus. Everything was the same. Our logo, our name, our menu items. Except for the phone numbers, which he had crossed out and replaced. He told our clients that the old numbers no longer worked.</p><p>For many of our clients, D was the first person that they met. It was D that convinced them to give our delivery service a try. So when he told them we had new phone numbers, they had no reason to be skeptical. Furthermore, many of our newer clients had never met me, David or Faty. They called us to order, but they never interacted with us face to face.</p><p>So when we showed up telling our clients that they had not in fact ordered food with us that day, they were rather confused. They had no reason to believe our side of the story, because D and the delivery guys were the people that they were familiar with.</p><p>After several days, however, they began to believe our side of the story, mostly because the food this restaurant was serving them was nowhere near the quality of what we offered. At the same time, we went to la Justice to report what was, in our eyes, a crime &#8212; D was using our name and our reputation to steal our clients.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t with Faty and David when they saw D and our delivery guys working together, making deliveries for someone else, but it&#8217;s not difficult to imagine their shock. Later, when the story was told to me, I felt the kind of nausea that accompanies heartbreak and loss.</p><p>While we are currently getting back to where we were before this fiasco &#8212; our clients now fully understand the situation &#8212; we lost a lot of money in one week, and worse, we learned that several people we worked with, people we had come to trust, people whose company we enjoyed, had conspired to effectively destroy our business.</p><p>D and the other delivery guys have asked for pardon. Some of them have actually asked to resume work with us. We will not be rehiring any of them. Right now, we are trying to recuperate the money we lost. We do not want to place criminal charges and hopefully, we will be able to resolve this by dealing with D and his family directly.</p><p>There are many lessons to be learned here, and we have already started to make significant adjustments in how we run our business. Some of these adjustments concern the culture of our business and the ways in which we can ensure that everyone feels invested in this project. We expected many challenges when we started this thing, but this was not one of them. All we can do is learn from it, and hopefully avoid something similar from happening in the future.<b><br
/><h3>CAMELS CAMELS CAMELS CAMELS</b></h3><p>The IndieGoGo campaign was successful so I drew 100 different camels with 100 different people this weekend. I also saw 3 different concerts, a performance put on by a house of former street kids, and I made tracks through countless Bamako neighborhoods. Video of all of this is on the way.</p><p><b>That other thing</b></p><p>I voted in Ohio several weeks ago, and I&#8217;m happy to be in Bamako now, where I&#8217;m spared things like robo-calls. I find politics mostly disgusting and I have no words for what is going to be a multi-billion dollar election. That said, if you&#8217;re American, you should vote.</p><p><a
