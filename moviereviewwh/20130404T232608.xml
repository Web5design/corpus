				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearing a plot description that involves the words Swedish, teen and gymnasts, this sounded like a film that couldn&#8217;t fail. Clearly nothing is sacred as this work of first time director Lisa Aschan just seems rather aimless. Though I&#8217;m generally unable to evaluate acting quality in a foreign language, I will defer to my Swedish source, Jessica at <a href="http://thevelvetcafe.wordpress.com/category/she-monkeys/" />The Velvet Cafe<a>, in trusting that what is offered here is not all that special. Even if the delivery is beyond me, it is easy to tell that this is a film, whether from the acting or the directing, goes for a very emotionless approach to its story, which in my case left me largely apathetic. The lead, Emma, and her friend and/or teammate Cassandra share a somewhat undefined relationship that is at times friendly, at times sexually charged and at times downright hostile. Still, you don&#8217;t get anywhere close to their feelings so it all seems inexplicable, somehow teaching us nothing of their nature.</p>
<p>By far the more interesting character in the film is Emma&#8217;s younger sister. Early on, we see her at a swim class where one instructor insists that she must wear a top to her bathing suit to which her mom (?) tries to de-shame the situation. Still, in the reaction to this moment and her actions at other points, we see that this girl, very young though she is, is going through a tricky place with her identity as a female and eventual adult. Though handled better than the main plot, even this seems a bit icier than it needs to be. Everything is just treated more preciously than it merits. This may benefit the visual look of the film but the story is what ultimately</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While some worry about the risk, in modern times, of teens being told to grow up too fast, at least sexually, watching A Letter to Three Wives, I couldn&#8217;t help but think the adult women of the post-war era seemed slightly infantalized. After all, the film seems so much like a period version of Gossip Girl, complete with faceless narrator and a certain social scandal as the narrator, Addie Ross, informs three women that she is running away with one of their husbands. With drama that contrived, the film&#8217;s story is sure to take a back seat to its more fundamental qualities.</p>
<p>The wives, Debby (Jeanne Crain), Rita (Ann Sothern) and Lora Mae (Linda Darnell) each has reason to fear it is their husband who has gone as all three men seem to idolize Addie as the perfect woman (all the better she isn&#8217;t shown as who could live up to that billing) and each is self-conscious in their relationships, as evidenced by the three flashbacks that make up the bulk of the film.</p>
<p>Placing the story of Debby and Brad Bishop at the front is an unfortunate choice as it is the weakest tale and almost loses it at the start. He&#8217;s a son of wealth and she&#8217;s a farm girl who met in the Navy, but now in his setting, she feels out of place. This insecurity is understandable enough, especially as Addie is constantly referred to as the one everyone figured Brad would wind up with, but Crain&#8217;s acting is so heavy-handed it fails to deliver on the potential.</p>
<p>Things take a step up with Rita and George Phipps (Kirk Douglas). Their relationship feels a bit more grounded, though we see a tension in that she aspires to advancing in material class while he, as a teacher, pursues intellectual sophistication. Her work in radio, perfectly translatable to the television of today, risks being too pedestrian for George, and Addie happens to be sophisticated herself. Douglas is in fine form here in a lighter role than I&#8217;d seen from him.</p>
<p>The final story of Lora Mae and Porter Hollingsway (Paul Douglas) is more forcefully about class. This takes us clear back to the onset of their romance where we find her as a lower class employee in one of his stores. Being closer to the street, Lora Mae is a much craftier than the other women and this allows Darnell to really shine as she responds to what could easily be a problematic/coercive situation and plays it to her advantage. Unfortunately, the class chasm between them is a continuing source of weakness for the relationship.</p>
<p>Even if the story is inane, there are a few bits of insight into relationships and class here to make it hold on. With strong performances from Douglas and Darnell, as well as good comedic relief from Sadie (Thelma Ritter) as Rita&#8217;s maid and Lora Mae&#8217;s family friend, it ultimately recovers from a slow start to be a surprisingly entertaining venture.</p>
<p>3.5/5</p>

Admittedly a true alcohol dependence is a physical addiction, often hereditary, that can exist beyond a social context, but much of the excessive and destructive drinking and other drug use that gets tucked under a term like alcoholism has a social origin. Living in one of the heaviest drinking states in America, where excessive drinking is one of the few activities presented to singles, I could certainly relate to the struggle facing Kate (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in Smashed. One doesn&#8217;t like to choose between a social life and responsibility.</p>
<p>It is pretty easy to imagine a couple college students, light on responsibilities, meeting over a mutual appreciation for the party lifestyle. So Kate and Charlie (Aaron Paul) establish a relationship based on abuse with a group of friends and list of activities that all tend to involve drinking, but what happens when they move into the adult world that demands a bit more from them? Kate hits a clear decision point one morning when she, a first grade teacher, vomits in class and feels guilted into claiming she is pregnant. What follows is an interesting portrait of the challenges of recreating one&#8217;s life as a sober adult and also the closeted nature of these struggles. It is easy and even reasonable to look at Kate at the start and conclude that she clearly can&#8217;t be trusted to care for a class of young students but it is harder to navigate her needs to get on the right track.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen plenty of gritty films about addictions of various sorts that are agonizing journeys with a scared sober kind of approach. Watching Requiem For A Dream or Trainspotting isn&#8217;t likely to make someone want to start using drugs. Smashed takes a softer, more comedic touch while still being dramatic. There are unpleasant outcomes but there&#8217;s a softer edge to these harder moments and this makes for an appreciated change. Rather than engage in a hyperbole of life or death stakes, this is more about subtler questions of happiness and who one actually wants to be in life. Given this, certain comedic moments that go a bit too broad or dramatic moments that go too big do feel a bit out of place but generally it does get this tone right on the back of a strong lead performance from Winstead.</p>
<p>4/5</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_5176" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-host.jpg"><img src="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-host.jpg?w=300&#038;h=222" alt="Well I know which one I&#039;d pick." width="300" height="222" class="size-medium wp-image-5176" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Well I know which one I&#8217;d pick.</p></div>In spite being a pretty ardent support of the Twilight series, both as books and as films, I had a mixed sense of anticipation for The Host. On the one hand, my attempt to listen to the audiobook version of the source left me rather uninspired but on the other hand, director/screenwriter Andrew Niccol has rarely led me wrong and Saoirse Ronan is already one of my favorite actresses based on her work with Joe Wright. Based on the nugget of an interesting sci-fi concept and this talent, I hoped it would all pull together.</p>
<p>Niccol, well versed in the realm of sci-fi, is able to bring together the story much more effectively, drawing out some of the universal themes contained in the story. We arrive to this version of Earth well into an alien invasion wherein a spore-like being inhabits humans and takes over their bodies and minds. Melanie (Saoirse Ronan) is one of the remaining humans when she&#8217;s finally tracked down and, her effort to kill herself to avoid being taken over failing, she too becomes a host. Wanderer (the alien&#8217;s title) quickly discovers that Melanie is far from gone and a battle rages inside her head.</p>
<p>The typical alien invasion story would place the aliens clearly as an evil presence but this is much less clear here. We do not really get a lot of motivation for the aliens, there isn&#8217;t a clear sense of depravation or lack of space on their other planets, rather, the invasion seems to be an intended act of benevolence. These beings saw all that was wrong with humanity and intended to rectify it for the betterment of all. And the glimpses we get of their world is a utopic one, though we have no sense of how they accomplish this. It says something about mankind, something The Matrix also noted, that we see little value in an idyllic world if our price is free will and so as an audience there is still a natural opposition to the aliens, especially the particularly aggressive one, simply called The Seeker (Diane Kruger). If Melanie&#8217;s story is ultimately the best parts of humanity influencing this alien soul, Seeker could be the worst parts.</p>
<p>For all Niccol&#8217;s sci-fi polish, this is indisputably Stephanie Meyer&#8217;s story as it follows from Twilight in re-appropriating genre tropes toward the exploration of the inner life of a young woman, especially the power of love, both romantic and familial. For Melanie, her main sources of strength are a younger brother, Jamie) and a boyfriend (Max Irons). Whereas the Twilight books played very much as a diary in investigating Bella&#8217;s mind, by having two souls in one body, these thoughts can play out as a dialogue between two minds. Though this technique, with Wanderer talking &#8220;to herself&#8221; and Melanie coming through as voice over, is a bit rickety in cinematic terms, it does lend the bulk of the film&#8217;s humor, especially as it relates to the romantic interests in the film, of which naturally, this being Meyer, there are two.</p>
<p>Though not overwhelming as either a sci-fi nor  a romance, the combination of the two is largely successful in creating an enjoyable and emotionally engaging experience. Following up on Hanna (an admittedly superior film/role), Ronan again plays a combination of toughness and slightly naive wonder about the world, though now notably more grown up with the introduction of the romances. Whatever you may say about hints of conservatism in Meyer&#8217;s work, she&#8217;s never been shy about sexuality and Melanie is allowed to be a young woman with unashamed sexual desire. I call that a win.</p>
<p>4/5</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/riseofguardians.jpg"><img src="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/riseofguardians.jpg?w=630" alt="RiseofGuardians"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-5170" /></a>Trailers are an odd thing. Their purpose is intended to sell people on watching a movie yet more often than not, for me, they provide reasons to stay away, typically emphasizing the most bland and &#8220;broadly appealing&#8221; elements of a film, not the things that make it special. Rise of the Guardians is definitely an example of a film being undersold in advertisement as the focus on the Santa and Easter Bunny characters, each with silly accent and cheesy jokes (and character animation that leaves something to be desired) that made it seem too typical of the Dreamworks animated films that have remained well back of the Pixar/Ghibli/Disney standard.</p>
<p>Watching the whole film is rather another experience. The character design remains a major weak point for the film but the rest of the animation is stunning with a combination of fairly realistic looking settings slamming into a great sense of the fantastic. Getting past the somewhat unfortunate voice work from Alec Baldwin as Santa, there is a gentle heart to the story and a fun interplay between the other guardians that include the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Sandman and, in response to a new threat posed by the Boogeyman, the newest guardian, Jack Frost.</p>
<p>Each character faces their own identity crisis that leads them to be a bit competitive as they strive to maintain the belief of children. While on the surface level this is the belief in the actual guardian, it is really what each represents about childhood that is put in question. In this way, the Boogeyman&#8217;s nightmares represent an end of innocence, but not in the healthy process of aging but in an abrupt and disturbing way. The film allows us to spend time in each guardian&#8217;s world, appreciating the distinct look of each and how it fits into their aspect. We also feel for Jack Frost&#8217;s sense of inadequacy next to these heavy hitters of holiday mythology as he tries to discover what he has to offer (besides annoying people with freezing temperatures into April, you listening to me Frosty?).</p>
<p>What also helps Guardians stand out from the typical is the effectiveness of the Boogeyman as a villain, in part due to the voice work of Jude Law. With echoes of Wreck-It-Ralph, this is a bad guy humanized. Unlike the Disney film, he remains the clear villain of the picture but his weakness is not so different as that of the guardians, he just wants to be relevant. When your effect on people is to give them nightmares it is hard not to be a villain, though perhaps the film does miss a beat by not noting the appeal of a good scare, whether it is childish ghost stories or adult horror films. In an otherwise very enjoyable film, this inability to take the final step is what keeps it from transcendence on the level of the best animated films. Still, after watching the trailer, I wasn&#8217;t expecting to talk about barely missed transcendence so that is a clear victory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apparently I didn&#8217;t learn the lesson I was supposed to by watching Hud. In reading a few things after finishing the film, it seems the message I am supposed to take home is that Hud is a bad man who ultimately drives people away. Hud certainly isn&#8217;t a good man but I give a lot of credit to Paul Newman for making the character seem like a complicated individual with easily acknowledge flaws but perhaps values that go unappreciated by those around him.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.soundonsight.org/introverted-perspectives-the-quiet-passive-observer/" />Sound on Sight</a> recently had an article about the practice of having a quieter character in the lead to observe the action around from a more grounded place and Hud is actually placed more firmly in the viewpoint of Hud&#8217;s nephew, Lonnie. An only child who has lost his parents, Lon is seeking both father figure and older brother in Hud but is caught between seeing the appeal in Hud&#8217;s freer lifestyle and the stern responsibility of his grandfather, Homer.</p>
<p>While Hud&#8217;s drinking and womanizing gets him into a certain amount of trouble, Homer&#8217;s principled naivety also puts the family at risk. If the film has a flaw, it is in being too decisive in passing verdict in this tug-of-war. Even though Newman&#8217;s performance sets the stage for a slightly more nuanced battle, the character is ultimately constrained. This holds it a step short of greatness for me. Bonus points for Newman making a salad dressing joke though.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_5160" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gatekeepers.jpg"><img src="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gatekeepers.jpg?w=300&#038;h=199" alt="Six heads, talking." width="300" height="199" class="size-medium wp-image-5160" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Six heads, talking.</p></div>The Israel-Palestine conflict is a tragic example of path dependence. Whether or not the formation of the modern country of Israel in 1948 itself was an action that could have resolved itself toward peace in time, as one prescient quote discussed in The Gatekeepers, a new Oscar-nominated documentary about the conflict, describes, the occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank following the Six Day War may have been a predictably bad decision. Unfortunately, what might have more easily been not done in 1967 is much more problematic to undo in 2013. Interviewing six heads of the secretive Shin Bet (seemingly the MI5 to Mossad&#8217;s MI6, focusing on domestic security concerns), the documentary looks for some insight into what has been learned from the actions of the past few decades.</p>
<p>As a documentary it is a curiously mixed bag. While mostly it is pretty conventional talking heads stuff with occasional archival footage, there are occasions when it throws in sort of video game-style animated reenactments. This almost seems needlessly elaborate as it doesn&#8217;t really provide much beyond a stylistic calling card (especially as it fades to photograph, tying the reenactment back into reality). More problematic is that the film seems overly concerned with replaying the history of Shin Bet&#8217;s actions. I certainly am no expert on these stories but nor does a fairly detailed knowledge of these events really pay off in understanding of the nature of the conflict beyond what I would have grasped already.</p>
<p>Where the film would seem to hold the most promise and interest is in how this history shapes the future. What does the experience of these six men teach them about where to go from here. On this the film is frustratingly brief. Maybe this is because even given their experiences, they too are at a loss at what to do. They seem to acknowledge that an aggressive response is doomed to fail but perhaps the Israeli right of settlers and the very religious will continue to team with the Palestinian militants to deter any hope of peace. After all, as is made clear in the film, it takes a whole nation to keep the peace and only one person to break it. Maybe it is asking too much of a documentary to solve a conflict of this level but it feels a bit unfulfilling for it to offer so little hope.</p>
<p>2.5/5</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having The Crimson Rivers as my introduction to director Mathieu Kassovitz may have been a bit misleading. A juicy genre film, working the talents of Jean Reno and Vincent Cassel toward a satisfyingly gothic crime procedural, is worlds away from the serious cinema of La Haine and its look at the unrest among young economic and ethnic minorities in France.</p>
<p>Vinz (Cassel), Hubert and Said are three young guys who are in that gap after leaving school (not necessarily through graduation) but not yet having found employment. The film doesn&#8217;t provide an immediate context on the employment situation but often times situations where we would be inclined to condemn those we see as lazy and milking the system simply have no ready opportunities for success. It would seem this is true of the time of the film, much as it is a reasonable description of life for those in their 20s, especially without much education, in present day America.</p>
<p>I feel like I harp on about unlikable protagonists too much but as much as one wants to sympathize with the situation of these kids but they sure don&#8217;t make it easy. While not lacking some legitimate grievances in terms of police aggression or discrimination, they seem needlessly provocative. When they are being idle and having little moments happen around them, the film holds together, but in those moments where things get macho, it becomes a bit obnoxious for me the way that machismo often does.</p>
<p>If the laziness of the plotting and reliance on machismo inhibits the film, the humor that is allowed to exist between friends at other times works with the strong black and white visual style to make the film more engaging than it maybe deserves to be, though still less than it should be.</p>
<p>2.5/5</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_5154" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/springbreakers.jpg"><img src="http://moviereviewwarehouse.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/springbreakers.jpg?w=630" alt="All rise!"   class="size-full wp-image-5154" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">All rise!</p></div>For a film that opens with a high-energy glimpse of spring break beaches that could be pulled from a Girls Gone Wild video, the interesting thing about Spring Breakers is that a much more voyeuristic scene happens not too much later as a group of four college friends, Faith (Selena Gomez), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brit (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) just hang out in a casual way in their dorm as presumably girls of that age will do when boys aren&#8217;t around. It is not the slumber party of male fantasy but a normal hang-out still seen through a male gaze. In a film full of nudity and exploitation, having this scene seem the greatest violation of privacy is pretty powerful, after all, once the girls head off for spring break in Florida, it all seems so much less private and much more performative. In the age of social media, such debauchery becomes public and the only thing kept in reserve is wholesomeness.</p>
<p>With Disney alums in the cast, Spring Breakers is sure to be a film to shock the senses of many theatregoers, but even having seen Korine films before, it is hard not to be a bit overwhelmed by the energy of the first act of the film. It is the exhilaration of youth with that hedonistic sense of invincibility. But like youth or like the drugged high, this energy can&#8217;t last. It would be easy to punish the film for dragging into the second act if it didn&#8217;t make so much thematic sense. This section is the hangover of the first as the ache builds up inside, convincing you that you both want to never experience that again or else need it to return to that right away.</p>
<p>The choice one makes in response to this feeling is a critical one as we see in the film that those who refuse to get older and leave behind this hedonism become increasingly trapped by it, none more so than Alien (James Franco), a white rapper/gangster who takes the girls in. Though not out of place with the aggressive tone of the film, Franco does seem the film&#8217;s biggest weak point as his character is just too much of a type and doesn&#8217;t really exude a charm or appeal that would believably draw the girls in like he does.</p>
<p>Spring Breakers is ultimately a film that makes you ask questions of yourself. While I never got involved in &#8220;spring break&#8221; style craziness, as I recently crossed the threshold into my 30s I&#8217;ve been forced to think a bit about my own short-cuts to sensations of happiness and consider what can provide less illusory contentment. I&#8217;m still not sure what that answer is so for now I think I&#8217;ll hydrate and take an aspirin, may I never feel like this again</p>
