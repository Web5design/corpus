What happened to Earth Hour 2013?</p> <p>It&#8217;s that time-of-year for the hour of Green Darkness. But how times have changed.  On Their-ABC, the only mention I can find is this: &#8220;Is Earth Hour dead?&#8220;  The Age and The SMH pay lip-service to Earth Hour with an article in today. But there is nothing like the hype of previous years. The Guardian puts on the best spin, but concede Lomborg might be right. Even the Huff Po is telling us it&#8217;s a waste of time.</p> <p>It appears Lomborg took the fun out of it by pointing out that Earth Hour was a waste-of-time token that produced more emissions than it saved.</p> <p>Earth Hour teaches us that tackling global warming is easy,&#8221; Lomborg writes at Slate. &#8220;Yet, by switching off the lights, all we are doing is making it harder to see.&#8221;</p> <p>How so? Well, for starters, Lomborg argues that more than a billion impoverished people around the world have no switch to flip, lacking the electricity that we take for granted. Earth Hour, he implies, demonizes a technology that has lifted great swaths of humanity from lives of [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.3" /></div><div>Rating: 9.3/<strong>10</strong> (46 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>People across the UK are rolling in the aisles in laughter.</p> <p>Lewandowsky&#8217;s latest paper, &#8220;Recursive Fury&#8221; (which has just reappeared),  categorized a comment by Richard Betts under the heading &#8220;Excerpt Espousing Conspiracy Theory&#8221; (in the supplemental data). But instead of being a comment from a rabid tin-foil-hat skeptic, Betts turns out to be Head of Climate Impacts at the UK Met Office and an IPCC lead author.</p> <p>When Betts was informed about this by Barry Woods, he tweeted &#8220;Lewandowsky et al clearly deluded!&#8221;</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the comment by Betts that Lewandowsky et al think demonstrates conspiracist ideation. Betts is pointing out how easily the authors of the original paper (claiming that skeptics-believe-the-moon-landing-was-faked) could have posted their survey link in places where skeptics were actually likely to see it. The Moon landing paper &#8212; after all &#8212; claimed to analyze skeptics but ended up getting results only from sites that were virulently anti-skeptic.</p> <p>Richard Betts: &#8220;The thing I don’t understand is, why didn’t they just make a post on sceptic blogs themselves, rather than approaching blog owners. They could have posted as a Discussion topic here at Bishop Hill without even asking the host, and I very much doubt that the Bish [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.2" /></div><div>Rating: 9.2/<strong>10</strong> (66 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

Discussing science with &#8220;climate deniers&#8221;  is like &#8220;talking to a wall&#8221; he says. We agree &#8212; anyone who denies we have a climate is thick-as-a-brick. Have you ever met one? No, neither have I. The mythical climate denier seems to be causing global warming through their inaction, but no one as yet, can name a single person who denies the climate.</p> <p>I&#8217;m sure Hoffman wouldn&#8217;t want to be loose and inaccurate with his words &#8212; so no doubt he will find an actual &#8220;climate denier&#8221; or start to speak English instead.</p> <p>Perhaps the debate he says he wants, will start when we speak the same language?</p> <p>It&#8217;s obvious the Great Global Warming Scare is unravelling when the losing team turn into sour-puss-psychologists &#8212; finding dark mental failings in those too stupid to understand their Gift with The Weather.</p> When it comes to pop-psychology anyone can play&#8230; <p>Hoffman thinks skeptics aren&#8217;t convinced because they are afraid:</p> <p>MANY climate sceptics [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.6" /></div><div>Rating: 9.6/<strong>10</strong> (73 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

In previous bank bailouts, if anyone took any losses it was the shareholders and the bond holders, and the depositors did not lose any money.

		<description><![CDATA[<p class="wp-caption-text">Hyperia &#124; Credit Wikimedia</p> <p>Despite the fuss about CO2 emissions, on a global scale no one is quite sure where a lot of it ends up. Those mystery &#8220;sinks&#8221; draw in a large proportion of CO2. Here&#8217;s a big sink that just got twice as big.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Science Daily  Mar. 17, 2013 — Models of carbon dioxide in the world&#8217;s oceans need to be revised, according to new work by UC Irvine and other scientists published online Sunday in Nature Geoscience. Trillions of plankton near the surface of warm waters are far more carbon-rich than has long been thought, they found. Global marine temperature fluctuations could mean that tiny Prochlorococcus and other microbes digest double the carbon previously calculated.</p> <p>The trouble started when someone made an assumption. </p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">In making their findings, the researchers have upended a decades-old core principle of marine science known as the Redfield ratio, named for famed oceanographer Alfred Redfield. He concluded in 1934 that from the top of the world&#8217;s oceans to their cool, dark depths, both plankton and the materials they excrete contain the same ratio (106:16:1) of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">But as any gardener who has [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=8.8" /></div><div>Rating: 8.8/<strong>10</strong> (51 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

And they were probably born yesterday.</p> <p>Summer here was so scorchingly awful it was Angry. But a funny thing happened on the orbit overhead. Check out the UAH satellite data on summers since the UAH records began.  The graph below (thanks to Ken) is the temperature data from the NASA satellites, processed by UAH (University of Alabama in Huntsville). Strangely there is a disparity between what the satellites recorded and the BOM.</p> <p>The satellite data shows that the summer of 2012-2013 was close to ordinary, compared with the entire satellite record going back to 1979. Not a record. Not even extreme?</p> <p class="wp-caption-text">According to UAH satellite measurements summer in early 2013 was not a record. Not even close.</p> <p>The graph data comes thanks to John Christy, Director, Earth System Science Center, Distinguished Professor, Atmospheric Science University of Alabama in Huntsville, Alabama State Climatologist and Roy Spencer. It was graphed by Ken Stewart at KensKingdom, and inspired by Tom Quirk at Quadrant. I was very happy to connect them this weekend.
