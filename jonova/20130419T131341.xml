		<description><![CDATA[<p>The EU is a basket-case, teetering, so when the European Parliament had the chance to &#8220;fix&#8221; the carbon market yesterday, they surprised everyone and chose not to. Being unfixed, it&#8217;s free to collapse, which it did and by 40%.</p> <p>The Economist headline today is &#8220;Carbon Trading Below Junk Status&#8221;.</p> <p>The EU carbon market once was around â‚¬22/tCO2 (that was 2008). Australia turned up five years late to the party, and is still trying to trade at similar rates.</p> <p>Today Point Carbon is listing the carbon price as &#8220;â‚¬2.80&#8220;.Â  Obviously, subject to change, and possibly trending-to-zero.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">[BusinessTimes] &#8220;Campaigners and traders warn the carbon price could now fall below 2 euros or even to near zero in the coming weeks, and government sales could fail if they don&#8217;t meet minimum price requirements, as banks that act as liquidity providers pull out.&#8221;</p> <p>&#160;</p> The EU carbon market is not dead yet, but this could be a game changer <p style="padding-left: 30px;">[The Economist] The rejection [of the bill to rescue the carbon market] was a surprise.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s difficult to say anything for sure about Antarctica because the weather is so variable. Bumper snow one year, not so much the next. (Noise and uncertainty is large). But 800 years of ice cores spread across Antarctica shows the Surface Mass Balance (SMB) is more likely to have been increasing over the last century. (Which fits with what Zwally et al found in 2012 with ICESAT satellite data). </p> <p>Note the correlation of the smoothed average of the SMB (orange line) with Total Solar Irradiance (green line). </p> <p class="wp-caption-text">Antarctic Ice has been increasing for the last half century, and over 800 years it correlates with solar radiation.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Stephan Lewandowsky&#8217;s work is a case study in government funded inanity. Some Australians are sure that burning coal will make storms stronger. Others are not convinced. In November 2012 Lewandowsky&#8217;s intellectual contribution to science in Australia was to call the unconvinced &#8220;stupid&#8221;. If that&#8217;s not inane enough, at the same time he claimed that he didn&#8217;t recieve funding from any organisation that would benefit from his article.</p> <p>How many taxpayer dollars went towards funding that? No conflict of interest?</p> <p class="wp-caption-text">Are Australian Research Council funds used as a form of third party advertising for Labor Government policy?</p> <p>Writing in &#8220;A storm of Stupidity, Sandy, Evidence and Climate Change&#8221; on The Conversation, his reasoning is like this: some scientists reckon that a very bad storm called &#8220;Sandy&#8221; has &#8220;links&#8221; to man-made emissions of a trace gas. Lewandowsky reasons that because those scientists are called &#8220;experts&#8221;, anyone who questions them should be called stupid. (He thinks this article and that tweet were overdue). Though, in a twist, apparently he doesn&#8217;t actually think the unconvinced are actually stupid, he thinks they are ethically &#8220;disembodied&#8221; people who &#8220;mislead&#8221;. (As an aside, notice how he approves of news articles that call them stupid even though [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.2" /></div><div>Rating: 9.2/<strong>10</strong> (89 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Tic, tic, tic. The sleeping MSM is stirring. Headlines no one could imagine seeing a few years ago are popping up on a regular basis. The backdown is beginning.</p> <p>For those who have not gone-over-the-falls and chained their reputation to a big-Green-rock, there is time to backtrack. This is a good moment to start mentioning that &#8220;things have changed.&#8221; It&#8217;s five years too late, but that&#8217;s better than being ten-years-too-late, and it still has a tiny bit of kudos for being ahead of stampede that is coming.</p> <p>The term du jour is &#8220;new evidence&#8221;. It&#8217;s the ticket back to reality, even though strong evidence has been there for a decade, and the lack of warming is just one more clue that the models are wrong.</p> <p>As far as I can tell, Geoffrey Lean is one of the commentators who&#8217;s been very much on the side of the global warming drive, but not a zealot. He allowed the odd caveat, he spoke of skeptics, but not of deniers. When the ClimateGate II emails were released, mostly he wrote about how they didn&#8217;t matter, were misrepresented, and the science was settled. Even then, there was a small caveat that &#8220;disturbing questions&#8221; remain, [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.8" /></div><div>Rating: 9.8/<strong>10</strong> (83 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

For those who have not already seen this (and I&#8217;ve received many emails about it) &#8212; Enjoy! &#8212; His turn of phrase is something to behold: the damning indictments carefully understated, yet laid bare. That the Royal Society President has been reduced to ad hominem attacks &#8220;&#8230; demonstrates more clearly than anything else the loss of dignity it has endured and depths of corruption to which it has been reduced under your stewardship and those of your two predecessors. &#8220;</p> <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 60px;">Â  &#8212; Jo</p> <p class="wp-caption-text">The Royal Society in better days: Boyle, Newton, Franklin, Jenner, Babbage, Wallace, Lister, Rutherford, Hodgkin, Shackleton.

		<description><![CDATA[<p class="wp-caption-text">Tim Flannery</p> <p>No wonder Flannery and co. are playing double or nothing. While headlines have shouted for years that vested interests of the fossil fuel players dominate this debate, few journalists point out that the renewables industry, carbon trading markets, and the climate-scary-science-campaign have an all-or-nothing interest in propagating alarm.Â </p> <p>As I keep saying, those in private business who provide real goods to real voluntary customers will suffer from a carbon tax, but they still have a market. For them it&#8217;s a &#8220;dent&#8221; in profits. We&#8217;ll still be buying coal, oil and gas for decades to come. In contrast, those who make a living from government funds could lose everything in an instant. Their wealth and status depends on a forced payment and a decision from one Minister. It is far more ephemeral and subject to whim. The state-dependents are far more desperate. The stakes are higher.</p> <p>Gillard calls the &#8220;climate commission&#8221; an independent body, which is only true in the same sense that any parasite can be described as &#8220;independent&#8221; of the host while being completely dependent on it.</p> <p>This shows just how independent and apolitical the Climate Commission reality is:</p> <p>Â The Australian &#8220;Abbott says Tim Flannery&#8217;s job [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.2" /></div><div>Rating: 9.2/<strong>10</strong> (134 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

You won&#8217;t see this in the new report.</p> <p>It was a major PR failure in 2007. The IPCC won&#8217;t make the same mistake again.

In the next report they plan to bury the spectacular missing-hot-spot images through &#8220;graph-trickery&#8221; and selective blindness.

The models have failed and they bury that undeniable result under the clutter.Â  (You&#8217;ll need to read the fine print).
