		<description><![CDATA[<p class="wp-caption-text">Tim Flannery</p> <p>No wonder Flannery and co. are playing double or nothing. While headlines have shouted for years that vested interests of the fossil fuel players dominate this debate, few journalists point out that the renewables industry, carbon trading markets, and the climate-scary-science-campaign have an all-or-nothing interest in propagating alarm. </p> <p>As I keep saying, those in private business who provide real goods to real voluntary customers will suffer from a carbon tax, but they still have a market. For them it&#8217;s a &#8220;dent&#8221; in profits. We&#8217;ll still be buying coal, oil and gas for decades to come. In contrast, those who make a living from government funds could lose everything in an instant. Their wealth and status depends on a forced payment and a decision from one Minister. It is far more ephemeral and subject to whim. The state-dependents are far more desperate. The stakes are higher.</p> <p>Gillard calls the &#8220;climate commission&#8221; an independent body, which is only true in the same sense that any parasite can be described as &#8220;independent&#8221; of the host while being completely dependent on it.</p> <p>This shows just how independent and apolitical the Climate Commission reality is:</p> <p> The Australian &#8220;Abbott says Tim Flannery&#8217;s job [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.3" /></div><div>Rating: 9.3/<strong>10</strong> (87 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

Eight months after Lewandowsky was so sure he had a &#8220;peer reviewed&#8221; conclusion that he announced his results in The Guardian and The Telegraph , the paper has finally been published.</p> <p>Lewandowsky et al claimed to show skeptics are nutters who believe any rabid conspiracy like the &#8220;moon-landing was faked&#8221;.  Their novel method for discovering the views of skeptics involved surveying sites frequented by those who hate skeptics.</p> <p>The survey questions included conspiracies likely to appeal to a small percentage of conservative or free market thinkers, and largely left out conspiracies that would appeal more to supporters of bigger government (like the idea that the rise of &#8220;climate denial&#8221; was a big-oil funded conspiracy). It studied big-government conspiracies and ignored big-corporate ones. There are gullible conspiracists who also believe in global warming, but there was no danger this survey would find them. The survey bias was so obvious, even alarmist commenters said they feared few &#8220;denialists&#8221; would take it. The results that were headlined in newspapers were based on a tiny sample of ten respondents to an anonymous online survey. Not surprisingly Lewandowsky&#8217;s university (UWA) received many complaints about ethics, methods, and the dismal quality [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.3" /></div><div>Rating: 9.3/<strong>10</strong> (154 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p style="padding-left: 60px;">If the Greens cared about CO2 they&#8217;d be very interested in ways to reduce emissions. But their selective interest speaks volumes about their real priorities. Anton Lang shows how newer coal fired powers stations run hotter and at higher pressures, and use 15% less coal to produce the same amount of electricity. We could upgrade our power stations and cut a whopping 15% of their emissions &#8212; which is huge compared to the piddling small, often unmeasureable savings thanks to renewables. Even massive floods that stop industry don&#8217;t reduce our emissions as much as this would.
