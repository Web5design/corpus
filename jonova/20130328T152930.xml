But they are not just looking for any old student. You don&#8217;t need experience, but to qualify you need &#8220;an affinity with climate change&#8221;. I guess they are not looking for skeptical students who feel an affinity with logic, reason, and empirical evidence?</p> <p>The reasons for asking the unpaid students is actually described as an &#8220;ambitious plan&#8221; to do a &#8220;thorough review&#8221; because there were &#8220;errors in the fourth assessment report&#8230;&#8221;. O.K.</p> <p>The Risk Monger:</p> <p>Maybe I am jumping to conclusions, but with all of the mess of the last IPCC Assessment Report (including a non-scientific WWF campaign document predicting the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers getting through the review process and becoming one of the IPCC’s main conclusions), shouldn’t they try to do a more rigorous review process this time around? Students, working for free, are not perhaps the ideal choice of reviewers needed to challenge the experts</p> <p>What troubles the Risk-Monger more here is that many environmental activists are working on their PhDs and [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.1" /></div><div>Rating: 9.1/<strong>10</strong> (24 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p style="padding-left: 60px;">If the Greens cared about CO2 they&#8217;d be very interested in ways to reduce emissions. But their selective interest speaks volumes about their real priorities. Anton Lang shows how newer coal fired powers stations run hotter and at higher pressures, and use 15% less coal to produce the same amount of electricity. We could upgrade our power stations and cut a whopping 15% of their emissions &#8212; which is huge compared to the piddling small, often unmeasureable savings thanks to renewables. Even massive floods that stop industry don&#8217;t reduce our emissions as much as this would. Do the Greens hate the coal industry more than &#8220;carbon pollution&#8221;? &#8212; Jo</p> <p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p> Ultra Super Critical Coal Fired Power gives a 15% CO2 Emissions Reduction <p>Guest Post: Anton Lang (aka TonyfromOz)</p> <p>It all comes down to steam.</p> <p>Assume (for a moment) that we have to reduce the emissions of CO2 by something like 20% between now and 2020.</p> <p>Previously I showed we could achieve a reduction of 13% in CO2 emissions from the electrical power generating sector just by converting from the current 70’s technology coal fired power to the newest technology USC (UltraSuperCritical) coal fired technology.

It is a sign of the times.</p> <p>The P.M. has bundled the Department of Climate Change into a nightmare acronynm:</p> <p>The Prime Minister used her sixth ministerial reshuffle to merge the Department of Climate Change with the Department of Industry, creating a new Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education.</p> <p>Is that DIICCSRTE?</p> <p>Gillard has made Craig Emerson minister of nearly everything. </p> <p>Gillard also appointed the former Woodside director, Gary Gray, to cabinet as mines and energy minister. The Climate Spectator is worried. Gray said something skeptical once in 1993: that the evidence linking human activity to climate change was ‘‘pop science&#8221;. Years later he apparently said he regretted the comments, but this was not enough to convince the religious that he has discovered the faith.  He made the mistake of saying there needed to be &#8220;intellectual challenge and debate&#8221;. These plain and sane words marked him as a confirmed skeptic.

The historic engines that propelled Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on their trip to the moon (with Michael Collins orbiting above them) have not only been found but recovered.

What happened to Earth Hour 2013?</p> <p>It&#8217;s that time-of-year for the hour of Green Darkness. But how times have changed.  On Their-ABC, the only mention I can find is this: &#8220;Is Earth Hour dead?&#8220;  The Age and The SMH pay lip-service to Earth Hour with an article in today. But there is nothing like the hype of previous years. The Guardian puts on the best spin, but concede Lomborg might be right. Even the Huff Po is telling us it&#8217;s a waste of time.</p> <p>It appears Lomborg took the fun out of it by pointing out that Earth Hour was a waste-of-time token that produced more emissions than it saved.</p> <p>Earth Hour teaches us that tackling global warming is easy,&#8221; Lomborg writes at Slate. &#8220;Yet, by switching off the lights, all we are doing is making it harder to see.&#8221;</p> <p>How so? Well, for starters, Lomborg argues that more than a billion impoverished people around the world have no switch to flip, lacking the electricity that we take for granted.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>People across the UK are rolling in the aisles in laughter.</p> <p>Lewandowsky&#8217;s latest paper, &#8220;Recursive Fury&#8221; (which has just reappeared),  categorized a comment by Richard Betts under the heading &#8220;Excerpt Espousing Conspiracy Theory&#8221; (in the supplemental data). But instead of being a comment from a rabid tin-foil-hat skeptic, Betts turns out to be Head of Climate Impacts at the UK Met Office and an IPCC lead author.</p> <p>When Betts was informed about this by Barry Woods, he tweeted &#8220;Lewandowsky et al clearly deluded!&#8221;</p> <p>Here&#8217;s the comment by Betts that Lewandowsky et al think demonstrates conspiracist ideation. Betts is pointing out how easily the authors of the original paper (claiming that skeptics-believe-the-moon-landing-was-faked) could have posted their survey link in places where skeptics were actually likely to see it. The Moon landing paper &#8212; after all &#8212; claimed to analyze skeptics but ended up getting results only from sites that were virulently anti-skeptic.</p> <p>Richard Betts: &#8220;The thing I don’t understand is, why didn’t they just make a post on sceptic blogs themselves, rather than approaching blog owners. They could have posted as a Discussion topic here at Bishop Hill without even asking the host, and I very much doubt that the Bish [...]<br /><div><img src="http://joannenova.com.au/wp-content/plugins/gd-star-rating/gfx.php?value=9.0" /></div><div>Rating: 9.0/<strong>10</strong> (80 votes cast)</div><br />]]></description>

Discussing science with &#8220;climate deniers&#8221;  is like &#8220;talking to a wall&#8221; he says. We agree &#8212; anyone who denies we have a climate is thick-as-a-brick.
