&lt;p&gt;Today, we're releasing Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter-music/id625541612" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter #music for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPod touch (3rd generation), iPod touch (4th generation), iPod touch (5th generation) and iPad on the iTunes App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fresh approach to finding new music by using Tweets and follows to power discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.tactus.com/technology/exclusive-new-budget-iphone-leak/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Alleged Budget iPhone Leak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been whispered about for a while now, but the above image allegedly shows the never before seen, rear shell of the rumoured budget iPhone. What do you think of this fantactus find? Could it really be the real deal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4236876/bitcoin-exchange-bitfloor-shuts-doors" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Bitcoin exchange BitFloor shuts its doors, promises to return everyone&amp;#x27;s money | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin exchange BitFloor is closing its doors, halting trading and announcing that it will return everyone’s funds. In an announcement on its main site, the company’s founder, Roman Shtylman, says that "due to circumstances outside [BitFloor’s] control" it "must cease all trading operations indefinitely." More specifically, BitFloor says that because its US bank account is closing it won’t be able to provide the same level of dollar deposits and withdrawals that it has been up to this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19-year-old entrepreneur Sarah Hanson from Seattle has found funding for her startup by auctioning off 10% of her future income for the next ten years. A unique strategy for sourcing seed capital, Hanson’s approach asks that investors take a bet on her rather than her venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/?cid=co7244464" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Is Forbidding Users From Reselling, Loaning Glass Eyewear | Gadget Lab | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is barring anyone deemed worthy of a pair of its $1,500 Google Glass computer eyewear from selling or even loaning out the highly coveted gadget.The company’s terms of service on the limited-edition wearable computer specifically states, “you may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google’s authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) has nabbed another member of Apple Inc. (AAPL) (AAPL)’s original iPhone team, hiring Richard Williamson, the manager who had led Apple’s mapping efforts, according to people with knowledge of the hire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney and Lucasfilm reportedly told CinemaCon attendees Wednesday that after Star Wars: Episode VII arrives in 2015, fans will see a new Star Wars movie every subsequent summer. These annual releases will include the other two movies in the new trilogy and several standalone films, which will focus on specific characters from the Star Wars franchise.The main episodes — VIII and IX — will be released every other summer and a standalone movie will be released during the off years, film sites reported when the news broke during a CinemaCon session in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest Iron Man film will be shown in a theater in Nagoya in 4DX. This “fourth dimension” experience will offer wind, fog, tilting seats, and odor effects. It’s unclear exactly what the smells themselves will be, but if Tony smells like his Diesel-made eau de wiseass, it wouldn’t be the worst thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soon-to-be-released app is called Glasses.com 3D Fit from Glasses.com, a new venture from 1-800-Contacts. It lets you see, through augmented reality, how dozens of pairs of glasses look on your 3D model. The app creates an accurate 3D model of your face, allowing you to see how you look in various styles of frames from different angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles and Women in Games International (WIGI) are working to create a patch that girls can earn by designing video games. The Boy Scouts of America introduced a similar game design merit badge last month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When anti-virus software entrepreneur Friðrik Skúlason teamed up with a genetics company to create genealogy website Íslendingabók (the Book of Icelanders), the idea was to map the family connections between the citizens of Iceland. However, since its launch in 2010, the project has morphed into something much more, spawning a new mobile app that is now being used to check if Icelandic natives are dating close family relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO of archiving service Evernote said his company will soon release branded hardware with partners, as it moves toward creating its own devices.“We won’t actually do the manufacturing, but we’ll do the co-design together,” said Phil Libin, who spoke to IDG News Service on the sidelines of the New Economy Summit, a technology conference held Tuesday in Tokyo.“Eventually, in a few years—three, four, five—I think we’ll be ready to do something ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235696/new-star-wars-films-to-be-released-every-summer-beginning-with" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New &amp;#x27;Star Wars&amp;#x27; films to be released every summer, beginning with &amp;#x27;Episode VII&amp;#x27; in 2015 | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you ready for a barrage of Star Wars films? Disney hopes so: according to multiple outlets, the company has just announced at CinemaCon that it will be releasing a new film in the universe every summer, starting in 2015. We had previously heard that Episode VII was destined for a 2015 release, but with today's development plans have become much clearer. Episode VIII should come out in 2017, followed by Episode IX in 2019. Those standalone films that we've been hearing about, meanwhile, will be slotted between each of those movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/pocket-send-to-friend/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pocket Introduces “Send to Friend” on First Year Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To celebrate their one year anniversary, Pocket (previously Read it Later) is launching Send to Friend, a brand new feature that goes beyond sharing to Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter. Send to Friend improves upon email sharing, which Pocket found people used more than twice as often as sharing to social networks. Send to Friend allows for better interpersonal sharing between friends and family. Content can be shared with a comment and a highlighted quote, and if the person receiving the shared link also uses Pocket, they’ll receive a Push Notification and the content in their inbox. Anyone who receives a link can save it to their list of stuff to view later, or simply ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235816/chat-heads-for-iphone-jailbreak-tweak" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Chat Heads, set free: jailbreak tweak puts Facebook Messenger all over your iPhone | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Facebook launched Chat Heads for iOS yesterday, the feature's functionality was limited. On Android, Chat Heads cling to the side of your screen as your browse the web, type an email, or check your calendar, but Chat Heads for iOS are stuck inside the Facebook app. Just 24 hours later, developer Adam Bell has created a tweak for jailbroken iPhones that lets Chat Heads run "on top" of iOS just as they do on Android. "I just got jealous," Bell says. "I wanted them on iOS." It took the 21-year-old Computer Science major mere hours to create a working version of the hack, which manipulates the way iOS handles different views to keep your friends' faces always on top. The Verge has confirmed the hack's functionality on a jailbroken iPhone 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/04/18/bitcoin-exchange-bitfloor-is-no-more-it-has-halted-trading-promises-to-return-funds-to-users/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Bitcoin exchange Bitfloor is no more, has halted trading and promises to return user funds - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a Bitcoin advocate, fan, or users, this isn’t good news: bitfloor is shutting down. During the Great MtGox downtime and trading halt, smaller exchanges, such as bitfloor, provided valuable market liquidity. No more, for bitfloor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/04/google-glass-resales/?cid=co7244464" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Is Forbidding Users From Reselling, Loaning Glass Eyewear | Gadget Lab | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is barring anyone deemed worthy of a pair of its $1,500 Google Glass computer eyewear from selling or even loaning out the highly coveted gadget.The company’s terms of service on the limited-edition wearable computer specifically states, “you may not resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person. If you resell, loan, transfer, or give your device to any other person without Google’s authorization, Google reserves the right to deactivate the device, and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund, product support, or product warranty.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/04/google-to-acquire-provo-utahs-fiber-transform-it-into-google-fiber/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google to acquire Provo, Utah’s fiber, transform it into Google Fiber | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less than 10 days after announcing that Austin will be Google Fiber’s second city (Kansas City, KS and MO, and surrounding small towns qualified as Google's first), the company announced suddenly that Provo, Utah will become the “third Google Fiber City.”Interestingly, Google isn’t laying its own fiber this time, but rather purchasing an existing network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57580161-94/eye-tribe-for-android-tracks-eyes-makes-fingers-obsolete/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Eye Tribe for Android tracks eyes, makes fingers obsolete | Mobile - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Demo Mobile conference in San Francisco, the eye-tracking software for Android known as Eye Tribe announced that it will release a developers kit for games and apps beginning in June. In its press release, Eye Tribe claims to be the "world's first eye control software" for Android devices. It lets users scroll down web pages, play games, and unlock their home screen, using nothing but their eyes. While devices like the Samsung Galaxy S4 claim to have eye-tracking software already, the handset's Smart Pause feature only recognizes when your face is looking at it, or away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4238138/twitter-unveils-new-music-service" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter #Music for iPhone now available | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week of teasing, Twitter has unveiled Twitter #Music, its new music discovery and streaming app. The new service is focusing on a recommendation engine that pulls in trending data from across Twitter and your followers to offer up music recommendations from the vast catalogs of iTunes, Spotify, and Rdio. The app will be available on iOS starting today, but there's no Android app quite yet. However, everyone will be able to access Twitter #Music through the browser at music.twitter.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/18/4236734/in-phase-two-of-rebuilding-effort-yahoo-releases-new-apps-for-weather" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Yahoo releases new weather and mail apps in second phase of rebuilding effort | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding Yahoo will require "a series of sprints," CEO Marissa Mayer told investors this week during an earnings call. The first sprint "was all about getting people to believe in Yahoo," she said. The next phase, she said, "is all about building beautiful products and executing well against our business strategy." That phase begins today with the launch of two new apps.Yahoo is releasing Yahoo Weather for iPhone and Yahoo Mail for iPad and Android tablets. By catering to mass-market interests like weather and email, the company hopes to generate interest across its entire line of mobile products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4231376/whatsapp-more-users-than-twitter-more-messages-than-facebook" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;WhatsApp CEO says it has more users than Twitter and more messages than Facebook | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular cross-platform messenger WhatsApp has found a home on hundreds of millions of smartphones, and in the process has surpassed some other widely-used communication tools. On stage at D: Dive Into Mobile, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said the company now boasts a bigger base than Twitter, which claims 200 million monthly users. And the company now processes some 18 billion messages a day, while by comparison, Facebook is processing a mere 10 billion. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, the app has also eschewed traditional advertising, and is transitioning to a $0.99 annual subscription model across all platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22166424" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Leap Motion seals HP deal to embed gesture control technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motion-control company Leap Motion has announced a deal to embed its technology within HP computers.The controller is able accurately to detect the movement of 10 fingers at once, allowing for intricate gesture-based controls.Initially, the product will be aimed at consumers as a gaming and entertainment device.But the firm's president Andy Miller said partnerships with car and medical industries would be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4231760/white-house-would-oppose-cispa-in-current-form" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;White House will oppose CISPA in its current form | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an amended version of CISPA nears a vote on the House floor, the White House has once again stated that it has fundamental problems with the cybersecurity bill in its current form. In an official policy statement, the Obama Administration said that lawmakers had not addressed several issues regarding information-sharing and privacy, and that "if the bill, as currently crafted, were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill." Instead, it urged a continuing dialog between Congress and the President in order to create a more acceptable version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4232436/facebook-reportedly-hires-former-apple-maps-manager-richard-williamson" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook reportedly hires former Apple Maps manager Richard Williamson | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook's "mobile first" push has obviously resulted in some big product announcements lately, from Home to an updated iOS app, but the effort also has included some high-profile hires. The latest, according to Bloomberg, is Richard Williamson, who was a Senior Director with over ten years of experience at Apple and who managed the team that delivered Apple Maps. The app's rocky launch apparently led to Williamson's ouster in November of last year, but Facebook has not been shy about picking up former Apple talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4232370/ex-google-ad-engineer-fights-back-against-advertisers-with-anti" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Ex-Google ad engineer fights back against advertisers with anti-tracking software | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Kennish helped to write the software that serves advertisements around the Web. First at DoubleClick and later at Google, he helped build ad servers and the developer APIs that link advertisers and ad products.But the more he worked on ad technology, the more concerned he grew about the data advertisers were collecting about him. In 2010, Kennish quit Google and started down the path that would lead him to create Disconnect the following year. This week the Palo Alto startup released version 2.0 of its browser extension for Chrome and Firefox, which thwarts companies that profit from identifying consumers through "retargeting." Unlike traditional ad-blocking software, Disconnect permits ads to load in most cases while blocking companies from tracking consumers around the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4232780/first-google-glass-explorer-kits-arriving-to-backers" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;First Google Glass Explorer kits arriving to backers, user guide posted online | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we learned that the first Google Glass units were rolling off the production line, and now we’re seeing the first units actually arriving to customers. Google+ user Brian Allgood has posted the internals of his Explorer Edition kit. And even though we already had a good idea of exactly what would be showing up inside the Explorer box, there are two surprises: a luxurious Glass carrying pouch, and a clear visor in addition to the tinted one, for those times when you don’t feel like wearing your sun-Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Google Glass user guide also is now available online. There isn't a lot new here if you're already familiar with how Glass operates, but it's worth pointing out that tethering the device to an Android phone with the MyGlass app installed will provide some special functionality (turn-by-turn directions and SMS) that aren't available when tethering to other devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4233310/isteve-steve-jobs-biopic-starring-justin-long-now-streaming-online" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#x27;iSteve,&amp;#x27; an 80-minute Steve Jobs mockumentary starring Justin Long, now free to watch online | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to watch a film about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, you'll have plenty of options before long: You could track down the aging Pirates of Silicon Valley, or wait for the Aaron Sorkin film based on Walter Issacson's authorized biography. You could hope that Ashton Kutcher's jOBS gets a release date. Or, you could watch Funny or Die's iSteve, an 80-minute parody starring Justin Long, who once portrayed the Mac in Apple's famous Mac vs. PC commercials. Jorge Garcia (Lost, Once Upon A Time) plays his partner Steve Wozniak. It's free to stream right now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2013/04/17/samsung-confirms-that-the-galaxy-s4-will-launch-with-all-7-carriers-in-the-us-this-month/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+TheNextWeb+(The+Next+Web+All+Stories)" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung confirms Galaxy S4 coming to all 7 US carriers: T-Mobile from April 24, Sprint from April 27 - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day after AT&amp;amp;T opened pre-orders for the Galaxy S4, Samsung has confirmed what we all expected, that the rollout of the latest blockbuster device in the US begins this month with all seven carriers involved — that’s AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, U.S. Cellular, Cricket and C Spire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is pricing the phone at $639 upfront, or $199.99 on a two-year contract, but the announcement from Samsung says that each carrier will dictate their own price and launch date, but we can expect more details “in the coming weeks” (some launches will slip into May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/17/4234398/the-legend-of-zelda-link-to-the-past-sequel-coming-to-nintendo-3ds" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past sequel coming to Nintendo 3DS this holiday | Polygon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nintendo will release a new Legend of Zelda game for Nintendo 3DS based on the world of A Link to the Past later this year, the company announced today. A sequel to the Super NES original, the game will feature new mechanics, including the ability for Link to become a 2D drawing and move along walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/04/17/twitter-now-allows-advertisers-to-target-specific-words-used-in-tweets/?awesm=tnw.to_h0dwy&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social%20media&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=Spreadus" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter now allows advertisers to target specific words used in tweets - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has finally crossed the rubicon and will allow advertisers to target ads to you based on the words that you tweet. specifically, the feature is called ‘keyword targeting in timelines‘, and its available today in 15 languages and all markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter previously used the content of tweets to fill out its interest graph for advertisers, but this update brings laser targeting based on the topics that you tweet about to the product. Twitter uses the example of a person who tweets about enjoying an album from a band. A local venue could use a combination of Twitter’s location-based targets along with a keyword tuned to that band to pop an ad with a link to buy tickets to that band into the user’s timeline as a Promoted Tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To mark their fourth annual 4sqDay (April 16 = 4/4&lt;sup&gt;2),&lt;/sup&gt; the folks at Foursquare have created a tool called Foursquare Checkin Visualization.

&lt;p&gt;A simple Blogspot journal is the center of a $20 million extortion claim and the alleged cyber bullying of one of the wealthiest men in America. Michael Pickens, son of billionaire business magnate T. Boone Pickens, began the tell-all blog last year, writing about petty fighting, poor parenting, and nasty behavior within the Pickens family, as well as his own drug abuse and depression. The writing may draw a sympathetic picture of Michael, but it's led T. Boone to sue his son over allegations of defamation and libel.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;: Quicksilver and the OS X App Launcher Landscape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Dan triumphantly returns from two weeks of crippling illness. So, the boys ease their way back into the groove with a grab bag of great follow-up, some &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; talk, and a longer discussion of popular OS X App launchers, including Quicksilver 1.0, LaunchBar, and Alfred 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://squarespace.com/backtowork" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[SPONSOR] Build a Website — Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is the easiest way for anyone to create an exceptional website. Pages, galleries, blogs, domains, hosting, analytics, 24/7 support - all included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/new-template-design-adirondack" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New Template Design: Adirondack — The Official Squarespace Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adirondack is a modern, clean design built with small business owners and savvy entrepreneurs in mind. Minimal navigation and full header images provide a bold framework for your company or brand. The template is characterized by scrolling effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re pushing out changes and improvements to Squarespace 6 almost daily, we wanted to point out a few recent updates that you might find helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/4/11/038-inbox-zero-and-new-projects-with-merlin-mann.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 70Decibels - CMD+SPACE - 038 - Inbox Zero and New Projects, with Merlin Mann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a very special episode of CMD SPACE Myke is joined by Merlin Mann to discuss Inbox Zero, starting New projects and a fun discussion about Adventure Time (as well as a little about comics, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/132" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 5by5 | Mac Power Users #132: Merlin Returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning for his annual appearance, Merlin Mann joins Katie and David to talk Evernote, GTD, iPad, Podcasting and his favorite Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Fat Cat Software – iPhoto Library Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPLM also gives you the ability to copy your photos from one library to another, while keeping track of photo metadata that is normally lost when exporting from one library and importing into another. Titles, dates, descriptions, keywords, ratings, faces, and place information are all transferred along with the photos, ensuring that you keep all that information you spent hours entering into iPhoto. Event and albums are also reconstructed when copied, and both the edited and original copies of each photo are copied as well. You can split up a large library into multiple smaller libraries, merge entire libraries together into a big one, or rebuild a corrupt library that is causing iPhoto to hang or crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Drafts: Action Directory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directory contains pre-configured custom actions to extend Drafts beyond the actions that come preinstalled with the app. If you have Drafts, browse this directory on your iOS device – when you find an action that interests you, tap the "Install" link and it will be installed in your local version Drafts. Any actions you install can be modified or deleted in the Drafts settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, Welcome. First of all. What is "MLPostFactor" you might ask. Well. As we all know, Apple has dropped OSX Mountain Lion support for older generation of Macs (2006~2008 Macs). The goal of the project is to support all those "drop out" Macs. So we designed this app to do just that. Read more @ Post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like speed dial, but for more than just phone calls! Launch Center Pro creates lightning quick shortcuts to specific features buried deep within apps. Call a loved one, message a friend, launch Instagram’s camera to quickly snap a pic, tweet, or turn your iPhone into a flashlight. Launch Center Pro gets you to where you’re going faster than ever before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/133" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 5by5 | Mac Power Users #133: Alfred 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Clayton Hoskins (August 9, 1920 – July 26, 1980) was an American child actor, most famous for portraying the character of Farina in 105 Our Gang short films from 1922 to 1931.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost 10 years of testing, Quicksilver lays the beta tag to rest. (If the lack of an eszett brings a tear to your eye, you can always reminisce by hitting ?S on your keyboard). What does this release mean? It means more than just a change in the version numbering system - it signifies a maturity of Quicksilver and a sign of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.qsapp.com/post/46268470658/quicksilver-an-interview-with-the-developers" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Quicksilver — LoveQuicksilver Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of Quicksilver v1.0, I sat with Quicksilver’s lead developers (at our respective far-flung computers) to gather their thoughts on this historic occasion, and to find out a bit more about Quicksilver behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Alfred App - Productivity App for Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaunchBar is a smart and powerful, keyboard driven productivity utility that lets you access and control every aspect of your digital life. Whatever you want to get done on your Mac – with LaunchBar it’s only a few keystrokes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/switch.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;LaunchBar - Switcher’s FAQs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve noticed an ever increasing number of former Quicksilver users who switched over to LaunchBar, so we’d like to provide an overview of some of the differences and to answer the most frequently asked questions in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Gilmer gets a job at a rural clinic. He finds out he’s replaced someone — also named Dr. Gilmer — who went to prison after killing his own father. But the more Benjamin’s patients talk about the other Dr. Gilmer, the more confused he becomes. Everyone loved the old Dr. Gilmer. So Benjamin starts digging around, trying to understand how a good man can seemingly turn bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve dedicated yourself to making the things you love, every inbox can and should become a well-monitored servant rather than a merciless master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, at the risk of sounding a little fruity, I believe that a life in which we habitually abandon the known Good Things in order to helplessly stab at ““managing”” a nebulous morass of chaoses that we can never control is not much of a life at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enchiridion (which translates to "The Handbook" or "The Manual") was an ancient book with codes of conduct, guidelines, and other helpful information for heroes. The book had great power which allowed it to tear open worm holes between dimensions in the multiverse. It was destroyed by Finn in "The Lich" in order to stop the Lich from gaining access to the multiverse (although, the Lich still made it. See "The Lich" for more details.)&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve got the joke right here in my pocket. You sense it even. You’re dying to make it yourself. Go ahead. This one time. Just do it. Whisper it. I’m listening.) Here’s the thing. That Blackberry Z10? It’s right for someone, somewhere. It really is. There’s someone out there who will take that phone home and love it. Just completely love it. Not in a romantic, or sexual way. (I hope.) But nonetheless, love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Tuesday, April 16, 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials could have something very different on their hands as they investigate the dual bomb blasts that struck the Boston Marathon finish line today: a potential abundance of photo and video evidence from the public. Government surveillance, while growing, still misses more than it catches. But events with thousands of spectators offer the potential for a detailed crowdsourced record of what happened. This public panopticon is changing how we see the world. February's Russian meteor was captured by many dash-cams mounted in Russian cars, but in this case the event is of profound interest to law enforcement officials, not just scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has announced that it will be partnering with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to help teens and their parents manage their privacy, both on Facebook and on the internet at large. The complexity of Facebook's privacy settings and what personal information is shared on the social network has long been a concern, and this marks the company's latest partnership to try and make things a bit clearer. The NAAG will work with Facebook to offer a series of informational releases and tools that it hopes will "ensure that young people make safe, smart, and responsible choices online," says Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. The initiative was lead by Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, and was announced Monday morning at his "Privacy in the Digital Age" event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing what appears to be an indefinite ban of its software from Apple's App Store, French app discovery service AppGratis is trying to make a case for itself with an Internet petition.A new page that went up over the weekend gives users a special e-mail address to send their pleas to if they want to "save" the company. So far, the initiative has accumulated more than 608,000 such messages, according to the page's official tally.AppGratis was removed from Apple's App Store earlier this month. The software would alert users to a daily app deal it brokered with developers. Apple said users could confuse it with the App Store, but its creators vehemently disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22157732" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Kobo unveils Aura &amp;#x27;high definition&amp;#x27; ebook reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebook seller Kobo has released what it is describing as a "high definition" e-ink based device.The Aura HD's 6.8in (17.2cm) screen offers a resolution of 265 pixels per inch (ppi).That puts it ahead of Amazon's bestselling Kindle Paperwhite which offers 212ppi on its 6in screen.The launch comes at a time when ebook sales are booming, but some analysts suggest interest in black and white e-ink devices has started to wane.Kobo is owned by the Japanese retail giant Rakuten which bought the company in 2011.In the UK it has benefited from a tie-up signed the same year with bookseller WHSmith.Kobo's chief executive said that this and similar deals with other bricks-and-mortar chains in other countries had helped his company enjoy rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4228248/netflix-plans-its-move-from-microsoft-silverlight-to-html5-video" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix plans its move from Microsoft Silverlight to HTML5 video | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month Google announced that Netflix was now available on ARM-based Samsung Chromebooks thanks to the use of HTML5 video — and now the streaming service has outlined its larger plans to eventually move to the format for all computers. Currently, Netflix primarily uses the Microsoft Silverlight plug-in when streaming video to web browsers, but Netflix's Anthony Park and Mark Watson point out in a blog post that the current solution really can't stand. Plug-ins don't play well with with most mobile browsers, they can be cumbersome for users, and perhaps most importantly, Microsoft itself may not develop a new version of Silverlight beyond the current release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4228700/pebble-tetris-clone-available" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Play &amp;#x27;Tetris&amp;#x27; on your Pebble smartwatch thanks to new SDK | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team behind the Pebble smartwatch released a "proof-of-concept" SDK last week, letting developers create their own watch faces and rudimentary apps. A few are already available on the Pebble forums, but the most impressive so far is a surprisingly playable version of Tetris. Once you get your head around pressing down to move right and up to move left, it's almost like you have a miniature Game Boy with a slightly better screen on your wrist. Installing Pebblis is a simple matter of clicking a download link on your phone, at least if you're using your Pebble with an Android device — iPhone owners will need to wait for an official app update, however, or try a direct Bluetooth workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/04/16/google-posts-mirror-api-developer-documentation-for-glass-as-first-units-roll-off-production-line/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google posts Mirror API developer documentation for Glass as first units roll off production line - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of Google informing developers that it’s ready to begin shipping out prototypes of its Glass smart eyewear, the company has posted documentation and example code for the device’s Mirror API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site instructs developers on how to build “Glassware” for the upcoming platform and provides sample projects in Python and Java. It provides guidelines for how to use the Glass timeline, subscriptions, location, contacts, authorization and media upload, as well as best practices, a reference section and a playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4229266/google-glass-specifications-announced" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google reveals Glass specs: one-day battery life, bone conduction audio, 16GB storage | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the first details of its Mirror API for Glass apps, Google has published a list of technical specifications for the head-mounted device. Glass features a 640 x 360 display that Google says is the "equivalent of a 25-inch high definition screen from eight feet away," a 5-megapixel camera capable of 720p video, and — as revealed in an FCC filing — audio that comes via a bone conduction transducer. There will be 16GB of flash storage on-board, with 12GB actually usable, and it will sync with "Google cloud storage" — presumably Google Drive. Glass will feature adjustable nose pads in a frame that Google says will "fit any face," and you'll get extra pads in two sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4229900/windows-8-1-boot-to-desktop-option" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Windows 8.1 will include boot to desktop option to bypass &amp;#x27;Metro&amp;#x27; | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is planning to change the way its Start Screen operates with the release of Windows 8.1. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans have revealed to The Verge that the company is currently testing builds of Windows 8.1, known as codename Windows Blue, that include an option to boot directly to the traditional desktop. They're told that the option is disabled by default, allowing users to simply turn on the functionality should they want to avoid the "Metro" Start Screen at initial boot or login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230274/facebook-6-0-for-ipad-and-iphone-hands-on-with-chat-heads-stickers" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook 6.0 for iPad and iPhone: hands-on with Chat Heads, stickers, and more | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Facebook is devoting some attention to iOS, with the release of Facebook 6.0. The new version has a few much-needed design tweaks, but the headline features are all about Facebook Messenger. First, within the Facebook app, you can pop-out Chat Heads for your conversations, but they won't work anywhere else because of the way that iOS keeps apps sandboxed. They are also adding 'Stickers' to their messaging feature (which are basically huge emoticons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230854/first-facebook-home-update-coming-second-week-of-may" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Home available outside US later today, first update coming &amp;#x27;second week of May&amp;#x27; | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On stage at AllThingsD's Dive Into Mobile conference today, Cory Ondrejka, head of mobile engineering at Facebook, announced that the first update to Facebook Home for Android will be released in "the second week of May." This is in line with the company's promise that it'd be updating its mobile apps on a monthly basis, but unfortunately, he declined to say what exactly the new version would include. Cory also mentioned that the Home download would start rolling out outside the US beginning later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/04/16/evernote-launches-a-new-accelerator-to-develop-its-app-ecosystem-taking-no-equity-from-startups/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote Launches New Accelerator To Develop Its App Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that Evernote is working to build a solid ecosystem of applications that use its service, but now it’s kicking things up a notch. Led by platform advocate and former technology journalist Rafe Needleman, Evernote will bring in the best hack teams to visit and work on their projects with the company’s developers and designers for a chance to be a part of the inaugural class.From April thorugh June, Evernote is hosting Devcup meetups and hackathons around the world, including in Berlin, Tokyo, Singapore, New York City, Columbia, Beijing, Austin, and in Silicon Valley. Six finalists from each city will be chosen and flown to San Francisco for the Evernote Conference in September to compete for prizes.The winners from the Evernote Conference will then spend October with Evernote working closely and receiving guidance on product design, marketing, and business development. It all culminates at its Demo Day when each product is demonstrated to journalists, investors, and other Silicon Valley thought leaders and experts.Through its partnerships, Evernote will also be promoting product development in two special areas. Honda Silicon Valley Labs is sponsoring a prize focused on use of Evernote and transportation, specifically on the best enhancements to the in-vehicle experience. In addition, DoCoMo Innovation Ventures, the VC arm of the Japanese mobile phone provider, is also putting up an award.For its part, Evernote says that it is not receiving any equity or “financial position” in the companies or products, regardless of whether it was created at a Devcup event or during the Accelerator program. Those invited into the Accelerator will receive travel and lodging expenses, along with a stipend and work space at Evernote’s headquarters.The launch of the Evernote Accelerator is fitting as the company seeks to further its status as a platform. At last year’s LeWeb conference, TNW’s Martin Bryant interviewed company CEO Phil Libin, where Libin said that the progression from Evernote being thought of as an app to a platform was always in its strategy. It has more than 10,000 third-party developers and many apps within its Trunk service. And as Evernote continues to grow out its Business product in Europe, Canada, Japan, and the US, finding a way to foster the develop apps that will suit its customers is probably not a bad thing for the company.?

&lt;p&gt;Jim Wicks, Motorola's design chief, said the company's first round of products designed after Google's purchase of the company will follow a philosophy of "better is better" rather than "bigger is better," Wicks said. "From a software and UI perspective, our strategy is to embrace Android and to make it the best expression of Android and Google in the market. It will be the unadulterated version of Android, and I feel really good about our embracing Android and being the best Android experience." The first Google-influenced Motorola phones will start to appear in the second half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;WARNING: MAD MEN SEASON 1 SPOILERS. Dan and Haddie discuss Google Fiber, Justin Bieber, Facebook Home's low ratings and equally disappointing ads, how to make those ads better, the launch of Handsome.pro, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/9/4204902/google-fiber-coming-to-austin" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Fiber coming to Austin by mid-2014 | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has officially announced the next city that will get its super-fast Fiber internet: Austin, Texas. "We are very glad that Google has been convinced to bring Fiber to Austin," said Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell. "Google Fiber will change how we live and how we work in ways we don't even know about yet." Austin will become the second US city, following Kansas City, to receive Google's groundbreaking internet service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/14/justin-bieber-anne-frank/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Bieber Hopes Girl Killed by Nazis Would Have Liked His Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a highly publicized appearance at Amsterdam's Anne Frank House, the site where Frank and her family hid from the Nazis from 1942 to 1944, an "inspired" Justin Bieber left some deep thoughts in the museum's guestbook. "Anne was a great girl," he wrote. "Hopefully she would have been a belieber."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/13/facebook-home-bad-rating/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Home Rated Just 1 Star by 44% of Google Play Reviewers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Android users aren't happy about Facebook Home moving into their Android phones. A day after launch, an astounding 44% of users who have reviewed the app on Google Play gave it just one star, with a mere 19.4% of users opting to give Home a 5-star rating. All that equates to an average 2.5-star rating in Google Play, not exactly an ideal first-day showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hate Facebook Home, watch a goat scream at Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook launched its third Facebook Home ad late Friday, the latest in a series of ads with questionable messages, including Facebook users' apparent inability to effectively remove themselves from their virtual experiences in order to have actual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software development kit (SDK) for the Pebble smart watch is now available for download. The makers of the smart watch promised that the SDK would go public once the watches began shipping (check out our recent hands-on with the timepiece/app hub), and Pebble has now made the SDK and all related documentation available to those interested in developing for the Bluetooth-enabled device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cellphone turned 40 last week. And it's a remarkable achievement. Really. It is. Even its inventor, Martin Cooper, thought that it would never beat out the landline. It may be hard to remember this in 2013, but when the cellphone was first introduced, it was a little bit like Google Glass -- a cutting-edge device that let you do amazing things but also immediately branded you as a goofball to the vast throngs of the uninitiated. In the '80s, cellphones weren't small devices. They were ginormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when I had started to wrap my head around the concept of 3D printing, 4D printing has emerged. The fascinating, if overwhelming, TED Talk posted yesterday explaining this next wave of the future—3D printed materials that have the capability of transformation. So, the fourth dimension is time itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr Storyboard recently interviewed Mike Breach, a New York City barista who has gained Internet notoriety for his wonderful latte art portraits. Breach began exercising his latte art skills last year as a way to relieve boredom while working at a hotel. You can browse his latte art on his Tumblr blog, Baristart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oslo-based Norwegian artist Ida Skivenes—we featured her whimsical breakfast food art previously—has playfully re-created well-known works of art with various food items on toast. Documenting her fun re-creations on Instagram, she has produced edible versions of paintings from Monet, Van Gogh and Dali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMG. It's one of the most popular phrases of the modern technological age used by just about every teenage girl in Western civilisation.However, it seems the 'Oh my God' initialism O.M.G. is actually very 'last century'.It dates back to 1917 when British admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher first penned the expression in a letter to Winston Churchill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Monday, April 15, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22134898" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Google chief urges action to regulate mini-drones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influential head of Google, Eric Schmidt, has called for civilian drone technology to be regulated, warning about privacy and security concerns. Cheap miniature versions of the unmanned aircraft used by militaries could fall into the wrong hands, he told the UK's Guardian newspaper. Quarrelling neighbours, he suggested, might end up buzzing each other with private surveillance drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/13/us-china-us-cyber-idUSBRE93C05T20130413" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;U.S., China agree to work together on cyber security | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and the United States will set up a working group on cyber-security, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Saturday, as the two sides moved to ease months of tensions and mutual accusations of hacking and Internet theft. Speaking to reporters in Beijing during a visit to China, Kerry said the United States and China had agreed on the need to speed up action on cyber security, an area that Washington says is its top national security concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/napster-fm-is-an-open-source-social-music-player-that-can-be-hosted-by-anyone-in-case-of-shutdown/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Napster.fm Is An Open Source Social Music Player That Can Be Hosted By Anyone In Case Of Shutdown | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of music piracy, there was Napster. On Sunday a service called Napster.fm popped up, a project started by Carnegie Mellon student Ryan Lester. It's a web-based music player essentially dependent upon “minor inefficiencies in YouTube’s piracy-detection system.” The project is open source and can be set up by anyone in case it ever gets shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/investment-firms-predict-aws-will-do-as-much-as-20-billion-in-revenues-by-2020-draining-it/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Investment Firm Expects AWS Will Hit $20 Billion In Revenues By 2020 | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Research has issued a research report saying it expects Amazon Web Services will have an estimated $20 billion in revenues by the end of the decade. In a separate report, RW Baird &amp;amp; Co. projects $10 billion in revenue for AWS by 2016 and up to $40 billion in losses from the traditional IT market. The estimates reflect Wall Street’s growing confidence in cloud services and the need that analysts see in letting their customers know that a shift is underway that will lead to continued flat revenues or even losses for enterprise companies and systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/business/global/blackberry-disputes-report-on-z10-phone.html?ref=technology" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BlackBerry Disputes Report on Z10 Phone - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry contends that a securities analyst’s report about its latest phone is not only wrong, it’s so wrong that it should be investigated by securities regulators. The report, issued on Thursday by Detwiler Fenton &amp;amp; Company in Boston, said that BlackBerry’s new Z10 phone is being returned by shoppers at an above-average rate. In a statement on Friday, BlackBerry called the analysis “false and misleading” and suggested that it was an attempt to manipulate the company’s share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one week after Rackspace announced it would take on a notorious patent-holding company, the company is at it again. Unwilling to pay a $75,000 demand to a patent troll called Rotatable Techologies, Rackspace is moving to invalidate its patent, No. 6,326,978, by initiating a process at the patent office called an inter partes review. "The trolls are bringing very flimsy lawsuits looking for quick settlements, and enough is enough," said Rackspace general counsel Alan Schoenbaum. "We see patent litigation as a threat to open source software and projects. It's gotten out of hand." Rotatable has said it's got a patent on the functionality that rotates a screen on a smartphone. That enables it to sue just about any app developer out there, just for calling up a simple functionality used by many apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/dont-let-verizon-att-run-roughshod-over-smaller-carriers-doj-warns/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Don’t let Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T run roughshod over smaller carriers, DOJ warns | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US antitrust officials today urged the Federal Communications Commission to limit the amount of wireless spectrum Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;amp;T can buy during future auctions. The Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, in a letter sent to the FCC made public Friday, said Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have more than their share of prime spectrum compared to T-Mobile and Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software development kit (SDK) for the Pebble smart watch is now available for download. The makers of the smart watch promised that the SDK would go public once the watches began shipping, and Pebble has now made the SDK and all related documentation available to those interested in developing for the Bluetooth-enabled device. Pebble earned its spot in the limelight with a popular Kickstarter campaign last year, raising about $10.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiian Board of Land and Natural Resources has backed building what's to be the world's largest, most powerful optical telescope above the clouds atop the volcano Mauna Kea. The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will have a primary mirror of 492 segments measuring some 100 feet across, giving it the power to image objects 13 billion light years away, near the beginning of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a touch-enabled smartwatch, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing unnamed supply chain sources, The Journal claims that Microsoft asked Asian suppliers to ship components for the device. If the reports are true, Microsoft would be joining the likes of Apple, Samsung, Google, and others looking to capitalize on a forecasted boom in wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/04/4chan-mall-shooter/?ed=5aH" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Virginia Mall Shooter Apparently Announced Crime in Advance on 4chan | Threat Level | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man arrested Friday in connection to the shooting of two women at a suburban Virginia mall may have announced his crime minutes in advance on the 4chan message board. The alleged shooter identified himself on the troublemaking board on 4chan as Neil Macinnis and provided his contact information with his posting. The shootings occurred at a mall in the town of about 21,000 in southwestern Virginia. Police were called about 2 p.m. when somebody reported a man with a gun at the community college’s satellite location in the mall. The two victims were rushed to a local hospital. Their condition was not immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network has launched a $25.5 billion takeover bid that would see it take control of Sprint. Japanese carrier SoftBank is currently in the process of purchasing Sprint, but Dish's offer could derail the takeover. Today's announcement represents a proposal, rather than a legally-binding offer, but The Wall Street Journal says the company is confident it can raise the funds necessary for such a large purchase. Under the conditions of the bid, Dish's shareholders would gain full control over the merged company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK mobile operator Vodafone has been forced to disable one of its cell towers in the city of Southampton after a peregrine falcon (duck hawk) chose the site for its nest. According to the BBC, some customers in the north of the city have been left without signal after engineers were unable to fix a problem with the mobile mast because the bird has a protected status and cannot be disturbed. Wildlife experts believe Vodafone may have to wait until June before the fledglings leave the roost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics writer Greg Pak, internet superstar musician Jonathan Coulton, and artist Takeshi Miyazawa have joined forces to create a graphic novel that stars the much-loved monsters and super-villains from classic Coulton songs like "Code Monkey," "Skullcrusher Mountain," "The Future Soon," and "Re: Your Brains."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are looking for $39000 to fund the book—which they could reach very soon, looking at the current total raised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Friday, April 12, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4213452/hugo-teso-full-airplane-flight-control-using-android-app" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Aircraft security exploit gives researcher full access to navigation controls | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hacker could gain complete control over a plane's navigation using an Android smartphone, according to a new report from security researcher Hugo Teso. Forbes reports that Teso demonstrated how using a custom application on his Samsung Galaxy, he was able to exploit certain systems in a plane's electronics. This gave him full control over navigation, as long as the plane remained in autopilot, and limited control over lesser functions such as cockpit lights. If the aircraft's pilots did not eventually engage manual controls, a hacker could accomplish any number of malicious actions, such as crashing one aircraft into another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/as-big-investors-emerge-bitcoin-gets-ready-for-its-close-up/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;As Big Investors Emerge, Bitcoin Gets Ready for Its Close-Up - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been many things in a short time: Olympic rowers. Nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg. Characters on “The Simpsons.” Now they can add a new label: bitcoin moguls.The 31-year-old identical twins have amassed since last summer what appears to be one of the single largest portfolios of the online currency that has caused such a stir in financial and technology circles. An array of speculators have now bid up the price of the bitcoin to the point where the outstanding supply of the digital money was worth $1.3 billion at last count. The Winklevii — as they are popularly known — say they own nearly 1 percent of that, or some $11 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dennis Crowley debuted Foursquare, his location-based social media app, at South by Southwest in 2009, he got rave reviews. The tech blog Mashable called Foursquare the “breakout mobile app” of the event. VentureBeat called it “the next Twitter.” At this year’s SXSW, Crowley, 36, had to remind people his company still exists. In early April the company got $41 million from private equity fund Silver Lake Partners and venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Spark Capital. The bulk of the money is a multiyear loan from Silver Lake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen to your Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive and Google  accounts after you die? That’s probably not something you really want to think about, but as more and more of our data now lives online, that’s sadly a question that comes up with some regularity. Today, Google is launching its Inactive Account Manager on the Google Account settings page, which sets out to set up a system that allows you to tell Google “what you want done with your digital assets when you die or can no longer use your account.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn announced on Thursday it has acquired mobile news aggregation startup Pulse, as Kara Swisher reported last month that it would, signaling another step by the massive professional network toward becoming an online content powerhouse.It’s a big buy for LinkedIn, costing a cool $90 million, according to the company.The app, which collects news articles from a range of topics chosen by users and presents them in a clean, stylish format, rose to the top of Apple’s App Store ranks just a few years ago, quickly becoming a favorite among the many newsreaders currently available. Pulse currently claims more than 30 million users globally who read more than ten million stories daily using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software giant is developing a new lineup of its Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year, said people familiar with the company's plans. Chasing the likes of the iPad Mini, Microsoft plans to launch a 7-inch version of its Surface tablet this year. The WSJ’s Yun-hee Kim talks about why the company is jumping into this hot corner of the tablet market.Microsoft's tablet ambitions, combined with planned price breaks for its flagship software and updates in coming months to its Windows operating software, paint the picture of a company trying to move more quickly than ever to counter urgent threats to its $75 billion software empire.One person familiar with Microsoft's product plans said the 7-inch tablets weren't part of the company's strategy last year, but Microsoft executives realized they needed a response to the rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry shares took a hit today after a few analysts criticized the tepid launch of the Z10 phone in the U.S., with one analyst claiming that the return rate was higher than the sales rate. Another said sales have dropped significantly at carrier stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs to fix a "strange" immigration policy that prevents promising but undocumented students from contributing to the country's future and doesn't provide enough visas for foreign workers with advanced skills."We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants. And it's a policy unfit for today's world," the 28-year-old founder of the world's largest Internet social network said in an opinion column in The Washington Post on Thursday.Comprehensive immigration reform and improvements in the U.S. education system were needed, Zuckerberg said in the article, which formally introduced a new advocacy group of Silicon Valley bigwigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of new PCs plummeted nearly 14 percent globally in the first three months of the year, and much of the blame is being placed on Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system.International Data Corp. reported Wednesday that shipments of PCs totaled 76.3 million worldwide in the first quarter of 2013, down 13.9 percent from the same period the previous year."PC shipments were down significantly across all regions compared to a year ago," IDC said, blaming "fading mini notebook shipments and competition from tablets and smartphones ... as well as a weak reception for Windows 8."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to sign its first internet radio licensing agreement with a major record label perhaps as soon as next week, multiple sources with knowledge of the talks have told The Verge. Universal Music Group, the largest of the major record companies, has reached the final stages of the negotiations and Warner Music is close behind, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/04/12/twitters-music-service-may-launch-as-early-as-this-friday/?fromcat=all" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter reportedly set to release music app on Friday, April 12 - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mike Isaac and Peter Kafka of AllThingsD, Twitter intends to launch its music service on Friday. Citing “sources familiar with the matter,” the duo’s report indicates that Twitter’s musical debut isn’t merely soon, but is expected today. We Are Hunted announced that it had joined Twitter, and celebrity Ryan Seacrest tweeted about using the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has also released a landing page titled '#music' that allows you to authorize a 'Twitter Trending Music App', but does nothing more at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK mobile operator O2 has unveiled a new smartphone plan aimed at helping its customers upgrade to the very latest phones without incurring an expensive penalty. Named O2 Refresh, the carrier's new 24 month plan splits the cost of the smartphone and airtime, allowing customers to upgrade their handset at any time, paying only for the cost of the outstanding handset portion of their contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has pushed an update for its Android Messenger app, allowing users to take advantage of the new Chat Heads feature. Like in Facebook Home, the Messenger app displays a round icon with the face of whoever you're talking to, regardless of the app you are using. Now, you'll be able to tap the chat head to reply to both SMS and Facebook messages, giving you a little piece of Facebook Home without having to install the full launcher app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Home launched in the US today for selected Android devices&lt;/p&gt;
