      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss the latest in tech news and events including the latest in Apple, the evolution of the computer interface, and the most detailed and illegal picture of the internet ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/03/21/jony-ive-pushing-for-flat-design-in-ios-7-amid-greater-hardware-software-design-collaboration/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Jony Ive Pushing for &amp;#x27;Flat Design&amp;#x27; in iOS 7 Amid Greater Hardware-Software Design Collaboration - Mac Rumors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last October, Tim Cook tasked Jony Ive with leadership of the company's Human Interface teams in addition to his role as head of Industrial Design. This suggested that the company's hardware and software user interfaces could become more complimentary with one executive in charge of everything that users see and touch. The Wall Street Journal reports that this is indeed the case, with mobile software teams being briefed about new hardware prototypes earlier in the design cycle. Additionally, Ive is now sitting in on the human interface team's review sessions to examine new designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/03/21/apple-beefs-up-icloud-apple-id-security-with-two-step-verification/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple beefs up iCloud, Apple ID security with two-step verification | 9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple has rolled out a new two-step verification service for iCloud and Apple ID users. This functionality greatly enhances the security of Apple accounts because it requires users to use a trusted device and an extra security code.This security code can be sent via SMS or via the Find my iPhone iOS app (if it is installed). Users can now setup two-step authentication on their devices via the Apple ID website. Users need to access the security tab on this website to conduct the setup process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/21/apple-looks-to-protect-dropped-iphones-by-shifting-their-orientation-mid-flight" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple looks to protect dropped iPhones by shifting their orientation mid-flight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Apple's "Protective Mechanism for an Electronic Device" patent filing looks to alleviate some or all of the damage when a device is accidentally dropped. While the invention can be applied to any electronic device with a processor, from a tablet to a laptop, it is most well-suited for those portables that users carry with them on a daily basis. For example, Apple's iPhone is specifically mentioned in the patent language.In order to work, the system needs a sensor or sensor array that can detect when a device is in freefall and how it is positioned relative to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57575626-37/apple-google-google-now-not-submitted-to-app-store/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple, Google: Google Now not submitted to App Store | Apple - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Now has not been submitted yet to Apple's App Store, the iPhone maker told CNET. And Google itself has now confirmed this.Earlier today, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt spoke at the Big Tent Summit in India and was asked when Google Now would be made available to iOS devices. In a coded response, Schmidt stopped short of calling out Apple but did seem to hint that the iPhone maker was playing a role in the app's availability on its platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/2300-11386_3-10016203.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Stars come out for &amp;#x27;Game of Thrones&amp;#x27; screening (pictures) - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Game of Thrones" stars talk to the press last night in San Francisco where the red carpet was laid out at the Palace of Fine Arts for a special screening to kick off the series' third season. The hit HBO show held its official premiere earlier this week in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/21/the-science-of-snoozing/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Science of Snoozing [VIDEO]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling a little groggy? Droopy? Dopey? Sleepy? Another 'Seven Dwarfs' syndrome?It may not be because you didn't get enough sleep, but perhaps because you opted for a few extra minutes of it. ASAP Science explains that alarm clocks are really the enemy in the bedroom, because they disrupt your body's natural rhythms and attempts at rousing you awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4127110/40-years-of-icons-the-evolution-of-the-modern-computer-interface" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;40 years of icons: the evolution of the modern computer interface | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 years of icons: the evolution of the modern computer interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4133288/apple-to-finally-stop-accepting-apps-that-use-outdated-udid-device-identifier-may-1st" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple to finally stop accepting apps that use outdated UDID device identifier on May 1st | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple announced it was deprecating the Unique Device Identifier back in August of 2011, and over 18 months later the company will formally start rejecting apps that continue to use it. In a brief post on Apple's Developer website, the company states that it won't accept apps that use UDIDs as of May 1st, and encourages developers to use two other options to provide similar functionality should they need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/this-is-most-detailed-picture-internet-ever" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;This Is the Most Detailed Picture of the Internet Ever (and Making it Was Very Illegal) | Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a newly published research paper, an unnamed data junkie explains how he used some stupid simple hacking techniques to build a 420,000-node botnet that helped him draw the most detailed map of the Internet known to man. Not only does it show where people are logging in, it also shows changes in traffic patterns over time with an impressive amount of precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4133428/is-google-building-a-smart-watch-of-its-own" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google&amp;#x27;s Android unit reportedly building a smartwatch | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a recent report from The Financial Times, Google might also be getting into the smartwatch game. And unlike Glass, which was developed in the company’s experimental X Lab, the watch (not pictured above) is said to be under development by the Android unit, possibly indicating that Google sees it as a more immediately viable product. According to FT’s source, the Google watch is separate from Samsung’s recently-announced effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/22/fcc-chairman-genachowski-to-step-down/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski will step down &amp;#x27;in the coming weeks&amp;#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julius Genachowski will be stepping down from his position as FCC Chairman "in the coming weeks" according to a brief message on the FCC's webpage. We're expecting more detail in a live announcement at 10am, but this was no big surprise: the Wall Street Journal broke the news yesterday and speculation over Mr. Genachowski's tenure has lingered ever since an awkward exchange where he refused to commit to his future at this year's CES.In his four years at the commission, Genachowski worked to speed up the roll-out of broadband to rural communities, voiced concerns about the current phone unlocking policy and pushed to allocate more spectrum to WiFi use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie are joined late in the afternoon by Myke Hurley and Moises Chiullan to discuss the latest in tech news, deviated septums, and trivia of the 50 United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/20/google-launches-evernote-rival-keep-for-the-web-android-4-0-and-above/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google launches Evernote rival Keep for the Web, Android 4.0 and above - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google on Wednesday announced Google Keep, a note-taking service similar to Evernote, for both the Web and Android 4.0  (Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean) devices. You can try the service out now for yourself at Drive.Google.com/Keep or download the Android app from the Google Play Store. Google describes Keep as a service that lets you “save ideas and organize to-dos the moment they happen by creating notes, lists, photos and voice recordings right from your phone” (don’t worry, it also works on tablets). You can access, edit, and create new notes on the Web from the above website, and furthermore, Google says you’ll be able to do the same directly from your Google Drive account “in the coming weeks.” Keep also lets you speak to it: the service transcribes voice memos for you automatically. Since we’re talking about Google here, there’s also a “super-fast search” function so you can find the note you wrote, read it, and then either archive or delete it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-on-the-99-kindle-fire-tablet-its-not-happening-2013-3?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon On The $99 Kindle Fire Tablet: &amp;#x27;It&amp;#x27;s Not Happening&amp;#x27; - Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon is not doing a $99 Kindle Fire HD tablet, a company spokesperson tells us: "It's not happening--we are already at the lowest price points possible for that hardware."Previously, TechCrunch had passed along a rumor that Amazon was going to release a $99 tablet, which would have been extremely disruptive.It looks like that's just not feasible right now for Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/19/t-mobile-uncarrier-plans-leak-make-unlimited-talk-and-text-givens/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile &amp;#x27;UnCarrier&amp;#x27; plans possibly leaked, make unlimited talk and text a given (updated)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile made much ado at CES of its desire to become the "UnCarrier," with steps away from subsidies and the usual complexities of smartphones. Thanks to tipsters, we have a better sense of what the provider meant. A memo suggests that T-Mobile is revamping plans in the near future to make unlimited talk and text a de facto part of the experience, where data would be the only changeable factor: on Classic tiers , the starter $60 plan would have 500MB of full-speed data with hotspot support built-in, while subscribers could upgrade their service in 2GB increments that cost between $10-20 dollars per month for individuals. You'd still have 'real' unlimited data on Classic from $90, with the hotspot as a bolt-on option. What we've seen doesn't specify a date or price, but T-Mobile happens to have an appropriately-themed event coming up on the 26th&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/youtube-announces-that-it-has-hit-one-billion-monthly-users-which-is-roughly-ten-super-bowl-audiences/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube Announces That It Has Hit One Billion Monthly Users, Which Is Roughly Ten Super Bowl Audiences | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it has hit a billion monthly users, which is an extremely insane metric. We know that YouTube is the go-to place for silly, interesting and important videos, but these numbers are something that even TV networks dream of.The great part for YouTube is that this means that online video ad-spend will go up, since the eyeballs appear to be ready, willing and able. It’s not only advertisers that are rushing YouTube, budding music artists are heading there too, and making a career from the attention that they get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.electronista.com/fullarticles/13/03/20/sequester.holding.up.purchase.intended.to.replace.failing.devices/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Exclusive: US DoD to purchase 650,000 iOS devices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were told that the breakdown was 120,000 iPads, 100,000 iPad minis, 200,000 iPod touches, and the remaining 210,000 filled by various iPhones. Specific models were not shared, and would likely be specified at the time of the cessation of sequester spending restrictions. Ultimate destinations for the hardware varies, with Electronista being told that "more than half are headed to the battlefield, afloat, and to associated support commands. Most of the rest will stay [at the Pentagon]."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/business/media/tonight-show-expected-to-return-to-new-york-with-fallon.html?_r=0" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;‘Tonight’ Show Expected to Return to New York, With Fallon - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plan is in the works to bring NBC’s “Tonight” show back to New York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the network has yet to complete a deal, it has made a commitment to Jimmy Fallon, the current host of its “Late Night” program, to have him succeed Jay Leno as the next host of “Tonight,” according to several senior television executives involved in the decision. The show would move from Burbank, Calif., back to New York, where it first started in 1954 with Steve Allen as host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some details remain to be worked out, including an exact timetable for the switch, though it is expected to take place by the fall of 2014 at the latest, the executives said in interviews this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NBC has quietly begun work on a new studio in its headquarters building at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as the home for the new “Tonight” show. The studio is part of a general reconstruction of the building being undertaken by Comcast, which this week completed a full takeover of NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/20/ad-exec-scott-trattner-returns-to-the-apple-fold-at-media-arts-l/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Ad exec Scott Trattner returns to the Apple fold at Media Arts Lab | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the hiring talk today is about Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch joining up with Apple, but there's been another interesting job switch in the Apple-sphere recently. Ad exec Scott Trattner has returned to work for the Media Arts Lab ad agency, after a short stint working for the design firm 72 and Sunny. The Media Arts Lab is part of ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day, and the group is responsible for some of the most iconic Apple ads, including the famous Switcher ads, as well as the iPod ads, Think Different and even the classic "1984" commercial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/british-airways-ungrounded/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;British Airways Launches UnGrounded ‘Innovation Lab In The Sky’ To Solve Problems By Putting Techies On Planes Together | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Airways today announced the first of its “UnGrounded” innovation lab flights that will assemble 100 Silicon Valley luminaries on a flight to London to devise a platform for connecting tech talent with big problems around the world. A partnership with the UN, the inaugural UnGrounded flight will fly on June 12th with 100 leaders from Google, Andreessen Horowitz, RocketSpace and more on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/20/vine-tribeca-film-festival-launch-6secfilms-vine-competition-for-viners-obsessed-with-vining-vines/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Vine, Tribeca Film Festival Launch #6SecFilms Vine Competition For Viners Obsessed With Vining Vines | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vine has steadily made waves ever since its launch in January. First it was a porn scare, and then it was widening growth against competitors like SocialCam and Viddy.And throughout it all, we’ve watched stars like Adam Goldberg vine their hearts out. But with today’s announcement that Vine is powering a new 6-second film contest for the Tribeca Film Festival, the app has most certainly graduated into a new tier of awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.chillhour.com/aqua-lung-ocean-wings" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Aqua lung ocean wings-wetsuit that lets you fly underwater | Chill Hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqua lung ocean wings is a wetsuit that lets you fly underwater. When we compare human body with the creatures of the sea, we are inefficient underwater.Massive limbs and lack of fins or tails requires a lot of energy to move in the water. Designer Guillaume Binard in cooperation with “Aqua Lung” created “Oceanwings”, a wetsuit with neoprene membranes which gives an incredible feeling to divers who use it in the deep sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/20/att-wireless-home-phone-goes-prepaid/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T Wireless Home Phone goes prepaid, emulates landlines on demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is wagering that it can overcome some of that hesitance with new prepaid tiers for Wireless Home Phone. Those who plug their wired phones into the $100 cellular hub can now pay only for those times they want pseudo-traditional service, whether it's $20 per month for unlimited US-wide calls or $15 for 1,000 minutes of international long distance. It's hard to make a case for the new Wireless Home Phone option when many of us already have cellphones, but we can see its uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/20/wireless-under-the-skin-implant-can-beam-instant-blood-test-re/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Wireless &amp;#x27;under the skin&amp;#x27; prototype implant beams instant blood test read-outs to your smartphone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new blood-testing subdermal sensor has been developed by a team of scientists in Switzerland. While that may not sound particularly notable, this half-inch prototype can instantly beam several health metrics to smart devices over Bluetooth, monitoring cholesterol, blood sugar levels as well as the impact of medical treatments like chemotherapy using five built-in sensors.The device has already been tested on animals and while the researchers hope to begin testing soon on patients that would typically require a lot of blood tests and monitoring, the module is still several years from a commercial release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4129560/apple-updates-garageband-with-audiobus-support" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple adopts Audiobus iOS multitasking solution with GarageBand update | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has updated GarageBand on iOS with support for Audiobus, a third-party interface that lets you use multiple music creation apps at the same time. Since Audiobus launched late last year, the developers behind several music apps have adopted it as a de facto communication standard for iOS, and it's easy to see why. The simple interface exponentially increases the iPad's value as a music creation tool by letting you do all the recording and sequencing on a single device without complex file imports, as well as enabling apps to talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/03/20/174827589/yes-your-new-car-has-a-black-box-wheres-the-off-switch" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Yes, Your New Car Has A &amp;#x27;Black Box.&amp;#x27; Where&amp;#x27;s The Off Switch? : All Tech Considered : NPR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're a vehicle owner and happen to have a car accident in the near future (we hope you don't), it's likely the crash details will be recorded. Automotive "black boxes" are now built into more than 90 percent of new cars, and the government is considering making them mandatory.Dave Wells, a detective at the King County Sheriff's Office in Washington state, specializes in accident reconstruction. That means he's often crouched under steering wheels, looking for the connector that mechanics use to get diagnostic codes. Crash data — moment-by-moment statistics can be saved from a car's most recent collision. There's speed, acceleration, braking — even information from inside the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html?m=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Official Blog: Google Keep—Save what’s on your mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you’re like most people you probably often discover that the desk, fridge or magazine wasn’t such a clever place to leave the note after all...it’s rarely where you need it when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem Google has created Google Keep. With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what’s important to you. Your notes are safely stored in Google Drive and synced to all your devices so you can always have them at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/03/20/macbook-pro-with-retina-display-problems-in-every-dimension/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro with Retina display: Problems in every dimension | 9to5Mac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has built its reputation on quality, craftsmanship, and customer/user experience, but that hasn’t been the case with its latest lineup of MacBooks. What many consumers don’t know is that buying a new Retina MacBook means taking your chances with possibly receiving a unit that is subject to display defects, battery, graphics, and fan-related issues among other major stability problems. These widespread issues have received limited coverage in the press and many consumers claim Apple is failing to sufficiently address the problems by not informing consumers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/512411/your-next-smartphone-screen-may-be-made-of-sapphire/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Sapphire Could Replace Gorilla Glass in the iPhone and other Smartphones | MIT Technology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufactured sapphire is incredibly strong and scratch resistant. Now falling costs and technology improvements could make it competitive with glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sapphire, a crystalline form of aluminum oxide, probably won’t ever be as cheap as Gorilla Glass, the durable material from Corning that’s used to make screens on iPhones and other smartphones. A Gorilla Glass display costs less than $3, while a sapphire display would cost about $30. But that could fall below $20 in a couple of years thanks to increased competition and improving technology, says Eric Virey, an analyst for the market research firm Yole Développement. And since sapphire performs better than glass, that price could make it cheap enough to compete, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/21/4131224/the-new-season-of-game-of-thrones-will-smite-you-with-dragon-fire" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The new season of &amp;#x27;Game of Thrones&amp;#x27; is a slow burn of dragon fire | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HBO's hit series Game of Thrones likes to take its time. From the very beginning, the series has excelled at the slow burn: methodically pitting one character against another, layering betrayal atop betrayal, and finishing each of its two seasons in shocking fashion. Of course, there's also a healthy mix of blood, sex, and dragon fire along the way. If the premiere episode of the program's third season is any indication, it isn't straying too far from that successful combination — and according to the minds behind the show, some of the most satisfying payoffs yet are in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night HBO and AllThingsD hosted a screening of the episode, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A with author George R.R. Martin as well as executive producers D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. The new season covers roughly half of A Storm of Swords, the third novel in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire saga. Season four would ostensibly cover the second half of the book — though Benioff cautioned that the show hasn't been picked up for next year just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/21/new-adware-trojan-targets-os-x-users/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New adware trojan targets OS X users | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adware attacks against OS X are on the rise this year, says a report by anti-virus company Doctor Web. The Russian firm recently discovered another threat, Trojan.Yontoo.1, which has quickly become the most prominent adware trojan attacking Apple desktops and laptops.The trojan worms its way onto your computer through websites that require you to install a plugin to view the content of the site. The most common vector are movie trailer websites that prompt you to install an HD Video player or similar plugin. Instead of a media plugin, unsuspecting users will download the trojan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Twitter getting the patent for "Twitter", a redesign of Hulu Plus for the Apple TV, Adobe's CEO is leaving and moving to Apple, the ReadWrite editor-in-cheif Dan Lyons is leaving and moving to Hubspot, and the release of Evernote Food for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124888/twitter-gets-a-patent-on-twitter" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter gets a patent on... Twitter | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Twitter famously has a pending patent on the familiar "pull-to-refresh" gesture, the company may have just acquired something more valuable: a patent on the Twitter messaging service itself. The new patent issued today with Twitter founders Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone listed as inventors, and broadly describes a messaging service in which users follow each other and sent messages don't have specific recipients, but are rather sent and displayed to those followers by the system itself. That's exactly how Twitter works, of course — it's definitely more of a broadcasting system than a direct messaging service, and the patent claims explicitly make reference to "broadcasting an update message" several times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter filed for the patent in 2007, but it's doubtful the company will pursue any litigation against competing services with it now that it's in hand — the company has very publicly promised to only use patents defensively, and last year introduced the Innovator's Patent Agreement to codify that promise and require permission from its employees before suing offensively. But competing companies like Facebook will have to evaluate their products carefully against Twitter's very broad claims on virtually any service that allows messages to be sent to a large group of unaddressed recipients who follow the sender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/19/hulu-plus-apple-tv-redesign/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Hulu Plus For Apple TV Gets a Facelift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its blog, Hulu says that it has redesigned the Apple TV Hulu Plus experience "from the ground up," with a focus on finding current TV episodes and content discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content categories are now across the top navigation bar — mimicking the interface Apple uses for the iTunes store — and offering easy access to sections such as TV, Movies, Kids, Latino and the Hulu Queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/19/adobes-cto-heading-to-apple/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Adobe’s CTO leaving the company and heading to Apple — Tech News and Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adobe CTO Kevin Lynch has been wooed away by Apple. CNBC reported Tuesday that Lynch has been hired by Apple but so far there are no details as to what his job title or responsibilities at the company would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/19/dan-lyons-leaves-readwrite/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;ReadWrite Editor-In-Chief Dan Lyons, A.K.A. Fake Steve Jobs, Is Leaving For Hubspot - TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Lyons, the editor-in-chief at tech blog ReadWrite, is leaving for a position at marketing software company Hubspot. We heard the news from knowledgeable sources, and the part about Lyons’ departure for Hubspot was confirmed by a SAY Media spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yes, Dan will be leaving his position as editor-in-chief of ReadWrite effective April 1. He made this decision based on the challenges of telecommuting and the daily distance from his editorial team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still very invested in ReadWrite – it’s an important brand in our portfolio. We’ll continue to invest in and support the team and develop the property as part of our commitment to the future of the brand."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/03/19/apple-credits-evad3rs-jailbreak-team-with-4-of-6-software-bugs-fixed-in-ios-6-1-3/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple credits evad3rs jailbreak team with 4 of 6 software bugs fixed in iOS 6.1.3 - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of iOS 6.1.3, Apple has also dropped a security note that details the bugs and issues patched in this version. The note credits the discovery of four of the six bugs fixed to evad3rs, the team behind the evasi0n jailbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/19/evernote-food-ios-update/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote Food for iOS now lets you share recipes, adds support for OpenTable reservations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food is an undoubtedly essential part of life -- and, in a rather digital age, some could certainly make the same argument about app updates, right? Well, combining the best of both worlds, today Evernote released a refreshed version of its Evernote Food application on iOS, making it more accessible for hungry users to book a reservation through OpenTable's system and adding some social tidbits that'll let foodies share their recipes by way of email, Facebook or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/19/doj-search-warrant-access-user-email/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;DoJ now in favor of using search warrants to access user email&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States Justice Department seems to be listening to cries from Google (among others) that the 1986 ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) should be revised to reflect the vastly different universe that we now live in. DoJ attorney Elana Tyrangiel testified before the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations today, and in a nutshell, she now seems willing to think about the use of search warrants to access all types of email. Previously, the entity wanted the use a far less strict method for gaining access -- giving less privacy to opened emails or emails that were over half a year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4124702/amazon-talks-to-record-labels-about-subscription-music-service" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon in talks with record labels about subscription music service | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subscription music services have yet to profit but that hasn't stopped some of the internet's biggest media distributors from jumping into the business. Amazon, the web's biggest retailer, is the latest to inquire with various music companies about starting a subscription service, multiple sources have told The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details are few and the talks have been described as very informal, the sources said. But so far, what Amazon has shown an interest in is an on-demand service that sounds pretty similar to Spotify, generally considered the sector leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4123740/supreme-court-upholds-first-sale-rights-abroad" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Supreme Court upholds &amp;#x27;first sale&amp;#x27; right to sell used books or movies, even when bought abroad | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5inShareThe Supreme Court has ruled that copyright owners cannot legally forbid people who buy their works to sell them in the US, even if the items in question were made outside the US. The decision upheld a geographically unlimited first sale doctrine — a provision which holds that once someone buys a book, DVD, or other work copyrighted in America, they're free to sell or rent it without the copyright holder's permission. In doing so, it created a major precedent for breaking down international sale barriers, granting legal status both to people who simply want to sell items bought abroad and to those who make money by taking advantage of cheap prices outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/19/cops-want-text-messages-logs/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Cops Want Wireless Providers to Record and Store Your Text Messages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same day that Google is asking Congress to strengthen privacy protections for Americans' emails, the cops are arguing that U.S. law should require cellphone providers to store text messages logs in the event authorities need to read them in the course of a criminal investigation.According to the proposal, backed by a coalition of law-enforcement associations, wireless companies like AT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day, millions of people click on Facebook "Like" buttons, boldly declaring their preferences for a variety of things, such as books, movies, and cat videos. But those "likes" may reveal more than they intend, such as sexual orientation, drug use, and religious affiliation, according to a study that analyzed the online behavior of thousands of volunteers. The researchers used data from 58,000 U.S.-based myPersonality volunteers to build a statistical model. Then, they used a sample of myPersonality volunteers to test how well the model could predict personal attributes from likes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lots of smaller recyclers are in over their heads, and the risk that they might abandon their stockpiles is very real,” said Jason Linnell of the Electronics Recycling Coordination Clearinghouse, an organization that represents state environmental regulators, electronics manufacturers and recyclers. In February, the group sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency asking for immediate help dealing with the rapidly growing stockpiles of the glass, much of which contains lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/bike-theft-tracker-bikespike/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New Theft Tracker Is Like LoJack and OnStar for Your Bike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've ever had your bicycle stolen, you're probably familiar with the frustration of  losing your two-wheeled mode of transport. A Chicago-based startup is addressing that pain point with a gadget that alerts your smartphone when your bike is tampered with and makes it easy to notify the police.The creators at Team BikeSpike developed a beacon of the same name that easily attaches to your bike and tracks its location through your phone or computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/03/big_data_means_more_than_big_p.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Big Data Means More Than Big Profits - Jim Fruchterman - Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many activities in the social sphere also generate lots of information. Massive amounts of data are collected on the pollution in our cities and the changes in our climate. The more we use technology in our education and health systems, the more data we collect about how people learn and what keeps us healthy or makes us sick. These information-centric areas are built for Big Data — data that if better understood could help provide a pathway to maximize our human potential, instead of maximizing profits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/fixing-the-worst-law-in-technology-aaron-swartz-and-the-computer-fraud-and-abuse-act.html?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=pulsenews" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Fixing the Worst Law in Technology: Aaron Swartz and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act : The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is the most outrageous criminal law you?ve never heard of. It bans ?unauthorized access? of computers, but no one really knows what those words mean. Orin Kerr, a former Justice Department attorney and a leading scholar on computer-crime law, argues persuasively that the law is so open-ended and broad as to be unconstitutionally vague. Over the years, the punishments for breaking the law have grown increasingly severe?it can now put people in prison for decades for actions that cause no real economic or physical harm. It is, in short, a nightmare for a country that calls itself free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gKlyu7mV_3oNhcRyG7P2JKmn9l3Q" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;AFP: S. Korean TV networks, banks under suspect cyber attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Korean military raised its cyber attack warning level Wednesday after computer networks crashed at major TV broadcasters and banks, with initial suspicions focused on North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Korea Internet Security Agency, a state watchdog, said computer networks at three TV broadcasters -- KBS, MBC and YTN -- as well as the Shinhan and Nonghyup banks had been "partially or entirely crippled".
LG Uplus, an Internet service provider, also reported a network crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate confirmation of who or what was behind the multiple shutdown, which occurred around 2:00 pm, but the main finger of suspicion is likely to point at Pyongyang.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>TOPIC: Memory.

This week, Dan and Merlin try to tackle the complexities of memory.

Why do we remember things from childhood with unimpeachable detail, but then forget our own phone number or PIN code? How can the same person remember the name of everyone he's ever met, and then space a phone call a couple hours after it was scheduled? Why do we remember and why do we forget?

Unsurprisingly, few concrete answers appear, but there's plenty of lively conversation on savant syndrome, tactical memory aides, and the precise location of Merlin's pills.

&lt;p&gt;This week, Dan and Merlin try to tackle the complexities of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we remember things from childhood with unimpeachable detail, but then forget our own phone number or PIN code? How can the same person remember the name of everyone he's ever met, and then space a phone call a couple hours after it was scheduled? Why do we remember and why do we forget?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (TOT), sometimes called presque vu, is the failure to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent.[1] The phenomenon's name comes from the saying, "It's on the tip of my tongue."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chunking, in psychology, is a phenomenon whereby individuals group responses when performing a memory task. Tests where individuals can demonstrate "chunking" commonly include serial and free recall tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt's father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond and a pittance to Charlie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin Hoffman spent a year working with autistic men and their families to understand their complex relationships. Also, when he was a jobbing actor, he had worked in a psychiatric care home, and drew from his experiences then for the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kim Peek - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence Kim Peek (November 11, 1951 – December 19, 2009) was an American savant. Known as a "megasavant", he had an exceptional memory, but he also experienced social difficulties, possibly resulting from a developmental disability related to congenital brain abnormalities. He was the inspiration for the character of Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man. Unlike Babbitt, who had autism, Peek probably had FG syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Savant syndrome - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savant syndrome is a condition in which a person with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, demonstrates profound and prodigious capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Looming Tower,?the now-classic study of al-Qaeda?s 9/11 attack. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with?current and former Scientologists?both famous and less well known?and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative ability to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_thetan" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Operating Thetan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Scientology, Operating Thetan (OT) is a spiritual state above Clear. L. Ron Hubbard, science fiction writer and creator of Scientology, defined it as "knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time (MEST)"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, friend, you will be deeply annoyed to hear me ask you to repeat your name at least twice, and possibly five times, during our inaugural conversation. And, in subsequent meetings, even though your face will be forever etched upon my brain (a skill at which I absolutely excel), I will probably call you "Champ," "Chief," or possibly "Tex." Because, yes, I will have completely forgotten your name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Neuroplasticity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity (from neural - pertaining to the nerves and/or brain and plastic - moldable or changeable in structure), also known as brain plasticity, refers to changes in neural pathways and synapses which are due to changes in behavior, environment and neural processes, as well as changes resulting from bodily injury. Neuroplasticity has replaced the formerly-held position that the brain is a physiologically static organ, and explores how - and in which ways - the brain changes throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss WhatsApp moving to a subscription model, Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer being sentenced to 41 months in prison, and Warby Parker's new shaving subscription site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4121940/whatsapp-for-ios-moving-to-subscription-model-this-year" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;WhatsApp for iOS moving to a subscription model this year, says CEO | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular cross-platform messaging service WhatsApp is shifting its iOS app from a flat-fee purchase to a $0.99 annual subscription model sometime this year, reports TechCrunch. The move would bring pricing in line with WhatsApp’s other offerings on Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry, and possibly making it free to use for the first year, as it is on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/ea-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-larry-probst-becomes-executive-chairman/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;EA CEO John Riccitiello Steps Down, Larry Probst Becomes Executive Chairman | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA’s CEO John Riccitiello has just submitted his letter of resignation to the company’s board. He’s stepping down on March 30 and Larry Probst is stepping in as Executive Chairman. Probst will lead the hunt for a permanent CEO.Riccitiello has led EA since 2007 and through a dramatic transformation in the industry as the gaming world has moved from selling expensive console games on the shelves of big-box retailers to one in which mobile phones and tablets are fast-becoming a platform of choice for many developers. He was president and chief operating officer from 1997 to 2004, then left EA to co-found and lead Elevation Partners until he was later rehired by the company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry chief executive officer Thorsten Heins has said the rapidly advancing global smartphone market has left Apple’s iPhone in its wake, and predicted his company would have 100,000 native apps available for its Z10 devices in time for the US launch later this week.Speaking exclusively to The Australian Financial Review, ahead of the local launch of its make-or-break smartphones, Mr Heins said last week’s launch of the Samsung S4, along with a wave of recent smartphone releases had reeled in the lead Apple used to hold in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security researcher Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer was today sentenced to 41 months in prison and immediately remanded to custody for his role in Goatse Security's collection and disclosure of 114,000 AT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jammie Thomas-Rasset won't have her day in court at the highest judicial authority in the United States. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case of the famous music pirate who was sentenced to pay $220,000 for downloading 24 songs with the now-defunct file-sharing software Kazaa.In 2007, Thomas-Rasset became the first person to go to trial against the Recording Industry Association of America, when she refused to settle her case after receiving a piracy cease-and-desist letter in August 2005. In the mid-2000s, the RIAA sued thousands of Americans for copyright infringements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warby Parker did it for eyeglasses, offering style at a discount. Now one of the co-founders of the trendy retailer is tackling something almost every guy needs: razors. Warby Parker co-founder Jeff Raider and his longtime friend Andy Katz-Mayfield have built Harry’s, a startup selling more than just blades and handles, but what they are calling “shaving experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two decided they would build razors for the “more discerning guy” and make them cheaper than both the dominant brands – Schick and Gillette – and what you’d find at a shaving boutique like Art of Shaving. They called their new brand Harry’s, after a grandfather figure in Raider’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next they spent nine months to learn as much as they could about shaving technology and the business. “That journey took us to Germany where we formed a partnership with company that makes some of the highest-quality razor blades in the world,” says Raider. From there the duo designed their own razor handles, packaging and shaving cream that would work perfectly with the blades, and spent many months refining, tweaking, and using the products to before landing on the final designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished razors don’t resemble the safety razors of the past, nor do they look like a Mach 3. “We took aesthetic inspiration from older ballpoint pens and old knives that have unique handles,” says Katz-Mayfield. “From there we linked up with industrial designers to take that aesthetic to create handles that are stylish and ergonomic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techies have been keeping a hot eye on dueling Steve Jobs biopics, one an indie starring Ashton Kutcher and the other, written by Aaron Sorkin, in the works at Sony, which made “The Social Network.”But it turns out there was also a joker in the deck nobody knew about: Funny or Die, the comedy Web site, said over the weekend that it had made its own Jobs movie — “iSteve” — and planned to unveil it online on April 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Digg Blog, We&amp;#x27;re Building A Reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg is building an RSS news reader to replace Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg says they have been planning to build a reader in the second half of 2013, saying it will "make the Internet a more approachable and digestible place." After Google’s announcement, they are moving the project to the top of their priority list, building a reader, starting immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/64472/samsung-smart-watch-of-its-own/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung is working on a smart watch of its own—and it could be more than just a little phone – Quartz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning both an anonymous source at Samsung and vice president of mobile Lee Young Hee said that the company is working on a smart watch, one that “will perform many of the tasks of a smartphone.” In the wake of an earlier rumor about Apple’s work on a smart watch—supposedly involving a team of 100 engineers—this feels a bit like a new kind of tech arms race. At the very least, it’s the race to be the first to hint at products that may be many months or even years in the future, in order to prop up the endless hype cycle required to capture the interest of consumers who have come to expect that revelations like Google Glass should arrive with some regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-cockroach-newyork-idUSBRE92E13V20130315" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Swarming cockroaches turn bus to New York into roach-mobile | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greyhound bus ride into New York City on Friday turned into a horror show for passengers suddenly swarmed by an invasion of cockroaches that forced the driver to pull over and evacuate the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cockroaches began emerging about 15 minutes after the bus departed from Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Friday morning, a Greyhound spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver soon pulled over and the 48 passengers scuttled off the infested bus to wait for a replacement vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell phone photos showing armies of cockroaches scampering over the seats and floor were posted by local media outlets, supplied by passengers on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/security-expert-brian-krebs-faced-a-real-life-swating-after-posting-about-russian-cybercrime-site/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Security Expert Brian Krebs Faced A Real-Life SWATing After Posting About Russian Cybercrime Site | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security writer Brian Krebs’ phone was spoofed and a SWAT team was called to his home last week by hackers who apparently took offense at his investigations into various online hacking organizations. His website also suffered a denial of service attack for a short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/early-treatment-sometimes-lets-the-body-keep-hiv-in-check/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Early treatment sometimes lets the body keep HIV in check | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, came a report that early treatment with antivirals has allowed one individual to keep an HIV infection limited for extended periods of time without treatment. Now, a report in PLOS pathogens suggests that this case may not be as exceptional as we might have thought. In a small population of people treated immediately after infection, about 15 percent managed to keep the virus in check after they discontinued other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no mechanism for offering upgrades in the Mac App Store. To accommodate customers who wish to purchase Mac App Store versions, special pricing will be offered for the first 48 hours. PDFpen will be $29.99 and PDFpenPro will be $39.99 for this very limited time. The special pricing expires on March 20 at midnight PDT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, which seems determined to map every square inch of the planet, on Monday released Street View images from four of the seven tallest mountains on earth. One lucky engineer, who happens to be a passionate mountaineer, led the Google Mountain Enthusiast team during a project that was strictly a labor of love for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/03/18/flattr-monetizing-facebook-likes-twitter-favorites-more/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Flattr now lets you make money from your Twitter Favorites, Instagram Likes and more - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flattr has allowed users to pay money into an account and use it to tip money to content creators whose work they appreciate by clicking a button on their sites. The ‘chicken and egg’ problem was that despite support from the likes of Dailymotion and Wikileaks, publishers generally didn’t want to add the buttons to their sites until Flattr had enough users to make it worthwhile, and users didn’t want to put money into a service that wasn’t widely supported by the sites they visited.Now Flattr is circumventing the need for its own buttons by monetizing Twitter’s Favorite, Instagram’s Likes and similar actions on some of the most popular social sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/more-solar-companies-fail/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Why We Need More Solar Companies to Fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suntech, a Wuxi, China-based company that as recently as 2011 was the world’s largest producer of solar panels, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. It’s running low on cash, owes bond investors half a billion dollars (which it failed to pay Friday), and is saddled with payments on billions of dollars in loans as it struggles to make money in a market flooded with solar panels.If Suntech fails and shuts down its factories, that might not be a bad thing. Some industry experts say that hundreds of solar companies need to fail to help bring solar panel supply back in line with demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/canada-social-farting/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Canada Takes on &amp;#x27;Social Farting&amp;#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatulence is a fairly taboo subject for U.S. advertising. Not so in Canada, apparently. This public service announcement from that country's Ministry of Health likens social smoking to passing gas in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/pope-francis-social-media/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;What It&amp;#x27;s Like to Be Pope Francis&amp;#x27; Social Media Intern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis sent his first tweet from the resurrected @Pontifex Twitter account Sunday, only four days after being elected as Benedict XVI's successor. A little-known fact is that Pope Francis has a couple of helping hands on social media: a pair of American undergraduate interns from Villanova University, a Catholic school in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/14/apple-proposes-on-the-go-wireless-charging-via-ipad-smart-cover-with-built-in-battery" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple proposes &amp;#x27;on-the-go&amp;#x27; wireless charging via iPad Smart Cover with built-in battery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Apple patent application discovered on Thursday reveals that the company is actively investigating wireless charging for its line of portable devices, but proposes to use the technology in a slightly different way than existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Mailbox being bought by Dropbox, North Korea blames US and allies for cyber attacks, and where to watch the Angry Birds Toons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-mailbox-an-app-with-some-buzz/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dropbox Buys Mailbox, an App With Some Buzz - Digits - WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is buying the owner of the buzzy Mailbox mobile app, making its first move into products outside its core file-sharing service.Under the deal, the 13 employees of Mailbox owner Orchestra Inc.–including alums of Apple, Stanford University and Ideo–will join Dropbox. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details on Apple's so-called "budget" iPhone were revealed on Friday to AppleInsider by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who has a reliable track record in predicting Apple's future product plans. According to Kuo, the specs for Apple's low-cost iPhone were decided in 2011, and the company is "unlikely to abruptly change" due to a market shift toward larger screens in the 5-inch range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCMag spoke with Nick DiCarlo, Samsung's vice president of portfolio planning, at last night's event, and he said that many of the software improvements in the Samsung Galaxy S4 could make their way into existing Samsung Galaxy S3 phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh Google. Thought we wouldn’t notice that you’re trying to kill off not just Google Reader, but also your support and endorsement for the RSS format itself? People have just started noticing that Google’s own RSS Subscription Chrome browser extension has disappeared from the Google Chrome Web Store. Though it’s unclear at this time exactly when the extension was removed, the change appears to be recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techinasia.com/north-korea-accuses-america-cyberattacks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;North Korean News Agency Accuses US and Allies of Cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s official news agency KCNA has accused the US and its allies of conducting cyberattacks. Described as “intensive and persistent virus attacks”, it’s otherwise not clear what information the alleged hackers were after or if any data was stolen. The implication is that the US or South Korean governments are trying to access North Korean servers in an act of espionage or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career website Glassdoor on Friday released its latest report highlighting this year’s top 50 highest-rated Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), and it seems like the tech world played a big role in the list. In fact, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unseated Apple CEO Tim Cook from the number one spot he grabbed last year.Glassdoor compiled its figures based on more than half a million company reviews submitted by employees between February 25, 2012 and February 24, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawdingo, a startup that connects users with lawyers for online consultations (sometimes instantly), is announcing that it’s part of the current class of startups at Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has just made an internal announcement to Facebook naming its veteran VP of Engineering Mike Schroepfer as CTO, we’ve just learned from an industry source. Facebook has since confirmed to TechCrunch that Schroepfer will take the postion previously held by Bret Taylor, who left last year. Schroepfer has been at Facebook for nearly five years and led most of its latest mobile efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent system is flawed, some would say broken. And patent trolls — less pejoratively known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) — are to blame, no matter how good a case they might make for their role in the patent ecosystem. Or are they? Trolls are an easy target because they don’t make anything, choosing instead to enforce patents against those who do.But curing the patent problem requires general solutions … not ones targeted just at patent trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-secret national security letters that come with a gag order on the recipient are an unconstitutional impingement on free speech, a federal judge in California ruled in a decision released Friday.U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered the government to stop issuing so-called NSLs across the board, in a stunning defeat for the Obama administration’s surveillance practices. She also ordered the government to cease enforcing the gag provision in any other cases. However, she stayed her order for 90 days to give the government a chance to appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovio has long been threatening to bring Angry Birds into other media, and this weekend they're finally doing it -- kind of. Angry Birds Toons is a brand new cartoon series featuring none other than the frustrated fowl that iOS gamers have known and loved for so long. But you won't find it on a TV station or in a movie theater: Instead, the cartoon is premiering inside the Angry Birds apps, so if you have any of them installed, you can jump in and you'll be able to watch the series starting this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/15/apple-sued-over-defective-macbook-pro-retina-displays/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple sued over defective MacBook Pro Retina displays | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit has been filed in federal court in California alleging that Apple is misleading consumers by not advertising that there are two different types of displays used in its MacBook Pros with Retina displays. The issue stems from widespread reports that MacBook Pros with Retina displays that use display panels from LG suffer from ghosting issues. MacBook Pros that use Retina displays from Samsung reportedly are not affected by the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are mourning the impending loss of Google Reader, which will be cease to function on July 1. The folks at Zite have a kinda, sorta replacement that can be used from within the free Zite personalized news app.Zite has always been a bit of a hybrid, allowing you to access your Google Reader feeds manually, while providing the extra Zite-selected news, based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/reservations/?p=1#to-grow-even-faster-mailbox-is-joining-dropbox" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox - Put Email In Its Place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we’ve decided to join forces with Dropbox and build it out together. To be clear, Mailbox is not going away. The product needs to grow fast, and we believe that joining Dropbox is the best way to make that happen. Plus, imagine what cool things you could do if your Mailbox was connected to your Dropbox…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/mailbox-cost-dropbox-around-100-million/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox Cost Dropbox Around $100 Million | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been hearing that Mailbox was raising money, piquing the interest of Andreessen Horowitz among others, which is why today’s news that the company sold to the harmoniously named Dropbox didn’t come as a surprise. Sometimes an acquisition is the easiest way to raise resources for growth — especially when you’re tackling as expensive a problem as email. And have a six-figure wait list.And we’re hearing that this particular acquisition was not cheap — The post-pivot startup cost the storage company “well over” $50 million, according to multiple sources. And we’ve heard that that the price was around $100 million in cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Uber drivers of their ‘Black Car’ service are striking this afternoon in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. Those drivers participating have parked in front of Uber’s headquarters. They intend on striking – not providing rides to Uber users – during the rush hour period, and perhaps the weekend.The drivers that TNW spoke to stated that they are being treated unfairly, specifically citing a lack of communication and input in the Uber decision making process, and the fact that Uber does not provide a commercial insurance policy, leaving drivers legally culpable in the case of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Road Films is pushing back the release of Jobs, which was scheduled to hit theaters April 19, the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Apple Computer. A new date has yet to be determined (the film previously was titled jOBS).Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that Open Road wanted more time to market the film, which was fully financed and produced by Mark Hulme's Five Star Feature Films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York State first began issuing paper licenses to chauffeurs in 1910, and the shape, form and style have changed over the past century, adapting to new laws and technologies. The following is a sampling of how the license has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of Samsung’s Galaxy S4 launch, Apple and its marketing chief Phil Schiller spoke with mainstream news publications to slam Android and iPhone competitors. Now, following the launch of the new Samsung device, Apple has opened up an entire new web page to tout why people have loved the iPhone for so many years and to seemingly throw some negative claims against Android and Samsung devices.Apple has also begun emailing a version of this webpage to its own customers, something that makes this seem more defensive than offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
