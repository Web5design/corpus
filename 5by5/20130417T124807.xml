      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;: Quicksilver and the OS X App Launcher Landscape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Dan triumphantly returns from two weeks of crippling illness. So, the boys ease their way back into the groove with a grab bag of great follow-up, some &lt;em&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/em&gt; talk, and a longer discussion of popular OS X App launchers, including Quicksilver 1.0, LaunchBar, and Alfred 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://squarespace.com/backtowork" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[SPONSOR] Build a Website — Squarespace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is the easiest way for anyone to create an exceptional website. Pages, galleries, blogs, domains, hosting, analytics, 24/7 support - all included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/new-template-design-adirondack" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New Template Design: Adirondack — The Official Squarespace Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adirondack is a modern, clean design built with small business owners and savvy entrepreneurs in mind. Minimal navigation and full header images provide a bold framework for your company or brand. The template is characterized by scrolling effects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.squarespace.com/blog/new-feature-roundup-page-duplication-and-more" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New Feature Roundup: Page Duplication and More — The Official Squarespace Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re pushing out changes and improvements to Squarespace 6 almost daily, we wanted to point out a few recent updates that you might find helpful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace/2013/4/11/038-inbox-zero-and-new-projects-with-merlin-mann.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 70Decibels - CMD+SPACE - 038 - Inbox Zero and New Projects, with Merlin Mann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a very special episode of CMD SPACE Myke is joined by Merlin Mann to discuss Inbox Zero, starting New projects and a fun discussion about Adventure Time (as well as a little about comics, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/132" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 5by5 | Mac Power Users #132: Merlin Returns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning for his annual appearance, Merlin Mann joins Katie and David to talk Evernote, GTD, iPad, Podcasting and his favorite Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fatcatsoftware.com/iplm/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Fat Cat Software – iPhoto Library Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iPLM also gives you the ability to copy your photos from one library to another, while keeping track of photo metadata that is normally lost when exporting from one library and importing into another. Titles, dates, descriptions, keywords, ratings, faces, and place information are all transferred along with the photos, ensuring that you keep all that information you spent hours entering into iPhoto. Event and albums are also reconstructed when copied, and both the edited and original copies of each photo are copied as well. You can split up a large library into multiple smaller libraries, merge entire libraries together into a big one, or rebuild a corrupt library that is causing iPhoto to hang or crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://actions.getdrafts.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Drafts: Action Directory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directory contains pre-configured custom actions to extend Drafts beyond the actions that come preinstalled with the app. If you have Drafts, browse this directory on your iOS device – when you find an action that interests you, tap the "Install" link and it will be installed in your local version Drafts. Any actions you install can be modified or deleted in the Drafts settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1325709" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[GUIDE] Success! Install 10.8 on old unsupported Mac - MacRumors Forums&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, Welcome. First of all. What is "MLPostFactor" you might ask. Well. As we all know, Apple has dropped OSX Mountain Lion support for older generation of Macs (2006~2008 Macs). The goal of the project is to support all those "drop out" Macs. So we designed this app to do just that. Read more @ Post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appcubby.com/launch-center/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;App Cubby • Hand Crafted iPhone Apps - Launch Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s like speed dial, but for more than just phone calls! Launch Center Pro creates lightning quick shortcuts to specific features buried deep within apps. Call a loved one, message a friend, launch Instagram’s camera to quickly snap a pic, tweet, or turn your iPhone into a flashlight. Launch Center Pro gets you to where you’re going faster than ever before!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/133" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;[PODCAST] 5by5 | Mac Power Users #133: Alfred 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David and Katie take a deep dive into Alfred 2.0, an application launcher and productivity application for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://forecast.io/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Forecast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[awesome web app with detailed weather conditions]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_%22Farina%22_Hoskins" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Allen Hoskins - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allen Clayton Hoskins (August 9, 1920 – July 26, 1980) was an American child actor, most famous for portraying the character of Farina in 105 Our Gang short films from 1922 to 1931.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://qsapp.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Quicksilver — Mac OS X at your Fingertips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quicksilver is a fast and free Mac OS X productivity application that gives you the power to control your Mac quickly and elegantly. Quicksilver learns your habits, making your everyday chores simple and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.qsapp.com/post/46268365849/quicksilver-comes-of-age" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Quicksilver — LoveQuicksilver Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost 10 years of testing, Quicksilver lays the beta tag to rest. (If the lack of an eszett brings a tear to your eye, you can always reminisce by hitting ?S on your keyboard). What does this release mean? It means more than just a change in the version numbering system - it signifies a maturity of Quicksilver and a sign of what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.qsapp.com/post/46268470658/quicksilver-an-interview-with-the-developers" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Quicksilver — LoveQuicksilver Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of Quicksilver v1.0, I sat with Quicksilver’s lead developers (at our respective far-flung computers) to gather their thoughts on this historic occasion, and to find out a bit more about Quicksilver behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Alfred App - Productivity App for Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred is an award-winning productivity application for Mac OS XAlfred saves you time when you search for files online or on your Mac. Be more productive with hotkeys, keywords and file actions at your fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/3-share-your-workflows/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Share your Workflows - Alfred App Community Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share your workflows with fellow Alfred v2 users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;LaunchBar 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaunchBar is a smart and powerful, keyboard driven productivity utility that lets you access and control every aspect of your digital life. Whatever you want to get done on your Mac – with LaunchBar it’s only a few keystrokes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/switch.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;LaunchBar - Switcher’s FAQs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve noticed an ever increasing number of former Quicksilver users who switched over to LaunchBar, so we’d like to provide an overview of some of the differences and to answer the most frequently asked questions in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://manytricks.com/butler/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Butler · Many Tricks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Butler's purpose is to ease all those routine tasks you do every day: controlling iTunes, opening programs and documents, switching users, searching for stuff on the web, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/492/dr-gilmer-and-mr-hyde" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gilmer and Mr. Hyde | This American Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Benjamin Gilmer gets a job at a rural clinic. He finds out he’s replaced someone — also named Dr. Gilmer — who went to prison after killing his own father. But the more Benjamin’s patients talk about the other Dr. Gilmer, the more confused he becomes. Everyone loved the old Dr. Gilmer. So Benjamin starts digging around, trying to understand how a good man can seemingly turn bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Problem: People would treat you so differently if you were literally riding a bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To feign illness, injury, or incapacitation in order to avoid work or obligation.It is not uncommon on exam days for several students to malinger rather than prepare themselves.[edit]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve dedicated yourself to making the things you love, every inbox can and should become a well-monitored servant rather than a merciless master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, at the risk of sounding a little fruity, I believe that a life in which we habitually abandon the known Good Things in order to helplessly stab at ““managing”” a nebulous morass of chaoses that we can never control is not much of a life at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get in on the ground floor! This massive hardcover collects the first 13 issues of Robert Kirkman's Eisner-Nominated super-hero, along with all the extras from the first three trade paperback volumes and even more on top of that! Invincible: The Ultimate Collection, Volume 1 is a can't-miss for anyone who's wanted to start reading Invincible, but needed an easier way to start from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/The_Enchiridion_(book)" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Enchiridion (book) - The Adventure Time Wiki. Mathematical!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enchiridion (which translates to "The Handbook" or "The Manual") was an ancient book with codes of conduct, guidelines, and other helpful information for heroes. The book had great power which allowed it to tear open worm holes between dimensions in the multiverse. It was destroyed by Finn in "The Lich" in order to stop the Lich from gaining access to the multiverse (although, the Lich still made it. See "The Lich" for more details.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Simon_%26_Marcy" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Simon &amp;amp; Marcy - The Adventure Time Wiki. Mathematical!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the thing: Every phone can be right, for the right reasons. Every platform can be wonderful. (Do you know how easy it would be to make a BlackBerry joke right here? Do you? I’ve got the joke right here in my pocket. You sense it even. You’re dying to make it yourself. Go ahead. This one time. Just do it. Whisper it. I’m listening.) Here’s the thing. That Blackberry Z10? It’s right for someone, somewhere. It really is. There’s someone out there who will take that phone home and love it. Just completely love it. Not in a romantic, or sexual way. (I hope.) But nonetheless, love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drafts is a different kind of note taking app. In Drafts, text comes first – open the app and get a new, blank draft. Don’t get bogged down in a timeline to tweet or post to Facebook and App.net. Don’t tap through multiple screens to compose an email or SMS. Don’t navigate folders, create files and name them just to jot down a note or create a todo. Drafts is available for both iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Tuesday, April 16, 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials could have something very different on their hands as they investigate the dual bomb blasts that struck the Boston Marathon finish line today: a potential abundance of photo and video evidence from the public. Government surveillance, while growing, still misses more than it catches. But events with thousands of spectators offer the potential for a detailed crowdsourced record of what happened. This public panopticon is changing how we see the world. February's Russian meteor was captured by many dash-cams mounted in Russian cars, but in this case the event is of profound interest to law enforcement officials, not just scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has announced that it will be partnering with the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) to help teens and their parents manage their privacy, both on Facebook and on the internet at large. The complexity of Facebook's privacy settings and what personal information is shared on the social network has long been a concern, and this marks the company's latest partnership to try and make things a bit clearer. The NAAG will work with Facebook to offer a series of informational releases and tools that it hopes will "ensure that young people make safe, smart, and responsible choices online," says Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. The initiative was lead by Maryland Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, and was announced Monday morning at his "Privacy in the Digital Age" event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing what appears to be an indefinite ban of its software from Apple's App Store, French app discovery service AppGratis is trying to make a case for itself with an Internet petition.A new page that went up over the weekend gives users a special e-mail address to send their pleas to if they want to "save" the company. So far, the initiative has accumulated more than 608,000 such messages, according to the page's official tally.AppGratis was removed from Apple's App Store earlier this month. The software would alert users to a daily app deal it brokered with developers. Apple said users could confuse it with the App Store, but its creators vehemently disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22157732" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Kobo unveils Aura &amp;#x27;high definition&amp;#x27; ebook reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebook seller Kobo has released what it is describing as a "high definition" e-ink based device.The Aura HD's 6.8in (17.2cm) screen offers a resolution of 265 pixels per inch (ppi).That puts it ahead of Amazon's bestselling Kindle Paperwhite which offers 212ppi on its 6in screen.The launch comes at a time when ebook sales are booming, but some analysts suggest interest in black and white e-ink devices has started to wane.Kobo is owned by the Japanese retail giant Rakuten which bought the company in 2011.In the UK it has benefited from a tie-up signed the same year with bookseller WHSmith.Kobo's chief executive said that this and similar deals with other bricks-and-mortar chains in other countries had helped his company enjoy rapid growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4228248/netflix-plans-its-move-from-microsoft-silverlight-to-html5-video" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix plans its move from Microsoft Silverlight to HTML5 video | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month Google announced that Netflix was now available on ARM-based Samsung Chromebooks thanks to the use of HTML5 video — and now the streaming service has outlined its larger plans to eventually move to the format for all computers. Currently, Netflix primarily uses the Microsoft Silverlight plug-in when streaming video to web browsers, but Netflix's Anthony Park and Mark Watson point out in a blog post that the current solution really can't stand. Plug-ins don't play well with with most mobile browsers, they can be cumbersome for users, and perhaps most importantly, Microsoft itself may not develop a new version of Silverlight beyond the current release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4228700/pebble-tetris-clone-available" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Play &amp;#x27;Tetris&amp;#x27; on your Pebble smartwatch thanks to new SDK | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team behind the Pebble smartwatch released a "proof-of-concept" SDK last week, letting developers create their own watch faces and rudimentary apps. A few are already available on the Pebble forums, but the most impressive so far is a surprisingly playable version of Tetris. Once you get your head around pressing down to move right and up to move left, it's almost like you have a miniature Game Boy with a slightly better screen on your wrist. Installing Pebblis is a simple matter of clicking a download link on your phone, at least if you're using your Pebble with an Android device — iPhone owners will need to wait for an official app update, however, or try a direct Bluetooth workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/04/16/google-posts-mirror-api-developer-documentation-for-glass-as-first-units-roll-off-production-line/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google posts Mirror API developer documentation for Glass as first units roll off production line - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of Google informing developers that it’s ready to begin shipping out prototypes of its Glass smart eyewear, the company has posted documentation and example code for the device’s Mirror API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site instructs developers on how to build “Glassware” for the upcoming platform and provides sample projects in Python and Java. It provides guidelines for how to use the Glass timeline, subscriptions, location, contacts, authorization and media upload, as well as best practices, a reference section and a playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4229266/google-glass-specifications-announced" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google reveals Glass specs: one-day battery life, bone conduction audio, 16GB storage | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the first details of its Mirror API for Glass apps, Google has published a list of technical specifications for the head-mounted device. Glass features a 640 x 360 display that Google says is the "equivalent of a 25-inch high definition screen from eight feet away," a 5-megapixel camera capable of 720p video, and — as revealed in an FCC filing — audio that comes via a bone conduction transducer. There will be 16GB of flash storage on-board, with 12GB actually usable, and it will sync with "Google cloud storage" — presumably Google Drive. Glass will feature adjustable nose pads in a frame that Google says will "fit any face," and you'll get extra pads in two sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4229900/windows-8-1-boot-to-desktop-option" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Windows 8.1 will include boot to desktop option to bypass &amp;#x27;Metro&amp;#x27; | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is planning to change the way its Start Screen operates with the release of Windows 8.1. Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans have revealed to The Verge that the company is currently testing builds of Windows 8.1, known as codename Windows Blue, that include an option to boot directly to the traditional desktop. They're told that the option is disabled by default, allowing users to simply turn on the functionality should they want to avoid the "Metro" Start Screen at initial boot or login.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230274/facebook-6-0-for-ipad-and-iphone-hands-on-with-chat-heads-stickers" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook 6.0 for iPad and iPhone: hands-on with Chat Heads, stickers, and more | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Facebook is devoting some attention to iOS, with the release of Facebook 6.0. The new version has a few much-needed design tweaks, but the headline features are all about Facebook Messenger. First, within the Facebook app, you can pop-out Chat Heads for your conversations, but they won't work anywhere else because of the way that iOS keeps apps sandboxed. They are also adding 'Stickers' to their messaging feature (which are basically huge emoticons).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230854/first-facebook-home-update-coming-second-week-of-may" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Home available outside US later today, first update coming &amp;#x27;second week of May&amp;#x27; | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On stage at AllThingsD's Dive Into Mobile conference today, Cory Ondrejka, head of mobile engineering at Facebook, announced that the first update to Facebook Home for Android will be released in "the second week of May." This is in line with the company's promise that it'd be updating its mobile apps on a monthly basis, but unfortunately, he declined to say what exactly the new version would include. Cory also mentioned that the Home download would start rolling out outside the US beginning later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/04/16/evernote-launches-a-new-accelerator-to-develop-its-app-ecosystem-taking-no-equity-from-startups/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Evernote Launches New Accelerator To Develop Its App Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that Evernote is working to build a solid ecosystem of applications that use its service, but now it’s kicking things up a notch. Led by platform advocate and former technology journalist Rafe Needleman, Evernote will bring in the best hack teams to visit and work on their projects with the company’s developers and designers for a chance to be a part of the inaugural class.From April thorugh June, Evernote is hosting Devcup meetups and hackathons around the world, including in Berlin, Tokyo, Singapore, New York City, Columbia, Beijing, Austin, and in Silicon Valley. Six finalists from each city will be chosen and flown to San Francisco for the Evernote Conference in September to compete for prizes.The winners from the Evernote Conference will then spend October with Evernote working closely and receiving guidance on product design, marketing, and business development. It all culminates at its Demo Day when each product is demonstrated to journalists, investors, and other Silicon Valley thought leaders and experts.Through its partnerships, Evernote will also be promoting product development in two special areas. Honda Silicon Valley Labs is sponsoring a prize focused on use of Evernote and transportation, specifically on the best enhancements to the in-vehicle experience. In addition, DoCoMo Innovation Ventures, the VC arm of the Japanese mobile phone provider, is also putting up an award.For its part, Evernote says that it is not receiving any equity or “financial position” in the companies or products, regardless of whether it was created at a Devcup event or during the Accelerator program. Those invited into the Accelerator will receive travel and lodging expenses, along with a stipend and work space at Evernote’s headquarters.The launch of the Evernote Accelerator is fitting as the company seeks to further its status as a platform. At last year’s LeWeb conference, TNW’s Martin Bryant interviewed company CEO Phil Libin, where Libin said that the progression from Evernote being thought of as an app to a platform was always in its strategy. It has more than 10,000 third-party developers and many apps within its Trunk service. And as Evernote continues to grow out its Business product in Europe, Canada, Japan, and the US, finding a way to foster the develop apps that will suit its customers is probably not a bad thing for the company.?

&lt;p&gt;Jim Wicks, Motorola's design chief, said the company's first round of products designed after Google's purchase of the company will follow a philosophy of "better is better" rather than "bigger is better," Wicks said. "From a software and UI perspective, our strategy is to embrace Android and to make it the best expression of Android and Google in the market. It will be the unadulterated version of Android, and I feel really good about our embracing Android and being the best Android experience." The first Google-influenced Motorola phones will start to appear in the second half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/9/4204902/google-fiber-coming-to-austin" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Fiber coming to Austin by mid-2014 | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has officially announced the next city that will get its super-fast Fiber internet: Austin, Texas. "We are very glad that Google has been convinced to bring Fiber to Austin," said Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell. "Google Fiber will change how we live and how we work in ways we don't even know about yet." Austin will become the second US city, following Kansas City, to receive Google's groundbreaking internet service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/14/justin-bieber-anne-frank/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Bieber Hopes Girl Killed by Nazis Would Have Liked His Music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a highly publicized appearance at Amsterdam's Anne Frank House, the site where Frank and her family hid from the Nazis from 1942 to 1944, an "inspired" Justin Bieber left some deep thoughts in the museum's guestbook. "Anne was a great girl," he wrote. "Hopefully she would have been a belieber."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/13/facebook-home-bad-rating/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Home Rated Just 1 Star by 44% of Google Play Reviewers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like Android users aren't happy about Facebook Home moving into their Android phones. A day after launch, an astounding 44% of users who have reviewed the app on Google Play gave it just one star, with a mere 19.4% of users opting to give Home a 5-star rating. All that equates to an average 2.5-star rating in Google Play, not exactly an ideal first-day showing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/04/13/facebook-home-ad-2/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Screaming Goat Featured in Funniest Facebook Home Ad Yet [VIDEO]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hate Facebook Home, watch a goat scream at Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook launched its third Facebook Home ad late Friday, the latest in a series of ads with questionable messages, including Facebook users' apparent inability to effectively remove themselves from their virtual experiences in order to have actual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software development kit (SDK) for the Pebble smart watch is now available for download. The makers of the smart watch promised that the SDK would go public once the watches began shipping (check out our recent hands-on with the timepiece/app hub), and Pebble has now made the SDK and all related documentation available to those interested in developing for the Bluetooth-enabled device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cellphone turned 40 last week. And it's a remarkable achievement. Really. It is. Even its inventor, Martin Cooper, thought that it would never beat out the landline. It may be hard to remember this in 2013, but when the cellphone was first introduced, it was a little bit like Google Glass -- a cutting-edge device that let you do amazing things but also immediately branded you as a goofball to the vast throngs of the uninitiated. In the '80s, cellphones weren't small devices. They were ginormous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just when I had started to wrap my head around the concept of 3D printing, 4D printing has emerged. The fascinating, if overwhelming, TED Talk posted yesterday explaining this next wave of the future—3D printed materials that have the capability of transformation. So, the fourth dimension is time itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr Storyboard recently interviewed Mike Breach, a New York City barista who has gained Internet notoriety for his wonderful latte art portraits. Breach began exercising his latte art skills last year as a way to relieve boredom while working at a hotel. You can browse his latte art on his Tumblr blog, Baristart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oslo-based Norwegian artist Ida Skivenes—we featured her whimsical breakfast food art previously—has playfully re-created well-known works of art with various food items on toast. Documenting her fun re-creations on Instagram, she has produced edible versions of paintings from Monet, Van Gogh and Dali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMG. It's one of the most popular phrases of the modern technological age used by just about every teenage girl in Western civilisation.However, it seems the 'Oh my God' initialism O.M.G. is actually very 'last century'.It dates back to 1917 when British admiral John Arbuthnot Fisher first penned the expression in a letter to Winston Churchill.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Monday, April 15, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22134898" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Google chief urges action to regulate mini-drones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The influential head of Google, Eric Schmidt, has called for civilian drone technology to be regulated, warning about privacy and security concerns. Cheap miniature versions of the unmanned aircraft used by militaries could fall into the wrong hands, he told the UK's Guardian newspaper. Quarrelling neighbours, he suggested, might end up buzzing each other with private surveillance drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/13/us-china-us-cyber-idUSBRE93C05T20130413" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;U.S., China agree to work together on cyber security | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China and the United States will set up a working group on cyber-security, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Saturday, as the two sides moved to ease months of tensions and mutual accusations of hacking and Internet theft. Speaking to reporters in Beijing during a visit to China, Kerry said the United States and China had agreed on the need to speed up action on cyber security, an area that Washington says is its top national security concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/napster-fm-is-an-open-source-social-music-player-that-can-be-hosted-by-anyone-in-case-of-shutdown/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Napster.fm Is An Open Source Social Music Player That Can Be Hosted By Anyone In Case Of Shutdown | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of music piracy, there was Napster. On Sunday a service called Napster.fm popped up, a project started by Carnegie Mellon student Ryan Lester. It's a web-based music player essentially dependent upon “minor inefficiencies in YouTube’s piracy-detection system.” The project is open source and can be set up by anyone in case it ever gets shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/14/investment-firms-predict-aws-will-do-as-much-as-20-billion-in-revenues-by-2020-draining-it/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Investment Firm Expects AWS Will Hit $20 Billion In Revenues By 2020 | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Research has issued a research report saying it expects Amazon Web Services will have an estimated $20 billion in revenues by the end of the decade. In a separate report, RW Baird &amp;amp; Co. projects $10 billion in revenue for AWS by 2016 and up to $40 billion in losses from the traditional IT market. The estimates reflect Wall Street’s growing confidence in cloud services and the need that analysts see in letting their customers know that a shift is underway that will lead to continued flat revenues or even losses for enterprise companies and systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/business/global/blackberry-disputes-report-on-z10-phone.html?ref=technology" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BlackBerry Disputes Report on Z10 Phone - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry contends that a securities analyst’s report about its latest phone is not only wrong, it’s so wrong that it should be investigated by securities regulators. The report, issued on Thursday by Detwiler Fenton &amp;amp; Company in Boston, said that BlackBerry’s new Z10 phone is being returned by shoppers at an above-average rate. In a statement on Friday, BlackBerry called the analysis “false and misleading” and suggested that it was an attempt to manipulate the company’s share price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/rackspace-goes-on-offense-against-second-patent-troll-in-two-weeks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Rackspace goes on offense against second patent troll in two weeks | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one week after Rackspace announced it would take on a notorious patent-holding company, the company is at it again. Unwilling to pay a $75,000 demand to a patent troll called Rotatable Techologies, Rackspace is moving to invalidate its patent, No. 6,326,978, by initiating a process at the patent office called an inter partes review. "The trolls are bringing very flimsy lawsuits looking for quick settlements, and enough is enough," said Rackspace general counsel Alan Schoenbaum. "We see patent litigation as a threat to open source software and projects. It's gotten out of hand." Rotatable has said it's got a patent on the functionality that rotates a screen on a smartphone. That enables it to sue just about any app developer out there, just for calling up a simple functionality used by many apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/dont-let-verizon-att-run-roughshod-over-smaller-carriers-doj-warns/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Don’t let Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T run roughshod over smaller carriers, DOJ warns | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US antitrust officials today urged the Federal Communications Commission to limit the amount of wireless spectrum Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;amp;T can buy during future auctions. The Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, in a letter sent to the FCC made public Friday, said Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have more than their share of prime spectrum compared to T-Mobile and Sprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/pebble-smart-watch-sdk-is-now-ready-for-creative-third-parties/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pebble smart watch SDK is now ready for creative third parties | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software development kit (SDK) for the Pebble smart watch is now available for download. The makers of the smart watch promised that the SDK would go public once the watches began shipping, and Pebble has now made the SDK and all related documentation available to those interested in developing for the Bluetooth-enabled device. Pebble earned its spot in the limelight with a popular Kickstarter campaign last year, raising about $10.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57579491-1/construction-of-worlds-largest-optical-telescope-approved/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Construction of world&amp;#x27;s largest optical telescope approved | Crave - CNET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiian Board of Land and Natural Resources has backed building what's to be the world's largest, most powerful optical telescope above the clouds atop the volcano Mauna Kea. The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will have a primary mirror of 492 segments measuring some 100 feet across, giving it the power to image objects 13 billion light years away, near the beginning of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/14/4225336/microsoft-working-on-smart-watch" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft working on a smartwatch, says WSJ | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a touch-enabled smartwatch, reports The Wall Street Journal. Citing unnamed supply chain sources, The Journal claims that Microsoft asked Asian suppliers to ship components for the device. If the reports are true, Microsoft would be joining the likes of Apple, Samsung, Google, and others looking to capitalize on a forecasted boom in wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/04/4chan-mall-shooter/?ed=5aH" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Virginia Mall Shooter Apparently Announced Crime in Advance on 4chan | Threat Level | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man arrested Friday in connection to the shooting of two women at a suburban Virginia mall may have announced his crime minutes in advance on the 4chan message board. The alleged shooter identified himself on the troublemaking board on 4chan as Neil Macinnis and provided his contact information with his posting. The shootings occurred at a mall in the town of about 21,000 in southwestern Virginia. Police were called about 2 p.m. when somebody reported a man with a gun at the community college’s satellite location in the mall. The two victims were rushed to a local hospital. Their condition was not immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2013/4/15/4225958/dish-sprint-takeover-bid" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dish Network attempts $25.5 billion Sprint takeover | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network has launched a $25.5 billion takeover bid that would see it take control of Sprint. Japanese carrier SoftBank is currently in the process of purchasing Sprint, but Dish's offer could derail the takeover. Today's announcement represents a proposal, rather than a legally-binding offer, but The Wall Street Journal says the company is confident it can raise the funds necessary for such a large purchase. Under the conditions of the bid, Dish's shareholders would gain full control over the merged company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/15/4225872/vodafone-disables-cell-tower-thanks-to-rare-bird-nest" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Nesting falcons claim UK cell tower, Vodafone surrenders | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK mobile operator Vodafone has been forced to disable one of its cell towers in the city of Southampton after a peregrine falcon (duck hawk) chose the site for its nest. According to the BBC, some customers in the north of the city have been left without signal after engineers were unable to fix a problem with the mobile mast because the bird has a protected status and cannot be disturbed. Wildlife experts believe Vodafone may have to wait until June before the fledglings leave the roost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gregpak/code-monkey-save-world" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Code Monkey Save World by Greg Pak — Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comics writer Greg Pak, internet superstar musician Jonathan Coulton, and artist Takeshi Miyazawa have joined forces to create a graphic novel that stars the much-loved monsters and super-villains from classic Coulton songs like "Code Monkey," "Skullcrusher Mountain," "The Future Soon," and "Re: Your Brains."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are looking for $39000 to fund the book—which they could reach very soon, looking at the current total raised.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Friday, April 12, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4213452/hugo-teso-full-airplane-flight-control-using-android-app" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Aircraft security exploit gives researcher full access to navigation controls | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hacker could gain complete control over a plane's navigation using an Android smartphone, according to a new report from security researcher Hugo Teso. Forbes reports that Teso demonstrated how using a custom application on his Samsung Galaxy, he was able to exploit certain systems in a plane's electronics. This gave him full control over navigation, as long as the plane remained in autopilot, and limited control over lesser functions such as cockpit lights. If the aircraft's pilots did not eventually engage manual controls, a hacker could accomplish any number of malicious actions, such as crashing one aircraft into another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been many things in a short time: Olympic rowers. Nemeses of Mark Zuckerberg. Characters on “The Simpsons.” Now they can add a new label: bitcoin moguls.The 31-year-old identical twins have amassed since last summer what appears to be one of the single largest portfolios of the online currency that has caused such a stir in financial and technology circles. An array of speculators have now bid up the price of the bitcoin to the point where the outstanding supply of the digital money was worth $1.3 billion at last count. The Winklevii — as they are popularly known — say they own nearly 1 percent of that, or some $11 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-11/foursquare-gets-41-million-investment-time-to-grow" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Foursquare Gets $41 Million Investment, Time to Grow - Businessweek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Dennis Crowley debuted Foursquare, his location-based social media app, at South by Southwest in 2009, he got rave reviews. The tech blog Mashable called Foursquare the “breakout mobile app” of the event. VentureBeat called it “the next Twitter.” At this year’s SXSW, Crowley, 36, had to remind people his company still exists. In early April the company got $41 million from private equity fund Silver Lake Partners and venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, and Spark Capital. The bulk of the money is a multiyear loan from Silver Lake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will happen to your Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive and Google  accounts after you die? That’s probably not something you really want to think about, but as more and more of our data now lives online, that’s sadly a question that comes up with some regularity. Today, Google is launching its Inactive Account Manager on the Google Account settings page, which sets out to set up a system that allows you to tell Google “what you want done with your digital assets when you die or can no longer use your account.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130411/yep-linkedin-acquires-newsreader-startup-pulse-for-90-million/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Yep, LinkedIn Acquires Newsreader Startup Pulse for $90 Million - Mike Isaac - Social - AllThingsD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn announced on Thursday it has acquired mobile news aggregation startup Pulse, as Kara Swisher reported last month that it would, signaling another step by the massive professional network toward becoming an online content powerhouse.It’s a big buy for LinkedIn, costing a cool $90 million, according to the company.The app, which collects news articles from a range of topics chosen by users and presents them in a clean, stylish format, rose to the top of Apple’s App Store ranks just a few years ago, quickly becoming a favorite among the many newsreaders currently available. Pulse currently claims more than 30 million users globally who read more than ten million stories daily using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323741004578415661035812902-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwMTExNDEyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Plans 7-Inch Tablet - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software giant is developing a new lineup of its Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year, said people familiar with the company's plans. Chasing the likes of the iPad Mini, Microsoft plans to launch a 7-inch version of its Surface tablet this year. The WSJ’s Yun-hee Kim talks about why the company is jumping into this hot corner of the tablet market.Microsoft's tablet ambitions, combined with planned price breaks for its flagship software and updates in coming months to its Windows operating software, paint the picture of a company trying to move more quickly than ever to counter urgent threats to its $75 billion software empire.One person familiar with Microsoft's product plans said the 7-inch tablets weren't part of the company's strategy last year, but Microsoft executives realized they needed a response to the rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57579190-94/blackberry-denies-abnormally-high-return-rate-for-z10-phone/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BlackBerry denies abnormally high return rate for Z10 phone | Mobile - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry shares took a hit today after a few analysts criticized the tepid launch of the Z10 phone in the U.S., with one analyst claiming that the return rate was higher than the sales rate. Another said sales have dropped significantly at carrier stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-zuckerberg-immigration-idUSBRE93A0SM20130411" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook&amp;#x27;s Zuckerberg calls for U.S. immigration reform | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs to fix a "strange" immigration policy that prevents promising but undocumented students from contributing to the country's future and doesn't provide enough visas for foreign workers with advanced skills."We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants. And it's a policy unfit for today's world," the 28-year-old founder of the world's largest Internet social network said in an opinion column in The Washington Post on Thursday.Comprehensive immigration reform and improvements in the U.S. education system were needed, Zuckerberg said in the article, which formally introduced a new advocacy group of Silicon Valley bigwigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of new PCs plummeted nearly 14 percent globally in the first three months of the year, and much of the blame is being placed on Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system.International Data Corp. reported Wednesday that shipments of PCs totaled 76.3 million worldwide in the first quarter of 2013, down 13.9 percent from the same period the previous year."PC shipments were down significantly across all regions compared to a year ago," IDC said, blaming "fading mini notebook shipments and competition from tablets and smartphones ... as well as a weak reception for Windows 8."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4214728/agreement-between-apple-and-universal-music-on-iradio-is-imminent" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple and Universal Music agreement on streaming iRadio service imminent | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is expected to sign its first internet radio licensing agreement with a major record label perhaps as soon as next week, multiple sources with knowledge of the talks have told The Verge. Universal Music Group, the largest of the major record companies, has reached the final stages of the negotiations and Warner Music is close behind, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2013/04/12/twitters-music-service-may-launch-as-early-as-this-friday/?fromcat=all" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter reportedly set to release music app on Friday, April 12 - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Mike Isaac and Peter Kafka of AllThingsD, Twitter intends to launch its music service on Friday. Citing “sources familiar with the matter,” the duo’s report indicates that Twitter’s musical debut isn’t merely soon, but is expected today. We Are Hunted announced that it had joined Twitter, and celebrity Ryan Seacrest tweeted about using the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has also released a landing page titled '#music' that allows you to authorize a 'Twitter Trending Music App', but does nothing more at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK mobile operator O2 has unveiled a new smartphone plan aimed at helping its customers upgrade to the very latest phones without incurring an expensive penalty. Named O2 Refresh, the carrier's new 24 month plan splits the cost of the smartphone and airtime, allowing customers to upgrade their handset at any time, paying only for the cost of the outstanding handset portion of their contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook has pushed an update for its Android Messenger app, allowing users to take advantage of the new Chat Heads feature. Like in Facebook Home, the Messenger app displays a round icon with the face of whoever you're talking to, regardless of the app you are using. Now, you'll be able to tap the chat head to reply to both SMS and Facebook messages, giving you a little piece of Facebook Home without having to install the full launcher app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Home launched in the US today for selected Android devices&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Thursday, April 11, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4208970/next-xbox-tv-entertainment-plans" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Exclusive: Microsoft&amp;#x27;s next Xbox will take over your TV, interact with your cable box | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is investing in TV in a big way with its next Xbox console as part of a fight for the living room. Multiple sources familiar with the company's Xbox plans have revealed to The Verge that Microsoft will introduce a feature that lets its next-generation console take over a TV and set-top box in a similar way to Google TV. The Verge understands that the next Xbox will require an online connection to use the entertainment services, allowing them to be always-on for streaming and access to TV signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/11/4212054/next-xbox-launch-titles-ryse-forza" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Next-generation Xbox launch titles include &amp;#x27;Ryse&amp;#x27; and a new &amp;#x27;Forza&amp;#x27; | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a number of launch titles for its new Xbox console. One of the first games to launch on the next Xbox will be Ryse, according to multiple sources familiar with Microsoft's Xbox plans. Microsoft originally unveiled Ryse at E3 2011, promising an exclusive Xbox 360 release with Kinect functionality. A release has never materialized for Xbox 360 and the company has remained fairly silent about the title's progress, noting that it was still in development in mid-2012 and again earlier this year. The Verge understands that Crytek, along with Microsoft Studios, has been rewriting the game to take advantage of its next-generation console, due later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130410/apples-ouster-of-appgratis-is-just-the-start-of-an-app-store-crackdown/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Why Apple Pulled AppGratis From the App Store - John Paczkowski - Mobile - AllThingsD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with Apple’s thinking tell AllThingsD that AppGratis’ ouster was a first step in a broader enforcement action generally targeted at app-discovery apps that run afoul of clauses 2.25 and 5.6 which forbid apps that promote apps other than a developer’s own, and prohibit developers from using push notifications to deliver marketing messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/well-that-was-fast-twitter-shut-down-ribbons-newly-launched-in-stream-payments-feature-built-using-twitter-card-technology/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Well, That Was Fast: Twitter Already Shut Down Ribbon’s Newly Launched In-Stream Payments Feature | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, payments startup Ribbon announced support for “in-stream” payments on Twitter.com, allowing users to click a button directly within a tweet in order to make a purchase without having to leave the Twitter.com website. However, it appears that Twitter has already shut this feature down – almost immediately after its public debut.Ribbon Co-founder Hany Rashwan has confirmed that Twitter has indeed shut them down, and the company is now in the process of trying to contact Twitter to discuss. It’s possible that the way Ribbon implemented the in-stream payments using Twitter Cards (via the Player Card model) was a violation of Twitter’s Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887324695104578414973888155516-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwMDExNDAyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;IDC: Global PC Shipments Drop 13.9% in First Quarter - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 13.9% in the first quarter, according to market researcher IDC, in the biggest decline since the firm began issuing quarterly numbers in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grim estimate of 76.3 million units shipped is the latest sign that consumers are shifting their dollars to smartphones and tablets rather than PCs, while responses such as convertible laptops and Microsoft Corp.'s touch-oriented Windows 8 operating system haven't stemmed the cannibalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/10/dropbox-for-teams-gets-dropped-in-re-branding-to-reflect-business-focus/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dropbox For Teams Gets Dropped In Re-Branding To Reflect “Business” Focus | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is renaming Dropbox Teams to better reflect its change in business focus. The move comes in tandem with Dropbox’s new support for single sign on (SSO) and partnerships with Okta and other identity providers.Dropbox for Business will replace the old name, reflecting the company’s change in focus to be more on larger business customers than teams within organizations.In particular, this means support for Active Directory (AD), the traditional mechanism companies use to authenticate and manage an employee’s corporate identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130410/in-midst-of-mobile-pivot-mozilla-ceo-kovacs-to-step-down-later-this-year/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;In Midst of Mobile Pivot, Mozilla CEO Kovacs to Step Down - Kara Swisher - Mobile - AllThingsD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gary Kovacs, who has been CEO of Mozilla for just over two years, will be stepping down later this year, the company announced Wednesday to employees. The Mountain View, Calif.-based open source software nonprofit foundation (which is also a for-profit company) said it will be searching for a new leader immediately to replace Kovacs, who will remain on the board of Mozilla.“After three years of a lot of change to move the organization faster forward, I wanted to move back to something more commercial,” said Kovacs in an interview yesterday, in which he outlined the many changes made at Mozilla since he arrived, including adding staff, opening global offices and, most of all, doubling down in mobile. “It is really a different Mozilla.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-plunges-2013-4?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Bitcoin Plunges - Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's shaping up to be a pretty ugly day for Bitcoin.After soaring past $250 earlier, it's tumbled all the way down to current levels around $150.Bitcoin is now 44 percent off its intraday high of $266.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4208166/yokohama-mistakenly-tweets-north-korean-missile-strike" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Japanese city accidentally tweets North Korean missile launch | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residents in the Japanese city of Yokohama came in for a shock earlier today after city officials mistakenly posted a tweet stating that North Korea had launched a missile. According to ABC News, the city posted the tweet around noon local time, exclaiming "North Korea has launched a missile," sharing it with @yokohama_saigai's 40,000 followers for around 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/10/google-forms-the-glass-collective-to-invest-in-eye-technology/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google forms the Glass Collective to invest in eye technology entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google believes that it's naive to build a wearable technology like Google Glass and expect successful businesses to simply materialize from thin air; those firms will need a financial nudge, too. Accordingly, Google is forming the Glass Collective to invest in projects centering on its eyewear. The partnership will see Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp;amp; Byers unite on seed funding for those US-based startups which show promise in areas like communication and navigation. The group hasn't named any targets for its cash, but it's obviously very early days for both Glass and the Collective -- Google needs more developers in the field before it can shower companies with support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Postal Service announced Wednesday that it would cancel plans to end Saturday mail delivery this summer, saying the new stopgap budget that Congress recently passed would prohibit the move.The postal service’s board of governors made the decision Tuesday, according to a statement from the agency.“The board believes that Congress has left it with no choice but to delay this implementation at this time,” the board said in the statement. “The board also wants to ensure that customers of the Postal Service are not unduly burdened by ongoing uncertainties and are able to adjust their business plans accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lawmakers prepare to discuss the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, or CISPA, Internet freedom activists are ramping up their campaign against it. On Wednesday, the advocacy group Fight for the Future published a video of Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian calling for online giants to speak up and fight against CISPA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/10/us-usa-fiscal-cybersecurity-idUSBRE93913S20130410" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Obama budget makes cybersecurity a growing U.S. priority | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama proposed on Wednesday increased spending to protect U.S. computer networks from Internet-based attacks in a sign that the government aims to put more resources into the emerging global cyber arms race.Obama's budget proposal for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins October 1, calls for more military "hackers" to head off escalating cyber threats from China, Iran, Russia and other countries. It would also bolster defenses for government and private-sector computer networks.Intelligence officials said last month that cyber attacks and espionage have supplanted terrorism as the top security threat facing the United States, and military officials sounded the alarm as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks of rumors, Samsung has today officially confirmed the Galaxy Mega series -- a line of big-screen smartphones aimed to straddle the space between the traditional phone and tablet markets. The official names, as rumored, are Galaxy Mega 5.8 and Galaxy Mega 6.3.&lt;/p&gt;

Winklevoss twins claim to own 1 percent of all Bitcoin | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may not have invented Facebook, but twin tech entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss — better known to the world as the Winklevoss twins, or Winkelvii — are deep into the next big online trend. The brothers claim to have amassed one of the largest portfolios of Bitcoin in the world, worth around $1.3 million, or about 1 percent of the entire currency's dollar value equivalent, as the New York Times Dealbook reports.That staggering amount comes in a little less than a year, as the brothers are only reported to have begun "dabbling" in Bitcoin starting last summer. “We have elected to put our money and faith in a mathematical framework that is free of politics and human error,” Tyler Winklevoss told Dealbook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The news for Wednesday, April 10, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/9/4196022/windows-phone-8-1080p-resolution-support-gdr3-update" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Phone 8 will support 1080p displays by the end of the year | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is planning to update Windows Phone 8 to support 1080p resolutions. Sources familiar with Microsoft's Windows Phone plans have revealed to The Verge that the company will issue an update later this year that brings support for the 1080p resolution and new 5-inch and higher devices. Windows Phone 8 currently supports WVGA, WXGA, and 720p resolutions.The update, known as a General Distribution Release (GDR3) for Windows Phone, will set the stage for new devices set to debut for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2013/04/09/apple-says-that-some-users-may-be-experiencing-imessage-service-issues/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple experiences iMessage and Facetime service issues - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Apple was facing downtime issues with their messaging systems. According to Apple’s Support page the total downtime appears to have been just over 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/04/09/aols-new-publisher-tool-to-compete-with-google-armstrong-says-its-back-in-ad-tech-game/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;AOL’s new publisher tool to compete with Google, Armstrong says it’s back in “ad tech game” — paidContent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL announced a new product for publishers called Marketplace, which integrates various elements of its ad tech platforms. The move comes as AOL redoubles its efforts to bring in revenue unrelated to its legacy copper wire business.“This gets us back into the ad tech game in a serious manner,” said CEO Tim Armstrong, speaking at the AdTech conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.The new Marketplace product, which will compete with offerings from Google and Adobe, is intended to provide publishers with an alternative to using multiple companies to carry out the process of selling and serving digital advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/04/10/google-play-music-arrives-in-7-more-countries-including-new-zealand-australia-austria-and-ireland/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play Music arrives in 7 more countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Austria, and Ireland - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is expanding its service coverage of its music service. We initially heard reports of the nearly two-year old service being available in Australia and New Zealand. Readers have shared with us that prior to today, if they visited music.google.com, the site would be unavailable. However, following the redesign of the Google Play Store, it appears the service has been enabled. A post by Google has confirmed the launch.A Google  post has indicated that the service is also now available in five more countries, including Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, and Portugal. Users can store up to 20,000 songs on Google Play for free and have it streamed instantly to their Android device. With many more countries now supported, Google is including music from established local artists. However, for those not currently signed to a record label, Google is releasing a Google Play artist hub for their respective country enabling them to sell music directly to their fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/09/google-gives-3m-global-impact-award-grant-to-three-organizations-to-support-global-human-trafficking-hotline/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Gives $3M Global Impact Award Grant To Three Organizations To Support “Global Human Trafficking Hotline” | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s non-profit arm announced its Global Impact Awards program last December and has announced three organizations that would be receiving $3 million in grants. All of these organizations are focused on setting up human trafficking helplines to help identify potential victims and provide them with support, no matter where they are in the world.The three organizations — Polaris Project, Liberty Asia and La Strada International — are working together to form a “Global Human Trafficking Hotline Network.”In Google’s announcement today, the company says that 21 million people are enslaved in one way or another globally and generating $32 billion in profit for those who are managing the illegal activity. The hope for these organizations is that they can collect data from all local helpline services to be able to view patterns and triangulate the hotspots in the world that are most egregious. Dating back to 2011, Google has invested $14.5 million into anti-trafficking efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/09/box-updates-its-outlook-plugin-and-makes-it-available-for-users-with-free-accounts-too/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Box Updates Its Outlook Plugin And Makes It Available For Users With Free Accounts, Too | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desktop-based email clients aren’t exactly a hot topic these days, but millions of users still rely on their trusty Outlook client. To bridge the gap between Outlook on the desktop and the web, the popular online content-sharing and management service Box has long offered an add-on that allows Outlook users to use Box for managing email attachments. Until today, this add-on was only available for paying Business and Enterprise customers, but starting now, even users with free Box accounts can install this plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/9/4206794/apple-and-yahoo-in-talks-to-build-a-deeper-ios-partnership" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple and Yahoo reportedly in talks to build a deeper iOS partnership | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is in talks with Yahoo to bring more of the search company's data to the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, reports The Wall Street Journal. Yahoo has long been one of the data providers for iOS devices — the default stocks and weather apps pull data from Yahoo, and Siri uses the company for things like sports statistics as well. Now, the companies are discussing ways to get more Yahoo data, including expanded sports data and content from Yahoo News onto iOS, presumably through Siri or other built-in apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/09/boxee-tv-becomes-boxee-cloud-dvr-adds-free-basic-dvr-service/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Boxee TV becomes Boxee Cloud DVR, adds free &amp;#x27;Basic&amp;#x27; DVR service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the trend of everything accentuating its connection to the "cloud," Boxee has rebranded its new box as the Boxee Cloud DVR. GigaOm reports the company made the shift to emphasize its DVR features as a differentiator from other $99 set-tops like those offered by Roku and Apple. Other than the name change and a website redesign, one other new tack is a free "Basic" service package. Buyers still get the "All-access" $10 service tier free for a month upfront on a trial basis, which has unlimited storage and playback across different devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4207894/google-babel-cross-platform-messaging-platform-rumors" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Babel: an ambitious messaging platform rumored ahead of I/O event | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past couple of weeks, rumors have been swirling that Google is working on a cross-platform messaging service called Babel that will tie together all of its existing communication products, from Google Talk and Hangouts to Voice and Google  Messenger. If the rumors are correct, it will do everything from provide a single, synced conversation list across all your devices, to turn a group discussion into a Hangout video chat with a single touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4206532/panic-status-board-app-ipad-widgets-airplay-streaming" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Panic debuts Status Board app, a widget hub for iPad | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app developer Panic has released only a small number of apps in the more than a decade that its been around, but its apps are often regarded as well-made and polished. Panic is today introducing Status Board, an app that turns an iPad into a news ticker, a calendar, and a widget hub all at once. The app imports data from the device, automatically filling up the screen with your Twitter feed, unread emails, and the local weather in discrete blocks not unlike what you'd find on Apple's Dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imore.com/t-mobile-usa-will-offer-free-iphone-5-iphone-users-switching-another-carrier" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile USA will offer free iPhone 5 to iPhone users switching from another carrier | iMore.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T-Mobile USA is offering an iPhone 5 for free on activation when you switch from another carrier and trade in your current iPhone 4 or 4S. The offer is available through Father’s Day, June 16, and customers who take advantage of this deal will receive a $120 credit that can be put towards things like monthly payments, outstanding bills, or accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/10/4208682/simcity-mac-release-date" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;SimCity launching June 11 on Mac, get both PC and Mac versions with single purchase | Polygon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SimCity will be available June 11 on Mac OS X, and users who buy either that version or the existing Windows PC version will receive copies on both platforms, publisher Electronic Arts announced today. Let's just hope they've fixed their system issues by then..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has just announced the release of Playbook Guides, a new resource for YouTube creators making content in common categories like music, sports, education, media companies and non-profits.Augmenting its Creator Playbook, the original resource for YouTube best practices, Google says Playbook Guides offer “tailored tips and strategies specific to the type of content you create.”&lt;/p&gt;
