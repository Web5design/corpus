      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss the latest in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323393304578360651345373308-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwNDExNDQyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Working on Incorporating the Hashtag - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is working on incorporating the hashtag, one of Twitter's most iconic markers, into its service by using the symbol as a way to group conversations, said people familiar with the matter. It is unclear how far along Facebook's work on the hashtag is and the feature isn't likely to be introduced imminently, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/14/apple-offering-imacs-with-optional-vesa-mount-adapters/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple offering iMacs with optional VESA mount adapters | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has begun offering iMacs with an optional VESA mount adapter. The new BTO option was first noticed by Macworld UK. Users who buy an iMac on Apple's online store can order the iMac with the VESA mount adapter instead of the standard foot stand for an additional US$40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/12/study-only-16-of-users-will-retry-a-malfunctioning-app/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Study: Only 16% of users will retry a malfunctioning app | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions are important when you are selling an app. According to a new study by Compuware that was reported by TechCrunch, you only have one chance, maybe two, to get a customer to become a regular user of your app. If glitches force a customer to try your app a third or fourth time, you risk losing 84 percent of your user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102720/outlook-outage-overheating-datacenter" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft blames overheating datacenter for 16-hour Outlook outage | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's outlook.com webmail service suffered 16-hour long issues yesterday after a firmware upgrade at the company's datacenter went wrong. In a blog post detailing the outage, Microsoft reveals some customers couldn't access parts of SkyDrive, Hotmail, and Outlook. Although Microsoft has updated its datacenter firmware successfully previously, the regular process "resulted in a rapid and substantial temperature spike in the datacenter" due to an unspecified reason. The overheating was significant enough to activate Microsoft's safeguard process for a number of servers in the datacenter, preventing access to certain mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new job search platform has played host to around $225 million in job offers. And with today’s news, the company is seeing some inbound cash as well: $2.7 million in a first round of institutional funding led by NEA and Sierra Ventures with participation from Google Ventures, Crosslink Capital, and Jeff Clavier’sSoftTech VC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/reuters-editor-indicted-for-conspiring-with-hacker-group-anonymous/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters Editor Indicted For Conspiring With Hacker Group, Anonymous | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuter’s Deputy Editor of Social Media, Matthew Keys, has been indicted for allegedly conspiring with hacktivist group, “Anonymous.” According to the Department of Justice, “Keys provided members of the hacker group Anonymous with log-in credentials for a computer server belonging to KTXL FOX 40’s corporate parent, the Tribune Company.”The indictment includes allegations of aiding hackers in defacing the Los Angeles Times websites. “That was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,” wrote a co-conspirator to Keys in a conversation intercepted by the Justice Department [PDF].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t get enough of the folksy musings of “America’s Happy Warrior,” the White House has launched the Being Joe Biden Portal. “If you want to keep people away during an earthquake, buy some shotgun shells,” said Vice President Biden, in response to a question about assault weapons bans during a Google  hangout last January. If Biden’s first broadcast is any indication, the audio series will surely bring weekly smiles from the Veep’s lovable down-home charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has released OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.3 and the first security update of 2013. The update includes a number of good improvements including:The ability to redeem iTunes gift cards in the Mac App Store using the built-in camera on a MacBoot Camp support for installing Windows 8 and Macs with a 3 TB hard drive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader being shut down by its malevolent overlords leaves a gaping, Google Reader-sized hole in the market where it used to be. Many are stepping up today to announce that their products or services can act as a replacement, but one source is specifically saying it will build a functionally complete replacement – news aggregation service Digg.Digg just announced on its official blog that it was previously planning on building a reader in the second half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit present a case study in which "dystexia" was the only symptom of a stroke. The patient had no trouble speaking, only texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc's mapping and commerce chief is stepping down in the latest senior management reshuffle after Android architect Andy Rubin moved on to a still-undefined role at the company on Wednesday.Google will split its Maps/Geo and Commerce group into two separate units. Senior Vice President Jeff Huber, who has led the group since 2011, is moving to Google X, the company's experimental projects group known for developing self-driving cars and the Google Glass wearable computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love spending time soaking up the sun, a new Kickstarter project can protect you from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays.UVeBand, a slap bracelet, monitors your exposure to the sun and vibrates when you need to apply more sunscreen. The device works after you've applied your first layer of lotion or spray and automatically turns on after making contact with your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-just-happened/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Launches The Galaxy S 4 With A Baffling, Overproduced Broadway-Style Show | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, illustrating different features of your new phone with real-world scenarios isn’t a terrible idea. And if you must hold your event in the Radio City, why not get theatrical? But what’s impressive here is how the skits are both terribly written and unconvincing (like, maybe intentionally so, because that makes it better?), and yet Samsung is really committing to them — actors get played on and off with cheesy music, and there have been multiple dance numbers. This was how Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 yesterday and their methods were laughably received by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kiln - Version Control and Code Review Software from Fog Creek Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-galaxy-s-iv-36261" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Marketing LandSamsung Launches The Galaxy S4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung formally unveiled the latest in its Galaxy S line-up of smartphones, the Galaxy S4 (or officially, the Galaxy S 4). The phone features a 5? screen without getting larger than the Galaxy S3 plus an array of features that seemingly put Samsung’s own brand ahead of Google and Android. Samsung said the phone will be available worldwide some time in April, supporting both 3G and 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-introduces-galaxy-s-iv-phone-with-nary-a-mention-of-android-or-google-2-36316" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Introduces Galaxy S4 With Nary A Mention Of Android Or Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung unveiled its heavily anticipated Galaxy S4 handset. The event had the hype and production values of an Apple product launch. But, what barely seemed in attendance was any idea that the S4 is an Android phone or contains Google services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the product launch was devoted to showcasing software rather than hardware features. Samsung is positioning the phone as a “life companion.” Perhaps most interesting, Google was never mentioned and Android drew one lesser mention in the context of the phone’s “Knox” enterprise security system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Google Reader shutting down, the new Pope, the new President of China, Samsung Galaxy S 4, and Pi Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/03/13/google-reader-shutdown/1986337/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader shutting down in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is shutting down its popular RSS Reader as part of a broader "spring cleaning" to concentrate on a smaller selection of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader will shut down July 1, so users have enough time to transition to a new option. Launched in 2005, the RSS Reader allowed users to pull content feeds from a variety of websites into one personal hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other services getting shuttered: Google Building Maker, Google Cloud Connect and the voice app for BlackBerry devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader to shut down July 1st | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, which originally launched back in 2005, will be officially put out to pasture on July 1st, 2013. Reader has gone through a number of iterations, but it had not been significantly updated in a long time. The last time that Google updated the product, it built in integration for the Google+ social network and removed Reader's own native sharing service, causing a bit of a backlash with die hard users. Google is offering users a way to export their Reader content, including lists of users that they follow and starred and liked articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google says it is killing it off because "usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products." As one of the most popular RSS aggregators around, the death of Google Reader could spell doom for the RSS protocol itself, which has seen waning popularity since the rise of social sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2013/03/14/as-google-reader-is-killed-off-flipboard-feedly-reeder-and-others-offer-rss-alternatives/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;As Google Reader is killed off, Flipboard, Feedly and others step up with RSS alternatives - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google axing Google Reader, this leaves the door open for others to step up with RSS alternatives. Feedly — a browser plug-in that turns feed into magazine-like layouts — has detailed its project to clone to Google Reader API, popular social aggregator Flipboard says its “got your RSS feeds covered”, open-source Newsblur is adding more servers to cope with Reader imports, while Reeder — another Google dependent – “won’t die with Google Reader”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a petition to ‘Keep Google Reader’ (there’s hope Google will open-source it) has gained more than 2,000 digital signatures. Given also that Feedly.com and Newsblur.com are down — presumably through the sheer volume of traffic — and that numerous blog posts have sprouted up on the subject, Reader’s exit will leave a void for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepartycow/status/311959283883466752" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter-Brian Walsh @thepartycow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21766622" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Xi Jinping named president of China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Beijing have confirmed Xi Jinping as president, completing China's 10-yearly transition of power. Mr Xi, appointed to the Communist Party's top post in November, replaces Hu Jintao, who is stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Xi assumes the leadership of a nation that is growing wealthier but more vocal in its anger at issues such as rising inequality, environmental damage and food safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also faces concern among regional neighbours over how China will wield its rising power, particularly in relations to thorny issues such as territorial disputes with Japan and Asean nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21781125?" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Francis begins his challenging papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis had been greeted by crowds roaring their approval when he appeared at the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square on Wednesday evening, about an hour after white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel to announce to the world that a new pontiff had been elected. Today, Pope Francis has begun his first day at the helm of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It seems that my brother cardinals have gone to the ends of the earth [to find a pope]," Francis said wryly, referring to his native Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old from Buenos Aires is the first Pope to take the name of Francis - reminiscent of Francis of Assisi, the 13th Century Italian reformer and patron saint of animals, who lived in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President Barack Obama sent "warm wishes" on behalf of the American people to the newly elected pontiff, hailing the Argentine as "the first Pope from the Americas".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102924/galaxy-s4-video-leak" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Leaked videos show Galaxy S 4 SmartPause, eye tracking, and new lock screen | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Samsung Unpacked event has even begun, the leaks have already started. The latest round of leaks, now helpfully arriving in video form, details two highlight features: SmartPause eye tracking and floating touch control. SmartPause does exactly the same thing LG announced yesterday — pausing and resuming video on the handset in accordance with whether you're looking at it or not. The floating touch appears to be an implementation of Samsung's Air View S Pen functionality, made to work without the stylus. Its purpose is to open up previews of things (such as a thumbnail on a video timeline) without requiring you to tap the display, you just hover your finger over the desired item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get a peek at the Galaxy S 4's browser performance, which looks satisfyingly quick and responsive, as well as its newly redesigned lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/4064006/samsung-galaxy-s-4-rumors" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S 4: Samsung prepares to unveil its latest flagship smartphone | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Samsung Unpacked launch event draws closer, more and more details are leaking out about the Galaxy S 4. If the leaks are accurate, the Galaxy S 4 will have a 1080p 5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, and an overclocked version of the PowerVR GPU found in the iPhone 5. It'll also have a host of new software features, as detailed by a series of videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Bradbury: The End of FeedDemon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Bradbury wrote and published a post yesterday on his site revealing that it is the end of FeedDemon saying "I've thoroughly enjoyed working on it and I'm grateful for all of the people who paid for it over the years despite free alternatives. But it's time for FeedDemon to die."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly states that FeedDemon's conclusions goes hand-in-hand with the death of Google Reader. Bradbury continues saying, "Then today came the news that Google Reader is shutting down on July 1. FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization, and there's no decent alternative (and even if there were, it's doubtful I'd have time to integrate with it, at least not without trading time away from my family - which I won't do). That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/the-google-reader-shutdown-is-yet-another-nail-in-feedburners-coffin/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Google Reader Shutdown Is Yet Another Nail In Feedburner&amp;#x27;s Coffin - TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Google Reader is out of the picture how much longer until we hear that FeedBurner will meet the same fate? The last RSS-focused product Google closed was AdSense for Feeds, its ad product for site owners who wanted to monetize their RSS feeds. With Reader and AdSense for Feeds gone, the last RSS product standing at Google is Feedburner – and all signs point to that getting the ax sooner or later, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Google Reader, it’s been a very long time since Feedburner got any updates and everything points at a total neglect of the product at Google: Its stats are sporadically unavailable, it never even got the visual refresh that virtually every other Google product got, the Feedburner blog (now called AdSense for Feeds – after the already closed product…) has been updated three times since April 2010. The FeedBurner Status Blog hasn’t been updated since last September. Things are not looking hopeful for FeedBurner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/twitter-line-breaks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter Now Supports Line Breaks in Tweets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter added support for line breaks Wednesday, a new feature that lets you spread your 140 character message over several different lines. Line breaks currently aren't supported on most third-party Twitter clients, nor are they supported in embedded tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just want to know if line breaks are supported in the bio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4103262/cbs-launches-ios-tv-streaming-app" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;CBS launches iOS streaming TV app with one-week delay for new episodes | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBS has been considering some interesting mobile and web options of its own.  "CBS Interactive," launched today for iPhone and iPad, it lets users stream full episodes of some shows, including CSI, How I Met Your Mother, and The Late Show with David Letterman. Like other networks, CBS already offers streaming on the web with roughly one-day delays across the board, but the app is a move towards more versatility and viewing outside the living room. New episodes of daytime and late-night shows will be added within 24 hours, and prime-time shows will arrive on the eighth day after broadcast. CBS is also touting extra "second screen" features for some shows. Warner Brothers launched a similar app with one-day delays last year, but only for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day! Pi, as we're sure you all know, is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, which is 3.14 in decimal form. It's actually more like 3.1415926, and can be calculated to many, many more digits because it's an irrational number. But we'll stick with 3.14 because it corresponds with March 14, which brings us back to Pi Day. Go make a Pie for Pi Day, some great recipes are linked here. (Not GF).&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jim and Dan talk about truth in reporting, trusting the news and news agencies, android users in the air, twisting numbers, Rubin stepping down, "cheap" guitars, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-things-changed-for-apple-2013-3?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Only Thing That Has Really Changed At Apple Is That There&amp;#x27;s No More Reality Distortion Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, it's a company for old people, and it's at risk of being the next Motorola — a one time high flyer who defined the mobile phone, but crashed when people moved on to the next thing.
What happened to Apple that it's been so thoroughly tarnished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/12/guessing-the-wall-street-journal-agenda-for-apple/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Guessing the Wall Street Journal Agenda for Apple - The Hiltmon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noted the past few months that the WSJ seems to issue regular negative news, no, opinions, no, rumors, no, rubbish on Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mac360.com/2013/03/when-it-comes-to-iphone-and-ipad-there-are-two-customer-groups-apple-doesnt-want-or-nee/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;When It Comes To iPhone And iPad There Are Two Customer Groups Apple Doesn’t Want Or Need | Mac360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have we heard about Apple ad nauseam for the past year? It’s not just that Apple is doomed.We hear that Apple needs to build an entry-level, less expensive iPhone or risk being left behind as Android dominates the smartphone world. Or, something like that. Such analysis overlooks Apple’s typical customer, and, importantly the customers Apple does not want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/07/be-safe-android-users-actually-i-dont-give-a-shit/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Be safe Android users; Actually, I don’t give a shit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android accounts for 79 percent of the security threats for mobile platforms. iOS barely registers in the results, despite the fact there are hundreds of millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.gogoair.com/?p=193" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Infographic: Staying Connected in Air | Gogo Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple devices are still reigning above the clouds, following the tablet trend with the iPad being the device of choice. Among all mobile devices being used to connect through Gogo, 84 percent carry Apple’s iOS operating system while 16 percent carry the Android operating system. If you look only at the smartphones our customers are using, the iPhone makes up 73 percent and all Android devices make up 26 percent, with Blackberry and Windows based devices each making up less than 1 percent of devices being used in air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-maps-improvements-2013-3" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Maps Improvements - Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dalrymple is one of the most pro-Apple bloggers in the world. He's constantly attacking Apple rival Samsung (see here) and disparaging anyone that speaks ill of Apple (see here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/12/apples-maps-being-updated-often-and-significantly/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Maps being updated often and significantly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updates have been quite significant for the areas involved. For instance, the update in Japan brought toll road notifications and improved pronunciation of roads during turn-by-turn navigation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4099450/andy-rubin-steps-down-as-head-of-android" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Andy Rubin steps down as head of Android at Google, will be succeeded by Chrome OS boss | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has just announced that Andy Rubin is stepping down as head of Android — he'll be replaced by Sundar Pichai who is currently the senior VP of Chrome and Apps. Pichai will keep his current duties, as well. CEO Larry Page announced the change on Google's blog today, and also took a moment to tout the domination of Android in the mobile marketplace — more than 750 million Android devices have been activated globally, and 25 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play. Judging from the blog post, it sounds like Rubin stepped down of his own accord and will remain at Google in an as-yet unspecified role. Page hailed Rubin's work, and asked him for "more moonshots, please!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigbends.com/nutsauce/agora.cgi?cart_id=4676777.11678&amp;amp;product=Nut%20Sauce&amp;amp;xm=on" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Product Listing Nut Sauce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie are joined by Moisés Chiullan to discuss France scolding Apple for forcing employees to work late, Google chairman Eric Schmidt gets $6 million cash bonus, a denial-of-service attack on JP Morgan Chase sites, Amazon's estimated 10 million Prime subscribers, New York judge not letting mayor Bloomberg from passing his soda ban, the introduction of Netflix Social, and no new Pope has been chosen thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4098052/french-judge-bans-apple-store-employees-from-working-nights" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Stores in France banned from forcing employees to work late | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Paris court this week banned seven French Apple Stores from forcing employees to work night shifts, in response to a complaint filed by a group of national labor unions. Apple was also ordered to pay €10,000 in damages to the unions who filed the suit, and will further cost Apple €50,000 for every subsequent infraction. A higher court in France is expected to hand down another decision on this case on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887324735304578356792314806034-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwMjExNDIyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Gets $6 Million Cash Bonus - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is giving Executive Chairman, Eric Schmidt a $6 million cash bonus for 2012. In early 2011, Mr. Schmidt was awarded $100 million of equity as he stepped down as chief executive of Google. Last month, Google disclosed that Mr. Schmidt would be selling some $2.5 billion in company stock during the coming year as part of a trading plan, as he reduces his stake by more than 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Google execs are receiving bonuses like CFO Patrick Pichette and chief business officer, Nikesh Arora, are both receiving a $2.8 million bonus, and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond is receiving a $3.3 million bonus. All of the awards are being given in recognition of the executives' contributions to Google's performance last year, reporting that it reached $50 billion in revenue in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.cnet.com/news/denial-of-service-attack-takes-down-jp-morgan-chase-sites/57573955" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Denial-of-service attack takes down JP Morgan Chase sites - CNET Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative confirmed that the web sites for banking giant JP Morgan Chase are offline this afternoon as the result of a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Visitors to the site were greeted by this message:  "Our website is temporarily down, but our branches and Mobile Apps are available. Please try again later." They do not know how long the site had been down or how long it would be until service was resumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers have ratcheted up their assaults on financial institutions in recent months, using DDoS attacks to take down Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, and others. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve was not immune to hackers, suffering a security breach last month of one of its internal Web sites. Though initially it was unclear who was behind the cyber attacks, government officials and security researchers said in January that Iran was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-10-million-members-morningstar-2013-3?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Has An Estimated 10 Million Members For Its Surprisingly Profitable Prime Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon hasn't actually disclosed how many people have signed up for its Prime program, which offers free two-day shipping, a Netflix-like video service, and other perks for a $79 annual fee, but Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy has come out with a report that pegs membership at more than 10 million, suggesting the program contributes about a third of Amazon's operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is he getting all of this? Well, he focused on a survey of Amazon shoppers conducted by market-research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in November 2012. In 2012, they were about 4 percent of Amazon's 182 million active customer base. But they accounted for nearly 10 percent of purchases. Why? Because they spend more than twice as much as non-prime customers—$1,224 a year versus $505.  Hottovy found that Amazon made about $78 per Prime member in 2012. By his calculations, that could grow to 25 million by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/judge-drinks-kool-aid-article-1.1285652" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Judge overreaches in barring Mayor Bloomberg from banning large sugary sodas - NY Daily News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers can keep on slurping big, sugar-filled sodas now that judge put the brakes on Mayor Bloomberg's latest public health initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling concluded that the prohibition against selling sugared beverages in containers larger than 16 ounces was both arbitrary and beyond the authority of the Board of Health, which approved the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say his fundamental error was to consider the regulation from the point of view of vendors who were hoping to get out from under it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn or a printed resume gives a simple, bloodless recitation of names, dates, and places. But when you walk into an office you get a rich, three-dimensional sense of someone as a person and professional: where they've been and where they're headed. Pathbrite, a one-year-old startup, aims to re-create that feeling of being in someone's office. It's a simple and intuitive site for creating portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathbrite integrates all kinds of media, from diplomas and Khan Academy badges to official ACT test scores to video, audio, and photos, with written commentary. It's shareable and updatable from anywhere. None of this is particularly groundbreaking in the world of web apps, but it is in the world of education apps--and that was the big problem, says founder Heather Hiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Netflix members in the U.S. can share their favorite shows and movies on Netflix with friends by connecting to Facebook and agreeing to share. By default, sharing will only happen on Netflix. You'll see what titles your friends have watched in a new “Watched by your friends” row and what they have rated four or five stars in a new “Friends’ Favorites” row. Your friends will also be able to see what you watch and rate highly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PowerFlask lets you simultaneously charge three mobile devices at once, making it the perfect choice for families and individuals with multiple mobile devices. In addition to its powerhouse lithium-ion rechargeable battery, the PowerFlask comes with 2 30-pin iPad/iPhone connectors, a USB-to-Micro-USB charging cable, a USB-to-Dual-Micro-USB-charging cable, a USB power adaptor, and includes two built-in ultra-bright flashlight LEDs that are great for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black smoke poured from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Tuesday, signaling that the 115 cardinals had failed on their first vote of the papal conclave to choose a new leader for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics and their troubled church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cardinals returned to the Vatican hotel for the night and resume voting today, Wednesday morning. Once a new pope is selected, the smoke turns white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/BleedingCool/~3/xzHBV1vdYTY/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Doctor Who’s Executive Producer Steps Down With Immediate Effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline Skinner has stepped down as executive producer of Doctor Who with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had heard that Skinner and Steven Moffat enjoyed a very public row at the BBC showcase event last month, and this decision appears to be at least tied into this, if not rooted in it. There have been several reasons for the argument mooted, but as yet I have not been able to verify any of them – so I’m not believing any of them. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi3 is in a tough spot. It has a not-so-secret deal with Valve. But Valve isn’t saying what that deal is, and everybody is assuming that Xi3 is making the fabled “Steam Box” for Valve, a console that will run Linux and play downloadable Steam games in the living room.

&lt;p&gt;What have we heard about Apple ad nauseam for the past year? It’s not just that Apple is doomed.We hear that Apple needs to build an entry-level, less expensive iPhone or risk being left behind as Android dominates the smartphone world. Or, something like that. Such analysis overlooks Apple’s typical customer, and, importantly the customers Apple does not want.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here's to the next 100! Dan and Haddie are joined by Ansa Copeland to discuss the events of yesterday's SXSW experience and the news of the day including: Linkedin's acquisition of Pulse, Google Glass apps, a coagulant gel, and Sprint's Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/11/pinterest-launches-new-data-analytic-tool-for-businesses-as-it-prepares-to-monetize/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pinterest Launches New Data Analytic Tool For Businesses As It Prepares To Monetize | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinterest has started rolling out new tools that will allow businesses to see how many visitors the content-sharing service is referring to their Web sites, with the first tool available for free today, reports Reuters.These new features make good on Pinterest’s promise to businesses late last year that it will introduce data analytic tools for companies to track Pinterest traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has issued a new call for international “rules and cooperation” on Internet espionage issues, while insisting that accusations of Chinese government involvement in recent hacking attacks were part of an international smear campaign.Connect With Us on TwitterFollow @nytimesworld for international breaking news and headlines.Twitter List: Reporters and EditorsThe remarks, by Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi, were China’s highest-level response yet to intensifying reports that the Chinese military may be engaging in cyberespionage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was once a time when the goings on of Silicon Valley, and the technology industry in general, didn’t interest anyone aside from a relative handful of engineers and scientists. For decades the valley quietly plodded along, creating chips and rockets unbothered by the gawking masses—or even MBAs. Those quiet years are now gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed “Underground Library” project would let subway passengers peruse virtual stacks on the walls of the metro car. Using near-field communication (NFC) technology found in smartphones, commuters could scan book titles that appear on advertisements inside the car. The first ten pages of the book would be be free of charge, then a map would pop up to direct users to the nearest library branch so they could finish what they started and check out the book.&lt;/p&gt;

Landolina created Veti-Gel, a substance that closes up wounds to major arteries or organs to immediately stop bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>TOPIC: Stupidity.

This week, Dan and Merlin tackle stupidity. And, brother, there sure are a whole lot of flavors of stupid.

Are we really talking about being clueless, unaware, dumb, absent-minded, or just plain-old ignorant? Because they're actually pretty different animals.

Whether you're dropping your library book in the mailbox, leaving your iPad at home, following baseless medical advice, or doing whatever Dan did with his garage door (don't worry: the car is fine), it's really helpful to understand where your real problem really lives.

From a tactical standpoint, try some useful failsafes, rituals, and habits. But, at a higher level, learn to develop the curiosity to keep evolving. Stay open to how you might be wrong by always seeking out the smartest person you can find who disagrees with you.

&lt;p&gt;In the novice stage, a person follows rules as given, without context, with no sense of responsibility beyond following the rules exactly. Competence develops when the individual develops organizing principles to quickly access the particular rules that are relevant to the specific task at hand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than average. This bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SE Dreyfus, HL Dreyfus - 1980&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract : In acquiring a skill by means of instruction and experience, the student normally passes through five developmental stages which we designate novice, competence, proficiency, expertise and mastery. We argue, based on analysis of careful descriptions of skill acquisition, that as the student becomes skilled, he depends less on abstract principles and more on concrete experience. We systematize and illustrate the progressive changes in a performer's ways of seeing his task environment. We conclude that any skill- training procedure must be based on some model of skill acquisition, so that it can address, at each stage of training, the appropriate issues involved in facilitating advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A classic Marvel hero defined by one of comics' greatest visionaries! A Marvel Comics mainstay since 1964, Daredevil got a new lease on life in a landmark 1979-1983 run by writer-penciler Frank Miller and inker-penciler Klaus Janson, whose daring reinvention of the character quickly made Miller one of the biggest and most influential stars in the comic-book industry. Miller put his own stamp on established cast members such as reporter Ben Urich, femme fatale Black Widow, mad assassin Bullseye, the saw-fisted Gladiator, and monstrous crime boss Kingpin. Miller also introduced Daredevil's mysterious mentor Stick, deadly ninja foes the Hand, and Matt's long-lost love Elektra, a beautiful assassin who would become one of Marvel's most memorable characters. Mixing traditional super-heroics with mysterious martial artistry, doomed romance, and dark personal drama, Miller's character-defining DD run is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! Collecting Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785168060/5by5-20" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Daredevil by Mark Waid, Vol. 1: Mark Waid, Paolo Rivera, Marcos Martin, Emma Rios, Kano Kano, Khoi Pham: 9780785168065: Amazon.com: Books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fresh start for the Man Without Fear! Matt Murdock is back in New York and hoping to resuscitate his law practice, but not everyone is happy to see him. And Daredevil hits the streets as Klaw, master of sound, makes his deadly return! Then, a blind client holds the key to a global conspiracy perpetrated by some familiar foes. Can Daredevil protect him long enough to bring down an international criminal organization? And when a piece of cutting-edge technology goes missing, Daredevil and Punisher team up to track it down and clear the Black Cat of the crime. But is Black Cat really innocent?! And after someone exhumes Battlin' Jack Murdock's grave, DD heads underground to find the villain responsible. Mark Waid's fantastic rejuvenation of Daredevil begins here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a character-defining run, Brian Michael Bendis crafted a pulp-fiction narrative that exploited the Man Without Fear's rich tapestry of characters and psychodrama, and resolved them in an incredibly nuanced, modern approach. Now, this Eisner Award-winning run is collected across three titanic trade paperbacks! In this volume, witness the Kingpin's downfall at the hands of Sammy Silke and see how a down-on-his-luck FBI agent can change Matt's life forever. Collects Daredevil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some The Big Lebowski is just a movie, to others it's THE MOVIE. Over the past several years the movie has developed a massive and passionate cult following, led by the creation of Lebowski Fest, a traveling festival celebrating all things Lebowski. Held in a bowling alley, it features bowling, costume and trivia contests, live music, a screening of the movie, White Russians, and what-have-you. Attendance has grown exponentially and the Fest has been featured in virtually every national media outlet, from NPR to the New York Times. The Associated Press called it "kind of a 'Star Trek' convention, but without all the geeks." SPIN Magazine called it one of the "19 events you can't miss!" Now, at last, comes the book that the legion of Lebowski fans (aka Achievers) has been waiting for. I'm a Lebowski, You're a Lebowski is a treasure trove of trivia and commentary, hilarious throughout and illustrated with photos from the film, including dozens taken on the set by Jeff Bridges. It includes interviews with virtually every major and minor cast member including John Goodman, Julianne Moore and John Turturro, as well as the real-life individuals who served as inspiration for the characters such as Jeff Dowd and John Milius. Fellow Achievers Patton Oswalt, Tony Hawk and Powerpuff Girls creator Craig McCracken give their thoughts on the movie and the phenomenon that surrounds it. The book features a handy guide to speaking Achiever, tips on how to Dude-ify your car, office, and living space, Lebowski Fest highlights and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Hill" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Hill - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria Hill is a fictional character appearing in books published by Marvel Comics. As the former director of the planetary defense/intelligence service S.H.I.E.L.D., she appears in various storylines in which that organization figures prominently, which often feature the Avengers or members of that group, such as the late 2000s Civil War and Secret Invasion miniseries, and the monthly Iron Man series, in which she was a prominent supporting character during the "Dark Reign" and "Stark Disassembled" storylines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his mainstream incarnation, Hulk has also been depicted in other fictional universes, in which Bruce Banner's transformation, behavior, or circumstances vary from the mainstream setting. In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benday" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Ben-Day dots - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the effect, color and optical illusion needed, small colored dots are closely spaced, widely spaced or overlapping. Magenta dots, for example, are widely spaced to create pink. Pulp comic books of the 1950s and 1960s used Ben-Day dots in the four process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) to inexpensively create shading and secondary colors such as green, purple, orange and flesh tones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>TOPIC: Stupidity.

This week, Dan and Merlin tackle stupidity. And, brother, there sure are a whole lot of flavors of stupid.

Are we really talking about being clueless, unaware, dumb, absent-minded, or just plain-old ignorant? Because they're actually pretty different animals.

Whether you're dropping your library book in the mailbox, leaving your iPad at home, following baseless medical advice, or doing whatever Dan did with his garage door (don't worry: the car is fine), it's really helpful to understand where your real problem really lives.

From a tactical standpoint, try some useful failsafes, rituals, and habits. But, at a higher level, learn to develop the curiosity to keep evolving. Stay open to how you might be wrong by always seeking out the smartest person you can find who disagrees with you.
