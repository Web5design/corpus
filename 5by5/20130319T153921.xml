      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Mailbox being bought by Dropbox, North Korea blames US and allies for cyber attacks, and where to watch the Angry Birds Toons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-mailbox-an-app-with-some-buzz/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dropbox Buys Mailbox, an App With Some Buzz - Digits - WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is buying the owner of the buzzy Mailbox mobile app, making its first move into products outside its core file-sharing service.Under the deal, the 13 employees of Mailbox owner Orchestra Inc.–including alums of Apple, Stanford University and Ideo–will join Dropbox. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/15/apples-budget-iphone-expected-to-have-same-4-inch-display-as-iphone-5" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;budget&amp;#x27; iPhone expected to have same 4-inch display as iPhone 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details on Apple's so-called "budget" iPhone were revealed on Friday to AppleInsider by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who has a reliable track record in predicting Apple's future product plans. According to Kuo, the specs for Apple's low-cost iPhone were decided in 2011, and the company is "unlikely to abruptly change" due to a market shift toward larger screens in the 5-inch range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2416620,00.asp" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung: Galaxy S4&amp;#x27;s Improvements Will Come to Galaxy S3 | News &amp;amp; Opinion | PCMag.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCMag spoke with Nick DiCarlo, Samsung's vice president of portfolio planning, at last night's event, and he said that many of the software improvements in the Samsung Galaxy S4 could make their way into existing Samsung Galaxy S3 phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/google-kills-rss/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Not Just Reader – Google Kills Its RSS Subscription Browser Extension, Too | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh Google. Thought we wouldn’t notice that you’re trying to kill off not just Google Reader, but also your support and endorsement for the RSS format itself? People have just started noticing that Google’s own RSS Subscription Chrome browser extension has disappeared from the Google Chrome Web Store. Though it’s unclear at this time exactly when the extension was removed, the change appears to be recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techinasia.com/north-korea-accuses-america-cyberattacks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;North Korean News Agency Accuses US and Allies of Cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s official news agency KCNA has accused the US and its allies of conducting cyberattacks. Described as “intensive and persistent virus attacks”, it’s otherwise not clear what information the alleged hackers were after or if any data was stolen. The implication is that the US or South Korean governments are trying to access North Korean servers in an act of espionage or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2013/03/15/glassdoor-employees-rank-facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-as-ceo-of-the-year-apples-tim-cook-loses-top-spot/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Glassdoor: Employees rank Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of the year; Apple’s Tim Cook loses top spot - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career website Glassdoor on Friday released its latest report highlighting this year’s top 50 highest-rated Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), and it seems like the tech world played a big role in the list. In fact, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unseated Apple CEO Tim Cook from the number one spot he grabbed last year.Glassdoor compiled its figures based on more than half a million company reviews submitted by employees between February 25, 2012 and February 24, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawdingo, a startup that connects users with lawyers for online consultations (sometimes instantly), is announcing that it’s part of the current class of startups at Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/facebook-fills-its-vacant-cto-role-by-promoting-its-vp-of-engineering-mike-schroepfer/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Fills CTO Role By Promoting Its VP Of Engineering, Mike Schroepfer | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has just made an internal announcement to Facebook naming its veteran VP of Engineering Mike Schroepfer as CTO, we’ve just learned from an industry source. Facebook has since confirmed to TechCrunch that Schroepfer will take the postion previously held by Bret Taylor, who left last year. Schroepfer has been at Facebook for nearly five years and led most of its latest mobile efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/03/stop-blaming-the-trolls-or-we-wont-be-able-to-fix-the-patent-system/?cid=co6424344" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Why We Can&amp;#x27;t Afford to Blame the Trolls for the Patent Problem | Wired Opinion | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent system is flawed, some would say broken. And patent trolls — less pejoratively known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) — are to blame, no matter how good a case they might make for their role in the patent ecosystem. Or are they? Trolls are an easy target because they don’t make anything, choosing instead to enforce patents against those who do.But curing the patent problem requires general solutions … not ones targeted just at patent trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/03/nsl-found-unconstitutional/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Judge Finds National Security Letters Unconstitutional, Bans Them | Threat Level | Wired.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-secret national security letters that come with a gag order on the recipient are an unconstitutional impingement on free speech, a federal judge in California ruled in a decision released Friday.U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered the government to stop issuing so-called NSLs across the board, in a stunning defeat for the Obama administration’s surveillance practices. She also ordered the government to cease enforcing the gag provision in any other cases. However, she stayed her order for 90 days to give the government a chance to appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/15/angry-birds-toons-premiering-this-weekend-in-angry-birds-apps/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Angry Birds Toons premiering this weekend in Angry Birds apps | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovio has long been threatening to bring Angry Birds into other media, and this weekend they're finally doing it -- kind of. Angry Birds Toons is a brand new cartoon series featuring none other than the frustrated fowl that iOS gamers have known and loved for so long. But you won't find it on a TV station or in a movie theater: Instead, the cartoon is premiering inside the Angry Birds apps, so if you have any of them installed, you can jump in and you'll be able to watch the series starting this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/15/apple-sued-over-defective-macbook-pro-retina-displays/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple sued over defective MacBook Pro Retina displays | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit has been filed in federal court in California alleging that Apple is misleading consumers by not advertising that there are two different types of displays used in its MacBook Pros with Retina displays. The issue stems from widespread reports that MacBook Pros with Retina displays that use display panels from LG suffer from ghosting issues. MacBook Pros that use Retina displays from Samsung reportedly are not affected by the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/15/google-reader-partially-rebuilt-in-zite/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader partially rebuilt in Zite | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are mourning the impending loss of Google Reader, which will be cease to function on July 1. The folks at Zite have a kinda, sorta replacement that can be used from within the free Zite personalized news app.Zite has always been a bit of a hybrid, allowing you to access your Google Reader feeds manually, while providing the extra Zite-selected news, based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/first-tablet-for-women/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The &amp;#x27;First Tablet for Women&amp;#x27; Is as Awful as It Sounds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/reservations/?p=1#to-grow-even-faster-mailbox-is-joining-dropbox" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox - Put Email In Its Place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we’ve decided to join forces with Dropbox and build it out together. To be clear, Mailbox is not going away. The product needs to grow fast, and we believe that joining Dropbox is the best way to make that happen. Plus, imagine what cool things you could do if your Mailbox was connected to your Dropbox…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/mailbox-cost-dropbox-around-100-million/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox Cost Dropbox Around $100 Million | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been hearing that Mailbox was raising money, piquing the interest of Andreessen Horowitz among others, which is why today’s news that the company sold to the harmoniously named Dropbox didn’t come as a surprise. Sometimes an acquisition is the easiest way to raise resources for growth — especially when you’re tackling as expensive a problem as email. And have a six-figure wait list.And we’re hearing that this particular acquisition was not cheap — The post-pivot startup cost the storage company “well over” $50 million, according to multiple sources. And we’ve heard that that the price was around $100 million in cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/16/uber-black-towncar-drivers-strike-in-san-francisco-over-compensation-terms-and-treatment/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Uber black towncar drivers strike in San Francisco over compensation terms and treatment - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Uber drivers of their ‘Black Car’ service are striking this afternoon in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. Those drivers participating have parked in front of Uber’s headquarters. They intend on striking – not providing rides to Uber users – during the rush hour period, and perhaps the weekend.The drivers that TNW spoke to stated that they are being treated unfairly, specifically citing a lack of communication and input in the Uber decision making process, and the fact that Uber does not provide a commercial insurance policy, leaving drivers legally culpable in the case of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Road Films is pushing back the release of Jobs, which was scheduled to hit theaters April 19, the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Apple Computer. A new date has yet to be determined (the film previously was titled jOBS).Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that Open Road wanted more time to market the film, which was fully financed and produced by Mark Hulme's Five Star Feature Films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/formspring-the-pioneering-anonymous-qa-platform-is-shutting-down/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Formspring, The Pioneering ‘Ask Me Anything’ Anonymous Q&amp;amp;A Platform, Is Shutting Down | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formspring, a startup that helped pioneer the “ask me anything” format of anonymous Q&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York State first began issuing paper licenses to chauffeurs in 1910, and the shape, form and style have changed over the past century, adapting to new laws and technologies. The following is a sampling of how the license has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of Samsung’s Galaxy S4 launch, Apple and its marketing chief Phil Schiller spoke with mainstream news publications to slam Android and iPhone competitors. Now, following the launch of the new Samsung device, Apple has opened up an entire new web page to tout why people have loved the iPhone for so many years and to seemingly throw some negative claims against Android and Samsung devices.Apple has also begun emailing a version of this webpage to its own customers, something that makes this seem more defensive than offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is working on incorporating the hashtag, one of Twitter's most iconic markers, into its service by using the symbol as a way to group conversations, said people familiar with the matter. It is unclear how far along Facebook's work on the hashtag is and the feature isn't likely to be introduced imminently, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has begun offering iMacs with an optional VESA mount adapter. The new BTO option was first noticed by Macworld UK. Users who buy an iMac on Apple's online store can order the iMac with the VESA mount adapter instead of the standard foot stand for an additional US$40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions are important when you are selling an app. According to a new study by Compuware that was reported by TechCrunch, you only have one chance, maybe two, to get a customer to become a regular user of your app. If glitches force a customer to try your app a third or fourth time, you risk losing 84 percent of your user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102720/outlook-outage-overheating-datacenter" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft blames overheating datacenter for 16-hour Outlook outage | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's outlook.com webmail service suffered 16-hour long issues yesterday after a firmware upgrade at the company's datacenter went wrong. In a blog post detailing the outage, Microsoft reveals some customers couldn't access parts of SkyDrive, Hotmail, and Outlook. Although Microsoft has updated its datacenter firmware successfully previously, the regular process "resulted in a rapid and substantial temperature spike in the datacenter" due to an unspecified reason. The overheating was significant enough to activate Microsoft's safeguard process for a number of servers in the datacenter, preventing access to certain mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new job search platform has played host to around $225 million in job offers. And with today’s news, the company is seeing some inbound cash as well: $2.7 million in a first round of institutional funding led by NEA and Sierra Ventures with participation from Google Ventures, Crosslink Capital, and Jeff Clavier’sSoftTech VC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuter’s Deputy Editor of Social Media, Matthew Keys, has been indicted for allegedly conspiring with hacktivist group, “Anonymous.” According to the Department of Justice, “Keys provided members of the hacker group Anonymous with log-in credentials for a computer server belonging to KTXL FOX 40’s corporate parent, the Tribune Company.”The indictment includes allegations of aiding hackers in defacing the Los Angeles Times websites. “That was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,” wrote a co-conspirator to Keys in a conversation intercepted by the Justice Department [PDF].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t get enough of the folksy musings of “America’s Happy Warrior,” the White House has launched the Being Joe Biden Portal. “If you want to keep people away during an earthquake, buy some shotgun shells,” said Vice President Biden, in response to a question about assault weapons bans during a Google  hangout last January. If Biden’s first broadcast is any indication, the audio series will surely bring weekly smiles from the Veep’s lovable down-home charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has released OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.3 and the first security update of 2013. The update includes a number of good improvements including:The ability to redeem iTunes gift cards in the Mac App Store using the built-in camera on a MacBoot Camp support for installing Windows 8 and Macs with a 3 TB hard drive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader being shut down by its malevolent overlords leaves a gaping, Google Reader-sized hole in the market where it used to be. Many are stepping up today to announce that their products or services can act as a replacement, but one source is specifically saying it will build a functionally complete replacement – news aggregation service Digg.Digg just announced on its official blog that it was previously planning on building a reader in the second half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit present a case study in which "dystexia" was the only symptom of a stroke. The patient had no trouble speaking, only texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc's mapping and commerce chief is stepping down in the latest senior management reshuffle after Android architect Andy Rubin moved on to a still-undefined role at the company on Wednesday.Google will split its Maps/Geo and Commerce group into two separate units. Senior Vice President Jeff Huber, who has led the group since 2011, is moving to Google X, the company's experimental projects group known for developing self-driving cars and the Google Glass wearable computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love spending time soaking up the sun, a new Kickstarter project can protect you from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays.UVeBand, a slap bracelet, monitors your exposure to the sun and vibrates when you need to apply more sunscreen. The device works after you've applied your first layer of lotion or spray and automatically turns on after making contact with your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-just-happened/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Launches The Galaxy S 4 With A Baffling, Overproduced Broadway-Style Show | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, illustrating different features of your new phone with real-world scenarios isn’t a terrible idea. And if you must hold your event in the Radio City, why not get theatrical? But what’s impressive here is how the skits are both terribly written and unconvincing (like, maybe intentionally so, because that makes it better?), and yet Samsung is really committing to them — actors get played on and off with cheesy music, and there have been multiple dance numbers. This was how Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 yesterday and their methods were laughably received by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kiln - Version Control and Code Review Software from Fog Creek Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-galaxy-s-iv-36261" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Marketing LandSamsung Launches The Galaxy S4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung formally unveiled the latest in its Galaxy S line-up of smartphones, the Galaxy S4 (or officially, the Galaxy S 4). The phone features a 5? screen without getting larger than the Galaxy S3 plus an array of features that seemingly put Samsung’s own brand ahead of Google and Android. Samsung said the phone will be available worldwide some time in April, supporting both 3G and 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-introduces-galaxy-s-iv-phone-with-nary-a-mention-of-android-or-google-2-36316" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Introduces Galaxy S4 With Nary A Mention Of Android Or Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung unveiled its heavily anticipated Galaxy S4 handset. The event had the hype and production values of an Apple product launch. But, what barely seemed in attendance was any idea that the S4 is an Android phone or contains Google services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the product launch was devoted to showcasing software rather than hardware features. Samsung is positioning the phone as a “life companion.” Perhaps most interesting, Google was never mentioned and Android drew one lesser mention in the context of the phone’s “Knox” enterprise security system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Google Reader shutting down, the new Pope, the new President of China, Samsung Galaxy S 4, and Pi Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/03/13/google-reader-shutdown/1986337/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader shutting down in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is shutting down its popular RSS Reader as part of a broader "spring cleaning" to concentrate on a smaller selection of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader will shut down July 1, so users have enough time to transition to a new option. Launched in 2005, the RSS Reader allowed users to pull content feeds from a variety of websites into one personal hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other services getting shuttered: Google Building Maker, Google Cloud Connect and the voice app for BlackBerry devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader to shut down July 1st | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, which originally launched back in 2005, will be officially put out to pasture on July 1st, 2013. Reader has gone through a number of iterations, but it had not been significantly updated in a long time. The last time that Google updated the product, it built in integration for the Google+ social network and removed Reader's own native sharing service, causing a bit of a backlash with die hard users. Google is offering users a way to export their Reader content, including lists of users that they follow and starred and liked articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google says it is killing it off because "usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products." As one of the most popular RSS aggregators around, the death of Google Reader could spell doom for the RSS protocol itself, which has seen waning popularity since the rise of social sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2013/03/14/as-google-reader-is-killed-off-flipboard-feedly-reeder-and-others-offer-rss-alternatives/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;As Google Reader is killed off, Flipboard, Feedly and others step up with RSS alternatives - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google axing Google Reader, this leaves the door open for others to step up with RSS alternatives. Feedly — a browser plug-in that turns feed into magazine-like layouts — has detailed its project to clone to Google Reader API, popular social aggregator Flipboard says its “got your RSS feeds covered”, open-source Newsblur is adding more servers to cope with Reader imports, while Reeder — another Google dependent – “won’t die with Google Reader”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a petition to ‘Keep Google Reader’ (there’s hope Google will open-source it) has gained more than 2,000 digital signatures. Given also that Feedly.com and Newsblur.com are down — presumably through the sheer volume of traffic — and that numerous blog posts have sprouted up on the subject, Reader’s exit will leave a void for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepartycow/status/311959283883466752" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter-Brian Walsh @thepartycow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21766622" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Xi Jinping named president of China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Beijing have confirmed Xi Jinping as president, completing China's 10-yearly transition of power. Mr Xi, appointed to the Communist Party's top post in November, replaces Hu Jintao, who is stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Xi assumes the leadership of a nation that is growing wealthier but more vocal in its anger at issues such as rising inequality, environmental damage and food safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also faces concern among regional neighbours over how China will wield its rising power, particularly in relations to thorny issues such as territorial disputes with Japan and Asean nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21781125?" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Francis begins his challenging papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis had been greeted by crowds roaring their approval when he appeared at the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square on Wednesday evening, about an hour after white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel to announce to the world that a new pontiff had been elected. Today, Pope Francis has begun his first day at the helm of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It seems that my brother cardinals have gone to the ends of the earth [to find a pope]," Francis said wryly, referring to his native Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old from Buenos Aires is the first Pope to take the name of Francis - reminiscent of Francis of Assisi, the 13th Century Italian reformer and patron saint of animals, who lived in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President Barack Obama sent "warm wishes" on behalf of the American people to the newly elected pontiff, hailing the Argentine as "the first Pope from the Americas".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102924/galaxy-s4-video-leak" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Leaked videos show Galaxy S 4 SmartPause, eye tracking, and new lock screen | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Samsung Unpacked event has even begun, the leaks have already started. The latest round of leaks, now helpfully arriving in video form, details two highlight features: SmartPause eye tracking and floating touch control. SmartPause does exactly the same thing LG announced yesterday — pausing and resuming video on the handset in accordance with whether you're looking at it or not. The floating touch appears to be an implementation of Samsung's Air View S Pen functionality, made to work without the stylus. Its purpose is to open up previews of things (such as a thumbnail on a video timeline) without requiring you to tap the display, you just hover your finger over the desired item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get a peek at the Galaxy S 4's browser performance, which looks satisfyingly quick and responsive, as well as its newly redesigned lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/4064006/samsung-galaxy-s-4-rumors" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S 4: Samsung prepares to unveil its latest flagship smartphone | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Samsung Unpacked launch event draws closer, more and more details are leaking out about the Galaxy S 4. If the leaks are accurate, the Galaxy S 4 will have a 1080p 5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, and an overclocked version of the PowerVR GPU found in the iPhone 5. It'll also have a host of new software features, as detailed by a series of videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Bradbury: The End of FeedDemon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Bradbury wrote and published a post yesterday on his site revealing that it is the end of FeedDemon saying "I've thoroughly enjoyed working on it and I'm grateful for all of the people who paid for it over the years despite free alternatives. But it's time for FeedDemon to die."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly states that FeedDemon's conclusions goes hand-in-hand with the death of Google Reader. Bradbury continues saying, "Then today came the news that Google Reader is shutting down on July 1. FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization, and there's no decent alternative (and even if there were, it's doubtful I'd have time to integrate with it, at least not without trading time away from my family - which I won't do). That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/the-google-reader-shutdown-is-yet-another-nail-in-feedburners-coffin/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Google Reader Shutdown Is Yet Another Nail In Feedburner&amp;#x27;s Coffin - TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Google Reader is out of the picture how much longer until we hear that FeedBurner will meet the same fate? The last RSS-focused product Google closed was AdSense for Feeds, its ad product for site owners who wanted to monetize their RSS feeds. With Reader and AdSense for Feeds gone, the last RSS product standing at Google is Feedburner – and all signs point to that getting the ax sooner or later, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Google Reader, it’s been a very long time since Feedburner got any updates and everything points at a total neglect of the product at Google: Its stats are sporadically unavailable, it never even got the visual refresh that virtually every other Google product got, the Feedburner blog (now called AdSense for Feeds – after the already closed product…) has been updated three times since April 2010. The FeedBurner Status Blog hasn’t been updated since last September. Things are not looking hopeful for FeedBurner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/twitter-line-breaks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter Now Supports Line Breaks in Tweets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter added support for line breaks Wednesday, a new feature that lets you spread your 140 character message over several different lines. Line breaks currently aren't supported on most third-party Twitter clients, nor are they supported in embedded tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just want to know if line breaks are supported in the bio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4103262/cbs-launches-ios-tv-streaming-app" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;CBS launches iOS streaming TV app with one-week delay for new episodes | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBS has been considering some interesting mobile and web options of its own.  "CBS Interactive," launched today for iPhone and iPad, it lets users stream full episodes of some shows, including CSI, How I Met Your Mother, and The Late Show with David Letterman. Like other networks, CBS already offers streaming on the web with roughly one-day delays across the board, but the app is a move towards more versatility and viewing outside the living room. New episodes of daytime and late-night shows will be added within 24 hours, and prime-time shows will arrive on the eighth day after broadcast. CBS is also touting extra "second screen" features for some shows. Warner Brothers launched a similar app with one-day delays last year, but only for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelrusch/a-photo-that-defines-a-generation" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;A Photo That Defines A Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors take photos with their phones and tablets of Pope Francis as he speaks from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2013/03/14/pi-day-6-healthy-pie-recipes" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pi Day: 6 (Healthy) Pie Recipes - US News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day! Pi, as we're sure you all know, is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, which is 3.14 in decimal form. It's actually more like 3.1415926, and can be calculated to many, many more digits because it's an irrational number. But we'll stick with 3.14 because it corresponds with March 14, which brings us back to Pi Day. Go make a Pie for Pi Day, some great recipes are linked here. (Not GF).&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jim and Dan talk about truth in reporting, trusting the news and news agencies, android users in the air, twisting numbers, Rubin stepping down, "cheap" guitars, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-things-changed-for-apple-2013-3?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Only Thing That Has Really Changed At Apple Is That There&amp;#x27;s No More Reality Distortion Field&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, it's a company for old people, and it's at risk of being the next Motorola — a one time high flyer who defined the mobile phone, but crashed when people moved on to the next thing.
What happened to Apple that it's been so thoroughly tarnished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/12/guessing-the-wall-street-journal-agenda-for-apple/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Guessing the Wall Street Journal Agenda for Apple - The Hiltmon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have noted the past few months that the WSJ seems to issue regular negative news, no, opinions, no, rumors, no, rubbish on Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mac360.com/2013/03/when-it-comes-to-iphone-and-ipad-there-are-two-customer-groups-apple-doesnt-want-or-nee/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;When It Comes To iPhone And iPad There Are Two Customer Groups Apple Doesn’t Want Or Need | Mac360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have we heard about Apple ad nauseam for the past year? It’s not just that Apple is doomed.We hear that Apple needs to build an entry-level, less expensive iPhone or risk being left behind as Android dominates the smartphone world. Or, something like that. Such analysis overlooks Apple’s typical customer, and, importantly the customers Apple does not want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/07/be-safe-android-users-actually-i-dont-give-a-shit/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Be safe Android users; Actually, I don’t give a shit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Android accounts for 79 percent of the security threats for mobile platforms. iOS barely registers in the results, despite the fact there are hundreds of millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.gogoair.com/?p=193" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Infographic: Staying Connected in Air | Gogo Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple devices are still reigning above the clouds, following the tablet trend with the iPad being the device of choice. Among all mobile devices being used to connect through Gogo, 84 percent carry Apple’s iOS operating system while 16 percent carry the Android operating system. If you look only at the smartphones our customers are using, the iPhone makes up 73 percent and all Android devices make up 26 percent, with Blackberry and Windows based devices each making up less than 1 percent of devices being used in air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-maps-improvements-2013-3" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Maps Improvements - Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dalrymple is one of the most pro-Apple bloggers in the world. He's constantly attacking Apple rival Samsung (see here) and disparaging anyone that speaks ill of Apple (see here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/03/12/apples-maps-being-updated-often-and-significantly/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Maps being updated often and significantly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updates have been quite significant for the areas involved. For instance, the update in Japan brought toll road notifications and improved pronunciation of roads during turn-by-turn navigation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4099450/andy-rubin-steps-down-as-head-of-android" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Andy Rubin steps down as head of Android at Google, will be succeeded by Chrome OS boss | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has just announced that Andy Rubin is stepping down as head of Android — he'll be replaced by Sundar Pichai who is currently the senior VP of Chrome and Apps. Pichai will keep his current duties, as well. CEO Larry Page announced the change on Google's blog today, and also took a moment to tout the domination of Android in the mobile marketplace — more than 750 million Android devices have been activated globally, and 25 billion apps have been downloaded from Google Play. Judging from the blog post, it sounds like Rubin stepped down of his own accord and will remain at Google in an as-yet unspecified role. Page hailed Rubin's work, and asked him for "more moonshots, please!"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigbends.com/nutsauce/agora.cgi?cart_id=4676777.11678&amp;amp;product=Nut%20Sauce&amp;amp;xm=on" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Product Listing Nut Sauce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

Nut Sauce is a cutting-edge lubricant that is applied to the nut, bridge, string guides and pivot points of the bridge. It is clean and safe, will not run or drip, and is non-staining.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie are joined by Moisés Chiullan to discuss France scolding Apple for forcing employees to work late, Google chairman Eric Schmidt gets $6 million cash bonus, a denial-of-service attack on JP Morgan Chase sites, Amazon's estimated 10 million Prime subscribers, New York judge not letting mayor Bloomberg from passing his soda ban, the introduction of Netflix Social, and no new Pope has been chosen thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Paris court this week banned seven French Apple Stores from forcing employees to work night shifts, in response to a complaint filed by a group of national labor unions. Apple was also ordered to pay €10,000 in damages to the unions who filed the suit, and will further cost Apple €50,000 for every subsequent infraction. A higher court in France is expected to hand down another decision on this case on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887324735304578356792314806034-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwMjExNDIyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Chairman Eric Schmidt Gets $6 Million Cash Bonus - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is giving Executive Chairman, Eric Schmidt a $6 million cash bonus for 2012. In early 2011, Mr. Schmidt was awarded $100 million of equity as he stepped down as chief executive of Google. Last month, Google disclosed that Mr. Schmidt would be selling some $2.5 billion in company stock during the coming year as part of a trading plan, as he reduces his stake by more than 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other Google execs are receiving bonuses like CFO Patrick Pichette and chief business officer, Nikesh Arora, are both receiving a $2.8 million bonus, and Chief Legal Officer David Drummond is receiving a $3.3 million bonus. All of the awards are being given in recognition of the executives' contributions to Google's performance last year, reporting that it reached $50 billion in revenue in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.cnet.com/news/denial-of-service-attack-takes-down-jp-morgan-chase-sites/57573955" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Denial-of-service attack takes down JP Morgan Chase sites - CNET Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A representative confirmed that the web sites for banking giant JP Morgan Chase are offline this afternoon as the result of a distributed-denial-of-service attack. Visitors to the site were greeted by this message:  "Our website is temporarily down, but our branches and Mobile Apps are available. Please try again later." They do not know how long the site had been down or how long it would be until service was resumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers have ratcheted up their assaults on financial institutions in recent months, using DDoS attacks to take down Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, and others. Even the U.S. Federal Reserve was not immune to hackers, suffering a security breach last month of one of its internal Web sites. Though initially it was unclear who was behind the cyber attacks, government officials and security researchers said in January that Iran was responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-prime-10-million-members-morningstar-2013-3?op=1" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Has An Estimated 10 Million Members For Its Surprisingly Profitable Prime Club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon hasn't actually disclosed how many people have signed up for its Prime program, which offers free two-day shipping, a Netflix-like video service, and other perks for a $79 annual fee, but Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy has come out with a report that pegs membership at more than 10 million, suggesting the program contributes about a third of Amazon's operating income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where is he getting all of this? Well, he focused on a survey of Amazon shoppers conducted by market-research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in November 2012. In 2012, they were about 4 percent of Amazon's 182 million active customer base. But they accounted for nearly 10 percent of purchases. Why? Because they spend more than twice as much as non-prime customers—$1,224 a year versus $505.  Hottovy found that Amazon made about $78 per Prime member in 2012. By his calculations, that could grow to 25 million by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Yorkers can keep on slurping big, sugar-filled sodas now that judge put the brakes on Mayor Bloomberg's latest public health initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Milton Tingling concluded that the prohibition against selling sugared beverages in containers larger than 16 ounces was both arbitrary and beyond the authority of the Board of Health, which approved the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say his fundamental error was to consider the regulation from the point of view of vendors who were hoping to get out from under it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn or a printed resume gives a simple, bloodless recitation of names, dates, and places. But when you walk into an office you get a rich, three-dimensional sense of someone as a person and professional: where they've been and where they're headed. Pathbrite, a one-year-old startup, aims to re-create that feeling of being in someone's office. It's a simple and intuitive site for creating portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathbrite integrates all kinds of media, from diplomas and Khan Academy badges to official ACT test scores to video, audio, and photos, with written commentary. It's shareable and updatable from anywhere. None of this is particularly groundbreaking in the world of web apps, but it is in the world of education apps--and that was the big problem, says founder Heather Hiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.netflix.com/2013/03/introducing-netflix-social.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Official Netflix Blog : US &amp;amp; Canada: Introducing Netflix Social&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting today, Netflix members in the U.S. can share their favorite shows and movies on Netflix with friends by connecting to Facebook and agreeing to share. By default, sharing will only happen on Netflix. You'll see what titles your friends have watched in a new “Watched by your friends” row and what they have rated four or five stars in a new “Friends’ Favorites” row. Your friends will also be able to see what you watch and rate highly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PowerFlask lets you simultaneously charge three mobile devices at once, making it the perfect choice for families and individuals with multiple mobile devices. In addition to its powerhouse lithium-ion rechargeable battery, the PowerFlask comes with 2 30-pin iPad/iPhone connectors, a USB-to-Micro-USB charging cable, a USB-to-Dual-Micro-USB-charging cable, a USB power adaptor, and includes two built-in ultra-bright flashlight LEDs that are great for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black smoke poured from the Sistine Chapel chimney on Tuesday, signaling that the 115 cardinals had failed on their first vote of the papal conclave to choose a new leader for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics and their troubled church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cardinals returned to the Vatican hotel for the night and resume voting today, Wednesday morning. Once a new pope is selected, the smoke turns white.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline Skinner has stepped down as executive producer of Doctor Who with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had heard that Skinner and Steven Moffat enjoyed a very public row at the BBC showcase event last month, and this decision appears to be at least tied into this, if not rooted in it. There have been several reasons for the argument mooted, but as yet I have not been able to verify any of them – so I’m not believing any of them. Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xi3 is in a tough spot. It has a not-so-secret deal with Valve. But Valve isn’t saying what that deal is, and everybody is assuming that Xi3 is making the fabled “Steam Box” for Valve, a console that will run Linux and play downloadable Steam games in the living room.

&lt;p&gt;What have we heard about Apple ad nauseam for the past year? It’s not just that Apple is doomed.We hear that Apple needs to build an entry-level, less expensive iPhone or risk being left behind as Android dominates the smartphone world. Or, something like that. Such analysis overlooks Apple’s typical customer, and, importantly the customers Apple does not want.&lt;/p&gt;
