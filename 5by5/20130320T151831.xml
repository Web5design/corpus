      <description>TOPIC: Memory.

This week, Dan and Merlin try to tackle the complexities of memory.

Why do we remember things from childhood with unimpeachable detail, but then forget our own phone number or PIN code? How can the same person remember the name of everyone he's ever met, and then space a phone call a couple hours after it was scheduled? Why do we remember and why do we forget?

Unsurprisingly, few concrete answers appear, but there's plenty of lively conversation on savant syndrome, tactical memory aides, and the precise location of Merlin's pills.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;: Memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Dan and Merlin try to tackle the complexities of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we remember things from childhood with unimpeachable detail, but then forget our own phone number or PIN code? How can the same person remember the name of everyone he's ever met, and then space a phone call a couple hours after it was scheduled? Why do we remember and why do we forget?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (TOT), sometimes called presque vu, is the failure to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent.[1] The phenomenon's name comes from the saying, "It's on the tip of my tongue."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Chunking (psychology) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chunking, in psychology, is a phenomenon whereby individuals group responses when performing a memory task. Tests where individuals can demonstrate "chunking" commonly include serial and free recall tasks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt's father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond and a pittance to Charlie&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin Hoffman spent a year working with autistic men and their families to understand their complex relationships. Also, when he was a jobbing actor, he had worked in a psychiatric care home, and drew from his experiences then for the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kim Peek - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurence Kim Peek (November 11, 1951 – December 19, 2009) was an American savant. Known as a "megasavant", he had an exceptional memory, but he also experienced social difficulties, possibly resulting from a developmental disability related to congenital brain abnormalities. He was the inspiration for the character of Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man. Unlike Babbitt, who had autism, Peek probably had FG syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Savant syndrome - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Savant syndrome is a condition in which a person with serious mental disabilities, including autistic disorder, demonstrates profound and prodigious capacities and/or abilities far in excess of what would be considered normal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear-sighted revelation, a deep penetration into the world of Scientology by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Looming Tower,?the now-classic study of al-Qaeda?s 9/11 attack. Based on more than two hundred personal interviews with?current and former Scientologists?both famous and less well known?and years of archival research, Lawrence Wright uses his extraordinary investigative ability to uncover for us the inner workings of the Church of Scientology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_thetan" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Operating Thetan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Scientology, Operating Thetan (OT) is a spiritual state above Clear. L. Ron Hubbard, science fiction writer and creator of Scientology, defined it as "knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time (MEST)"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, friend, you will be deeply annoyed to hear me ask you to repeat your name at least twice, and possibly five times, during our inaugural conversation. And, in subsequent meetings, even though your face will be forever etched upon my brain (a skill at which I absolutely excel), I will probably call you "Champ," "Chief," or possibly "Tex." Because, yes, I will have completely forgotten your name.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss WhatsApp moving to a subscription model, Andrew 'weev' Auernheimer being sentenced to 41 months in prison, and Warby Parker's new shaving subscription site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mobile.theverge.com/2013/3/18/4121940/whatsapp-for-ios-moving-to-subscription-model-this-year" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;WhatsApp for iOS moving to a subscription model this year, says CEO | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular cross-platform messaging service WhatsApp is shifting its iOS app from a flat-fee purchase to a $0.99 annual subscription model sometime this year, reports TechCrunch. The move would bring pricing in line with WhatsApp’s other offerings on Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry, and possibly making it free to use for the first year, as it is on those platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/ea-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-larry-probst-becomes-executive-chairman/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;EA CEO John Riccitiello Steps Down, Larry Probst Becomes Executive Chairman | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EA’s CEO John Riccitiello has just submitted his letter of resignation to the company’s board. He’s stepping down on March 30 and Larry Probst is stepping in as Executive Chairman. Probst will lead the hunt for a permanent CEO.Riccitiello has led EA since 2007 and through a dramatic transformation in the industry as the gaming world has moved from selling expensive console games on the shelves of big-box retailers to one in which mobile phones and tablets are fast-becoming a platform of choice for many developers. He was president and chief operating officer from 1997 to 2004, then left EA to co-found and lead Elevation Partners until he was later rehired by the company&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry chief executive officer Thorsten Heins has said the rapidly advancing global smartphone market has left Apple’s iPhone in its wake, and predicted his company would have 100,000 native apps available for its Z10 devices in time for the US launch later this week.Speaking exclusively to The Australian Financial Review, ahead of the local launch of its make-or-break smartphones, Mr Heins said last week’s launch of the Samsung S4, along with a wave of recent smartphone releases had reeled in the lead Apple used to hold in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jammie Thomas-Rasset won't have her day in court at the highest judicial authority in the United States. On Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case of the famous music pirate who was sentenced to pay $220,000 for downloading 24 songs with the now-defunct file-sharing software Kazaa.In 2007, Thomas-Rasset became the first person to go to trial against the Recording Industry Association of America, when she refused to settle her case after receiving a piracy cease-and-desist letter in August 2005. In the mid-2000s, the RIAA sued thousands of Americans for copyright infringements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warby Parker did it for eyeglasses, offering style at a discount. Now one of the co-founders of the trendy retailer is tackling something almost every guy needs: razors. Warby Parker co-founder Jeff Raider and his longtime friend Andy Katz-Mayfield have built Harry’s, a startup selling more than just blades and handles, but what they are calling “shaving experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two decided they would build razors for the “more discerning guy” and make them cheaper than both the dominant brands – Schick and Gillette – and what you’d find at a shaving boutique like Art of Shaving. They called their new brand Harry’s, after a grandfather figure in Raider’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next they spent nine months to learn as much as they could about shaving technology and the business. “That journey took us to Germany where we formed a partnership with company that makes some of the highest-quality razor blades in the world,” says Raider. From there the duo designed their own razor handles, packaging and shaving cream that would work perfectly with the blades, and spent many months refining, tweaking, and using the products to before landing on the final designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finished razors don’t resemble the safety razors of the past, nor do they look like a Mach 3. “We took aesthetic inspiration from older ballpoint pens and old knives that have unique handles,” says Katz-Mayfield. “From there we linked up with industrial designers to take that aesthetic to create handles that are stylish and ergonomic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techies have been keeping a hot eye on dueling Steve Jobs biopics, one an indie starring Ashton Kutcher and the other, written by Aaron Sorkin, in the works at Sony, which made “The Social Network.”But it turns out there was also a joker in the deck nobody knew about: Funny or Die, the comedy Web site, said over the weekend that it had made its own Jobs movie — “iSteve” — and planned to unveil it online on April 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Digg Blog, We&amp;#x27;re Building A Reader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg is building an RSS news reader to replace Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digg says they have been planning to build a reader in the second half of 2013, saying it will "make the Internet a more approachable and digestible place." After Google’s announcement, they are moving the project to the top of their priority list, building a reader, starting immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://qz.com/64472/samsung-smart-watch-of-its-own/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung is working on a smart watch of its own—and it could be more than just a little phone – Quartz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning both an anonymous source at Samsung and vice president of mobile Lee Young Hee said that the company is working on a smart watch, one that “will perform many of the tasks of a smartphone.” In the wake of an earlier rumor about Apple’s work on a smart watch—supposedly involving a team of 100 engineers—this feels a bit like a new kind of tech arms race. At the very least, it’s the race to be the first to hint at products that may be many months or even years in the future, in order to prop up the endless hype cycle required to capture the interest of consumers who have come to expect that revelations like Google Glass should arrive with some regularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-cockroach-newyork-idUSBRE92E13V20130315" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Swarming cockroaches turn bus to New York into roach-mobile | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Greyhound bus ride into New York City on Friday turned into a horror show for passengers suddenly swarmed by an invasion of cockroaches that forced the driver to pull over and evacuate the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cockroaches began emerging about 15 minutes after the bus departed from Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Friday morning, a Greyhound spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver soon pulled over and the 48 passengers scuttled off the infested bus to wait for a replacement vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cell phone photos showing armies of cockroaches scampering over the seats and floor were posted by local media outlets, supplied by passengers on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/18/security-expert-brian-krebs-faced-a-real-life-swating-after-posting-about-russian-cybercrime-site/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Security Expert Brian Krebs Faced A Real-Life SWATing After Posting About Russian Cybercrime Site | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security writer Brian Krebs’ phone was spoofed and a SWAT team was called to his home last week by hackers who apparently took offense at his investigations into various online hacking organizations. His website also suffered a denial of service attack for a short period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/early-treatment-sometimes-lets-the-body-keep-hiv-in-check/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Early treatment sometimes lets the body keep HIV in check | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, came a report that early treatment with antivirals has allowed one individual to keep an HIV infection limited for extended periods of time without treatment. Now, a report in PLOS pathogens suggests that this case may not be as exceptional as we might have thought. In a small population of people treated immediately after infection, about 15 percent managed to keep the virus in check after they discontinued other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no mechanism for offering upgrades in the Mac App Store. To accommodate customers who wish to purchase Mac App Store versions, special pricing will be offered for the first 48 hours. PDFpen will be $29.99 and PDFpenPro will be $39.99 for this very limited time. The special pricing expires on March 20 at midnight PDT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, which seems determined to map every square inch of the planet, on Monday released Street View images from four of the seven tallest mountains on earth. One lucky engineer, who happens to be a passionate mountaineer, led the Google Mountain Enthusiast team during a project that was strictly a labor of love for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/03/18/flattr-monetizing-facebook-likes-twitter-favorites-more/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Flattr now lets you make money from your Twitter Favorites, Instagram Likes and more - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flattr has allowed users to pay money into an account and use it to tip money to content creators whose work they appreciate by clicking a button on their sites. The ‘chicken and egg’ problem was that despite support from the likes of Dailymotion and Wikileaks, publishers generally didn’t want to add the buttons to their sites until Flattr had enough users to make it worthwhile, and users didn’t want to put money into a service that wasn’t widely supported by the sites they visited.Now Flattr is circumventing the need for its own buttons by monetizing Twitter’s Favorite, Instagram’s Likes and similar actions on some of the most popular social sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/more-solar-companies-fail/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Why We Need More Solar Companies to Fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suntech, a Wuxi, China-based company that as recently as 2011 was the world’s largest producer of solar panels, is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. It’s running low on cash, owes bond investors half a billion dollars (which it failed to pay Friday), and is saddled with payments on billions of dollars in loans as it struggles to make money in a market flooded with solar panels.If Suntech fails and shuts down its factories, that might not be a bad thing. Some industry experts say that hundreds of solar companies need to fail to help bring solar panel supply back in line with demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/canada-social-farting/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Canada Takes on &amp;#x27;Social Farting&amp;#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flatulence is a fairly taboo subject for U.S. advertising. Not so in Canada, apparently. This public service announcement from that country's Ministry of Health likens social smoking to passing gas in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/18/pope-francis-social-media/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;What It&amp;#x27;s Like to Be Pope Francis&amp;#x27; Social Media Intern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis sent his first tweet from the resurrected @Pontifex Twitter account Sunday, only four days after being elected as Benedict XVI's successor. A little-known fact is that Pope Francis has a couple of helping hands on social media: a pair of American undergraduate interns from Villanova University, a Catholic school in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/14/apple-proposes-on-the-go-wireless-charging-via-ipad-smart-cover-with-built-in-battery" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple proposes &amp;#x27;on-the-go&amp;#x27; wireless charging via iPad Smart Cover with built-in battery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Apple patent application discovered on Thursday reveals that the company is actively investigating wireless charging for its line of portable devices, but proposes to use the technology in a slightly different way than existing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Mailbox being bought by Dropbox, North Korea blames US and allies for cyber attacks, and where to watch the Angry Birds Toons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-mailbox-an-app-with-some-buzz/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Dropbox Buys Mailbox, an App With Some Buzz - Digits - WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropbox is buying the owner of the buzzy Mailbox mobile app, making its first move into products outside its core file-sharing service.Under the deal, the 13 employees of Mailbox owner Orchestra Inc.–including alums of Apple, Stanford University and Ideo–will join Dropbox. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/15/apples-budget-iphone-expected-to-have-same-4-inch-display-as-iphone-5" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;budget&amp;#x27; iPhone expected to have same 4-inch display as iPhone 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details on Apple's so-called "budget" iPhone were revealed on Friday to AppleInsider by Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities, who has a reliable track record in predicting Apple's future product plans. According to Kuo, the specs for Apple's low-cost iPhone were decided in 2011, and the company is "unlikely to abruptly change" due to a market shift toward larger screens in the 5-inch range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCMag spoke with Nick DiCarlo, Samsung's vice president of portfolio planning, at last night's event, and he said that many of the software improvements in the Samsung Galaxy S4 could make their way into existing Samsung Galaxy S3 phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/google-kills-rss/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;It’s Not Just Reader – Google Kills Its RSS Subscription Browser Extension, Too | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh Google. Thought we wouldn’t notice that you’re trying to kill off not just Google Reader, but also your support and endorsement for the RSS format itself? People have just started noticing that Google’s own RSS Subscription Chrome browser extension has disappeared from the Google Chrome Web Store. Though it’s unclear at this time exactly when the extension was removed, the change appears to be recent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.techinasia.com/north-korea-accuses-america-cyberattacks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;North Korean News Agency Accuses US and Allies of Cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North Korea’s official news agency KCNA has accused the US and its allies of conducting cyberattacks. Described as “intensive and persistent virus attacks”, it’s otherwise not clear what information the alleged hackers were after or if any data was stolen. The implication is that the US or South Korean governments are trying to access North Korean servers in an act of espionage or sabotage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career website Glassdoor on Friday released its latest report highlighting this year’s top 50 highest-rated Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), and it seems like the tech world played a big role in the list. In fact, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unseated Apple CEO Tim Cook from the number one spot he grabbed last year.Glassdoor compiled its figures based on more than half a million company reviews submitted by employees between February 25, 2012 and February 24, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawdingo, a startup that connects users with lawyers for online consultations (sometimes instantly), is announcing that it’s part of the current class of startups at Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/facebook-fills-its-vacant-cto-role-by-promoting-its-vp-of-engineering-mike-schroepfer/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Fills CTO Role By Promoting Its VP Of Engineering, Mike Schroepfer | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Zuckerberg has just made an internal announcement to Facebook naming its veteran VP of Engineering Mike Schroepfer as CTO, we’ve just learned from an industry source. Facebook has since confirmed to TechCrunch that Schroepfer will take the postion previously held by Bret Taylor, who left last year. Schroepfer has been at Facebook for nearly five years and led most of its latest mobile efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent system is flawed, some would say broken. And patent trolls — less pejoratively known as non-practicing entities (NPEs) — are to blame, no matter how good a case they might make for their role in the patent ecosystem. Or are they? Trolls are an easy target because they don’t make anything, choosing instead to enforce patents against those who do.But curing the patent problem requires general solutions … not ones targeted just at patent trolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-secret national security letters that come with a gag order on the recipient are an unconstitutional impingement on free speech, a federal judge in California ruled in a decision released Friday.U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered the government to stop issuing so-called NSLs across the board, in a stunning defeat for the Obama administration’s surveillance practices. She also ordered the government to cease enforcing the gag provision in any other cases. However, she stayed her order for 90 days to give the government a chance to appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovio has long been threatening to bring Angry Birds into other media, and this weekend they're finally doing it -- kind of. Angry Birds Toons is a brand new cartoon series featuring none other than the frustrated fowl that iOS gamers have known and loved for so long. But you won't find it on a TV station or in a movie theater: Instead, the cartoon is premiering inside the Angry Birds apps, so if you have any of them installed, you can jump in and you'll be able to watch the series starting this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/15/apple-sued-over-defective-macbook-pro-retina-displays/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple sued over defective MacBook Pro Retina displays | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit has been filed in federal court in California alleging that Apple is misleading consumers by not advertising that there are two different types of displays used in its MacBook Pros with Retina displays. The issue stems from widespread reports that MacBook Pros with Retina displays that use display panels from LG suffer from ghosting issues. MacBook Pros that use Retina displays from Samsung reportedly are not affected by the same issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are mourning the impending loss of Google Reader, which will be cease to function on July 1. The folks at Zite have a kinda, sorta replacement that can be used from within the free Zite personalized news app.Zite has always been a bit of a hybrid, allowing you to access your Google Reader feeds manually, while providing the extra Zite-selected news, based on your interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/reservations/?p=1#to-grow-even-faster-mailbox-is-joining-dropbox" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox - Put Email In Its Place&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we’ve decided to join forces with Dropbox and build it out together. To be clear, Mailbox is not going away. The product needs to grow fast, and we believe that joining Dropbox is the best way to make that happen. Plus, imagine what cool things you could do if your Mailbox was connected to your Dropbox…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/mailbox-cost-dropbox-around-100-million/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Mailbox Cost Dropbox Around $100 Million | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been hearing that Mailbox was raising money, piquing the interest of Andreessen Horowitz among others, which is why today’s news that the company sold to the harmoniously named Dropbox didn’t come as a surprise. Sometimes an acquisition is the easiest way to raise resources for growth — especially when you’re tackling as expensive a problem as email. And have a six-figure wait list.And we’re hearing that this particular acquisition was not cheap — The post-pivot startup cost the storage company “well over” $50 million, according to multiple sources. And we’ve heard that that the price was around $100 million in cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/16/uber-black-towncar-drivers-strike-in-san-francisco-over-compensation-terms-and-treatment/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Uber black towncar drivers strike in San Francisco over compensation terms and treatment - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of Uber drivers of their ‘Black Car’ service are striking this afternoon in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. Those drivers participating have parked in front of Uber’s headquarters. They intend on striking – not providing rides to Uber users – during the rush hour period, and perhaps the weekend.The drivers that TNW spoke to stated that they are being treated unfairly, specifically citing a lack of communication and input in the Uber decision making process, and the fact that Uber does not provide a commercial insurance policy, leaving drivers legally culpable in the case of an accident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Road Films is pushing back the release of Jobs, which was scheduled to hit theaters April 19, the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Apple Computer. A new date has yet to be determined (the film previously was titled jOBS).Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that Open Road wanted more time to market the film, which was fully financed and produced by Mark Hulme's Five Star Feature Films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York State first began issuing paper licenses to chauffeurs in 1910, and the shape, form and style have changed over the past century, adapting to new laws and technologies. The following is a sampling of how the license has evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the eve of Samsung’s Galaxy S4 launch, Apple and its marketing chief Phil Schiller spoke with mainstream news publications to slam Android and iPhone competitors. Now, following the launch of the new Samsung device, Apple has opened up an entire new web page to tout why people have loved the iPhone for so many years and to seemingly throw some negative claims against Android and Samsung devices.Apple has also begun emailing a version of this webpage to its own customers, something that makes this seem more defensive than offensive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss the latest in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323393304578360651345373308-lMyQjAxMTAzMDEwNDExNDQyWj.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Working on Incorporating the Hashtag - WSJ.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is working on incorporating the hashtag, one of Twitter's most iconic markers, into its service by using the symbol as a way to group conversations, said people familiar with the matter. It is unclear how far along Facebook's work on the hashtag is and the feature isn't likely to be introduced imminently, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/14/apple-offering-imacs-with-optional-vesa-mount-adapters/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple offering iMacs with optional VESA mount adapters | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has begun offering iMacs with an optional VESA mount adapter. The new BTO option was first noticed by Macworld UK. Users who buy an iMac on Apple's online store can order the iMac with the VESA mount adapter instead of the standard foot stand for an additional US$40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/12/study-only-16-of-users-will-retry-a-malfunctioning-app/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Study: Only 16% of users will retry a malfunctioning app | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions are important when you are selling an app. According to a new study by Compuware that was reported by TechCrunch, you only have one chance, maybe two, to get a customer to become a regular user of your app. If glitches force a customer to try your app a third or fourth time, you risk losing 84 percent of your user base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102720/outlook-outage-overheating-datacenter" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft blames overheating datacenter for 16-hour Outlook outage | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's outlook.com webmail service suffered 16-hour long issues yesterday after a firmware upgrade at the company's datacenter went wrong. In a blog post detailing the outage, Microsoft reveals some customers couldn't access parts of SkyDrive, Hotmail, and Outlook. Although Microsoft has updated its datacenter firmware successfully previously, the regular process "resulted in a rapid and substantial temperature spike in the datacenter" due to an unspecified reason. The overheating was significant enough to activate Microsoft's safeguard process for a number of servers in the datacenter, preventing access to certain mailboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/developerauction/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;DeveloperAuction raises $2.7M for exactly what you’d think | VentureBeat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new job search platform has played host to around $225 million in job offers. And with today’s news, the company is seeing some inbound cash as well: $2.7 million in a first round of institutional funding led by NEA and Sierra Ventures with participation from Google Ventures, Crosslink Capital, and Jeff Clavier’sSoftTech VC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/reuters-editor-indicted-for-conspiring-with-hacker-group-anonymous/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Reuters Editor Indicted For Conspiring With Hacker Group, Anonymous | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuter’s Deputy Editor of Social Media, Matthew Keys, has been indicted for allegedly conspiring with hacktivist group, “Anonymous.” According to the Department of Justice, “Keys provided members of the hacker group Anonymous with log-in credentials for a computer server belonging to KTXL FOX 40’s corporate parent, the Tribune Company.”The indictment includes allegations of aiding hackers in defacing the Los Angeles Times websites. “That was such a buzz having my edit on the LA Times,” wrote a co-conspirator to Keys in a conversation intercepted by the Justice Department [PDF].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/white-house-launches-being-joe-biden-website-cant-get-enough-folksy/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;White House Launches ‘Being Joe Biden’ Website. Can’t…Get…Enough…Folksy | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you can’t get enough of the folksy musings of “America’s Happy Warrior,” the White House has launched the Being Joe Biden Portal. “If you want to keep people away during an earthquake, buy some shotgun shells,” said Vice President Biden, in response to a question about assault weapons bans during a Google  hangout last January. If Biden’s first broadcast is any indication, the audio series will surely bring weekly smiles from the Veep’s lovable down-home charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/14/os-x-mountain-lion-v10-8-3-security-update-2013-001-now-availab/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.3, Security Update 2013-001 now available | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has released OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.3 and the first security update of 2013. The update includes a number of good improvements including:The ability to redeem iTunes gift cards in the Mac App Store using the built-in camera on a MacBoot Camp support for installing Windows 8 and Macs with a 3 TB hard drive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/digg-yes-that-digg-is-building-a-google-reader-replacement-complete-with-api/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Digg – Yes, That Digg – Is Building A Google Reader Replacement, Complete With API | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader being shut down by its malevolent overlords leaves a gaping, Google Reader-sized hole in the market where it used to be. Many are stepping up today to announce that their products or services can act as a replacement, but one source is specifically saying it will build a functionally complete replacement – news aggregation service Digg.Digg just announced on its official blog that it was previously planning on building a reader in the second half of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57574382-76/nonsensical-texting-may-be-only-sign-of-stroke/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Nonsensical texting may be only sign of stroke | Cutting Edge - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit present a case study in which "dystexia" was the only symptom of a stroke. The patient had no trouble speaking, only texting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/14/net-us-google-maps-idUSBRE92D0U220130314" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;More change at Google as Maps-Commerce chief gets new role | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc's mapping and commerce chief is stepping down in the latest senior management reshuffle after Android architect Andy Rubin moved on to a still-undefined role at the company on Wednesday.Google will split its Maps/Geo and Commerce group into two separate units. Senior Vice President Jeff Huber, who has led the group since 2011, is moving to Google X, the company's experimental projects group known for developing self-driving cars and the Google Glass wearable computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/14/uveband/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;UVeBand Tells You When To Reapply Sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love spending time soaking up the sun, a new Kickstarter project can protect you from the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays.UVeBand, a slap bracelet, monitors your exposure to the sun and vibrates when you need to apply more sunscreen. The device works after you've applied your first layer of lotion or spray and automatically turns on after making contact with your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-just-happened/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Launches The Galaxy S 4 With A Baffling, Overproduced Broadway-Style Show | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In theory, illustrating different features of your new phone with real-world scenarios isn’t a terrible idea. And if you must hold your event in the Radio City, why not get theatrical? But what’s impressive here is how the skits are both terribly written and unconvincing (like, maybe intentionally so, because that makes it better?), and yet Samsung is really committing to them — actors get played on and off with cheesy music, and there have been multiple dance numbers. This was how Samsung introduced the Galaxy S4 yesterday and their methods were laughably received by the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/kiln/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kiln - Version Control and Code Review Software from Fog Creek Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your developers decide: Kiln Harmony helps your developers work together, whether they prefer Mercurial or Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-galaxy-s-iv-36261" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Marketing LandSamsung Launches The Galaxy S4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung formally unveiled the latest in its Galaxy S line-up of smartphones, the Galaxy S4 (or officially, the Galaxy S 4). The phone features a 5? screen without getting larger than the Galaxy S3 plus an array of features that seemingly put Samsung’s own brand ahead of Google and Android. Samsung said the phone will be available worldwide some time in April, supporting both 3G and 4G LTE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://marketingland.com/samsung-introduces-galaxy-s-iv-phone-with-nary-a-mention-of-android-or-google-2-36316" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Introduces Galaxy S4 With Nary A Mention Of Android Or Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung unveiled its heavily anticipated Galaxy S4 handset. The event had the hype and production values of an Apple product launch. But, what barely seemed in attendance was any idea that the S4 is an Android phone or contains Google services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the product launch was devoted to showcasing software rather than hardware features. Samsung is positioning the phone as a “life companion.” Perhaps most interesting, Google was never mentioned and Android drew one lesser mention in the context of the phone’s “Knox” enterprise security system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss Google Reader shutting down, the new Pope, the new President of China, Samsung Galaxy S 4, and Pi Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/03/13/google-reader-shutdown/1986337/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader shutting down in July&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is shutting down its popular RSS Reader as part of a broader "spring cleaning" to concentrate on a smaller selection of services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader will shut down July 1, so users have enough time to transition to a new option. Launched in 2005, the RSS Reader allowed users to pull content feeds from a variety of websites into one personal hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among other services getting shuttered: Google Building Maker, Google Cloud Connect and the voice app for BlackBerry devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/13/4101144/google-shuts-down-reader-rss-aggregation-service" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Reader to shut down July 1st | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service, which originally launched back in 2005, will be officially put out to pasture on July 1st, 2013. Reader has gone through a number of iterations, but it had not been significantly updated in a long time. The last time that Google updated the product, it built in integration for the Google+ social network and removed Reader's own native sharing service, causing a bit of a backlash with die hard users. Google is offering users a way to export their Reader content, including lists of users that they follow and starred and liked articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google says it is killing it off because "usage of Google Reader has declined, and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products." As one of the most popular RSS aggregators around, the death of Google Reader could spell doom for the RSS protocol itself, which has seen waning popularity since the rise of social sharing services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/media/2013/03/14/as-google-reader-is-killed-off-flipboard-feedly-reeder-and-others-offer-rss-alternatives/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;As Google Reader is killed off, Flipboard, Feedly and others step up with RSS alternatives - The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google axing Google Reader, this leaves the door open for others to step up with RSS alternatives. Feedly — a browser plug-in that turns feed into magazine-like layouts — has detailed its project to clone to Google Reader API, popular social aggregator Flipboard says its “got your RSS feeds covered”, open-source Newsblur is adding more servers to cope with Reader imports, while Reeder — another Google dependent – “won’t die with Google Reader”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already a petition to ‘Keep Google Reader’ (there’s hope Google will open-source it) has gained more than 2,000 digital signatures. Given also that Feedly.com and Newsblur.com are down — presumably through the sheer volume of traffic — and that numerous blog posts have sprouted up on the subject, Reader’s exit will leave a void for many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepartycow/status/311959283883466752" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter-Brian Walsh @thepartycow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-21766622" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Xi Jinping named president of China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Beijing have confirmed Xi Jinping as president, completing China's 10-yearly transition of power. Mr Xi, appointed to the Communist Party's top post in November, replaces Hu Jintao, who is stepping down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Xi assumes the leadership of a nation that is growing wealthier but more vocal in its anger at issues such as rising inequality, environmental damage and food safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also faces concern among regional neighbours over how China will wield its rising power, particularly in relations to thorny issues such as territorial disputes with Japan and Asean nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21781125?" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Francis begins his challenging papacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pope Francis had been greeted by crowds roaring their approval when he appeared at the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square on Wednesday evening, about an hour after white smoke rose from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel to announce to the world that a new pontiff had been elected. Today, Pope Francis has begun his first day at the helm of the Catholic Church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It seems that my brother cardinals have gone to the ends of the earth [to find a pope]," Francis said wryly, referring to his native Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 76-year-old from Buenos Aires is the first Pope to take the name of Francis - reminiscent of Francis of Assisi, the 13th Century Italian reformer and patron saint of animals, who lived in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US President Barack Obama sent "warm wishes" on behalf of the American people to the newly elected pontiff, hailing the Argentine as "the first Pope from the Americas".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4102924/galaxy-s4-video-leak" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Leaked videos show Galaxy S 4 SmartPause, eye tracking, and new lock screen | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the Samsung Unpacked event has even begun, the leaks have already started. The latest round of leaks, now helpfully arriving in video form, details two highlight features: SmartPause eye tracking and floating touch control. SmartPause does exactly the same thing LG announced yesterday — pausing and resuming video on the handset in accordance with whether you're looking at it or not. The floating touch appears to be an implementation of Samsung's Air View S Pen functionality, made to work without the stylus. Its purpose is to open up previews of things (such as a thumbnail on a video timeline) without requiring you to tap the display, you just hover your finger over the desired item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get a peek at the Galaxy S 4's browser performance, which looks satisfyingly quick and responsive, as well as its newly redesigned lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/4064006/samsung-galaxy-s-4-rumors" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S 4: Samsung prepares to unveil its latest flagship smartphone | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Samsung Unpacked launch event draws closer, more and more details are leaking out about the Galaxy S 4. If the leaks are accurate, the Galaxy S 4 will have a 1080p 5-inch screen, 2GB of RAM, and an overclocked version of the PowerVR GPU found in the iPhone 5. It'll also have a host of new software features, as detailed by a series of videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/the-end-of-feeddemon.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Nick Bradbury: The End of FeedDemon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick Bradbury wrote and published a post yesterday on his site revealing that it is the end of FeedDemon saying "I've thoroughly enjoyed working on it and I'm grateful for all of the people who paid for it over the years despite free alternatives. But it's time for FeedDemon to die."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clearly states that FeedDemon's conclusions goes hand-in-hand with the death of Google Reader. Bradbury continues saying, "Then today came the news that Google Reader is shutting down on July 1. FeedDemon relies on Google Reader for synchronization, and there's no decent alternative (and even if there were, it's doubtful I'd have time to integrate with it, at least not without trading time away from my family - which I won't do). That was the nail in the coffin for me. I hate to say goodbye to FeedDemon after a decade of working on it, but it's time to say goodbye. When Google Reader shuts down on July 1, FeedDemon will also disappear."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/the-google-reader-shutdown-is-yet-another-nail-in-feedburners-coffin/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Google Reader Shutdown Is Yet Another Nail In Feedburner&amp;#x27;s Coffin - TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Google Reader is out of the picture how much longer until we hear that FeedBurner will meet the same fate? The last RSS-focused product Google closed was AdSense for Feeds, its ad product for site owners who wanted to monetize their RSS feeds. With Reader and AdSense for Feeds gone, the last RSS product standing at Google is Feedburner – and all signs point to that getting the ax sooner or later, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Google Reader, it’s been a very long time since Feedburner got any updates and everything points at a total neglect of the product at Google: Its stats are sporadically unavailable, it never even got the visual refresh that virtually every other Google product got, the Feedburner blog (now called AdSense for Feeds – after the already closed product…) has been updated three times since April 2010. The FeedBurner Status Blog hasn’t been updated since last September. Things are not looking hopeful for FeedBurner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/twitter-line-breaks/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter Now Supports Line Breaks in Tweets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter added support for line breaks Wednesday, a new feature that lets you spread your 140 character message over several different lines. Line breaks currently aren't supported on most third-party Twitter clients, nor are they supported in embedded tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just want to know if line breaks are supported in the bio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4103262/cbs-launches-ios-tv-streaming-app" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;CBS launches iOS streaming TV app with one-week delay for new episodes | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CBS has been considering some interesting mobile and web options of its own.  "CBS Interactive," launched today for iPhone and iPad, it lets users stream full episodes of some shows, including CSI, How I Met Your Mother, and The Late Show with David Letterman. Like other networks, CBS already offers streaming on the web with roughly one-day delays across the board, but the app is a move towards more versatility and viewing outside the living room. New episodes of daytime and late-night shows will be added within 24 hours, and prime-time shows will arrive on the eighth day after broadcast. CBS is also touting extra "second screen" features for some shows. Warner Brothers launched a similar app with one-day delays last year, but only for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/michaelrusch/a-photo-that-defines-a-generation" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;A Photo That Defines A Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visitors take photos with their phones and tablets of Pope Francis as he speaks from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2013/03/14/pi-day-6-healthy-pie-recipes" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pi Day: 6 (Healthy) Pie Recipes - US News and World Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Pi Day! Pi, as we're sure you all know, is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, which is 3.14 in decimal form. It's actually more like 3.1415926, and can be calculated to many, many more digits because it's an irrational number. But we'll stick with 3.14 because it corresponds with March 14, which brings us back to Pi Day. Go make a Pie for Pi Day, some great recipes are linked here. (Not GF).&lt;/p&gt;
