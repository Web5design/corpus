      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie discuss the latest in tech news: including a possible all screen iPhone, Blackberry's sales, a biological transistor, the Ouya release, a cheesy heist, and musical instruments made of lasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/apple-patent-wrap-around-amoled-display/#continued" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple patent filing describes phone concept with wrap-around AMOLED display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Apple patent application popped up at the USPTO Thursday, which describes a "consumer electronic product" that's nothing but screen. The patent involves building a device from an open-ended transparent body (of glass, for example) that becomes a full wrap-around display when a flexible AMOLED screen is unfurled within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/mike-lazaridis-to-leave-blackberry/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Founder Mike Lazaridis to leave Blackberry May 1st as vice-chairman and director&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the heels of yesterday's earnings release, Blackberry vice chairman Mike Lazaridis announced that he'll leave the company on May 1st. The exec founded the company formerly known as Research in Motion almost 30 years ago, with Jim Balsillie as its early CEO -- who resigned this time last year himself and recently sold off his remaining shares. Lazaridis said that he'll focus instead on his new Quantum Valley Investments venture, which recently backed a research center in his home town of Waterloo, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/blackberry-2013-q4/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BlackBerry makes $94 million on revenue of $2.7 billion, ships 1 million BB10 devices in 2013 Q4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackberry published its results from the end of the fiscal year to March 2nd, which shows that the smartphone maker made $94 million in GAAP income on revenues of $2.7 billion -- in contrast with the $125 million net loss it made in the same quarter last year. More importantly, however, it shipped out almost one million BlackBerry 10 devices during the three weeks of the quarter that they were available. In addition, it managed to push five million of its older smartphones and 370,000 PlayBook tablets out of the door, but saw user numbers fall from 79 million last quarter to 76 million now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/ee-switches-on-4g-in-13-more-areas/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;EE switches on 4G in 13 more areas, claims half of the UK population now covered&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a week relaxing in the Cumbrian countryside, EE's back on the road, bringing its 4G LTE network to some relatively more populated areas. The company has announced 13 additional locations it's coating with high-speed coverage today. This brings the total number of regions under the 4G umbrella to 50, which EE claims, coincidentally, now covers 50 percent of UK residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/in-app-purchase-revenue-hits-record-high-accounts-for-76-of-u-s-iphone-app-revenue-90-in-asian-markets/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;In-App Purchase Revenue Hits Record High: Accounts For 76% Of U.S. iPhone App Revenue, 90% In Asian Markets | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s well-known that many of today’s mobile applications generate revenue through in-app purchases, a new report released yesterday shows how powerful this money-making mechanism has become. In January 2012, just over half (53 percent) of iPhone App Store revenue in the U.S. was attributed to in-app purchases, but as of last month, that number has climbed to a record 76 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/google-donates-patents-to-protect-cloud-software-from-lawsuits/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google donates patents to protect cloud software from lawsuits — Tech News and Analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google unveiled a “patent pledge” that it hopes will shield cloud software and big data developers from the type of litigation that has engulfed the mobile phone industry. The pledge, which is like a non-aggression pact, covers ten patents related to Google’s MapReduce technology.The pledge, which Google announced on Thursday, says that developers are free to use or sell the technology described in the patents without fear of future lawsuits. The shield applies, however, only to projects based on open source software that is available to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/03/26/andrew_weissmann_fbi_wants_real_time_gmail_dropbox_spying_power.html?wpisrc=most_viral" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Weissmann: FBI wants real-time Gmail, Dropbox spying power.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, during a talk for the American Bar Association in Washington, D.C., FBI general counsel Andrew Weissmann discussed some of the pressing surveillance and national security issues facing the bureau. Despite the pervasiveness of law enforcement surveillance of digital communication, the FBI still has a difficult time monitoring Gmail, Google Voice, and Dropbox in real time. But that may change soon, because the bureau says it has made gaining more powers to wiretap all forms of Internet conversation and cloud storage a “top priority” this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4157830/biological-transistor-inside-living-cells-DNA-made-by-stanford" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Scientists develop biological transistor that can command living cells | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully biological computers are getting closer to reality. Scientists at Stanford University on Thursday announced they have created a new type of transistor, the most basic part of a computer (and almost all other modern electronics), that is made entirely using genetic material, and works inside of living bacteria. The new biological transistor is actually better than its inorganic counterpart in some ways, according to the researchers, who say their device will be able to help build fully functioning computers within the cells of living organisms — plants and animals alike — in the future. Their full findings appeared Thursday in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4157982/amazon-to-acquire-book-recommendation-social-network-goodreads" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon to acquire Goodreads, a social network for book recommendations | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon will acquire book recommendation site and readers' social network Goodreads, according to an Amazon press release issued Thursday. Amazon already owns Shelfari, a social and information network described as a "community-powered encyclopedia for book lovers." Together with Goodreads (as well as its own lightweight / somewhat anemic kindle.amazon.com social notes network) Amazon will soon own the major online recommendation and commentary engines for new and old books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4158156/ouya-will-be-available-in-retail-stores-on-june-4th-for-99-99" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Ouya will be available in retail stores and online on June 4th for $99.99 | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a listing at Amazon, Ouya will be available on June 4th for $99.99. Ouya will also be available at Best Buy, Game, GameStop, Target, and on the Ouya website. The Android-powered console will be available initially in the US, Canada, and the UK. Those who backed the project on Kickstarter should get their consoles much sooner, however — Ouya tweeted today that emails for shipment details were being sent out today and that more shipments would roll out over the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/28/d-link-ships-its-ac1200-802-11ac-wifi-router/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;D-Link ships its AC1200 802.11ac WiFi router / thermos doppelganger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D-Link's AC1200 may better resemble the container keeping your coffee hot at work than a traditional WiFi router, but it remains a rare take on networking design that's frankly appreciated. The device is the more affordable of D-Link's two 2013-era 802.11ac routers at its $130 street price, keeping costs in check by peaking at at more modest 867Mbps speed with the new standard and 300Mbps on old-fashioned 802.11n. It still dishes out wireless on either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz bands, offers wired connections to four gigabit Ethernet devices and shares content from drives attached to its lone USB 3.0 port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweetdeck, the Twitter client that's more popular (and useful) than the company's own native desktop app, is getting a version bump that has everything to do with filters. Available for Windows and Mac users now, the update lets social tweakers get granular as they sort through columns and search with new content and user filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch is bringing the energy and excitement of a mini-Disrupt to more cities across the country. The site is pleased to announced the 2013 Meetups. Pitch-Offs will begin in Austin on May 30 at Stage On Sixth in downtown Austin. Then, throughout the year, Tech Crunch will be holding meetups with pitch-offs in Seattle, San Diego, and Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying no to unnecessary commitments can give you the time you need to recover and rejuvenate. Saying no to daily distractions can give you the space you need to focus on what is important to you. And saying no to temptation can help you stay on track and achieve your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/m/blogEntry?id=18832065" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Illinois Man Charged In 21-Ton Cheese Heist - ABC News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veniamin Balika, 34, of Plainfield, Ill., was accused of stealing 42,000 pounds of Muenster cheese from a Wisconsin cheese company. He was arrested at a Bergen County rest area on the New Jersey Turnpike on Monday, the result of a joint investigation with the Saddle Brook New Jersey Police Department and the New Jersey State Police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"He was charged with receiving stolen property and fencing," New Jersey State Police Sergeant Adam Grossman told ABCNews.com. Balika allegedly attempted to sell the load of 1,135 cases of cheese at the rest area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the good news: The vial of Guanarito, a rare disease found only in Venezuelan rodents, that was reported missing from a Texas lab on Wednesday is probably nothing to worry about. First of all, there’s no evidence that Guanarito can be transmitted from person to person—only from rodent to person (though when that happens, primarily to “male agricultural workers,” it isn’t pleasant). Nor does it appear that the vial was spirited away by an evildoer—more likely, it was destroyed after accidentally falling to the floor, Galveston National Laboratory scientific director Scott Weaver tells the Houston Chronicle. Galveston National Laboratory is housed at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Reports the Chronicle:“We don't think anything that happened this past week endangers the community," Weaver said. "We think this is an error that any one facility is inevitable and we are going to improve to prevent this in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, two Swedish women, Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin, set out to solve some problems with traditional bike helmets. As they saw it, the problems were that many cyclists refused to wear bike helmets because they are unattractive and wreak havoc on styled hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are building an eerie, human-sized robot jellyfish with a lifelike silicone mantle to patrol the oceans. Virginia Tech mechanical engineering professor Shashank Priya is leading the team, which hopes its invention can be used for jobs ranging from military surveillance to cleaning up oil spills and mapping ocean floors, reports Phys.org. The project is part of a $5 million multi-university program funded by the US Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/28/a-violin-made-of-lasers/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Violin Made of Lasers Actually Sounds Lovely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology lecturer Dylan Menzies doesn’t play the violin in the traditional sense. Instead he uses software and lasers to translate the positioning, speed and motion of a traditional wooden bow into music.His optical sensor-driven O-Bow is encased in copper with a groove for the bow. Wired reports on his solution for replicating the sound of a violin but making something easier to play:A system that uses synthesis software to translate data sent from an optical flow sensor, which tracks the speed, motion and angle of a wooden rod in high resolution as it is moved across it. The data is used to modify music created from a hooked-up keyboard (which creates the notes and pitch), meaning a player can replicate the subtle tones of a bow gliding across strings, not just the staccato notes produced by typical orchestral keyboard effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://laughingsquid.com/seaboard-grand-a-new-piano-like-electronic-instrument-with-a-soft-tactile-keyboard/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Seaboard GRAND is a new piano-like electronic instrument with a tactile keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seaboard GRAND is a new piano-like electronic instrument with a tactile keyboard that creates a more expressive and varied sound than a traditional piano. The soft black keyboard uses an interface called Sensory, Elastic and Adaptive (SEA), enabling the player to adjust pitch, volume, and timbre as they press the keys. You can see and hear the instrument in action in these solo and duet teaser performances. Seaboard GRAND is being developed for production by British tech company ROLI. A introductory run of 88 instruments is in the works—prices and technical details will be released in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pianist Sonya Belosouva channels her inner Rick Grimes, the lead character from AMC's The Walking Dead, as she bravely plays a rendition of the television drama's theme song while surrounded by zombies in this slickly produced video.

&lt;p&gt;Warren Robinett, a video game designer, is credited with creating one of the first digital Easter eggs. In the digital world, an Easter egg is a hidden message snuck into a computer program, video game, or website where it shouldn’t be. In 1979, Robinett secretly put his name in a room of the video game Adventure, which he developed for Atari. So by any logic, Warren Robinett is the real Easter Bunny.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dan and Haddie are joined by Myke Hurley to discuss the news of the day and Haddie gets back at Myke for a previous American Fact quiz with a "Britishisms" quiz. Dan also discusses the running of a grand English manor and how it relates to Wayne Manor with Myke and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links for this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21954636" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;BBC News - Global internet slows after &amp;#x27;biggest attack in history&amp;#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet around the world has been slowed down in what security experts are describing as the biggest cyber-attack of its kind in history.A row between a spam-fighting group and hosting firm has sparked retaliation attacks affecting the wider internet.It is having an impact on popular services like Netflix - and experts worry it could escalate to affect banking and email systems.Five national cyber-police-forces are investigating the attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5992652" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;That Internet War Apocalypse Is a Lie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might've read some headlines today—in very reputable publications—saying that there's an online attack underway. The biggest in history. Enough to slow down the internet. This would be exciting and scary, except it's just not true. The entire thing sounds so dramatic—the swarming DDoS onslaught is "jamming crucial infrastructure around the world," the NYT screams from the trenches—that it sounds just plausible enough. And indeed, the combatants in question have been battling it out online: a conflict between Spamhaus, a Dutch European group that tracks spammers and Cyberbunker, a Dutch hosting company accused of housing them. That's really happening: as far as we can tell, botnets acting on behalf of (or run by) Cyberbunker have been trying to crash Spamhaus for days with a strong stream of overload junk data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/27/4152602/mailchimp-rewarding-users-ten-percent-off-two-step-security" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;MailChimp rewarding users with ten percent discount for enabling two-step authentication | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google and Apple can't exactly reward customers who make their accounts more secure with two-step authentication — not financially, anyway. Both companies provide free services that require no monthly fee. But for email marketing company MailChimp, it's actually a sensible option. Users that enable two-step security on their accounts will now receive a ten percent discount off their monthly bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2031516/hands-on-with-audiobus-and-garageband.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Hands on with Audiobus and GarageBand | Macworld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent update, Apple made the iOS version of GarageBand compatible with the popular audio-channeling utility Audiobus. Although Apple provides ways for some apps to communicate with others—Facebook and Twitter hooks built into iOS, for example—until Audiobus came along, moving sound between iOS music apps was a clumsy process that required saving and exporting audio files and then importing them into compatible apps.What Audiobus brings to the table is the ability for compatible apps to communicate with one another, much as PC and Mac audio applications have been able to do for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/25/the-vamp-old-speakers/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Make Old Speakers Bluetooth-Enabled With This Little Gadget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The London-based Paul Cocksedge Studio is raising funds on Kickstarter to further develop "The Vamp," a cube-like device that attaches to any speaker and adds Bluetooth capability. Instead of buying new Bluetooth speakers, The Vamp sort of makes the retro relevant again, as demonstrated in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc is ramping up plans to combine its physical stores with online technology, testing the use of lockers to hold goods ordered on the Internet until shoppers pick them up, as the world's largest retailer tries to catch up with e-commerce leader Amazon.com Inc.While Wal-Mart is the leading retailer overall with $466.1 billion in annual sales, it trails Amazon and a handful of other retailers when it comes to selling goods online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/paytango/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Fingerprints Instead Of Credit Cards? YC-Backed PayTango Aims To Make Payments Work Through Biometrics | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mechanism for payment, the credit card remains just as hardy as ever. It has so far defied the threat of mobile phones, and less plausibly, QR codes, among many other forms of payment.One YC-backed startup is betting that fingerprints and other forms of biometric identification may be the payment method of the future though. Called PayTango, they’re partnering with local universities to offer a quick and easy way for students to use their fingerprints to pay instead of credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/paul-graham-picky/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Paul Graham Says Y Combinator Is Pickier Than Ever, With ‘Hardly Any’ Bad Startups In Current Batch | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the pitches kicked off at today’s Y Combinator Demo Day, partner Paul Graham said the incubator was stricter than ever when selecting the current batch — there are 47 companies demonstrating today, compared to 75 in the last session.“There are hardly any startups in this batch that are bad,” Graham said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/27/4154814/egypt-catches-divers-cutting-internet-cable" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;After service disruption, Egypt arrests three divers severing undersea internet cable | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent internet service disruption in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia may have been the result of sabotage. Egypt's coastguard has caught three divers in the act of cutting an underwater internet cable off the port of Alexandria, fueling speculation that the incident could be connected to the outages that affected operator Seacom last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148302/print-your-own-google-glass-and-look-the-part" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Print your own Google Glass and look the part | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han Solo, Honest Abe, and even Aristotle are just a few of the people who look absolutely fantastic wearing their Google Glass computers. But unless you're a deep-pocketed developer from the US, chances are nil of getting anywhere near the audacious $1,500 spectacles. So why not do the next best thing and print a pair? That's exactly what Sander Veenhof and Klasien van de Zandschulp did, whom Thomas Ricker, the author of this article, discovered in an Amsterdam cafe cheerfully muttering nonsense into their oblivious eyewear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/03/26/star_trek_series_streaming_free_on_hulu_episodes_of_tng_voyager_enterprise.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Star Trek series streaming free on Hulu: Episodes of TNG, Voyager, Enterprise, and the original that you should watch.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week Hulu is offering free access to every episode of every series of Star Trek that’s ever aired—a true bonanza for trekkers who never quite got into Enterprise or who gave up on Voyager amidst the seven season slog through the Delta Quadrant but are intrigued by (accurate!) rumors that the later seasons are better. But the merely Trek-curious may find the sheer volume of content available daunting. Where to start? Embedded on this page are 10 excellent episodes that don’t lean heavily on long plot arcs or complicated elements of the larger Trek mythos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/27/baseball-swing-technology/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;New Technology Could Engineer the Perfect Baseball Swing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if a baseball coach could truly determine what a player must do to hit the ball out of the park? New technology is underway that fuses physics and real-time data to help develop the perfect swing.The University of Michigan has been working on a small device that looks at the entire three-dimensional motion of the bat as you swing, and measures reaction time, speed and control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/27/google-glass-made-in-usa/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Google Glass will reportedly be built in America, at least initially&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That $1,500 price tag for Google Glass Explorer Edition? Perhaps it makes a bit more sense considering that US labor will be used to manufacturer it. According to unnamed sources cited by Financial Times, the first run of production-quality Glass headsets will be built in Santa Clara, California. The reason? A lot is riding on the quality of Glass, and it's likely that Google just wants to keep a close eye on every single prototype that leaves the lab. In fact, it's not exactly uncommon -- the outfit did the same for its ill-fated Nexus Q, and Apple is building some of its iMacs here in the states as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not content to let Amazon hold the limelight with its new X-Ray for TV feature unveiled this morning, Google is unveiling a similar feature for movies in the Google Play store. On an Android tablet (and sadly, only on Android tablets), when you hit pause on a movie it will automatically fill the screen with relevant info cards for the actors and music from what you're watching. The information comes from Google's Knowledge Graph, but interestingly Google isn't figuring out which cards to display based solely on the movie's metadata. Instead, it's using facial recognition on the actors and Sound Search on the music to automatically figure out what to display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of Netflix’s original series House Of Cards, the company has announced that it will release a new sci-fi TV series to the platform called Sense8.The show is being developed under the guidance of the Wachowskis, who are responsible for smash hits like the Matrix series of films, V for Vendetta, Cloud Atlas and Speed Racer, as well as J. Michael Straczynski who is the creator behind Changeling, Thor, and Babylon 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sue Gardner, who oversaw a period of rapid growth and evolution of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, said she would step down as executive director of the nonprofit foundation that runs it.In an interview on Wednesday, Ms. Gardner, 45, said she would leave in roughly six months, after the Wikimedia Foundation board had picked a successor.She said she wanted to advocate more directly on behalf of an open Internet, by starting a nonprofit group, writing a book or joining an advocacy organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 60-hour time limit forces competitors to run, climb and bushwhack for three days with little or no sleep. They endure taunts from the race director, who deliberately keeps the competition’s entry procedure a mystery. It is a race in which there are no comfort stations, and runners cannot use a GPS device or a cellphone.Less than 2 percent of the nearly 800 ultrarunners who have subjected themselves to this punishment — 12 men, the same number as have walked on the moon — have finished the race in its current iteration. The only prize is that after 100 miles, they get to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite declining desktop shipments as well as an increased interest in mobile and social games, the PC gaming market is still holding strong with a growth of 8% last year according DFC analyst David Cole, who was quoted in a recent PC Gaming Alliance (PCGA) report. (The PCGA has released excerpts from two member-exclusive papers spanning all things PC gaming, but you'll have to pay for the full copies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/26/4148628/why-doesnt-icloud-just-work" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&amp;#x27;s broken promise: why doesn&amp;#x27;t iCloud &amp;#x27;just work&amp;#x27;? | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iCloud, perhaps more than any Apple software product, is meant to "just work." When Apple introduced iCloud, it made clear its hopes to eradicate settings menus and file systems in favor of automation. Steve Jobs pledged to do a better job than he did on MobileMe, Apple’s notoriously horrible stab at web services a few years ago. With iCloud, changes you make to documents on your computer show up instantly on your iPhone and vice versa. "It just works," Jobs exclaimed when he first demoed the service in 2011. "Everything happens automatically," Jobs continued, "and it’s really easy to tie your apps into iCloud’s storage system."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/24/bees/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;What If The Google Reader Readers Just Don’t Come Back? | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If judged by my Twitter stream last week, the shutdown of Google Reader is the biggest story ever in the history of news. Of course, the reality is that Google is likely shutting down the product for a good reason: relatively few people used it, with less using it over time. More wood, fewer arrows, and all that.But that doesn’t mean this move isn’t a mistake for a couple reasons.The first is that Reader’s users, while again, relatively small in number, are hugely influential in the spread of news around the web. In a sense, Reader is the flower that allows the news bees to pollinate the social web. You know all those links you click on and re-share on Twitter and Facebook? They have to first be found somewhere, by someone. And I’d guess a lot of that discovery happens by news junkies using Reader.By killing the flower, Google could also kill the bees. That would be bad for all of us, even if we no longer use Reader or have any clue what RSS is.But the second reason worries me even more because it’s more quantifiable. By killing Reader, Google is likely to harm a lot of publishers, large and small, by eliminating a larger source of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/pipeline/8" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;5by5 | The Pipeline #8: Jason Kottke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Benjamin interviews Jason Kottke, the independent publisher of kottke.org since 1998. They discuss blogging for a living, general vs. niche blogs, content longevity, making the transition to full-time blogging, how taking a break (even for a week) can affect traffic, finding links, guest bloggers, the good and bad of comments, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.feedafever.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Fever° Red hot. Well read.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your current feed reader is full of unread items. You’re hesitant to subscribe to any more feeds because you can't keep up with your existing subs. Maybe you've even abandoned feeds altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the discontinuation of Google Reader, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our plans for NetNewsWire.First, we intend to bring sync to future versions of NetNewsWire. It's too soon to go into details about this, but you should know that we recognize how extremely important it is and that it is a top priority for us.Second, even though we've been quiet about it, we have been working on new versions of NetNewsWire for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. We have some great new features and a modern design that we can't wait to show you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;NewsFire™ (for Mac OS X)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he discovered he had run up a ?3,700 bill on his father?s credit card playing games on his iPad, Cameron Crossan expected a very stern telling off at least.The 13-year-old was mortified by what he had done ? but worse was to come. For instead of punishing him, his father filed an official police complaint effectively accusing him of fraud.Doug Crossan, 48, said he was horrified when his credit card company informed him of the amount his son had spent on the games in Apple?s online App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has acquired indoor-GPS company WifiSLAM, a sign that the war over indoor mobile location services is heating up.Apple paid around $20 million for the Silicon Valley-based company, according to a person familiar with the matter who said the deal closed recently.An Apple spokesman confirmed the deal saying the company “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” and generally doesn’t discuss its plans. He declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL) is currently experiencing one of the worst sell-offs it has faced in the last decade. In this article, I will attempt to provide many reasons why the company's growth story isn't over and why the stock should be bought at these levels. Reasons for this include that recent growth worries are likely temporary, declining margin fears are overblown and manageable to the extent they occur, new product categories are coming, and that Apple is best positioned to continue to take over new product and service categories as much of the world's gross domestic product becomes tied into the mobile Internet -- and thus transformed and disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-rolls-out-fix-password-reset-security-hole-iforgot-site-back" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple rolls out fix for password reset security hole, iForgot site back up | iMore.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s iForgot password reset page is now back online, and iMore has verified that the security hole, discovered earlier today in Apple’s password reset page, has been closed.Previously, after providing a victim’s Apple ID and date of birth, an attacker could send a URL to Apple that would change the password for that account, without needing to answer any security questions. In response, Apple blocked access to the password reset page, and a short while later took the entire site down in light of another loophole that still allowed the attack to be performed.This vulnerability came at an interesting time, just a day after Apple began to roll out its two-step verification system. Users who had already enrolled in the new system seem to have been immune from the password reset vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll look at the statistics gathered from 1300 choruses, verses, etc. of popular songs to discover the answer to a few basic questions. First we’ll look at the relative popularity of different chords based on the frequency that they appear in the chord progressions of popular music. Then we’ll begin to look at the relationship that different chords have with one another. For example, if a chord is found in a song, what can we say about the probability for what the next chord will be that comes after it?&lt;/p&gt;

They are also joined by Jory Raphael of www.sensibleworld.com and 5by5 artwork fame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nick D’Aloisio, the 17-year-old whose mobile startup Summly has been bought by Yahoo for about $30 million, talks about developing applications and his plans for the future. He speaks with Mark Barton on Bloomberg Television’s “Countdown.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify, the on-demand music service, is planning a major change.According to two sources briefed on the company's plans, Spotify intends to become an on-demand music and video service – one that would invest in original content and compete heads-on with Netflix.Ultimately, Spotify's metamorphosis would also put it into competition with content creators and providers such as HBO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57576124-93/is-spotify-gearing-up-to-take-on-netflix-not-soon/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Is Spotify gearing up to take on Netflix? Not soon | Internet &amp;amp; Media - CNET News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spotify, the largest on-demand music service with 24 million active listeners, is in the early stages of exploring a possible video service, according a person close to the company. But CEO Daniel Ek says building a Netlix competitor is not something the company is gearing up to do anytime soon."I won't rule it out because we're a company that looks at what we're doing incredibly long term," Ek said in a recent interview with CNET. "But right now, we're all focused on music."The idea of a Spotify video service came up in a report today on Business Insider. The story even suggested that Spotify would invest in creating original content, the way Netflix did with its "House of Cards" original series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/25/star-trek-logo-london/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Star Trek Logo Appears Over London Sky for Earth Hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the hype for the upcoming movie "Star Trek Into Darkness" grows, Paramount Pictures decided to heat things up even more by displaying a huge, glowing Star Trek logo over London.Displayed during Earth Hour, the rotating logo was set up with 30 LED-bearing quadrocopter drones.The logo, created by Ars Electronica Futurelab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of forcing Congresscritters to wear NASCAR-style coveralls with the logos of their financial backers has been bandied about before, but here it is in official White House petition form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter has done a great job at keeping the whole “blue badge” verification process a mystery. If curiosity eats away at you like it does me, you’re in luck. A new video from comedians Hari and Ashok Kondabolu, featuring Anil Dash who has around 500k followers, shows the magical transformation from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/on-demand-car-service-uber-finally-embraces-microsoft-with-a-new-windows-phone-app/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;On-Demand Car Service Uber Finally Embraces Microsoft With A New Windows Phone App | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks behind Uber, the on-demand car service, announced early yesterday that Windows Phone users now have a native app of their own, albeit one that doesn’t look quite as pretty as what iOS and Android users are privy to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/03/25/uk-cop-turns-in-his-son-after-apple-refuses-to-refund-app-store/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;UK cop turns in his son after Apple refuses to refund App Store spending spree | TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UK father and police officer Doug Crossan took an extreme measure when he discovered his 13-year-old-son had racked up £3,700 (USD$5600) via in-app purchases on the iOS App Store. After Apple refused to rescind the charges, Crossan decided his next best move was to report his son to the authorities for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the iPhone 5 and three new iPad models in 2012 not only raised Apple's profits to record levels, but has also helped manufacturer Foxconn to reach a all-time high $3.2 billion profit ($3.9 trillion New Taiwan dollars) during the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best Buy Co. Inc. is exiting the venture capital business.Over the past five years, the company’s venture capital unit — Best Buy Capital — had invested millions of dollars in eight early-stage start-ups with the hopes of exclusively selling new technology through its retail stores.But as new CEO Hubert Joly redirects Best Buy’s resources toward core store and online operations, the company is winding down Best Buy Capital, according to two sources with knowledge of the situation. Best Buy officials declined to comment, except to say the unit still exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India's IT outsourcers are promoting "mini CEOs" capable of running businesses on their own, while trimming down on the hordes of entry-level computer coders they normally hire as they try to squeeze more profits out of their staff.The shift by Infosys Ltd and others is symptomatic of a maturing industry that wants more revenue from its own intellectual property instead of providing only labor-intensive, lower-margin information technology and back-office services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57576176-1/maniglove-literally-puts-iphone-control-at-your-fingers/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;ManiGlove literally puts iPhone control at your fingers | Crave - CNET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we're waiting for Google Glass to reach the masses, there are plenty of other wearable technology options to keep us busy. One newcomer is the ManiGlove, an iPod and iPhone control glove raising funds on Kickstarter.The Version 1 ManiGlove looks a lot like a golfing glove, but it contains a rechargeable battery and Bluetooth for hooking up to your iPhone or iPod. Touch your thumb and different fingers together to change the volume, navigate songs, activate Siri, or control a PowerPoint presentation. Conductive pressure points trigger the commands.Originally, creator Scott Dixon thought up the glove as an easy way to control music while exercising. The glove is supposedly lightweight and breathable, so it can be worn even when you're out running and getting all hot and sweaty. The battery is good for about 15 hours on a charge, which should get you through a few marathons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a new study at Western Washington University, led by psychology professor Ira Hyman has discovered the best trick to getting that terrible song out of your head is solving puzzles -- sudoku, for example. But by far the most effective puzzle was five-letter anagrams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/25/big-moment-for-vine-as-first-wolverine-movie-footage-comes-via-6-second-tweaser-instead-of-trailer/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Big Moment For Vine As First Wolverine Movie Footage Comes Via 6-Second “Tweaser” Instead Of Trailer | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vine’s ready for its close-up. The first footage of new Marvel comics superhero film The Wolverine was released today through a Vine “tweaser” tweeted by director James Mangold. That’s a big departure from the modern tradition of first releasing a trailer on a film’s website, Apple’s trailer page and YouTube. Seems Hollywood has realized nothing leaves people wanting more like a great Vine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that every analyst we've surveyed -- even the most bullish -- believes that for the first time in a decade Apple (AAPL) will report that its income this quarter was lower than the same quarter the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Financial, the consensus EPS for fiscal Q2 2013 on Friday was $10.18, down from $12.30 in Q2 2012. The analysts we've heard from so far are even more pessimistic. Their estimates range from a low of $9.23 to a high of $10.39 for a mean EPS of $9.85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if science offered a way to stack the odds in favor of a healthy, gifted child? The idea is as thrilling as it is alarming. But how realistic is it? Last week, a widely shared story in the magazine Vice suggested it’s imminent and inevitable—just not in the hidebound United States. The article, headlined “China Is Engineering Genius Babies,” reports that our superpower frenemies in the East have hatched a grand plan to breed a crop of hyperproductive smartypants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2298089/Truman-Capotes-cremated-remains-invited-attend-Breakfast-Tiffanys-Broadway-premier.html" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Truman Capote&amp;#x27;s cremated remains invited to attend &amp;#x27;Breakfast at Tiffany&amp;#x27;s&amp;#x27; Broadway premier | Mail Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadway producers who want big stars at their premier usually want ones with a pulse. But the folks who put Truman Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's on Broadway wanted the late author's cremated remains at the play premier's after party, since Capote himself couldn't make it. They even went so far as to offer the ashes and their owner a flight from Los Angeles to New York for the show. Former wife of Johnny Carson, Joanne Carson, keeps the In Cold Blood author’s remains in the Bel Air bedroom where he died in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At long last, T-Mobile will carrying the Apple iPhone starting on April 12th. The fourth place carrier announced the news during a press event in New York on Tuesday. T-Mobile, the fourth largest carrier in the US, is the last national carrier to offer the iPhone, following behind AT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/03/os-x-app-launcher-quicksilver-ends-its-decade-long-beta/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;OS X app launcher Quicksilver ends its decade-long beta | Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of development, a shift from closed source to open source, and the advent of popular competitors like Alfred, the OS X productivity tool Quicksilver is finally leaving behind the beta tag it has been carrying around since 2003. According to the Quicksilver blog, the new release "means more than just a change in the version numbering system—it signifies a maturity of Quicksilver and a sign of what’s to come."Version 1.0.0, which supports OS X 10.6, 10.7, and 10.8 is available to download from Quicksilver's website. Quicksilver still has the same core feature set the app has always had: it allows users to quickly launch applications and open files with just a few keyboard shortcuts or mouse gestures (called "triggers" in Quicksilver-ese). The pitch for the app is very simple, but its extensive customization features and plugin library allow it to hook into many popular OS X apps, saving you the trouble of having to use your mouse to drag around and interact with the operating system. These plugins are another key focus for version 1.0.0, and the Quicksilver developers hope to be able to attract them back to the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>TOPIC: Choosing Your Forks.

This week, Dan and Merlin talk about some of the deeper and more slippery issues behind changes in our career and life.

In particular, how do we go from a vague tickle to that feeling of full-blown intolerability that can end up driving a change? Are we looking backward at what we should be doing as we slavishly catalog our many petty aggrievements? Or, do we take two giant steps back and apply a cooler eye to what we really want to do next?

Even before we find our forks in the road, how can we know a big decision might or should be coming our way? And, how do we stay current on that never-ending need to accept and plan for the changes we never could  have anticipated?

It's tough at 23, it's super-hard at 30, and, brother, is it ever murder at 50.

Sure, it's a little fruity, but, yeah: you need to write the story you really want to live. Rather than just cobbling together a flattering post-mortem on how you magically ended up where you are.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOPIC&lt;/strong&gt;: Choosing Your Forks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, Dan and Merlin talk about some of the deeper and more slippery issues behind changes in our career and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, how do we go from a vague tickle to that feeling of full-blown &lt;em&gt;intolerability&lt;/em&gt; that can end up driving a change? Are we looking backward at what we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing as we slavishly catalog our many petty aggrievements? Or, do we take two giant steps back and apply a cooler eye to what we really want to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before we find our forks in the road, how can we know a big decision might or should be coming our way? And, how do we stay current on that never-ending need to accept and plan for the changes we never could  have anticipated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's tough at 23, it's super-hard at 30, and, brother, is it ever murder at 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it's a little fruity, but, yeah: you need to write the story you really want to live. Rather than just cobbling together a flattering post-mortem on how you magically ended up where you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite its primacy in our lives, our sense of smell is often overlooked when we record our history. We tend to connect with the past visually - we look at objects displayed in a museum, photographs in a documentary, the writing in a manuscript. Sometimes we might hear a vintage speech, or touch an ancient artifact and imagine what it was like to use it. But our knowledge of the past is almost completely deodorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-dependent_memory" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;State-dependent learning - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State-dependent learning, or state-dependent memory, is the phenomenon in which the retrieval of a memory is most effective when an individual is in the same state of consciousness as it was when the memory was formed.[1] The term is typically used to describe states of consciousness induced by psychoactive drugs—most commonly, alcohol.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A transactive memory system is a mechanism through which groups collectively encode, store, and retrieve knowledge. Transactive memory was initially studied in couples and families where individuals had close relationships but was later extended to teams, larger groups, and organizations to explain how they develop a "group mind"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering is an unstable and profoundly unreliable process--it’s easy come, easy go as we learn how true memories can be obliterated, and false ones added.

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Rollins is a mind-blowing pickpocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/07/130107fa_fact_green" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Green: The Spectacular Thefts of Apollo Robbins, Pickpocket : The New Yorker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, at a Las Vegas convention for magicians, Penn Jillette, of the act Penn and Teller, was introduced to a soft-spoken young man named Apollo Robbins, who has a reputation as a pickpocket of almost supernatural ability. Jillette, who ranks pickpockets, he says, "a few notches below hypnotists on the show-biz totem pole," was holding court at a table of colleagues, and he asked Robbins for a demonstration, ready to be unimpressed. Robbins demurred, claiming that he felt uncomfortable working in front of other magicians. He pointed out that, since Jillette was wearing only shorts and a sports shirt, he wouldn?t have much to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Come on," Jillette said. "Steal something from me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock-afire_Explosion" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;The Rock-afire Explosion - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rock-afire Explosion is an animatronic robot band that played in Showbiz Pizza Place from 1980 to 1990, and in various Showbiz Pizza locations between 1990-1992 as Showbiz rebranded and the band was steadily replaced by Chuck E. Cheese characters. The show was pioneering in many respects to other animatronics shows of the early 1980s, featuring life-sized characters capable of facial expression&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Seagal#Aikido" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Seagal - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seagal moved to Japan in his late teens after he went to Japan with his father who was visiting for military purposes and met karate masters and decided to remain in Japan. He received his 1st dan degree (Shodan) under the direction of Koichi Tohei. He continued to train in aikido as a student of Seiseki Abe, Koichi Tohei (whose aikido organization, Ki Society, Seagal refused to join in favor of staying with the Aikikai), Kisaburo Osawa, Hiroshi Isoyama and the second doshu Kisshomaru Ueshiba. He attained a 7th dan degree and Shihan in aikido and became the first foreigner to operate an aikido dojo in Japan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan talks with Phil Coffman, Shlok Vaidya, Producer Robin Welch, and callers about so-called "moderate success", passion, starting out, paying your dues, making changes, the myth of job security, and finding a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan is joined by David Heinemeier Hansson, Shlok Vaidya, Producer Haddie Cooke to discuss telecommuting vs. being in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Benjamin is joined by Joel Bush, Shlok Vaidya, Tina Nikolova and producer Haddie Cooke to discuss what it means to have "four o'clock in the morning courage".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Aikido - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aikido is performed by blending with the motion of the attacker and redirecting the force of the attack rather than opposing it head-on. This requires very little physical strength, as the aikid?ka (aikido practitioner) "leads" the attacker's momentum using entering and turning movements. The techniques are completed with various throws or joint locks.[5]&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>TOPIC: Choosing Your Forks.

This week, Dan and Merlin talk about some of the deeper and more slippery issues behind changes in our career and life.

In particular, how do we go from a vague tickle to that feeling of full-blown intolerability that can end up driving a change? Are we looking backward at what we should be doing as we slavishly catalog our many petty aggrievements? Or, do we take two giant steps back and apply a cooler eye to what we really want to do next?

Even before we find our forks in the road, how can we know a big decision might or should be coming our way? And, how do we stay current on that never-ending need to accept and plan for the changes we never could  have anticipated?

It's tough at 23, it's super-hard at 30, and, brother, is it ever murder at 50.

Sure, it's a little fruity, but, yeah: you need to write the story you really want to live. Rather than just cobbling together a flattering post-mortem on how you magically ended up where you are.

      <description>Too Much Coffee Man sprang forth from the mind of then-Austinite video clerk Shannon Wheeler. He joins us to discuss his work and the nature of success, whether personal, creative, or financial. Do they have to be separate things?

We also discuss The Bible. The Shannon of 20 years ago wouldn't believe he's working on this unique adaptation/presentation of the classic text.

      <description>Developer/actor/raconteur Wiley Wiggins (Dazed and Confused, Computer Chess, Thunderbeam) joins us to talk about being on various sides of creating independent content. We discuss his passion for true adventure (and programming) above all else.

Did you know that people competed their computer chess programs against each other in the 80's? Now there's a movie about it. Did you know there are tons of free Adventure Time browser-based games available? We talk about them on the show. Ever find yourself reading a show description that asks too many questions? Oh.

&lt;p&gt;Dell’s board is looking at two surprise takeover bids from Blackstone Group and billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, reports Reuters citing sources close to the discussion. A special committee is deciding whether either proposal would trump an existing $24.4 billion buyout offer from the PC maker’s founder Michael Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake.The new bids mean that Michael Dell could potentially lose control of the company he founded in 1984 and that he and Silver Lake will most likely need to reconsider their original proposal to make it more attractive to Dell shareholders, some of whom have complained that its terms undervalue the PC maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/783178/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile’s New LTE Network Spotted Being Tested In 8 Major U.S. Cities | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While T-Mobile is more than a bit late to the LTE game, the company confirmed on Monday that their new network would be launching by the end of the month. Where it would launch, however, was kept under wraps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/24/4142082/t-mobiles-new-contract-free-pricing-plans-are-live" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&amp;#x27;s new contract-free pricing plans are live | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, T-Mobile has pulled the wraps off a new plan structure that eliminates two-year contracts altogether, part of its upcoming "Uncarrier" initiative to streamline pricing. A base price of $50 per month buys you 500MB of high-speed data (with overage-free throttled data after that), unlimited voice minutes, and unlimited texts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/21/eric-schmidt-blackberry-user" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Surprise! Google chairman Eric Schmidt uses.. a BlackBerry | Technology | guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right: Eric Schmidt uses a BlackBerry. Why? He likes the keyboard, he says. One could question why Schmidt uses a BlackBerry: there are Android phones you can buy now! which offer a keyboard. Here's the Samsung Replenish in the US - though it reminds us of another make (can't think which just now) and only runs Gingerbread 2.3 - you know, from December 2010. Still, the reviews are good. (Plenty more here: tick the "QWERTY keyboard" box under "Style" on the left margin.)What's more, he thinks that Apple's iPad mini - the "small tablet" format that Google and Amazon have both made popular through their Nexus and Kindle Fire offerings - is "too small" compared to the large-format iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/22/4135484/post-office-cant-legally-drop-saturday-mail-service-says-gao" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Post Office can&amp;#x27;t legally drop Saturday mail service, says Congressional oversight office | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Government Accountability Office (GAO), which investigates public expenditures for the US Congress, says a Post Office plan to drop Saturday mail delivery doesn't satisfy its legal obligations. In a letter, GAO General Counsel Susan Poling writes that an earlier rule requiring six-day delivery should be considered to extend into 2013, despite the Post Office's argument to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/22/jane-goodall-plagiarizing-wikipedia/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Goodall Apologizes for Plagiarizing Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an age when research is easier than ever and entire sentences can be copied and pasted without second thought, even the most venerable nonfiction writers can find themselves accused of plagiarism.That's appears to be the case with noted author and naturalist Jane Goodall, who was forced to apologize this week after a Washington Post investigation found Goodall's latest book contained more than a dozen passages copied from multiple websites, including Wikipedia.The passages all appear in Goodall's latest book, Seeds of Hope, which was cowritten by Gail Hudson, a writer and researcher who has contributed to two of Goodall's other books in the past. The passages in question range from short phrases to whole sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/rovio-opens-angry-birds-space-encounter-exhibit-after-announcing-global-theme-park-plans/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Rovio Opens Angry Birds Space Encounter Exhibit After Announcing Global Theme Park Plans | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rovio is yet again breaking into new businesses with the introduction of the first Angry Birds interactive attraction, as the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex is opening an Angry Birds Space Encounter Exhibit.The whole thing measures up to 4,500 square feet of pure Angry Birds wonder. Six stations are set up to let visitors interact with Angry Birds space-related activities and games. This is part of a slow build into Angry Birds-themed consumer attractions for Rovio, who has gone from a mobile game maker to merchandise phenom, with a newly released animated cartoon series being distributed through the games themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/22/google-alerts-dying/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Are Google Alerts Dying?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Google's killing of Google Reader, power users now have a new fear: Are Google Alerts next?Google Alerts is a service that allows users to receive email notifications of updated Google results for a search query or keyword. This lets users easily monitor an ongoing news story or be alerted of new stories mentioning a brand or individual. Google Alerts are actively used by marketers, social media managers, publicists, journalists and researchers. It's one of Google's oldest tools, and it's also one of the most useful — at least, when it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/22/kickstarter-games-pledges/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Kickstarter: $108 Million Pledged on Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since crowdfunding website and service Kickstarter launched in 2009, a staggering $108.52 million has been pledged to games projects, both video and tabletop. Of that, $90.83 million went towards successful projects — those that met their funding goal and are either already on general release or in development.On the technology side, $47.99 million has been raised by pledges for projects, while $38.33 million of that sum went to successful ventures. In both cases, Kickstarter did not claim the shortfalls.What do these figures tell us? For a start, Kickstarter does rather well as it claims a percentage of each pledge. But more importantly that crowd funding is a very good means to raise capital for a good project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/22/4135754/pepsi-attempts-to-make-its-bottle-more-iconic" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Pepsi attempts to make its bottle more iconic with first redesign in 16 years | The Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consumers probably don't think about the design of their beverage bottles, but for a company like Pepsi, it's all part of a global brand image that the company is constantly tweaking. To that end, Pepsi just unveiled a new bottle for its 16 oz. and 20 oz. beverages, the first redesign those bottles have seen in 16 years. As AdAge notes, the new design features a swirled grip — a new design cue that the company hopes it can use to make its bottle a more effective and iconic marketing tool. While a bottle's shape might sound like a mundane detail best left for designers and marketing departments departments to obsess over, the bottle can be just as effective a branding tool as the logo itself — just take a look at Coca-Cola's iconic "contour bottle" design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ewal.net/2012/09/09/slow-wake-for-macbook-pro-retina/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;quot;Fixing&amp;quot; Slow Wake for MacBook Pro w/ Retina Display - Ewal.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is actually happening is that these new MacBook Pro’s (and recent MacBook Air’s) have a new powersaving mode which Apple calls standby. Standby mode kicks in after the laptop has been in normal sleep mode for about an hour. When that happens, the contents of RAM are written to the hard drive and the RAM is powered down to further extend battery life. In theory, the laptop will last up to 30 days in standby mode. The trade off is that, when waking up, it takes a long time to reload 16 GB of RAM from the hard drive (even with SSD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if the laptop sleeps for less than an hour, then it will wake up nearly instantly. I’ve seen this myself in cases where I close the lid briefly while walking between meetings. This fact is the key to my workaround. It turns out that this 1 hour delay is configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/22/us-kodak-shutterfly-lawsuit-idUSBRE92L0Z220130322" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterfly sues to shut down Kodak photo app | Reuters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo service Shutterfly Inc has sued to shut down an Eastman Kodak Co app that lets users purchase photo albums made from pictures stored on Facebook Inc's social media network, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shutterfly bought the Kodak Gallery online photo business for $23.8 million last year, and as part of the deal Kodak agreed not to set up a duplicate business, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shutterfly said in a complaint filed on Friday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the "My Kodak Moments App" violates the sale agreement by setting up a competing business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early build of Windows Blue, the next version of Windows, has leaked online on the same day that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer celebrates his 57th birthday. Build 9364, a partner version that was originally compiled on March 15th, has been made available on file sharing sites and includes some of the new changes that Microsoft is building into its significant Windows 8 update. Leaked screenshots posted at Winforum show that the company is bringing smaller tile arrangements and even a larger desktop one to its Start Screen, along with greater control over the color personalization options, and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/03/23/apple-acquires-indoor-location-company-wifislam/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Acquires Indoor Location Company WifiSLAM - Digits - WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has acquired indoor-GPS company WifiSLAM, a sign that the war over indoor mobile location services is heating up.Apple paid around $20 million for the Silicon Valley-based company, according to a person familiar with the matter who said the deal closed recently.An Apple spokesman confirmed the deal saying the company “buys smaller technology companies from time to time” and generally doesn’t discuss its plans. He declined to comment further. WifiSLAM could not immediately be reached for comment.The two-year-old startup has developed ways for mobile apps to detect a phone user’s location in a building using Wi-Fi signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/disruptions-f-a-a-may-loosen-curbs-on-fliers-use-of-electronics/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Disruptions: F.A.A. May Loosen Curbs on Fliers&amp;#x27; Use of Electronics - NYTimes.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to people who work with an industry working group that the Federal Aviation Administration set up last year to study the use of portable electronics on planes, the agency hopes to announce by the end of this year that it will relax the rules for reading devices during takeoff and landing. The change would not include cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/20/apollo-rocket-engines-moon-bezos/2003533/" class="link" target="_blank"&gt;Apollo moon rocket engines raised from Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two giant rocket engines that launched U.S. astronauts to the moon four decades ago have been recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean off Cape Canaveral by an expedition paid for by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F-1 engines, which powered the first-stage Saturn V boosters that fell back to Earth after their fuel was depleted, were found at a depth of 14,000 feet, Bezos' expedition announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recovery, after three weeks at sea, came almost a year after his team used state-of-the-art sonar to locate a debris field of battered, rusted F-1 engines and parts that Bezos described as "gorgeous."&lt;/p&gt;
