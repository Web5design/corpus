				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was hooked on the wide streets. It was dark, the street lights were twinkling and I couldn&#8217;t see a lot.</p>
<p>But I saw the wide streets and thought of my Dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like Sydney 50 years ago. The streets are so wide, there&#8217;s no traffic and such a slow and enjoyable way of living.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_29632" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29632" alt="Lenzerheide restaurant Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lenzerheide-restaurant.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lenzerheide restaurant</p></div>
<p>My Dad comes to Adelaide every year to watch the test cricket match. &#8220;The best cricket oval in the world&#8221; so he reckons.</p>
<p>Mum is usually not far behind him. They&#8217;d live here if they could. I try to tell them to forget about their children and grandkids and follow their hearts and just move to Adelaide before it gets swallowed up like Sydney.</p>
<p>They grew up in Surry Hills, back when it wasn&#8217;t cool to live there. But to them it was. The old Sydney.</p>
<p>Already I was falling in love and I hadn&#8217;t done anything yet.</p>
<p>And then we pulled up at the <a href="www.crowneplazaadelaide.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Crowne Plaza hotel.</strong></a> The friendliest door man in the world came to greet us. I no longer felt tired from the flight. I was bouncing with energy and as a result found myself in the bar for an evening wine, free WiFi and the best hand cut hot chips I had ever eaten.</p>
<div id="attachment_29614" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29614" alt="Crowne Plaza Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Crowne-Plaza-Adelaide.jpg" width="800" height="400" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Crowne Plaza Adelaide</p></div>
<p>I seriously do love Crowne Plaza Hotels (check out our review on the <a title="Location, Location: Three Nights at Crowne Plaza Hotel, Melbourne" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/crowne-plaza-hotel-melbourne/" target="_blank"><strong>Melbourne</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.mojitomother.com/2012/03/how-to-enjoy-a-weekend-family-getaway-to-the-hunter-valley/" target="_blank"><strong>Hunter Valley</strong> </a>and <a title="10 reasons to stay at the Crowne Plaza Terrigal" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/crowne-plaza-terrigal/" target="_blank"><strong>Terrigal</strong></a> hotels &#8211; their buffet breakfast is THE BOMB!)</p>
<h2>Adelaide Central Market</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29620" alt="Adelaide Central Market" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Adelaide-Central-Market.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>South Australia is known to be a foodie’s paradise with plenty of fresh local produce and good wine. A visit to the 140 year old <a href="http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Adelaide Central Market</strong></a> in the centre of the business district was the perfect way for us to experience the culinary delights of the region.</p>
<p>The market is the largest fresh produce market in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 80 specialist stalls and the most visited tourist destination in South Australia with over 1.3 million visitors per month.</p>
<p>Wowee! The Adelaide Central Market are the best markets I have been to in Australia.</p>
<p>We were greeted by Mark Gleeson who runs the<a href="http://www.centralmarkettour.com.au/CMTHome.html" target="_blank"><strong> Adelaide Central Market food tours</strong></a>. He has been involved in the food industry for 30 years and saw an opening 10 years ago to merge that with tourism. He is passionate about sharing the journey of produce from farmer to plate and highlighting the effort of the businesses that are involved in that production.</p>
<p>We started at his own store <a href="http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/traders/providore/" target="_blank"><strong>Providore</strong></a>, a place guaranteed to skyrocket your taste buds and expand your waistline to ginormic proportions. The first sign we were in trouble came with the shops centrepiece: a towering chocolate fountain. There’s only one thing you can do with that, stick in a bucket of strawberries and munch em down. Creamy, delicious and not too sweet!</p>
<div id="attachment_29613" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29613" alt="chocolate strawberries Adelaide central market" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chocolate-strawberries-Adelaide-central-market.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yum!</p></div>
<p>There were plenty of things to sweeten your taste buds: cakes and pastries, chocolates and biscuits and variations on old Australian favourites &#8211; lovingtons, berry and choc-chip Pavlova rolls, and wagon wheels &#8211; what the cool kids had packed in their lunch boxes when I was at school.</p>
<p>I was delighted to see a huge variety of gluten free cakes and slices, something that is rare to find in Australia.</p>
<div id="attachment_29624" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29624" alt="berry and choc chip pavlova" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/berry-and-choc-chip-pavlova.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">berry and choc chip pavlova</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29612" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29612" alt="Providore Adelaide Central Market" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Providore-Adelaide-Central-Market.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Providore</p></div>
<p>We lingered a little too long at Providore and Mark had to drag us to the <strong>Lucina Italiana</strong>, the café opposite. It started with a post-war Italian immigrant family.</p>
<div id="attachment_29615" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29615" alt="Lucina Adelaide Central Market" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lucina-Adelaide-Central-Market.jpg" width="800" height="545" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lucina Cafe</p></div>
<p>The café still serves aficionados 55 years later and has seen three generations of family manage it. This Adelaide institution has now branched out into a pizza restaurant and grocery store.</p>
<p>While I was buying some Lucina  olive oil, the smell of cooking mushrooms pulled me over to the huge pot next to the serving counter.</p>
<p>“Those mushrooms smell divine. What are you making?” I asked the server stirring it.</p>
<p>“Mushroom soup. We cook it here and then package it and sell it over there.” He pointed to the line of pre-packaged soup in the fridge. “If someone walks past and wants some as I am pureeing it up, then sure I’ll sell them some right here to.”</p>
<div id="attachment_29619" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29619" alt="Lucina Cafe Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lucinda-Cafe-Adelaide.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mushroom madness</p></div>
<p>I wanted some right there. But, we had farmers to visit.</p>
<p>Mario is one of the only growers left in the market. He brings his produce 30 minutes every day from his farm to the markets. You can tell by the size and quirkiness of the fruit that this is real home grown goodness.</p>
<p>The apples are tiny, the zucchini extra-large, the avocados robust, and the quince bumpy. He has been selling fruit and veg here for over 35 years. He cut up some persimmon and nectarine for us, it was deliciously sweet.</p>
<div id="attachment_29626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29626" alt="green grocer Adelaide central market" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/green-grocer-Adelaide-central-market.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mario</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29623" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29623" alt="Adelaide Central market fruit and veg" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Adelaide-Central-market-fruit-and-veg.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh from the farm</p></div>
<p>Time was running out so we were whisked over to <a href="http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/traders/say-cheese/" target="_blank"><strong>Say Cheese</strong></a>, “The sexiest cheese store in Australia.” Mark was adamant that your search for the best cheese in Australia ended here.</p>
<p>We had to put this to the test. Lulu came on out from behind the counter and before us turned some curd into mozzarella. The Say Cheese does cheese making demonstrations from Thursday to Saturday.</p>
<div id="attachment_29628" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29628" alt="making cheese at Adelaide central market (2)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/making-cheese-at-Adelaide-central-market-2.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Start with the curd</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29629" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29629" alt="making cheese at Adelaide central market (3)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/making-cheese-at-Adelaide-central-market-3.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mix and stretch</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29630" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29630" alt="making cheese at Adelaide central market (4)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/making-cheese-at-Adelaide-central-market-4.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">roll</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29627" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29627" alt="making cheese at Adelaide central market (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/making-cheese-at-Adelaide-central-market-1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Knot if you want extra sexy</p></div>
<p>It was fascinating watching it transform from blobs to dense stringy cheese and then balls. She sliced the finished balls for each of us to try. It was still warm and dripping with water. The combination of salt and milky creaminess melted into a taste orgasm.</p>
<p><strong>It totally got the Say Cheese sexiness.</strong></p>
<p>We visited the market on Wednesday, volunteer day. This is the one day of the week the vendors do not have to be open. Thankfully a large selection of vendors still do. It was probably the best day for us to visit as Mark said on every other day you can’t move in the markets. It is elbow pushing room only.</p>
<p>I  highly recommend this tour. I loved the personal nature of meeting the vendors, trying their foods and learning more of their stories.</p>
<h2>Lenzerheide Restaurant, Hawthorn</h2>
<p>Because spending a morning sampling amazing local fare is not enough, we then moved to one of Adelaide’s most famous restaurants for lunch, <a href="http://lenzerheide.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Lenzerheide,</strong></a> in the historic neighbourhood of Hawthorn.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29633" alt="Lenzerheide restaurant" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lenzerheide-restaurant1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>The building dates back to 1891 when it was originally a doctor’s residence and surgery. Mark Gaston and his partner brought the 5 acre property in 1989 and have been operating the fine dining restaurant since. Mark is now seeing generations of families return to his restaurant again and again.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why. The food was delicious, the setting stunning, and the company great.</p>
<div id="attachment_29642" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29642" alt="LEnzerheide restaurant in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/LEnzerheide-restaurant-in-Adelaide.jpg" width="800" height="800" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for some food</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29640" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29640" alt="Hervey Bay sea scallops with dill, cream, pernod and hollaidaise gratin" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Sea-scallops.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hervey Bay sea scallops with dill, cream, pernod and hollandaise gratin</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29636" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29636" alt="barramundi fillet" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/barramundi-filletr.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Barramundi fillet</p></div>
<p>I was happy to hear much of the produce came from the markets we just visited. Mark even suggested for our challenge we could possibly go to the nearby fields and pick our own mushrooms for cooking.</p>
<p>Our lunch companions, local journalists shared stories with us as to how produce grows abundantly in the Adelaide neighbourhoods: hedges of rosemary, overladen lemon trees, and wild olive trees.</p>
<p>What I loved about the restaurant was their <a href="http://lenzerheide.com.au/notices" target="_blank"><strong>high tea</strong></a>. We sampled a few different teas, my favourite being the Jasmine Dragon Eyes, a slow unfurling white tea with subtle and fresh jasmine tones.</p>
<p>The selection of cakes and pastries were too die for.</p>
<div id="attachment_29641" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29641" alt="High tea Lenzerheide restaurant" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/High-tea-Lenzerheide-restaurant.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">High tea Lenzerheide restaurant</p></div>

<div id="attachment_29637" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29637" alt="high tea chocolates" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/high-tea-chocolates.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Maybe some chocolates?</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29639" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29639" alt="Lenzerheide high tea" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Lenzerheide-high-tea.jpg" width="800" height="454" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Can you fit anymore in?</p></div>
<h2>Toot Toot &#8211; the train is leaving Adelaide</h2>
<p>Our final visit before flying out of Adelaide was a stop at the <a href="http://www.natrailmuseum.org.au/" target="_blank"><strong>National Railway Museum</strong></a> in Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>I am not one for this sort of thing, but if you are a train or museum nut you will love it. It&#8217;s Australia&#8217;s largest railway museum and features over 100 exhibits of trains, many of which hold the title of being the biggest and best of their times.</p>
<div id="attachment_29634" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29634" alt="National railway museum Adelaide (2)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-railway-museum-Adelaide-2.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">National railway museum Adelaide</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29635" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29635" alt="National railway museum Adelaide (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/National-railway-museum-Adelaide-1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes please!</p></div>
<p>The museum is run completely by volunteers whose passion for trains is evident in the way they share the stories and history of trains on display.</p>
<p>It was only a short day stay, but I loved Adelaide. I am super keen to return and explore more of the historical neighbourhoods and beautiful architecture and sample the amazing food.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t like flying with Savannah much, (as she is a<a title="The Worst Age to Travel with Kids" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/worst-age-travel-with-kids/" target="_blank"><strong> challenging toddler)</strong></a>, but I absolutely adore watching her in the airport, especially when it comes time to board the plane.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27482" alt="Savannah in airport" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Savannah-in-airport.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>She has to be held back from charging through the passengers, rolling her suitcase along behind her. It&#8217;s a slow walk for us, if we try to speed it up by carrying her, she will throw herself on the floor in a defiant tantrum.</p>
<p>It warmed my heart to see her already displaying the traits of a professional traveller.</p>
<p>Check out the video:<br />
<object width="640" height="360" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_QXytPHsrg?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="640" height="360" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_QXytPHsrg?hl=en_GB&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p>She absolutely delighted the other passengers who watched with cameras out, broad grins and claps.</p>
<p>Thank you to the crowd of Asians following us as we exited the plane. Instead of pushing past you patiently shuffled behind laughing and cheering little Savannah on.</p>
<p>Even when I moved her to the side to give you room to walk past, you did not quicken your pace. You slowed down giggling, clapping and taking videos.</p>
<p>You allowed her a moment to exert her wilfulness and learn independence, and gave her the opportunity to feel the sense of joy that comes with mastering a new skill.</p>
<p>I’m happy our fiercely strong and independent (aka wild) daughter was able to give you a spark of joy in your day.</p>

<p>You can’t visit San Francisco without taking the ferry over to this famous island which served as a lighthouse and military site before becoming a Federal prison in 1963.

<h2>Cruising San Francisco Bay</h2>
<p>Whilst the 60 minute Bay Cruise is definitely a touristy thing to do, Cathy Sweeney still takes her out-of-town visitors because it offers great views of the city and perspectives of the Golden Gate Bridge that you can’t get any other way.</p>

<p>During his short visit Adam gave himself one priority: eat a San Francisco-style burrito. There’s a burrito restaurant in Berlin that’s famous for them, but he wanted the real thing.<br />
So he set out on a quest to find the best burrito in SF, and thanks to some suggestions he went straight for the Mission.</p>

<h2>Point Reyes National Seashore</h2>
<p>When Henry Lee&#8217;s friend suggested a trip to Point Reyes, 50km northeast of San Francisco, they had to think about the reputation of the weather, the windiest and foggiest location on the US west coast. But the sun was out and so he decided to discover this geologically diverse area.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today I caught a croc.</strong></p>
<p>I reached into the depths of its dark home, grabbed it under its neck and reefed it out wrestling with its thrashing tail on the way out.</p>
<p>You can’t come to the Northern Territory without wrestling a croc and it does not matter if it is only a 30cm baby with its mouth taped, it’s still a croc!</p>
<div id="attachment_29428" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29428" alt="baby crocodile" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/baby-croc.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">So cute</p></div>
<p>It’s still a prehistoric creature that has survived ice ages and continued to evolve as a predator to be admired and respected.</p>
<p>I also came close to its snapping jaws of death popping out air as he lurched out of the water to grab and gulp the chunk of meat I held off the stick dangling over its nose.</p>
<p>Crocodiles are a booming industry in the Top End, a growth the locals are keen to keep seeing. It’s not just for the incredible amounts of money it brings into the economy by way of jobs and tourist dollars (everyone who comes to NT wants to see a croc) but also because it helps protect the crocodiles.</p>
<div id="attachment_29431" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29431 " alt="saltwater crocodile" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/saltwater-crocodile.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Freaky</p></div>
<p>There are plenty of places in Darwin where you can visit crocs in safe enclosures, but I don’t think any of that could ever compare to seeing them in their natural habitat.</p>
<p>We saw them all the time when working on the <a title="Welcome to Kuri Bay Paspaley Pearl Farm" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/kuri-bay-paspaley-pearl-farm/" target="_blank"><strong>pearl farm in Kuri Bay</strong></a>—they are fierce, unnerving, and cunning.</p>
<p>There is something magical about a place that has danger in every corner, a heightened sense of awareness reminding you with each step that you are alive and you need to keep your wits in order to maintain that state of being.</p>
<p>It brings about a tendency to relax more into life, be in awe of it and celebrate it in slightly off-beat ways.</p>
<p>We didn’t get to see a croc in the wild on this section of our <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TQUAL" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL race to the Top End</strong></a>, nor did we get to experience much of Darwin. Most of the action happens from May to July during the dry season.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“In Darwin, it is 32 degrees every day. It’s only the varying humidity which makes it cooler or hotter.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t quote any one person as saying this as it was said by every local person we met.</p>
<p>A place with predictable daily warmth is the place for me.</p>
<p>Darwin is a thriving city thanks to the mining boom and its proximity to Asia. There are festivals, the popular <a title="6 Sunset Photos from Australia’s Top End" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/sunset-photos-from-australia/" target="_blank"><strong>Mindil Beach Markets</strong> </a>and the best pub crawl street in Australia &#8211; Mitchell Street &#8211; as declared by my brother, Stilts. I guarantee he has the market research on that one.</p>
<p>I was so lucky on this stop of the <a title="T-Qual Tick Race: Sydney and Brisbane" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL Tick Race</strong></a> to meet up with my brother and his wife Chris. They have lived in Darwin for nearly the past year and it has been that long since we have seen each other.</p>
<div id="attachment_29430" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29430" alt="Darwin harbour sunset cruise" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Darwin-harbour-sunset-cruise.jpg" width="800" height="466" /><p class="wp-caption-text">With Stilts</p></div>
<p>They joined us for our <a href="http://www.darwinharbourcruises.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Darwin Harbour sunset cruise</strong></a>. The rain decided to pour in bucket loads, which is not the typical Darwin downpour, so it meant the tropical vivid sunset would not be tonight.</p>
<p>I didn’t care I was in good company with good food and wine, and the Darwin Harbour scenery could not be faulted.</p>
<h2>Darwin FreeSpirit Resort</h2>
<p>In Darwin we stayed about 15 minutes outside the city centre at the <strong><a href="http://www.darwinfreespiritresort.com.au/?gclid=CJqm6_S3oLYCFcYipQodcUQAqA" target="_blank">Darwin FreeSpirit Resort.</a></strong></p>
<div id="attachment_29429" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29429" alt="Darwin FreeSpirit Resort" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Darwin-FreeSpirit-Resort.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Darwin FreeSpirit Resort</p></div>
<p>I loved this camping and caravan park and so do many others, it has won best caravan park in Northern Territory for 2 years running.</p>
<p>It’s set on 28 acres, can accommodate up to 1500 people, has 3 swimming pools, kids’ activities during the day, a restaurant, pub and social activities. It offers so much more than just a cabin or tent space. I love places whose emphasis is on making children happy on their holidays!</p>
<p>You know that when they are happy you can relax with a <em><strong>Mojito! (</strong></em>You can get one during happy hour 4-6pm).</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 622px"><img alt="Mojito time" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/62373_580632445288314_1391126932_n.jpg" width="612" height="612" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheers</p></div>
<p>The cabins were extremely comfortable to sleep in and I just wish I had more time to rest on the deck surrounded by rainforest.</p>
<p>But, we had more exciting things planned—we were rising earlier than the sun to hop on a small plane and fly over the <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/kakadu-national-park/" target="_blank"><strong>Kakadu National Park</strong></a> for a quick visit to <strong>Arnhem Land </strong>with <a href="http://www.venturenorth.com.au/"><strong>Venture North</strong></a> tours.</p>
<p>Craig visited Kakadu last year, and it has been on my bucket list for many years and I was beyond excited.</p>
<h2>Arnhem Land and Kakadu by air</h2>
<div id="attachment_29456" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29456" alt="Venture North flights to Arnhem Land" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Venture-North-flights-to-Arnhem-Land.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Let&#8217;s go!</p></div>
<p><strong>Arnhem Land</strong> is a highly spiritual and sacred Aboriginal area just east of Kakadu. The aboriginal people live in close connection with the land as they have always traditionally done. To visit Arnhem Land you need a special permit and it is what would be considered one of the most off the beaten path experiences in Australia.</p>
<p>It was a rainy morning and there was a small chance we would not be able to go. We waited patiently at the airport for the weather to pass and get the clearance.</p>
<p>Our pilot, Roland soon poked his head around the door with a smile <em>“Are you ready girls? Let’s go!”</em></p>
<div id="attachment_29455" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29455" alt="small plane flights (2)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/small-plane-flights-2.jpg" width="800" height="477" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo shoot fun with<a href="http://abeachcottage.com"><strong>A Beach Cottage</strong></a>, <strong><a href="http://mummysmiles.com" target="_blank">Mummy Smiles </a></strong>and Rowland our pilot</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29454" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29454" alt="small plane flights (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/small-plane-flights-1.jpg" width="800" height="551" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Such great fun</p></div>
<p>The delay meant that our 2 hour tour was scaled back to an hour, but even at such a short amount of time it was worth it.</p>
<p>The seven seater aircraft flew under the low-lying clouds for views of Kakadu and the Adelaide River which from above looked like a slow moving sidewinder.</p>
<div id="attachment_29453" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29453" alt="Darwin coastline" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Darwin.jpg" width="600" height="771" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Darwin coastline</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29432" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29432" alt="Adelaide River Kakadu (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-River-Kakadu-1.jpg" width="800" height="463" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Adelaide River</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29449" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29449" alt="Arnhem Land (16)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-16.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Flying altitude</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29433" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 410px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29433" alt="Adelaide River Kakadu (2)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-River-Kakadu-2.jpg" width="400" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Like a sidewinder</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29450" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29450" alt="Arnhem Land (17)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-17.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">We followed the river down low</p></div>
<p>“This is the best time to visit this area,” our pilot told us.</p>
<p>Even though it was the wet season and many roads impassable it meant the land was lush and green and the waterfalls, that could be reached, were flowing fully.</p>
<p>There was stillness in Arnhem Land that spoke of sacredness. The stories of the escarpment, the trees and animals soon began to speak in whispered tones.</p>
<p>I felt welcome and blessed.</p>
<p>Our Aboriginal guide, Gary greeted us with a shy smile and a softly spoken voice. He shared with us stories of the Dog dreaming, which is how his people came to live in Gunbalanya, this area of Arnhem Land.</p>
<div id="attachment_29442" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29442" alt="Arnhem Land (9)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-9.jpg" width="800" height="479" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Our guide Gary&#8211; a beautiful soul</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29434" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29434" alt="Arnhem Land (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-1.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Stunning Arnhem Land</p></div>

<p>If you look at the rock below you will see the three legs of the injured dingo. This is where the Dingo, the ancestor of the local people came to rest after she was injured and could walk no further. It&#8217;s a very spiritual place.</p>
<div id="attachment_29447" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29447" alt="Arnhem Land (14)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-14.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dog Dreaming&#8211; the resting place of the Dingo which is how Gunbalanya began</p></div>

<div id="attachment_29440" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29440" alt="Arnhem Land (7)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-7.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Purity</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29457" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29457" alt="wetland wildflowers" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wetland-wildflowers.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Wildflowers</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29437" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29437" alt="Arnhem Land (4)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-4.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">So beautiful</p></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29441" alt="Arnhem Land (8)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-8.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>We stopped at significant spiritual places along the way, the most special being the small waterhole where he would often swim as a child.</p>
<p>It is his spirit’s resting place. Wherever he goes in the world he knows his spirit will always return to this place to rest.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have ever seen a place of such purity. The water looked as if it had never been touched: you could see right through to the bottom and the brightness of the ferns surrounding it made it look jade green. A small waterfall gushed over the rocks into the pool. The water so fresh you could drink it.</p>
<p>Gary invited each of us to crouch down in front of him. He scooped up water and rested his hands on our head, praying in his local dialect. He gathered a large amount of water in his mouth and then sprayed it over our heads and then throwing his hands wide he completed the blessing.</p>
<p>I didn’t need to understand. I felt the power and purity of his spirit transferred with the water.</p>
<p>It was beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_29444" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29444" alt="Arnhem Land (11)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-11.jpg" width="600" height="795" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The blessing</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29445" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29445" alt="Arnhem Land (12)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Arnhem-Land-12.jpg" width="800" height="510" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The water spray</p></div>

<p>I wished we could have stayed to learn and explore more. Gary invited us back one day to hear more of his stories. The Aboriginal culture is based upon stories that are passed down from generation to explain life and how we all fit together.</p>
<p>“I don’t have many stories to share” one of the members of our group said to Gary. He smiled in disbelief. “Everyone has stories you just have to give birth to them.”</p>
<p>Gary I will be back to this land that few Australians know about, nor will ever make an effort to visit, which is great as it will preserve its sacredness for millions of years more.</p>
<p>I felt sadness that in the Western world we have so lost touch with our spiritual connections to the land and each other. I hope that as Gary’s spirit always finds its way back to the watering hole, we will also one day find our way back to our spiritual source and use that as a way to connect deeply to land and people.</p>

<h3>How can something so old be so beautiful?</h3>
<p>I mean, at 110 million years old the <strong>Daintree Rainforest</strong> is pretty damn old, and possibly the oldest existing rainforest in the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m about to hit the big FOUR ZERO this year and feeling a little tattered, and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s taken me this long to visit Tropical North Queensland.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re talking about not just one, but two <strong>World Heritage Listed</strong> sites smack bang against each other, well that&#8217;s a nature lovers paradise.</p>
<p>The Daintree Rainforest and <strong>Cape Tribulation &#8211; </strong>a headland located within Daintree National Park &#8211; look anything but tattered and old.</p>
<p>As a I sat quietly in my kayak a few hundred metres off-shore gazing back at the only place in the world where two World Heritage areas meet, all I could think of was beauty, serenity and being <strong>privileged. </strong>Privileged to be at the very spot where</p>
<blockquote><p>World Heritage Listed <strong>Daintree Rainforest</strong> meets the World Heritage Listed <strong>Great Barrier Reef.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I knew I was going to enjoy this day. The drive from the nearby town of Port Douglas in to the Daintree Rainfrest was breathtaking as we passed overlooks and wound our way through the stunning rainforest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-21/" rel="attachment wp-att-29391"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29391" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-21.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The other thing that got me excited was meeting Pete, my guide for the kayaking trip. Pete has called Tropical North Queensland home for the past 15 years since relocating from his birth place in New Zealand &#8211; yeah another one &#8211; and his enthusiasm for this place was infectious!</p>
<p>Previous to starting his Kayaking adventure company, Pete was a chef, dive instructor and jungle surfing instructor, all within the Tropical North Queensland region. He&#8217;s an outdoor lover and his passion comes across naturally.</p>
<p>First things first was putting on our &#8220;stinger suits&#8221; for protection against the box jelly fish who make these pristine waters home. I then grabbed my single kayak whilst Pete and Chelsea, my guide from Port Douglas Tourism, chose the double and we made our way to the waters edge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-29403"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29403" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-tribulation.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>With Pete leading the way, our initial goal was spotting turtles that inhabited the reefs close to shore. We spotted them but you had to be quick with your camera, which I wasn&#8217;t, as the cheeky buggers broke the surface then swam away out of site.</p>
<p>We paddled slowly further off-shore, stopping numerous times to just float around and take in the beauty and peacefulness of the place. I was snapping a ton of photos but every so often reminded myself to put the camera down and just take it all in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-23/" rel="attachment wp-att-29393"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29393" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-23.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-24/" rel="attachment wp-att-29394"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29394" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-24.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-25/" rel="attachment wp-att-29395"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29395" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-tribulation-25.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Pete being the hospitable guy that he is, even had chocolate cake on-board his kayak for morning tea, and I never say no to cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-26/" rel="attachment wp-att-29396"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29396" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-26.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-20/" rel="attachment wp-att-29388"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29388" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-20.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The stroke rate of our paddles increased again as we headed towards the point of the headland in search of the resident <strong>dugong</strong> who apparently likes this coastal habitat and is dependent upon sea-grasses that exist in the Cape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-8/" rel="attachment wp-att-29373"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29373" alt="Cape Tribulation 8" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-8-.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-9/" rel="attachment wp-att-29374"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29374" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-9.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><b></b>Under instructions from Pete, we then floated quietly in an area he had spotted them previously. We waited patiently for the not-so-attractive dugong to poke its head above water for air. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t see one, but Pete was adamant one surfaced a little way off in the distance, again you have to be quick with the camera.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the point, we paddled alongside the rocks and up close to the mangroves before rounding the bend and heading towards <strong>Cape Tribulation Beach. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-10/" rel="attachment wp-att-29377"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29377" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-10.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-29378"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29378" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-12.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-13/" rel="attachment wp-att-29379"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29379" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-13.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-14/" rel="attachment wp-att-29380"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29380" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-14.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>At this point all I wanted to do was jump in and have a swim. The beach was empty well, almost, and the water incredibly clear and inviting. Compared to a lot of famous tourist destinations along coastal Queensland, Cape Tribulation is still an off the beaten track destination.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-16/" rel="attachment wp-att-29381"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29381" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-16.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/img_3684/" rel="attachment wp-att-29382"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29382" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3684.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>But the risks of swimming at this time of year are too great so we settled for standing up in knee deep water protected by our &#8220;stinger suits&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the way back we paddled over another reef section and it was here we got a visit from a few stingrays. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, where are the pics, unfortunately I missed out again but have the memory forever etched in my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation/" rel="attachment wp-att-29383"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29383" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-17/" rel="attachment wp-att-29384"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29384" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-17.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout our three hour morning paddle, Pete enthusiastically shared his future plans for his 20km kayak adventure tour, his 5 day epic kayaking tour supported by both boat and car on land, as well as his kayak and fishing combo tours.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want this tour to end, and I couldn&#8217;t think of a better way to experience this amazing tropical environment and the ancient Daintree Rainforest.</p>
<p><strong>Sea kayaking </strong>allows you to take in the natural beauty<strong> </strong>from a completely different perspective, seeing the amazing marine life, fringing coral reefs and World Heritage Daintree National Park.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first leg of our T-Qual Tick Race started with a spectacular morning on <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/category/destinations/oceania/australia-places/nsw-australia-places/sydney/" target="_blank"><strong>Sydney Harbour.</strong></a></p>
<p>Waking up to the sun quietly rising over the world&#8217;s most beautiful harbour (Yes I am calling it) is almost the perfect way to start any day.</p>
<div id="attachment_29318" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/sydney-harbour-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-29318"><img class="size-full wp-image-29318" alt="Good Morning Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sydney-Harbour1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Good Morning Sydney</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.mirvachotels.com/pullman-quay-grand-sydney-harbour/" target="_blank"><strong>Pullman Quay Grand</strong></a> is where we spent our first night of the adventure. The hotel is T-QUAL accredited and has an awesome location right on the harbour. It was also only a few doors down from where we were kicking off the event at Aria Restaurant.</p>
<div id="attachment_29319" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/pullman-quay-grand-sydney-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29319"><img class="size-full wp-image-29319" alt="Pullman Quay Grand Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pullman-Quay-Grand-Sydney1.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pullman Quay Grand Sydney</p></div>
<h2>The T-QUAL Tick Race</h2>
<p>Joining me in the race is the lovely Sarah from <a href="http://www.abeachcottage.com/" target="_blank"><strong>A Beach Cottage</strong></a> and Nat from <a href="http://www.mummysmiles.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mummy Smiles</strong></a>. Lauren E.P Bath, <a href="http://instagram.com/laurenepbath/" target="_blank"><strong>instagramming extraordinaire</strong></a> was also joining us as the official photographer. (Instagram #TQUAL)</p>
<div id="attachment_29303" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29303" alt="T-QUAL Tick team" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Lauren_Caz_Matt-Moran_Craig-Davidson_Sarah_Natalie.jpg" width="800" height="614" /><p class="wp-caption-text">With Matt Moran and Craig Davidson from Tourism Australia</p></div>
<p>We were all excited, although a little nervous about what lay ahead of us for the next three days.</p>
<p>The T-Qual Race is a big mystery to us. We participate in challenges and only find out what the next event and location is with a clue at the end of each challenge. Points are given to those who guess the clue first and win the challenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TQUAL" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL initiative</strong></a> is perfect for those time strapped travellers who want to have amazing experiences yet don’t have time to research them. Travellers can be assured that Australian tourism businesses that carry the T-QUAL tick have gone through rigorous accreditation to ensure they are quality.</p>
<h2>Day 1 &#8211; Sydney</h2>
<h2>Media Launch at Aria Restaurant with Matt Moran</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Creating a tuna sashimi dish</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ariarestaurant.com" target="_blank"><strong>Aria&#8217;s</strong></a> is owned by celebrity chef Matt Moran. Kalyra was most excited to hear that I would be preparing one of Matt&#8217;s dishes and he would be judging it!</p>
<p>I am really glad that it was simply copying his design of the dish rather than actually cooking something or I would have been out at the first stir.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Cooking with Matt Moran" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/6704_579561715395387_1837443060_n.jpg" width="639" height="960" /></p>
<p>Not really knowing what I was doing, I relied on the power of flowers to pretty something up. All three plates were very similar and I was shocked when Matt judged mine the winner by a thin whisker.</p>
<h2>Lunch &#8211; Mickey&#8217;s Cafe, Oxford St Paddington</h2>
<p>On the much quieter, trendier side to Oxford St is <a href="http://www.mickyscafe.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mickey&#8217;s Cafe</strong></a>, a funky and comfortable cafe to while a way a few hours. We didn&#8217;t have that much time, but enough to enjoy a delicious crispy skin salmon with green vegetables and freshly squeezed juice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/micekys-cafe-paddington-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29320"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29320" alt="Micekys-cafe-paddington" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Micekys-cafe-paddington1.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Mickey’s is well known for their pizzas, thick shakes and cappuccinos. The menu here offers a range from Mexican to burgers, salads and mains. Gluten-free and vegetarians are well catered for. Highly recommend it as a place to eat on your travels to Sydney.</p>
<h2>Kayaking on Sydney Harbour with Life&#8217;s an Adventure</h2>
<p><strong> Challenge:</strong> Best GoPro photo</p>
<p>The perfect afternoon for kayaking on the world’s most beautiful harbour.</p>
<p>I have kayaked before on Middle Harbour, but this time we set adrift from Elizabeth Bay on the south side of the harbour .This is the area where the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race starts and there are many touring options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/photo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29321"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29321" alt="photo" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo1.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>We paddled out to Clarke’s island. The tide was too low for us to disembark and investigate the tiny harbour island, instead we circumnavigated it, and took some great harbour photos from the kayak.</p>
<p>I felt incredibly vulnerably sitting so close to the surface of this immense body of water, but it was exhilarating.</p>

<h3>“Isn’t this so beautiful?”</h3>
<p>Mike, our guide and owner of the company enthusiastically repeated this question throughout our tour. His enthusiasm was contagious. “The water is so calming, you just come out here and any bad day you may have been having is just wiped away.” I couldn’t imagine how you could have a bad thought out here.</p>
<p>When we received our next clue, it took me two seconds to yell:</p>
<h2>Barbecue at Sydney YHA the Rocks</h2>
<div id="attachment_29274" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29274" alt="Sydney YHA Dig" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Snapseed.jpg" width="800" height="800" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The great dig Photo: Lauren EP Bath</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Challenge: Dig out the clue from the YHA&#8217;s archeological site</strong></p>
<p>My favourite recommendation for <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-sydney-2/" target="_blank"><strong>places to stay in Sydney</strong></a>. Visiting again verified for me what a cracker of a place this is to stay. Best location, awesome harbour views, modern amenities all with hostel prices. You can’t beat it.</p>
<p>We had a little archaeological dig for our next clue and headed to the rooftop for a bbq, some wine and magnificent sunset views.</p>

<p>The evening wasn’t finished with us yet. Nothing real exciting to report just a flight to Brisbane and a transfer to the Quest Ipswich.</p>
<h2>DAY 2 &#8211; Brisbane</h2>
<h2>Hot Air Ballooning over Fassifern Valley with Floating Images</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Most likes on a photo uploaded to Facebook</p>
<p>I don’t really like being ready for lift off at 5:30am, but once I was soaring above the Fassifern Valley serenely welcoming the day I was happy I was forced out of bed so early.</p>
<p>The sun gently rose above the clouds shrouding the valley and the nearby D’Aguilar Ranges in mist. It was so beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29304" alt="Hor air ballooning Brisbane" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4786.jpg" width="800" height="533" /> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29305" alt="Fassifern Valley Ipswich balloon ride" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4804.jpg" width="800" height="533" /> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29306" alt="Fassifern Valley Ipswich balloon ride" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4842.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Coming in slowly to land, when you are just high enough to to be on level with the trees and mountains is my favourite part.</p>
<p>The earth looks greener and fuller. You can see the cows being mustered and the kangaroos bouncing around the farm paddocks so much clearer. It is also a little thrilling as you glide over the treetops and land with a gentle thud to the ground and a shaky baby roller coaster ride when the basket drags to a holt along the grass.</p>
<p>Grahame, pilot and owner of <a href="http://www.floatingimages.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Floating Images</strong></a> made the experience even more enjoyable with his knowledge of the local area and his gentle, humorous spirit.</p>
<h2>Novotel Lunch and Accommodation</h2>
<p>I really loved the funky decor of the <a href="http://novotelbrisbane.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Novotel Brisbane</strong></a> and that they have a channel on the TV dedicated to yoga workouts! The staff here could easily win the award for happiest and friendliest service in Brisbane, I was so impressed.</p>
<div id="attachment_29325" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/novotel-brisbane-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29325"><img class=" wp-image-29325" alt="Novotel-Brisbane" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Novotel-Brisbane1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Funky rooms</p></div>
<p>We filled our energy reserves with a delicious 3 course lunch before rolling out to abseil the cliffs at Kangaroo Point.</p>
<div id="attachment_29326" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/novotel-lunch-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29326"><img class="size-full wp-image-29326" alt="Yum" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Novotel-Lunch1.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yum</p></div>
<h2>Abseling at Kangaroo Point with Riverlife Adventures</h2>
<div id="attachment_29327" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/img_4915-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29327"><img class="size-full wp-image-29327" alt="Scary!" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_49151.jpg" width="600" height="986" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scary!</p></div>
<p>One of the best things about today was discovering Kangaroo Point, a tranquil area by the Brisbane River. There are plenty of activities here to do like cycling, kayaking or boardwalk river walking.</p>
<p>We opted for the adventurous abseiling with <a href="http://www.riverlife.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Riverlife Adventure Centre</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The sheer cliff face is about 15 metres high and I found myself frozen at the edge of it. Terror engulfed me, which is highly unlike me. I was so pleased to have a supportive guide and encouraging friends convincing me that I could do it. As soon as I took those first few steps over the edge, the fear evaporated and I really loved it.</p>

<h2>Dinner at Aria in Brisbane</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29333" alt="with Matt Moran" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Matt-Moran.jpg" width="640" height="428" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Day 2 finished full circle with an amazing dinner at <a href="http://www.ariarestaurant.com" target="_blank"><strong>Aria restaurant</strong></a> in Brisbane. We had an awesome surprise with Matt Moran flying up from Sydney to join us.</p>
<p>We had an enjoyable evening sharing travel stories with media representatives and learning about Matt&#8217;s success as a chef and TV personality. The views of the Brisbane River with the Story Bridge provided a perfect backdrop to the evening and gave us an insight into the elegant, yet casual atmosphere of this city.</p>
<p>The food was outstanding &#8212; possibly the finest dining I have ever experienced.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our favourite ways of discovering a new area is via tips from talking with the locals.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://bit.ly/BTSTassie" target="_blank"><strong>behind the scenery campaign</strong> </a>visit to Tasmania was all about finding the hidden spots the locals love.</p>
<p>There is only so much a guidebook can tell you, and usually they are handy pieces of information on the must see attractions, which is great.</p>
<p>But, we love to dig a little deeper to get to the heart of a place.</p>
<h3>Where are the locals going and why?</h3>
<p>Recently we had a fabulous 4 day trip to Launceston and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>We had a couple of well-known places planned to visit, but the rest we were leaving to suggestions by the locals &#8211; which we know now to be the best way to discover Tasmania.</p>
<p>Besides getting great tips, this is also a fantastic way to learn more about the local culture.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: using this strategy can be fraught with time danger, especially when the local people are as friendly as they are in Tassie. There were several places on our itinerary we did not quite get to because we chatted with the local people for so long.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great delay to have and one of the reasons we fell in love with Tasmania &#8211; the people are so bloody nice! And they excel at local tips.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the places to visit suggested by the locals:</strong></p>
<h2>The Cataract Gorge</h2>
<p>We arrived in Launceston and went straight to the <em><strong>Cataract Gorge &#8211; </strong></em>a must see destination. (We&#8217;ll have a separate post for you on the Cataract coming soon). For this post though we want to focus on the other places to visit suggested by the locals.</p>
<div id="attachment_29091" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29091" alt="Cataract Gorge Launceston" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cataract-Gorge-Launceston.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cataract Gorge</p></div>
<p>Firstly, we want to introduce you to Michael and his wife, Sarah.</p>
<p>We were finishing up a delicious breakfast at the Basin Cafe and ready to do a gorge walk when we started chatting to this friendly couple. They have been living in Tasmania for a few years and had the following amazing tips:</p>
<h2>The Tamar Island Wetlands Walk</h2>
<p>Our friend Christina also recommended this quiet reserve only 10 minutes drive north of Launceston. We knew 7:30am would be the perfect way to start the morning with a 3km return walk through the wetlands to Tamar Island.</p>
<div id="attachment_29232" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0181-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29232"><img class="size-full wp-image-29232" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_01811.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise over the wetlands</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s best to arrive at dawn or dusk when barely another soul can be seen. A boardwalk extends over swamps and crosses the river to two islets and then Tamar Island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29095" alt="Tamar Valley Wetlands" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_02221.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29094" alt="Beautiful wetlands" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0212.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>There is an abundance of bird life swopping amongst the reeds towering above your head; perched on the wooden bridges, flying off one by one as you approach; and playing in the rivers.</p>

<h2>Josef Chromy Vineyard</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Without a doubt the best winery in Launceston&#8221;</em> Michael cried. <em>&#8220;The views are spectacular and the food and wine world-class.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>He was not wrong.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.josefchromy.com.au/" target="_blank">Josef Chromy Wines </a>began in 2007 and in that short time it has amassed over 14 trophies and 170 medals which makes it one of the most successful launches in the history of the Tasmanian wine industry.</p>
<p>It also has gorgeous views over the lake and vineyards appreciated from either the outside deck of the restaurant, or from behind the full length glass windows. I also really loved the wrap around verandah next to the gardens where you can have bar snacks or a glass of their finest.</p>
<div id="attachment_29207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3530/" rel="attachment wp-att-29207"><img class=" wp-image-29207" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3530.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">stunning lake views over to the vineyards</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3539/" rel="attachment wp-att-29208"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29208" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3539.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The restaurant menu is intended to showcase the local Tasmanian produce. Our risotto with squid ink and salmon fish cakes washed down with a smooth pinot noir did just that.</p>
<div id="attachment_29209" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3543/" rel="attachment wp-att-29209"><img class="size-full wp-image-29209" alt="Discover Tasmani" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3543.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Risotto with squid ink and salmon</p></div>
<p>The restaurant is smart and contemporary. It is a little on the pricey side, but if you are looking for an experience that is a little classier Chromy&#8217;s would be the place to go. They frequently have<strong> jazz on the lawn</strong> days as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3546/" rel="attachment wp-att-29210"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29210" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3546.jpg" width="600" height="871" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3544/" rel="attachment wp-att-29214"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29214" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3544.jpg" width="800" height="560" /></a></p>
<p>The cellar door is located in the estates original 1880s homestead, surrounded by an expanse of established landscaped gardens making it an idyllic place to while away the hours.</p>
<p><strong>Getting There:</strong> Josef Chromy Wines is located at 370 Relbia Road, Relbia, 10 minutes south of Launceston, not far from the airport.</p>
<h2>Evandale</h2>
<p>We could not make the Sunday morning markets in Evandale &#8211; the home run event &#8211; but Michael and his wife&#8217;s enthusiasm for this <strong>&#8220;<em>Best town in Launceston&#8221;</em> </strong>convinced us to at least pass through for coffee and cake.</p>
<p>You arrive in Evandale and feel as if the clock has been wound back 100 years.</p>
<p>Evandale is a<strong> National Trust classified Georgian village.</strong> It&#8217;s unspoiled heritage buildings make it a popular place for tourists. Clarendon House, just outside of the village, is said to be one of Australia&#8217;s greatest Georgian houses.</p>
<p>We devoured a gluten-free rhubarb crumble at the <strong>Ingleside licensed bakery cafe</strong> located inside the old Council chambers built in 1867. There is a pretty courtyard bursting with flowers or, in the winter, a cozy roaring fire.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0553/" rel="attachment wp-att-29215"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29215" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0553.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_29216" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0568/" rel="attachment wp-att-29216"><img class=" wp-image-29216" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0568.jpg" width="800" height="505" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">gluten-free rhubarb crumble</p></div>

<p>I wish we had more time to enjoy a cold beverage in the beer garden of the historic Clarendon Hotel. Next time!</p>
<h2>Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm Cafe</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/yTravelBlog/posts/571669676184591" target="_blank">When we asked our facebook fans</a> prior to leaving for tips on things to see and do, quite a few of them recommended the <a href="http://www.raspberryfarmcafe.com/home_cafe.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Farm Cafe</a> and said we must go there. So we did and gorged ourselves on chocolate and raspberry mud cake, lemon tarts and scones.</p>
<div id="attachment_29102" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29102" alt="Mud cake with Raspberries at the Raspberry Farm Launceston" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mud-cake-with-Raspberries-at-the-Raspberry-Farm-Launceston.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mud cake with Raspberries at the Raspberry Farm Launceston</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29069" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0284/" rel="attachment wp-att-29069"><img class=" wp-image-29069" alt="IMG_0284" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0284.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">lemon tarts and scones</p></div>
<p>Craig dared to try a raspberry latte and I had a refreshing raspberry and mint iced tea.</p>
<p>The stone and timber café overlooks lush green lawns running down to a lake filled with water lilies. The garden features native trees and a herb garden overlooking the raspberry canes in the distance.</p>
<div id="attachment_29101" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29101" alt="Raspberry Farm Launceston Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0293.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Raspberry Farm Cafe</p></div>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to grab a choc dipped raspberry on your way out &#8211; they melt in your mouth, finished with a silky hit of raspberry.</p>
<h2>Tips Discovered in the Tamar Valley</h2>
<p>We were staying our first night in the Tamar Valley at <a href="http://www.rosevears.com.au/" target="_blank">Rosevears Retreat</a>.</p>
<p>The Tamar Valley is a wine region only 10 minutes drive north of Launceston and is known (secretly) to be one of the best wine regions in Australia. The cool climate is perfect for producing high quality elegant wines.</p>
<p>Exploring the Tamar Valley was definitely the highlight of our Tasmanian trip.</p>
<p>Our guide book told us <a href="http://kreglingerwineestates.com/products/ninth-island/" target="_blank">The Ninth Island Winery</a> had extraordinary views, and as it was the first winery we came to on the drive out from Launceston we decided to pull in.</p>
<div id="attachment_29079" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3052/" rel="attachment wp-att-29079"><img class=" wp-image-29079" alt="IMG_3052" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3052.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">views from the Ninth Island Winery</p></div>
<h2>Meeting Jeremy from the Ninth Island Winery</h2>
<p>The guidebook was not wrong about the <em>achingly beautiful</em> views. The vineyard caught a cool breeze from the river; exactly what we needed on this rare hot day. The breeze also cools down the grapes helping to <strong><em>percol</em> </strong>their sweetness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0051-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29242"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29242" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_00511.jpg" width="600" height="830" /></a></p>
<p>It was perfect for wine tasting and for a lively conversation with Jeremy, our wine connoisseur. He loves to make up words like <em><strong>percol</strong></em>, and give strange palate cleansing tips such as put a grape in your tea or coffee and then eat it once the drink has finished for a taste explosion.</p>
<p><strong>As you can tell Jeremy was great fun.</strong></p>
<p>He brought us a range of wines to taste from Ninth Island and Pipers Brook, a winery further north owned by the same people. Jeremy helped us to distinguish the taste differences and why they were like that. After much discussion, we decided to purchase a bottle of the pinot gris to bring home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0068/" rel="attachment wp-att-29219"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29219" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0068.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy convinced us &#8211; despite being full &#8211; that the <a href="http://www.ilk-cafe.com/" target="_blank">Ilk Cafe</a> down the road had to be our next stop for a bite to eat.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;One of the best cafes in the region,&#8221;</em> he declared. <em>&#8220;The chef, Sam has moved with the times and creates amazing dishes.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>Ilk Cafe and Gallery</h2>
<p><strong>OMG. The best bruschetta ever!</strong></p>
<p>We would never have stopped at the <a href="http://www.ilk-cafe.com" target="_blank">Ilk Cafe</a> if it wasn&#8217;t for Jeremy.</p>
<p>The waitress, Stephanie, was friendly and accommodating and when we told her Jeremy had sent us, she grinned broadly and said, &#8220;He&#8217;s my husband!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bruschetta, topped with roasted capsicum, pine nuts, grilled haloumi and smoked ocean trout was an explosion of flavours &#8211; very modern, healthy and made from fresh local produce.</p>

<p>The small cafe sits opposite the river on Rosevears Drive. You can sit outside and soak up the views or enjoy the homely interior.</p>
<div id="attachment_29264" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3082/" rel="attachment wp-att-29264"><img class="size-full wp-image-29264" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3082.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">views from Ilk Cafe</p></div>
<p>It was time for more wine so of course we asked Stephanie for more tips. She sent us to her favourite winery just down the road, Moores Hill.</p>
<h2>Moores Hill</h2>
<p>We arrived to <a href="http://www.mooreshill.com.au/" target="_blank">Moores Hill</a> before closing time with minutes to spare for tasting. I&#8217;m so glad we could fit it in with the lovely owner, Fiona.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0105/" rel="attachment wp-att-29239"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29239" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0105.jpg" width="800" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>Originally from Adelaide, Fiona and Lance, her wine-making husband, decided to relocate to Tassie to produce excellent slow growing wines.</p>
<p>The winemakers believe in small batch winemaking as a way of maximising complexity in the wines, allowing the vineyard to fully express itself.</p>
<p>You can see the expression in <strong>their signature label</strong>, commissioned by an artist.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0096/" rel="attachment wp-att-29228"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29228" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0096.jpg" width="800" height="590" /></a></p>
<p>I also tasted it in their lightly oaked Chardonnay. It&#8217;s brought me back to my long lost love. It&#8217;s creamy, lemony taste gave it a fresh uniqueness that rolled and soothed the taste buds. We took a bottle of that one home to enjoy from the verandah of our eco-retreat cabin, along with Tasmanian cheese, olives, dips and eggplant balls.</p>
<div id="attachment_29229" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3099/" rel="attachment wp-att-29229"><img class=" wp-image-29229" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3099.jpg" width="800" height="602" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">view from deck</p></div>
<p>Oh, and the cows singing in the fields just behind the vines added to the Tamar Valley serenity.</p>
<p>Fiona gave us the remainder of the bottle to their dessert Riesling to take home. Just enough for two glasses to wash the chocolate down with.</p>
<p>She also gave us a couple of hot tips for the following day as we were leaving. We of course had to follow them.</p>
<p><strong>Press play to hear why Fiona thinks you should visit Tasmania:<br />

<h2>Saturday Harvest Market, Launceston</h2>
<p>We find it difficult to resist a good farmer&#8217;s market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to eat well, help the local economy, and save money. This was a small one in the car park on Cimitiere St in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>The produce was fresh, local and cheap. Blueberries were the market superstars, with buckets overflowing from every second stall. We devoured some raw energy chocolate balls from the Vegan stall and tried wallaby for the first time. It is delicate and delicious.</p>
<div id="attachment_29221" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0240/" rel="attachment wp-att-29221"><img class="size-full wp-image-29221" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0240.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">raw energy chocolate balls</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29222" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0242/" rel="attachment wp-att-29222"><img class="size-full wp-image-29222" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0242.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">wallaby for sale</p></div>
<p>And guess who we saw wandering around the markets &#8211; Fiona! We were quickly becoming locals.</p>
<h2>Fresh Cafe, Launceston</h2>
<p>Fiona also recommended Fresh as a great cafe for vegetarian fare. The markets made us hungry so we headed to <a href="http://www.freshoncharles.com.au/" target="_blank">Fresh on Charles St</a> for breakfast.</p>
<div id="attachment_29223" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0243-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29223"><img class="size-full wp-image-29223" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_02431.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh Cafe</p></div>
<p>Fresh has grown since its opening in 1999. From a five table cafe to now including a restaurant, sundeck, and bar &amp; entertainment venue.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s the place all cafe bummers, musicians and writers aspire to be seen in.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_29230" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0246/" rel="attachment wp-att-29230"><img class="size-full wp-image-29230" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0246.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Good coffee</p></div>
<p>It checks off the terms cool, retro, bohemiam and funky, a place most typically found on Degraves St in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Craig went for the full veggie breakfast and I had a baked egg with chilli beans. Hearty and delicious and bursting with flavour.</p>
<div id="attachment_29224" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0247/" rel="attachment wp-att-29224"><img class="size-full wp-image-29224" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0247.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">vegie breakfast</p></div>

<h2>John Temple Gallery</h2>
<p>We were driving through the historic towns of the Great Western Tier on the way to Sheffield when our Tourism Tasmania guide sent us a text.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Westbury is the John Temple Gallery. Feel free to stop there, he is one of the best photographers in Tasmania.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We decided to stop in the gallery situated in this historical English village.</p>
<div id="attachment_29099" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29099" alt="Westbury Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0261.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Historical building Westbury</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.johntemplegallery.com.au/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>John Temple Gallery</strong> </a>is a brochure for Tasmania. Come here and your list of must see places will have a growth explosion. John&#8217;s panoramic photos showcase the stunning natural landscape of the state with a couple of other global landscape stunners like Monument Valley thrown in.</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to be wearing our camera around my neck. I just hoped he didn&#8217;t want to look at my portfolio of overexposed shots.</p>
<div id="attachment_29100" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29100 " alt="John Temple Gallery" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0267.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">John Temple and Craig at his Gallery</p></div>
<p>John shoots on slide film, without filters, and doesn&#8217;t even take many photos.<em> </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I just wait until the lighting is right.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>He told us digital has about another 20 years before it can ever compete with slide film. Wow!</p>
<p>Again our planned itinerary was cut short as we chose to continue our interesting chat with John. He told us more about his life as a photographer and the local area.</p>
<p>As we stood chatting an unassuming lady got out of her ordinary looking 4WD and walked into the local butchers across the road.</p>
<h3>&#8220;See that lady there. She was the person who developed the Frequent Flyer concept.&#8221;</h3>
<h3>&#8220;No way.&#8221;</h3>
<h3>&#8220;Oh yes. There are some fascinating people around here.&#8221;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I was not surprised.</strong></p>
<p>In less than 24 hours we had already met a diverse bunch of locals. They certainly made our first Tassie experience so enriching.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I fulfill my dream of participating in the Amazing Race &#8211; not the TV version, one that is much better than that!</p>
<p>I will be be joining the <strong>T-QUAL</strong> Tick Race, an initiative by Tourism Australia to promote the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TQUAL" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL tick &#8211; </strong></a>the Australian Government&#8217;s national symbol of tourism quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_29231" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 786px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29231" alt="T-QUAL Tick Race Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/T-QUAL-Tick-Race-Sydney.jpg" width="776" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digging for a clue</p></div>
<p>Tourism businesses that carry the T-QUAL Tick have undergone rigorous assessment to ensure they deliver quality experiences. So it saves the tourists time in researching. If they see a business with the T-QUAL Tick they know it&#8217;s good.</p>
<h3>The race has two legs: 25-28th March and 2-5 April.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating in challenges that earn points. And I&#8217;ll need to be unlocking clues along the way, so I may need your help.</p>
<p>Follow the adventure on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>facebook</strong></a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>twitter</strong></a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>instagram</strong></a> feeds and the hashtag <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>#TQUAL</strong></span></p>
<p>On this page I will be uploading a daily vlog sharing my experiences of the day and hopefully the fact that I am earning challenge points. The first one involves me cooking so I am not too confident!</p>
<p>Anyway you can see below how it all goes. Check back here daily to see the new vlog:</p>
