				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only a few weeks ago Ben Affleck mentioned the difficulty of marriage in his Oscar winning acceptance speech.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I want to thank you [Jennifer] for working on our marriage for 10 Christmases. It&#8217;s good. It is work, but the best kind of work and there&#8217;s no one I&#8217;d rather work with.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was a bizarre statement to make for the setting, but I think it was an honest look at marriage and the reality of love.</p>
<p>Marriage is tough. It’s day in day out, nose to the grind constant work. Every decision you make is centred on what is best for each other, not just for yourself-difficult, as by nature we are pretty selfish.</p>
<p>You get sick of the sacrifice and often, when you are tired, resentful, angry, frustrated and unhappy, a return to singledom looks so inviting.</p>
<p>These feelings are pretty normal.</p>
<p>Rarely are we told about the difficulties of marriage and long-term relationships and how to work through them. It’s all romance and weddings, blissfully rocking babies to sleep (ha ha ha), and happily swinging in the rocking chairs during the retirement prime. (Except for me it would be a hammock, and trust me, I’d be in it because I won the hour-long argument for shotgun rights.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_9060" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 467px"><img class="size-full wp-image-9060" alt="Tips for Couples Travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/scan00041.jpg" width="457" height="640" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Was that really 11 years ago?</p></div>
<h3>Craig and I have been married 11 years today.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have been bloody great years, but there have been moments when I thought we wouldn’t make it.</p>
<p>We’ve had financial difficulties and lifestyle constraints that have brought a lot of inner turmoil and suffering. You know the type that says <strong>run and start all over again</strong>. The statistics say that 1/3 of marriages faced with crises such as these would fall apart.</p>
<p>But we haven’t and I truly believe that the strength of our bond comes from our life of travel.</p>
<p>Travelling long-term with your partner can definitely break you, but here’s why I think often makes you instead.</p>
<h2>You learn how to put up with each other’s idiosyncrasies</h2>
<div id="attachment_17295" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 743px"><img class=" wp-image-17295 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fanpage_profile_2.png" width="733" height="414" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kookiness</p></div>
<p>I can’t stand how he <a href="http://www.mojitomother.com/2012/09/why-i-spend-20-minutes-on-the-toilet/" target="_blank"><strong>sits on a toilet for 20 minutes</strong></a> and it drives him nuts how I always leave the butter out (Yes Mum, I know it drives you crazy too).</p>
<p>Think of the mile-long list you have of things that annoy you about your partner. When you travel 24/7 there is no escaping the irritants, you just have to learn to live with them. We’ve learned to work around these annoyances and adapt to them.</p>
<p>They still drive us nuts, but not enough to take us to the divorce courts. We’ve learned to make fun of them and love each other regardless. (but really 20 minutes?)</p>
<h2>You get to know what lies at the heart of your partner</h2>
<div id="attachment_30067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30067" alt="couples travel tips" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tea-at-a-Tibetan-tea-house-in-Shrangri-la.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tea at a Tibetan tea house in Shrangri la</p></div>
<p>When you travel everything else in your life gets stripped away: possessions are stored in boxes, friendships are placed on hiatus, and expectations placed upon by others are gone.</p>
<p>For the first time in your life you can be yourself.</p>
<p>Suddenly you get to know the real heart of your partner (and that can be where relationships turn south! At least it can save you years of heartache finding out later).</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you know what lies at the core of your partner, it is difficult to not see that when you return home and go through trials and tribulations.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Everything becomes yours</h2>
<div id="attachment_30064" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30064 " alt="mud bath yangshao China" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mud-bath-yangshao-China.jpg" width="800" height="561" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Two peas in the mud bath &#8211; Vietnam</p></div>
<p>There is no longer any separation of what is mine and yours, except for your clothes and I do have a habit of wearing his UNC sweaters and spilling food on it at the worst times!</p>
<p>You now own little and life becomes about experiencing moments together. You’ve spent months planning and saving and now your combined dream is being played out.</p>
<p>You don’t have girls and guys nights out. The friendships you form along the way are now your common friends.</p>
<p>You start to morph into this one person—which can be kinda scary. But don’t fear, you don’t have to lose your identity, more like take on a second one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two souls become one and that one can be the unifying strength you need to get through any major relationship hurdles in the years to come.</p></blockquote>
<h2>You have memories to fall back on</h2>
<div id="attachment_30096" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/can-travel-strengthen-marriages-and-long-term-relationships/caz-craig-in-bryce-canyon-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-30096"><img class="size-full wp-image-30096" alt="Bryce Canyon National Park" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Caz-craig-in-Bryce-canyon.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bryce Canyon National Park</p></div>
<p>This is one of the biggest saving graces for our marriage. 11 years of travel has given us a solid memory bank to pull us through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at all we have done during our relationship. We can&#8217;t throw that away!&#8221;</p>
<p>In times of stress we can quickly recall that time we went <a title="13 Photos of Bryce Canyon NP" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/12-photos-of-bryce-canyon-np/" target="_blank"><strong>horse riding in Bryce Canyon</strong></a>, or to bring more laughter in our life the time we <a title="Riding an Ostrich: A unique form of ‘Green’ Transportation" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/riding-an-ostrich-a-unique-form-of-green-transportation/" target="_blank"><strong>rode ostriches in Africa,</strong></a> or when we just want to feel chilled, the Jack Johnson concert in the forest by the lake in Raleigh.</p>
<p>I couldn’t ever imagine the memories of incredible adventures in over 40 countries and setting up homes in 5 different countries, suddenly disappear. As we say on this blog it is all about the memories!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Travel more. Create better memories.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>You’re learn how to work through challenges together</h2>
<div id="attachment_30097" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/can-travel-strengthen-marriages-and-long-term-relationships/389143498303-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30097"><img class="size-full wp-image-30097" alt="Monument Valley, Utah" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/3891434983031.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Monument Valley, Utah</p></div>
<p>Think of most of the challenges that pop up in your life: work, family, friendships, unhappiness. A large percentage of it is individual problems where one has to help the other, it’s not often something both of you have to solve together.</p>
<p>When you are travelling the problems are yours to share. So again, you become that one person. That one mind has to be able to split to see the other’s needs, but bring it back to what is best for the one goal. How can the one mind use each other’s strength to come to the best solutions?</p>
<h2>Your lover becomes your best friend</h2>
<div id="attachment_26436" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-26436 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/things-to-do-in-phuket-5.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">cocktails by the pool &#8211; Thailand</p></div>
<p>There are not many other distractions. It’s just you and him. You have to work to keep the lover part to your relationship going, but soon enough you have more than that—a best friend.</p>
<p>People find it weird that Craig and I do almost everything together and I tell him everything. Why? He’s my best friend. I actually enjoying hanging out with him.</p>
<p>When I have a problem, Craig is the first person I turn to to help me solve it. I trust he’ll support and encourage me and give it to me straight. I know this, as for most of our marriage I have only had him to rely on. There’s a lot of strength in that trust and support.</p>
<h2>Your forced to deal with it and find the solution</h2>
<div id="attachment_6788" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 598px"><img class="size-full wp-image-6788" alt="Tips for Couples Travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rsz_africa_104.jpg" width="588" height="350" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The beginning of the meltdown</p></div>
<p>Marriage is an easy thing to get out of, 72 days after the wedding you can decide you’ve gotten to know this person too much and those irritating things are too much to bear forever!</p>
<p>There are no divorce courts you can run to when you are sitting in the tray in a pick-up truck on a dusty road in the middle of nowhere in Africa and the wheel falls off mid turn. There are no counselors to steer you past the crash collision course brought on by frustration, tiredness and budget travel fed-upness. You have to find a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>You vent, swear, pick up your backpack and storm off. And storm until the anger diminishes and you realize you don’t like trying to figure this out on your own.</p>
<p>So you both come together &#8211; volatile feelings in check &#8211; heck you might even have a bit of a giggle at your predicament.</p>
<p>You sheepishly scuff your feet in the dirt and try to work out what next. And then you erupt into fits of laughter when 10 minutes later that old rusted crumbling pick-up truck comes bumbling down the track, wheel back on and ready to pick you up and continue on your journey.  (only to break down 30 minutes later, but by this time you are cuddling again)</p>
<h2>You work together as a team</h2>
<div id="attachment_30070" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30070" alt="hiking zion national park utah" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/zion-national-park-utah.jpg" width="800" height="524" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking Angel Falls Zion NP</p></div>
<p>Strong teammates play to their strengths and support each other’s weaknesses. They inspire, encourage and motivate.</p>
<p>On our travels we have participated in many adventurous activities. We relied on each other to make it through. Craig always using his strength to help carry me over the line, protect me, and encourage me to keep pushing through. It was that same we-are-in-this-together strength that got me through childbirth twice.</p>
<p>Mentally, when things got too much, whoever was in the clearer frame of mind could bring clarity to the moment and help the other to refocus.</p>
<p>A long-term relationship will only survive if you see yourself as moving towards a common goal as a team.</p>
<h2>You’re visiting the world’s most romantic places</h2>
<div id="attachment_30063" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 727px"><img class=" wp-image-30063" alt="Namibia Soussesvlei" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namibia-Soussesvlei.jpg" width="717" height="538" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise over Soussesvlei &#8211; Namibia</p></div>
<p>Travel presents you with ample opportunities to have the romantic moments every couple needs: camping under the stars on the Great Rift escarpment in Malawi, watching sunrises on the world’s tallest sand dunes, picnicking under the Eiffel tower, or <a title="Cycling Through Yangshuo Countryside China" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cycling-through-yangshuo-countryside-china/" target="_blank"><strong>bike riding through the Yangshuo</strong></a> countryside.</p>
<p>Variety is the spice of life—you know it!</p>
<h2>You’re doing what you love</h2>
<div id="attachment_30062" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30062 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Port-Douglas.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Doing what we love together &#8211; Port Douglas, Queensland</p></div>
<p>I think I can safely assume that by travelling the world together you are both doing what you love.</p>
<p>There will be compromises and you may have to ride the odd camel to help your partner check off their bucket list, but at least you are filled with happiness to know you are helping to fill their cup.</p>
<p>Joy is a powerful glue&#8211;the most magical of all emotions.</p>
<p>Think about those joyful experiences you have had with your family and friends. The laughter of them for years to come is what holds you together. When you travel there is an overabundance of joyful emotions &#8211; that is some sticking glue!</p>
<p>I also feel safe in saying people are generally better when they travel, because they are doing what they love. They are looking after their own interests, discovering new things, learning more about themselves, exploring beautiful parts of the earth and meeting new people.</p>
<p>The wowser moments just keep coming and sharing them with you is your partner. There’s nothing better than doing what you love beside the person who is also doing what they love and together you love each other.</p>
<blockquote><p>How many loves were just in that sentence? Enough to get the picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that travelling the world with your partner could be the recipe for disaster, but so could staying at home. The recipe for a solid relationship could be building a settled life together too. But, I believe travel can build a deep foundation that will hold you steady during those rocky times.</p>
<p>We all need a firm foundation and solid steel pylons to hold the walls of the house together.</p>
<p>Happy Anniversary Craig. 11 years of 24/7 with you has been <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tough</span> wonderful.  Sure don’t ever get sick of you!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is known to have the best calamari in the world.</p>
<p>I know this because I have conducted the experiment to find out. The only other person who has come close to cooking the most divine, melt in your mouth battered calamari rings has been my sister, the Chef.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woywoyfishermenswharf.com.au/" target="_blank">Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf Woy Woy</a> is a popular place for locals and day trippers from Sydney to enjoy a seafood feast on the water.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-002.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</p></div>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29582" alt="Fisherman's Wharf Restaurant Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Restaurant-Woy-Woy.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Not only does it have the BEST calamari in the world, but from 1994 -1997 it has been said that the best cook ever.</p>
<p>Craig may vehemently disagree, but what would he know? I know it to be true because that cook was me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29547" alt="Fishermans Wharf lunch" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-lunch.jpg" width="600" height="900" />    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29581" alt="Fisherman's Wharf Restaurant Woy Woy (3)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Restaurant-Woy-Woy-3.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>Yes, just another thing you don&#8217;t know about me.</p>
<p>Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf did lend a great hand in my ability to travel the world. I worked as the aforementioned <del>chef</del> cook when I was a University student and earned a decent amount of cash to save for my travels.</p>
<p>I also worked there with a group of my friends and adored my bosses. It was one of the best jobs I ever had, even though I stunk of fish and the pub over the road smelt us long before we walked through the doors at knock off time.</p>
<p><strong>Fishos is an icon.</strong></p>
<p>During the summer months the restaurant on the deck over the water gets completely booked out over two sittings, for lunch and dinner. The lines would snake out the front into the kid&#8217;s playground as people happily waited for their take away orders, and you don&#8217;t even want to come near the Fresh seafood market section on Christmas Eve and Good Friday.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans Wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Woy-Woy.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful views</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s changed quite a bit since I worked there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s styled up with the influence of Sam Clayton, the owner&#8217;s son. He has turned it into a tapas style restaurant, still with ample seafood choices, but a little more spunk and flair in the menu. The deck has been renovated, there&#8217;s often live music and the BYO has been replaced with a huge choice of craft beers, wine and my summer travel favourite, sangria.</p>
<p>We love this new addition to the restaurant as we are not big fans of Australian mainstream beer. This gives us an opportunity to drink the good stuff at reasonable prices.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-029.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Love this beer in a bag</p></div>
<p>We visit Fishos a lot now for lunch or dinner and are never disappointed. The calamari is still smoking hot and is now in fierce competition with the BBQ Atlantic salmon salad for my order. We rarely fail to have an entree of anchovy toast either &#8211; you&#8217;ve not lived until you have eaten this.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="BBQ Atlantic Salmon salad" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-038.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">YUM!</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img alt="oysters Fishermans Wharf" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oysters-Fishermans-Wharf.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh local oysters</p></div>
<p>Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf is a popular day trip for those from Sydney. It&#8217;s a short walk from Woy Woy train station or if you have the means, a beautiful boat trip from Sydney. You can moor up at the wharf next door.</p>
<p>And when you have finished you can take a lovely walk along the waterfront to work off your indulgences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/grand-building-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29995"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29995" alt="Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Grand-Building-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-1.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>Looking for tips on <strong>things to do in Buenos Aires?</strong></p>
<p>As part of our <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/city-guide/" target="_blank"><strong>city guides</strong></a> series, we interviewed Stephanie from<a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/about/" target="_blank"><em><strong> The Travel Chica </strong></em></a>who fell in love with the city in 2009 and a short vacation and then decided to move there.</p>
<p>Stephanie shares with us her <em><strong>insider tips</strong></em> on the best things to do in Buenos Aires, plus advice on where to eat, sleep, drink, shop and explore.</p>
<h2>Why Visit Buenos Aires?</h2>
<p>The city is unlike any other I have experienced or read about.</p>
<p>There is a lot of European influence, but you definitely still get the Latin America vibe, yet the <em>porteños</em> have a distinct personality and culture. I love big cities, and in Buenos Aires, I feel that there is something (or many things) for everyone.</p>
<h2>Best Things to Do in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>Buenos Aires is a huge city, and it can be overwhelming to a traveler who wants to see and do it all (like me).</p>
<h3>My highlights include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checking out the graffiti art</strong>. Not only is the street art impressive, it is an important part of the city’s culture and history. You will easily find <strong><a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/2011/05/graffiti-art-in-buenos-aires/" target="_blank">graffiti art </a></strong>in the barrios (neighborhoods) of San Telmo and Palermo Soho. If you’re really into it, Irecommend a Graffitimundo Tour to learn more about the graffiti styles and artists.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires-graffiti-264-l/" rel="attachment wp-att-29987"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29987" alt="Things to do in Buens Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-Graffiti-264-L.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Get lost in the <strong>Recoleta Cemetery</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>See the center of politics and important historical events at the <strong>Plaza de Mayo</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy the lively <strong>San Telmo Sunday Feria</strong>. Even if you’re not into the shopping, it’s fun to see the crowds,listen to the music, watch tango, and enjoy the passion of the people.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Explore the <strong><em>Bosques de Palermo</em></strong>. If you want to get a glimpse into the lifestyle of <em>porteños</em>, the parks are where to spot them enjoying a beautiful day. The <em>Bosques de Palermo</em> is the biggest and most beautiful in the city.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Neighborhoods to Explore</h2>
<p>There are many <em>barrios </em>(neighborhoods), each with their own distinct character. For a short trip, these are the ones you have to see.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Palermo Soho</strong> is one of the trendier neighborhoods known for its restaurants and boutique shops. It is also a pleasant and pretty place for a stroll.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Recoleta is the neighborhood that gives Buenos Aires its reputation for being the “Paris of South America.”The architecture is gorgeous, and the area is packed with high end shopping, restaurants, and art galleries and museums.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>San Telmo is a charming area with narrow cobblestone streets, lots of colorful graffiti, and a mix of traditional and trendy shopping and dining.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Eat in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>As Buenos Aires becomes a more sophisticated city with a growing expat community, the selection of international cuisine keeps growing.</p>
<p>For a special experience, check out a <strong><em>puerta cerrada</em> </strong>(closed door) restaurant where excellent chefs serve creative set menus for a small group of people (reservations required) sometimes at private tables and sometimes group dining.</p>
<p>Here are of my favorite places to grab a bite or enjoy a slow meal with friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy excellent steak and excellent service at <strong><a href="http://www.parrillalacabrera.com.ar/" target="_blank">La Cabrera</a> </strong>in Palermo Soho. Be sure to order the provoleta for a starter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you’re craving Southeast Asian, the <em>puerta cerrada </em><a href="http://www.cocinasunae.com" target="_blank"><strong>Cocina Sunae</strong> </a>is both an incredible meal and a special dining experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The pizza at <strong><a href="http://www.galeriaelcuartito.com.ar/" target="_blank">El Cuartito</a></strong> is famous. Try the fugazzetta topped with onions and loads of melty cheese.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cumaná in Recoleta</strong> is a popular locals restaurant where you can get a variety of quality traditional Argentine cuisine including locro, empanadas, pizza, and picadas (meat and cheese plates). Location: Rodríguez Peña 1149</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want a truly unique dining experience (and are an adventurous eater), check out <a href="http://www.restoelbaqueano.com/" target="_blank"><strong>El Baqueano</strong>. </a> Go with the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you’re craving something sweet, <strong><a href="http://www.persicco.com/" target="_blank">Persicco</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.unaltravolta.com.ar/" target="_blank">Un ‘Altra Volta</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://moratto.com.ar/" target="_blank">Moratto</a></strong> are some of the top shops with locations throughout the city.</li>
</ul>
<h2>You Cannot Visit Without Eating?</h2>
<p>You cannot go to Buenos Aires without having an amazing steak, a great bottle (or five) of red wine, and a ¼ kilo of ice cream.</p>
<p>Other foods to try in Buenos Aires include empanadas, pizza, provoleta (baked cheese!), locro (a stew typical in the north of Argentina), and a picada (cheese and meat plate).</p>
<div id="attachment_29989" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/eat-steak-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29989"><img class="size-full wp-image-29989" alt="Eat Steak - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eat-Steak-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Amazing steak</p></div>
<h2>Where to Drink in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>Buenos Aires is a city that never sleeps, and a lot of that late-night culture is fueled by alcohol. As you would expect, there is no shortage of options no matter your poison.</p>
<p>If you love wine, you are in the right city. Argentina is known for its big reds, including Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah. The northern region is also known for its white varietal Torrontes. The wine in Argentina is very affordable, and you can find good options in any restaurant and most shops.</p>
<p>For a really special experience, schedule a tasting with <strong><a href="http://www.anuvawines.com/signup/travel-chica" target="_blank">Anuva Wines</a></strong>, which features high-quality wines from smaller bodegas.</p>
<p>Argentina is not known for its beer. The best place to have a beer is outdoors on a beautiful day. <strong>Plaza Serrano</strong> in Palermo Soho is my favorite place to have an afternoon beer. There are several bars with large outdoor patios.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for artisanal beer, a good option is <strong><a href="http://www.cervezaantares.com/" target="_blank">Antares</a></strong> in Palermo Soho.</p>
<p>I typically stick to beer or wine, but expats and locals rave about the cocktails at <strong><a href="http://www.milion.com.ar/" target="_blank">Milion</a>.</strong> The setting inside an old mansion might make the drinks taste a little better too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/drink-wine-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29991"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29991" alt="Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Drink-Wine-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Best Place For a Night on the Town</h2>
<p>Most of the touristy areas are good for a night on the town. After all, this is the city that never sleeps.</p>
<p>The top neighborhoods are San Telmo, Recoleta, and Palermo Soho. The latter is my top pick because you have many options for dinner, drinks at a casual bar, and dancing at a club until the sun rises.</p>
<p>If you’re in Buenos Aires on a Monday, you must see La Bomba de Tiempo at <strong><a href="http://www.ciudadculturalkonex.org/" target="_blank">Ciudad Cultural Konex</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re into music, there are lots of opportunities to see performances. There are small venues all over, and you will see flyers advertising shows everywhere. Be adventurous and check out something new.</p>
<h2>Where to Stay in Buenos Aires</h2>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>For budget travelers, Couchsurfing and hostels provide several affordable options in all of the central <em>barrios</em>.</p>
<p>A couple of recommended hostels are <strong><a href="http://www.hostelgiramondo.com/%20english/hostel_habitaciones.html" target="_blank">Giramondo</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.hostelpampa.com.ar/" target="_blank">Hostel Eco Pampa</a></strong> in Palermo Soho and <strong><a href="http://www.americahostel.com.ar/" target="_blank">America del Sur Hostel</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Mid-Range</h3>
<p>Good mid-range options include <strong><a href="http://www.bonitobuenosaires.com/" target="_blank">Bonito Bed &amp; Breakfast</a></strong> in San Telmo and <strong><a href="http://www.cypressin.com/" target="_blank">Cypress In</a></strong> in Palermo Soho.</p>
<h3>High-End</h3>
<p>If you want something more luxurious but still good value, consider <strong><a href="http://www.ownhotels.com/" target="_blank">Own Hotel</a></strong> in Palermo Soho or <strong><a href="http://www.casacalmahotel.com/" target="_blank">Casa Calma</a></strong> in Recoleta.</p>
<h3>Luxury</h3>
<p>Super-luxury travelers will be thrilled by world-renowned options such as the<strong><a href="http://www.alvearpalace.com/v3/eng/" target="_blank"> Alvear Palace Hotel</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://www.faenahotelanduniverse.com/" target="_blank">Faena Hotel + Universe</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>Apartments</h3>
<p>Renting an apartment can also be an affordable and more comfortable option for couples or groups. There are many apartment rental services, but be careful dealing with landlords. It is best to use a service that is well-established and provides user reviews, such as <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank"><strong>VRBO</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AirBnB</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/eat-ice-cream-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29990"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29990" alt="Eat Ice cream - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eat-Ice-cream-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<h2>Markets and Shopping</h2>
<p>There are lots of shopping opportunities in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p><strong>San Telmo</strong> is known for its antiques shops, and the <strong>Sunday Feria</strong> outdoor fair is a must-do. <strong>Palermo Soho</strong> also hosts an outdoor market with a more bohemian style at Plaza Serrano and nearby streets on weekends.</p>
<p>If you are looking for trendy, boutique shops, you will find them throughout Palermo Soho, San Telmo, and Recoleta.</p>
<p><strong>Villa Crespo</strong> (next to the Palermo neighborhood) is where to find good deals. There is an outlet shopping area on Aguirre and a small leather district on Murrillo.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind busy, crowded areas, the pedestrian street Calle Florida is a well-known shopping district where you can find nicer stores, handmade goods, and junk.</p>
<h2>Festivals and Events</h2>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://festivales.buenosaires.gob.ar/tango/festivalymundial/web/es/index.html" target="_blank">World Tango Festival</a></strong> happens in May. Although you can find tango all over the city any day of the week, the city has a special energy during this two-week festival, and you can see the finest tango dancers in the world.</p>
<p>There are too many festivals and events to list here. Pay attention to flyers and billboards around the city, and you are bound to find something big happening. Also, the website <strong><a href="http:/agendacultural.buenosaires.gob.ar/" target="_blank">Agenda Cultural</a> </strong>which lists the government-sponsored cultural events going on in the city.</p>
<h2>Getting Around?</h2>
<p>Public transport is great. You can get all over the city by using the underground <strong><a href="http://www.subte.com.ar/" target="_blank">Subte</a></strong> and local buses.</p>
<p><strong>The Subte</strong> is quite easy to figure out, even if you don’t speak Spanish. Buses are a little trickier, but hardcore independent travelers with a little Spanish can figure it out. Best tip for the bus&#8230;always have <em>monedas</em> (coins). They don&#8217;t take bills.</p>
<p>The city is very large, but it is also <strong>walkable</strong> within and between neighboring <em>barrios, </em>and it’s a fun way to check out the architecture and stumble upon a local wine bar or café.</p>
<p><strong>Taxis</strong> are plentiful and not that expensive compared to other major cities like New York or London. Just be sure you have some idea where you are going and read about common taxi scams in a guide book.</p>
<h2>Finding WiFi</h2>
<p>Yes, the city is wifi friendly and growing more so every day. If your hotel or hostel doesn’t have wifi, you shouldn’t be staying there.</p>
<p>More and more cafés and restaurants are offering wifi too. McDonalds and Starbucks are a sure bet and easy to find in the most popular <em>barrios</em>.</p>
<h2>Best Time of Year to Visit</h2>
<p>The hottest and driest months are December and January and coincide with the busiest part of the high season.</p>
<p>If you prefer moderate temperatures, don’t mind chancing some rain, and prefer smaller crowds, I suggest October, November, March, or April.</p>

<h2>Favorite Side Trip</h2>
<p>The affluent suburb of <strong><a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/2011/07/buenos-aires-day-trip-san-isidro/" target="_blank">San Isidro is a great side trip</a></strong> because it gives you a break from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires, and it is a beautiful area to stroll.</p>
<p>It is best to go on the weekend when there is an antiques and crafts fair in the main plaza.</p>
<h2>Getting There and Away</h2>
<p>The major airlines with international flights to Buenos Aires are American Airlines, Delta, Air Canada, British Airways, and Iberia.</p>
<p>If you are in Latin America and looking for flights, check out LAN, TACA, and Aerolineas Argentinas.</p>
<p>From within Argentina, there is a good network of buses. Check out <strong><a href="http://www.plataforma10.com/" target="_blank">Plataforma10</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>Best <em>Insiders Tip</em></h2>
<p><strong>Bring US dollars with you</strong> and always ask about discounts for paying in dollars. Inflation has been and continues to be rampant in Argentina, and the people still don’t trust the banks.</p>
<p>The government has placed many restrictions on locals for buying US dollars, so businesses are happy to offer large discounts to travelers in order to get a more stable currency.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paleo evangelists have a reputation of being slightly nutty in their extreme healthy living choices.</p>
<p>But, I guess we are all a little nutty when we stand up for a cause we believe in, especially one that makes us feel full of energy and good health.</p>
<p>There are things about the paleo lifestyle I like and things I’m still not too sure about. I’m not completely sold on the idea of eating little fruit, nor am I a believer that a diet heavily focused on meat protein is good either.</p>
<p>The idea that paleo is founded on a caveman diet unsettles me; there is a thing called evolution. I no longer see men hunting, unless they are at the local nightclub on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>One thing I do really love about the Paleo lifestyle however is the <a href="http://www.paleo-cafe.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Paleo Café in Cairns</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It almost converted me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29769" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-6.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>The Paleo Café opened in October 2012 and is already an institution.</p>
<p>Patrons steadily streamed in filling up the tables and stood around waiting for take away orders during our hour long lunch.</p>
<p>The owners, Marlies and Jai Hobbs, have taken a lifestyle they are passionate about and combined it with a unique opportunity to create a place people are flocking to.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Paleo Café is the only paleo café in Australia and pretty much a first for the world. We have people flying from Western Australia and even the US just to come here. The success has been so huge that we just finished franchising it this week, so hopefully more stores will be opening soon across the country.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Our group of travelling journalists had just arrived into Cairns from our respective hometowns. We would be spending the next 3 days together exploring Far North Queensland region.</p>
<p>There is no better way to get to know one another then over an extended lunch of Paleo food.</p>
<div id="attachment_29765" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29765" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-1.jpg" width="800" height="478" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Difficult choice</p></div>
<p>I almost had to be airlifted out of the café from gorging so much on delicious menu items such as the Caveman&#8217;s breakfast, sweet potato shepherds pie and coconut ice-cream, forcing me to question whether a Paleo diet can really help you lose weight?</p>
<p>I started with a choc banana and honey smoothie made from raw cocoa and coconut milk.</p>
<p>Although it was filling, it also gave me a light boost of energy; I wasn’t bogged down by fat and sickly sugar.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy chocolate smoothie? Give me more.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_29766" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29766" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-2.jpg" width="600" height="1000" /><p class="wp-caption-text">YUM</p></div>
<p>A few bowls of sweet potato fries with lemon aioli arrived on our table while we waited to order.</p>
<p>Conversion number 1 occurred &#8211; out with those starchy potatoes and in with the orange equivalent that taste so much better!</p>
<p>Marlies shared with us how she fell into the paleo lifestyle. Her 4 month old son had severe dairy intolerance. She started investigating food and the effects it has on our bodies and the paleo lifestyle made sense and worked for her family: more energy, feeling lighter, healthier and clearer skin, weight loss and of course no allergic reactions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We are cross fit trainers as well and cross fit goes hand in hand with paleo living. The exercise is based on the movements of cave men and so a paleo diet works well with that. A lot of our patrons regularly cross fit train&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Again not too sure if that is for me, but I was definitely hooked on the food.</p>
<p>What pushed me a little further over into the I am so excited about this cafe, is that every item on the menu is gluten-free. It ain&#8217;t easy to be a gluten-free, pescatarian traveller who also likes to eat low (if not free from) sugar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29768" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-5.jpg" width="541" height="612" /></p>
<p>Thank you Paleo Cafe for giving me these options with food that tastes bloody sensational!</p>
<p>Deciding what we wanted for lunch was a task in procrastination &#8211; the choices were far too good. I finally settled on the <strong>Dukkah crusted local ocean fish</strong> and Craig the <strong>mango and avocado salad with prawn.</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t care how full I was, I made sure to not leave a single flake of fish on my plate. The fullness was topped with a layer of deliciousness and missing that unhealthy, gluttonous fatty layer.</p>
<div id="attachment_29767" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29767" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-3.jpg" width="800" height="539" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dukkah fish</strong></p></div>
<p>I was going to call it a day until Marlies mentioned the coffees.</p>
<h3>“You use coconut milk in your coffee?”</h3>
<h3>“Yes. We didn’t want to segregate a whole market of people who like milk in their coffee so we do offer dairy and soy options, but the healthiest way is with almond or coconut milk.&#8221;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat up creating a little extra space in my stomach. Maybe this paleo is for me. <a href="http://www.mojitomother.com/2013/01/my-coconut-addiction/" target="_blank"><strong>I am obsessed with coconut</strong></a> and ignoring my decision not to have coffee today, I  asked for a coffee with coconut milk.</p>
<p>Maybe if I had this every day I might not be so attacked by the coffee guilts each time I have one. It was delicious. The only problem is now I have to fly to the Paleo Café in Cairns if I want one as no other café in Australia would probably offer it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why the Paleo Cafe is becoming a Cairns destination rather than just a random place to eat. Put it on your bucket list and feel healthy on your travels.</p>
<h3>Are you a supporter of the Paleo lifestyle?</h3>
<h3>Would you like to eat here regardless?</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just returned home from Dubai after attending the historic <strong>Qantas and Emirates</strong> partnership launch.</p>
<p>It was an unforgettable four days.</p>
<p>As a member of the media contingent I was fortunate to go behind the scenes and learn about <strong>how and why</strong> these two iconic airlines have come together to form the world&#8217;s leading airline alliance.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this monumental partnership got off to a dramatic start with a spectacular fly over of Sydney Harbour with two A380 jets, one from Qantas and one from Emirates, the first time such an event has taken place anywhere in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/why-i-like-the-qantas-and-emirates-partnership/299292_10151368300047686_304932375_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-29901"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29901" alt="Qantas and Emirates" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/299292_10151368300047686_304932375_n.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a>credit: Brent Winstone</p>
<p>When we flew out of Sydney on QF1, the first ever Qantas flight to Dubai, it was not only a day of firsts for Qantas, but also for me.</p>
<p>It was my first ever trip to Dubai, my first flight on an A380, my first experience attending press conferences, and my first time enjoying the comforts of a Qantas Business class lounge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/why-i-like-the-qantas-and-emirates-partnership/img_3876/" rel="attachment wp-att-29845"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29845" alt="Qantas and Emirates" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_3876.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Food on offer in the lounge.</strong></p>
<p>And of course no celebration is complete without a glass of bubbly on board the first flight.</p>

<p><strong>After landing in Dubai it was press conference number two.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And more food. Sweet gift from Emirates.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/why-i-like-the-qantas-and-emirates-partnership/img_3944/" rel="attachment wp-att-29847"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29847" alt="Qantas and Emirates" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_3944.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a></p>
<h2>The Partnership</h2>
<p>As of March 31st Qantas no longer fly&#8217;s to London and Europe via Singapore or Hong Kong on the traditional &#8220;kangaroo route&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, all London and European flights from Sydney and Melbourne will operate via the international hub of Dubai, sharing the new Terminal 3 with Emirates A380 planes.</p>
<h2>What Does This Mean For Travellers?</h2>
<p>Qantas customers will enjoy one-stop access to a much wider range of cities across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa via Dubai, rather than having to fly to London and then backtrack.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By travelling through Dubai, Qantas customers can connect to the extensive Emirates network into Europe and the UK and fly directly to their destination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before today, the Qantas network offered five one-stop codeshare destinations into Europe and the UK. From today, we offer access to more than 30 destinations in Europe on the combined Qantas and Emirates network&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Qantas CEO Alan Joyce</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He said it would cut average journey times by more than two hours from Melbourne and Sydney to the top 10 destinations in Europe i<strong></strong>nclude Paris, Rome and Amsterdam &#8211; sounds good to me!</p>
<p><strong>President of Emirates, Tim Clark, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;No other aviation partnership offers customers a coordinated premium airline experience. Emirates customers using a Qantas flight or lounge will experience a level of service that is on par with what they expect from Emirates.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Facts at a Glance</h2>
<ul>
<li>98 flights between Australia and Dubai every week (twice daily on Qantas).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One-stop access to 65 destinations across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Show Me Dubai</h2>
<p>Dubai is an &#8220;interesting&#8221; place to say the least.</p>
<p>Besides being a huge transit hub &#8211; second busiest airport in the world &#8211; it&#8217;s a thriving and diverse destination. A real melting pot of cultures with the absolute opulence in accommodation and shopping, and then the charm of the <em>old Dubai</em>.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of <strong><em>flash and cash</em></strong> on display and I liken it to an adults playground, but there is also plenty of activities for the kids.</p>
<p>When planning a visit, keep in mind it can get unbearably HOT in the summer reaching temperatures in the 50&#8242;s (celsius) with 100% humidity &#8211; ouch &#8211; no wonder there is an indoor snowfield.</p>
<p>Due to our media commitments I didn&#8217;t get a whole lot of free time to really explore this city. But I look forward to returning with Caz and the kids and seeing all there is to offer. In the meantime, here is a taste of what you can experience:</p>

<h2>Dinner in the Desert</h2>
<p>Our last night in Dubai was a spectacular one. The prelude to dinner in the desert was drinks and nibbles in the dunes at sunset.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/why-i-like-the-qantas-and-emirates-partnership/img_4098/" rel="attachment wp-att-29896"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29896" alt="Qantas and Emirates" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_4098.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve been flying on Qantas for 20+ years, and there is probably no more iconic and recognised Australian company around the world than Qantas.</p>
<p>As a frequent traveller I love having options and I like the fact that this partnership stands to make long haul travel from Australia to Europe, the UK and Northern Africa more seamless and faster and brings the best of both Qantas and Emirates together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m yet to take a flight on Emirates, but from word of mouth they also have a great reputation as a premium airline. So it appears to be a great fit and I look forward to accessing the rewards programs and facilities of both airlines.</p>
<p>The airline industry is obviously getting more competitive on price with low-budget airlines entering the market, but as we discovered recently price is not everything &#8211; <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/the-good-and-bad-of-air-asia-x/" target="_blank"><strong>we will never fly Air Asia long haul again</strong></a> &#8211; and when travelling with young kids extra comfort and facilities of a premium airline is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about this partnership and believe it&#8217;s a WIN for travellers.</p>
<p>It may be surprising to some, but I&#8217;m yet to visit mainland Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to tapping into this vast network and having my flights simplified and flying time shortened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also re-evaluating every way in which I can increase my frequent flyer points to take advantage of the two great programs.</p>
<p>Dubai is definitely on the move with 19 new hotels due to open as well as many restaurants, bars and wait for it &#8211; Disneyland.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for East meets West, head to Dubai.</p>
<p>As for the Qantas team, everyone from the cabin crew, to the airport staff, to the management is also very excited about this partnership and I really sensed a level of pride and achievement amongst them, and I&#8217;m sure this is just the beginning with even more expansion plans in the works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting time for Aussies looking to travel abroad, and for foreigners heading down-under!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am deeply, madly in love with <a title="Discover Tasmania via the Locals – Launceston and surrounds" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/" target="_blank"><strong>Tasmania.</strong></a> In fact I am deeply, madly in love with Australia.</p>
<p>One thing this <a title="T-Qual Tick Race: Sydney and Brisbane" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL Tick race</strong> </a>has made me aware of his how beautiful and diverse my own country is and how much we as Australian’s take it for granted.</p>
<p>We look to Asia and the Pacific Islands to quench our travel thirst, when in our own backyards we have everything you could ever ask for: <em>amazing scenery, diverse ecosystems, incredible fresh produce, great wine, stunning beaches, vibrant multicultural cities, a cool happening vibe and wonderful people.</em></p>
<p>My heart at the moment has been left on the rocky cove of <strong>Hazards Beach, Tasmania</strong>.</p>
<p>It was where it wanted to rest for a while where nothing else moved through except the wind, marine life, and the rare soft patter of feet.</p>
<p>Pure, remote, desolate, peaceful, and breathtaking.</p>

<h2>Tasmanian Air Adventures &#8211; Sea Plane to Wineglass Bay</h2>
<div id="attachment_29696" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29696" alt="Wineglass Bay Tasmania (4)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Wineglass-Bay-Tasmania-4.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Our departure from Hobart</p></div>

<p>We arrived by sea plane from Hobart, flying over the famous Wineglass Bay &#8211; a beach consistently rated as one of the world’s best.</p>
<p>Three pink granite peaks &#8211; the Hazard mountains &#8211; rise dramatically, protecting the bay from the infiltration of humanity. <strong>The Freycinet Peninsula</strong> was not meant for buildings and tour groups, rubbish and flashing neon lines, and those not willing to make a journey to experience paradise.</p>
<p>Our pilot pointed out beautiful places along the way and had a lot of knowledge and passion for the area. I felt really safe in the sea plane and thoroughly enjoyed this way of flying. Landing and take off was smooth and far more stunning than any airport could ever be.</p>

<p>Just across the small strip of land from Wineglass Bay was <strong>Hazards Beach</strong>, the place where our sea plane has permission to land.</p>
<p>We were met by Ranger D. He hiked 2 hours to greet us. That is the only other way you can sit and contemplate how beautiful nature can be and how lucky you are to experience it.</p>
<p>Ranger D took us to the rock pools to show us starfish and sea snails hiding under rocks, sea anemones and hermit crabs. He brings families and school children out for discovery tours on the beach.</p>
<blockquote><p>“They absolutely love it. “he said. “You need them to come here when they are young and full of curiosity, before they are sucked in by the likes of Facebook.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I could barely concentrate on what he was saying. My heart was calling me to just sit and be. To soak up this magical place and fill myself up on its perfect energy.</p>

<p>It was the most amazing way to finish our T-QUAL race.</p>
<p>Tasmania is beautiful. I am stunned that it is often overlooked for the other major star Australian attractions. For more information on sea plane tours to Wineglass Bay click <a href="http://tasmanianairadventures.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h2>A Fitting Ambassador to Promote the Beauty of Tasmania</h2>
<p>We talked about the beauty of Tasmania over dinner the evening before at the <a href="http://www.thehenryjones.com/dine/henrysrestaurant" target="_blank"><strong>Henry Jones Art Hotel</strong></a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_29724" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29724" alt="Henry Jones Art Hotel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Henry-Jones-Art-Hotel.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dinner at the Henry Jones Art Hotel</p></div>
<p>We were dining with <a href="http://www.benandandy.com.au/slides/ben-milbourne/" target="_blank"><strong>Ben Milbourne</strong></a>, last year’s popular contestant on <strong>MasterChef</strong>. We followed his journey on the show and loved his passion for Tasmania then. We felt he seemed like a really decent guy.</p>
<p>And then I met him and discovered he was: humble, grounded, and truly passionate about Tasmania.</p>
<p>He left the state after high school and moved to the mainland, <em>“Tasmania just seemed too small for me.”</em> His youthful need to explore what existed outside of his small home town of Devonport called not be ignored.</p>
<p>He has since returned with eyes wide open to just how much Tasmania has changed and what it offers. So much so that he states he won’t ever leave again.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Tasmanians are finally embracing Tasmania. Our produce is incredible. Most of the food you get on the mainland is sourced from Tasmania anyway. There’s a real Melbourne vibe in Tassie now. The café scenes are opening up and people are really caring about showcasing the food we have at our doorstep.</em>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ben’s passion for Tasmania shone through as he spoke about the diversity of the state and how you can drive only a few hours from the East Coast’s long white beaches, steep and rugged peaks in highland wilderness to the West Coast’s ancient rainforests and dark rivers.</p>
<div id="attachment_29720" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 778px"><img class=" wp-image-29720 " alt="Dinner with Ben Milbourne Tqual ambassador" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Dinner-with-Ben-Milbourne-Tqual-ambassador.jpg" width="768" height="768" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The TQUAL ladies with Ben</p></div>
<p>I think he is the perfect ambassador for The Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania.</p>
<p>His job is to promote good customer service, urge businesses to be accredited with the national T-QUAL scheme and encourage visitors to seek out places with the T-QUAL tick of approval.</p>
<p>His new position was announced by the Minister for Tourism during our morning press meeting at the <a href="http://www.tmag.tas.gov.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery.</strong></a></p>
<h2>T-QUAL Tick race winner</h2>
<p>The minister also announced the winner of the T-Qual tick race—Natalie from <a href="http://mummysmiles.com" target="_blank"><strong>Mummy Smiles</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In a dramatic finish which may have included a little pushing and name calling, Nat just pipped me at the post. The creek I had to jump over in the grounds of Port Arthur was just a little too challenging against her sprint across the bridge. It was a fun end to an incredible adventure.</p>
<p>Sarah from <a href="http://abeachcottage.com" target="_blank"><strong>A Beach Cottag</strong></a>e came in not far behind us, but was definitely the winner in terms of nabbing left side for profile photos and the best monkey and lizard jokes.</p>
<p>We laughed a lot on the tour. We had an excellent crew along with Lauren, one of the <a href="instagram.com/laurenepbath/" target="_blank"><strong>world’s best instagrammers</strong></a> (yes I am calling it &#8211; stay tuned for podcast interview) and Charlie, Rekha and Ant, our organizers.</p>
