				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting Tasmania to be such a foodies paradise.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told many times &#8220;<em>you have to go to Tasmania, it&#8217;s beautiful down there</em>&#8221; so I&#8217;ve always expected Tassie would have the scenery and the unspoilt natural beauty.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen countless photos of Wineglass Bay, Cradle Mountain and Bay of Fires, and whilst I never got to visit these iconic places on my first trip down to Tassie, I wasn&#8217;t surprised by the scenery that I did see.</p>
<p>Tassie is of course also known for its convict history and World Heritage Convict sites such as Port Arthur, but what I wasn&#8217;t expecting, and call me ignorant, but it turns out Tassie has some of the freshest and best produce going around.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t get to try much of the supposedly famous seafood and cheeses, but for the short period we were down there our taste buds and bellies were very satisfied and I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to returning and <strong>&#8216;eating my way around Tasmania&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>We discovered some great cafes and restaurants <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/" target="_blank">thanks to tips from the locals</a>. Check out what was on our plate:</p>
<h2>Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm Cafe, Elizabeth Town</h2>
<p>This cafe came highly recommended by our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/yTravelBlog" target="_blank">facebook community </a>and the locals we met on the ground in Tassie. And as you&#8217;ll see by the photos below, we were more than satisfied.</p>
<p>My fave was the <strong>Mud cake with Raspberries:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/11955_639505199409382_793488813_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-30427" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30427" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11955_639505199409382_793488813_n.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How about some scones with raspberry jam?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0284-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30428" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30428" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0284.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><strong>or maybe the lemon tarts?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0281/" rel="attachment wp-att-30444" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30444" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0281.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Ilk Cafe, Tamar Valley</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, the BEST bruschetta I have ever eaten. Topped with roasted capsicum, pine nuts, grilled haloumi and smoked ocean trout:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0076-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30431" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30431" alt="Bruschetta - Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0076.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Saturday Harvest Market, Launceston</h2>
<p>Held in the Cimitiere Street Car Park Every Saturday, this market sells only food and beverages grown and produced in Tasmania, and there is a range of foods for all tastes.</p>
<p>Grab yourself a <strong>raw energy chocolate ball:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/539820_639504656076103_856331804_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-30432" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30432" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/539820_639504656076103_856331804_n.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Another treat is the raw chocolate cheesecake:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/541643_639504522742783_1883910916_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-30433" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30433" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/541643_639504522742783_1883910916_n.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Some great fresh produce:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/625604_639504449409457_1044182074_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-30434" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30434" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/625604_639504449409457_1044182074_n.jpg" width="800" height="599" /></a></p>
<p><strong>And why not try some wallaby, another great meat option similar to Kangaroo:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/11458_639504779409424_543889981_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-30437" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30437" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/11458_639504779409424_543889981_n.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Fresh Cafe, Launceston</h2>
<p>Fresh is great for vegetarians, like us, but also if you like cool, retro, bohemiam and funky. Its the place all cafe bummers head to.</p>
<p>I went for the <strong>full vegie breakfast:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0247-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-30438" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30438" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0247.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Caz tucked into the baked egg with chilli beans:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0249-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30439" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30439" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0249.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>And the coffee was, yeah&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0246-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30440" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30440" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0246.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<h2>Ingleside Licensed Bakery Cafe, Evandale</h2>
<p>This cafe is located inside the old Council chambers which was built back in 1867. Grab a seat in the pretty courtyard or cozy up around the roaring fire during the winter.</p>
<p>Are stop was a brief one for coffee and <strong>gluten-free rhubarb crumble:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0568-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30422" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30422" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0568.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Josef Chromy Vineyard Restaurant</h2>
<p>Its been said that Josef Chromy is the best winery in Launceston. After eating in their restaurant, I can tell you that the food is top notch too. And as a bonus , you get awesome views over the lake and vineyards.</p>
<p><strong>Try the Risotto with squid ink and salmon:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_3543-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30442" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30442" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_3543.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Salmon cakes:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0584/" rel="attachment wp-att-30449" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30449" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0584.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Levee Food Co. Seaport, Launceston</h2>
<p>For some casual dining on the water in Launceston, head to Seaport and Levee Restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>They have burgers:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0627-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30450" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30450" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0627.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>And a Calamari Salad<span style="font-family: Arial;"> served on butternut pumpkin &amp; bocconcini salad &amp; a creamy garlic aioli dressing:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tasting-tasmania/img_0623/" rel="attachment wp-att-30451" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30451" alt="Tasmania Food" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0623.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>Craig and I feel very confident in calling ourselves travel experts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve been travelling since 97.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve each experienced solo travel.</li>
<li>We know all about couples travel&#8211;we did it for the first five years of our marriage. What a honeymoon!</li>
<li>We now travel with our two children.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve lived and worked in 5 countries.</li>
<li>We created a lifestyle around travel, with this travel blog &#8211; one of the world&#8217;s biggest.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve been to over 4o countries.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve done it ultra budget for most of the time.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve done long-term backpacking, short getaways and road trips.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve paid for about 2 flights since 2008 (and they were cheap domestic flights) and we&#8217;ve flown on heaps, including business class.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can see we can cover a lot of topics and questions.</p>
<p>And if we don&#8217;t know the answer, we sure know where to find it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/travel-podcast-questions-answers/hazards-beach-freycinet-peninsula-tasmania-28-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30395" class="broken_link"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-30395" alt="Hazards-Beach-Freycinet-Peninsula-Tasmania-28" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Hazards-Beach-Freycinet-Peninsula-Tasmania-281.jpg" width="600" height="793" /></a></p>
<p>We are opening up one podcast episode per month to answer your burning questions. For now, these will be recorded podcasts. In the future we&#8217;d love to open them up to live calls where you can put us on the spot and have a live conversation with us.</p>
<p>All you gotta do is ask.</p>
<p>Depending on how many questions we get, we may not be able to answer all of them in one episode.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t like to go over 20 mins per episode. So if we don&#8217;t get to your question in one episode, stay tuned for the next. And to avoid repetition of answers, if you ask a question we have already answered, we will point you in the direction of that recorded podcast.</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s how you can ask us your burning questions:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easiest step: </strong>reply in the comments below with your question</li>
<li>Email us at cazcraig [at] ytravelblog [dot] com Please put <strong>Podcast Question</strong> in the subject line</li>
<li>On <a href="http://facebook.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a> each month we will put a call out for questions. So stay tuned.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_30323" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30323" alt="Cooya Beach" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cooya-Beach-Mossman-Cairns-21.jpg" width="800" height="401" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cooya Beach</p></div>
<p>I’m wading through knee deep water on the beach off the coast of Mossman, just north of Port Douglas in Tropical North Queensland.</p>
<p>The world’s biggest reef just lies out to the horizon and looking back are the rainforest clad mountains. Just a little further north lies the oldest rainforest in the world, <a title="Kayaking in Paradise – Cape Tribulation and the Daintree Rainforest" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/" target="_blank"><strong>the Daintree.</strong></a></p>
<p>I’m doing my best to move stealthily through the water, like a cheetah on the prowl. Not making a sound is proving to be very difficult and I feel responsible for the fish quickly scurrying away.</p>
<p>My spear is raised and my eyes peeled on the tops of the water for underwater movement or the glint that indicates dinner ahead.</p>
<p>For the next 30 minutes I see nothing. My guide, Brandon Walker, however with eyes of an eagle sees every slight tail-swish underneath.</p>
<p>You can’t hear him stalking, only the soft thwack of his spear as it leaves his hand and travels far in the distance to land with a soft splash in the water.</p>
<blockquote><p>“They saw me. Two of them darted off as my spear was mid-air.”</p></blockquote>
<p>How the hell did he see that?</p>
<div id="attachment_30056" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30056" alt="Spear fishing at Cooya Beach Cairns (19)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-19.jpg" width="800" height="485" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ready for spearing</p></div>
<p>Brandon and his brother, Linc, are traditional custodians of the Mossman and Cooya lands. Cooya Beach, were we now standing, is the traditional hunting grounds of the Kuku Yalanji people.  I was spending the afternoon with Brandon on his <a href="http://www.bamaway.com.au/KukuYalanji.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>cultural habitat tour</strong></a> learning how to hunt.</p>
<p>“How big do the fish have to be?””</p>
<p>“Plate size.”</p>
<p>Our prizes would be later cooked up in Brandon’s family home across the street. After our spear fishing expedition Brandon would us move to the mangroves on the shore for mud crab hunting and mussel collection.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much prize collection coming from me though.</p>
<div id="attachment_30051" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30051" alt="Spear fishing at Cooya Beach Cairns (1)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Father and daughter moment</p></div>
<p>Brandon’s daughter, Faith and his two nephews joined us. Faith wants to take over the business from her Dad.</p>
<p>“She’s fearless.” the pride behind his warm smile obvious</p>
<p>“I chased a sting ray the other day.” she boasted. I&#8217;d be boasting that too.</p>
<p>I watched as she dived into the water to pull out rat tails—another new marine creature discovery, a shell with the distinctive 80’s fashion faux pas hanging down the back. Brandon showed me how to follow their snail trail in the sand and pull them out from their hiding place. I kinda failed at that one too.</p>
<p>Brandon pointed ahead. &#8220;There see that. There’s a few fish out there.&#8221; I pretended to see what he was pointing at through my squint, but all I see was bobbing water and the odd glint. How on earth does he see that?</p>
<div id="attachment_30052" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30052" alt="Spear fishing at Cooya Beach Cairns (3)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-3.jpg" width="800" height="451" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yep apparently there are fish out there!</p></div>
<div id="attachment_30053" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 808px"><img class=" wp-image-30053" alt="Spear fishing at Cooya Beach Cairns (4)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-4.jpg" width="798" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Time for dinner</p></div>
<p>Again and again Brandon’s spear sailed through the air. Again and again I saw nothing. Only once the spear splashed down did I see the water bubbling over as the fish jumped out of the way.</p>
<p>“Got him.” Brandon victoriously pulled back the spear, but only a few scales were stuck to the end. “Shaved five gills of his head. Still got away.”</p>
<p>Noticing my pretty pathetic hunting skills, Brandon stopped to show me how to throw the spear and give me a little practice. He was patient and supportive and took me through each throw step-by-step until I eventually got it. Sort of.</p>
<p>“Come on we’ve got to get you some dinner Caz. Let’s have a few more gos.”</p>
<p>The end of his spear twanging back and forth in the water showed we finally caught our prize</p>
<p>“”Got him. Right through the heart. It’s a mullet too. Our favourite. Let’s go into the mangroves now.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; The kids raced on ahead.</p>
<div id="attachment_30324" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30324" alt="Heading to the mangroves" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-71.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Heading to the mangroves</p></div>
<p>“Mangroves are great with kids, they can get into all the tight spaces to catch our food.”</p>
<p>We squelched through the soft mud, using our spears as walking sticks, and clambered over tuberous mangrove roots snaking above the mud – it was eerie, the perfect death trap.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes swarmed around us the deeper we went in and the more pungent it became. Mud squelched between our feet and caked our legs. I thought of how soft my skin would be once I washed it off—nature’s perfect free spa treatment.</p>
<div id="attachment_30046" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30046" alt="hunting in the mangroves with Brandon Walker (2)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hunting-in-the-mangroves-with-Brandon-Walker-2.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking for periwinkles</p></div>
<div id="attachment_30048" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30048" alt="Mangroves Mossman Cairns" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Mangroves-Mossman-Cairns.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The eerie and smelly mangroves</p></div>
<div id="attachment_30325" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30325" alt="Digging for something" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hunting-in-the-mangroves-with-Brandon-Walker-31.jpg" width="600" height="810" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digging for something</p></div>
<p>We were using our toes and feet to feel for the rounded, hard surface of a mussel at the roots of the mangrove trees. Brandon and his children were good at digging them out, Brandon always helping me to dig out my share by pointing with his toe his latest find.</p>
<p>“Gotta catch your own snacks around here Caz.” He pulled a periwinkle off the mangrove and showed me the yellow underbelly. “If it’s yellow you know it’s safe for eating.”</p>
<p>The periwinkles I could catch no worries and the oysters,which were in abundant supply. We picked a few off for trail mix as we walked trudged on through.</p>
<div id="attachment_30049" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30049" alt="mud crab hunting in the mangroves" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mud-crab-hunting-in-the-mangroves.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Trying unsuccessfully to catch a mud crab&#8211; come out crab!</p></div>
<div id="attachment_30044" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30044" alt="digging for mussels in the mangrove" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/digging-for-mussels-in-the-mangrove.jpg" width="800" height="527" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Big, beautiful mussels</p></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When I was a kid my mum would bring us in here with hessian sacks and we couldn’t come out until it was full. Kids these days have it easy, especially when it comes to catching their own food. MacDonald’s and fast food are killing off our community. I want to teach my kids to hunt so they can always provide for themselves. Eat well from an early age.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And Brandon’s kids were eating well. They join him as much as they can on his tours and love to hunt with him. I admired what he was teaching his children and the joy on their faces as they clambered and dug and dived under the water was inspiring to watch. If only all children had such a playground and supermarket to shop in.</p>
<p>“Dad calls me big Eyes” Faith told me. Her big eyes were certainly working as her and Elijah climbed over the mangroves squealing “Found another mussel Dad. That’s 7.” Mussels and periwinkles were her favourite.</p>
<p>After our afternoon tea bucket was full we walked back onto the sandy beach around the edge of the mangroves. Brandon shared with me more about the area and his culture.</p>
<div id="attachment_30327" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30327" alt="What a playground!" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cooya-Beach-Mossman-Cairns-11.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">What a playground!</p></div>
<p>He pointed out an abundance of coastal resources, including the beach hibiscus flower, which prevents dehydration, and the beach lettuce berry, which contains liquid that soothes sore eyes.</p>
<p>Brandon is so in tune with nature. When seasons and tides change, schools of barramundi prawns and sharks come into the mudflats and the rocky headlands around the bay. He knows precisely when they’ll be here and how to catch them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mango season is my favourite. I take the kids and we pick mangoes off the trees and eat them up the creek. When the tide goes down we choose a sandy bank and throw the seeds on it, the crayfish come out and eat the seed and we jump and have crayfish for dinner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His grandfather mostly taught him how to hunt and to know what source of food was in the area and when.</p>
<p>“He’s the one that taught me the mango trick. “</p>
<p>His grin widened as he told me about his catch the previous night—turtle. Aboriginal people have the rights to hunt turtle-as they have since the dreamtime beginning. He explained in detail how the turtle had to be killed to ensure that meat was not poisoned by the seeping gall bladder. It was pretty intense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren’t turtles sacred to the Aboriginal people?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes. That’s why as a sign of respect, the hunter must be the first to try the meat. He has to test to make sure it is not poisoned so he does not kill the whole village.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I gasped, “That is some job.”</p>
<p>“I’m very careful with how I kill it, so I feel safe.”</p>
<p>A man walked by with his dog, they waved.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t listen to the weather man I’d be out on that reef today.” He said. “It’s perfect out there today.”</p>
<p>They both looked out to the horizon line.</p>
<p>“If I wasn’t working today I’d be out there.” Brandon stated shaking his head</p>
<p>“Why what’s so good today?” I asked—obviously I had no clue about weather, fishing, and reefs.</p>
<p>“It’s so still and calm. The tide is barely moving. It’ll be clear for fishing.”</p>
<p>His spirit perked as he shared the coming evening’s night fishing adventure with his brother and the kids.</p>
<p>“We putt along with the motor and spear fish from the boat. The kids come, and we put mattresses out for them to sleep on. They love it.”</p>
<p>I was in awe. Spear fishing from a boat in the darkness. How the bloody hell does he do it?</p>
<p>Tonight they were hunting for more turtle. Brandon’s cousin’s 35<sup>th</sup> birthday was the following week. “A turtle can feed 250 people. “</p>
<p>In Brandon’s family, 160 relatives live in the local community.</p>
<div id="attachment_30329" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30329" alt="The weather mountain" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Cooya-Beach-Mossman-Cairns1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The weather mountain</p></div>
<p>He pointed to the mountain peak in the distance. “If you come out here every morning and look at that mountain, you’ll know what the weather will be. Forget the weather man, he knows nothing. If it is clear, you’ll have a clear day, it if’s cloudy on top, she’ll blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Never wrong?”</p>
<p>“Never”</p>
<p>I trusted Brandon. He was not wrong when he said the water we were wading through was safe from stingers and crocs. Hundreds of years of hunting and gathering practices passed down from generations told him so.</p>
<p>Just like traditional cooking.</p>
<p>“My mum does all the cooking. She taught me how.” His mum’s house was opposite the beach front and was where we went to cook up our afternoon snack. From supermarket to kitchen in 10 steps.</p>
<p>She sat with Aunty and we made small talk over a bowl of fish soup.</p>
<p>“When I’m sick, this is the only thing I can eat.” Aunty told me. “Clears me up straight away. It’s so good”</p>
<div id="attachment_30050" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30050" alt="mullet fish soup" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mullet-fish-soup.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mullet fish soup</p></div>
<p>And it was. Light, fresh and tasty. I wasn’t even bothered that the head of the mullet and its guts were creating most of the wholesome flavour. Aboriginal people do not like to waste the animals they have been fortunate to use for food.</p>
<p>I watch as he prepares the food in the kitchen.</p>
<p>He breaks apart the still alive crab and points out its small beating heart slowly starting to fade. I feel sadness. He throws it in with the mussels and other tiny morsels of marine life we’d be eating.</p>
<p>How disconnected we become to the cycle of life when we rely on supermarkets to source our food? We pay no attention to where our meat comes from and the sacrifice of one life for our own. I tried to grasp onto the gratitude rather than the feeling that I was a cruel killer.</p>
<p>In the pan, Brandon began cooking the mussels, periwinkles, cockle shells and crab heart with a mixture of butter, chili, garlic and coconut oil. It was creamy and delicious. I’d never eaten fresher seafood and the taste made it more exquisite because I had a hand in catching it.</p>
<div id="attachment_30040" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30040" alt="cooking seafood" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cooking-seafood.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Yum!</p></div>
<p>Next up was his people’s favourite fish: mullet rolled in flour and salt and pan fried. It certainly tasted a million times better than the mullet Mum cooked us when we were young (sorry Mum) Now I understood why it was their favourite.</p>
<p>“The fins are like crackling. Mum and I fight over it.” I left it on the side of the plate not wanting to disrupt the ensuing argument.</p>
<p>It was time to go, but not before Brandon’s shared a plate of pan fried turtle.</p>
<p>I knew this was an honour so joined in with eating it as a way of paying my respects and gratitude. The meat was tender and light and I savoured each with respect to the turtle.</p>
<div id="attachment_30057" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30057" alt="turtle meat" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/turtle-meat.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Turtle</p></div>
<p>Honour and respect. That is what life should be about shouldn’t it? Giving thanks to all that cross your path, animal or plant, for the lessons and the life giving sustenance they provide.</p>
<p>Brandon believes so passionately in sharing the traditional lives of his people with those passing by. It is a uniquely different perspective of the Port Douglas area—a quiet step away from the adrenalin, but a dirty and raw experience that brings you back to basics as you interact with this beautiful land and go about being an active participant in your body’s evolution.</p>
<div id="attachment_30054" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30054" alt="Spear fishing at Cooya Beach Cairns (5)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Spear-fishing-at-Cooya-Beach-Cairns-5.jpg" width="800" height="485" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Spending each day doing what you love + making a difference = JOY</p></div>
<p>“This is all I ever wanted to do with my life.” Brandon told me, spear in hand as we patiently waited for the fish to come and lose the game.</p>
<p>I walked beside him, wide-eyed and curious, surrounded by land and sea—some of the most stunning in the world. I understood why his heart showed through his smile and eyes sweeping out the reef beyond.</p>
<p>It was a heart that spoke of purpose and belonging. Knowing that you were spending each day overfilling your own cup so you had plenty more to help fill others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only a few weeks ago Ben Affleck mentioned the difficulty of marriage in his Oscar winning acceptance speech.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I want to thank you [Jennifer] for working on our marriage for 10 Christmases. It&#8217;s good. It is work, but the best kind of work and there&#8217;s no one I&#8217;d rather work with.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was a bizarre statement to make for the setting, but I think it was an honest look at marriage and the reality of love.</p>
<p>Marriage is tough. It’s day in day out, nose to the grind constant work. Every decision you make is centred on what is best for each other, not just for yourself-difficult, as by nature we are pretty selfish.</p>
<p>You get sick of the sacrifice and often, when you are tired, resentful, angry, frustrated and unhappy, a return to singledom looks so inviting.</p>
<p>These feelings are pretty normal.</p>
<p>Rarely are we told about the difficulties of marriage and long-term relationships and how to work through them. It’s all romance and weddings, blissfully rocking babies to sleep (ha ha ha), and happily swinging in the rocking chairs during the retirement prime. (Except for me it would be a hammock, and trust me, I’d be in it because I won the hour-long argument for shotgun rights.)</p>

<h3>Craig and I have been married 11 years today.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have been bloody great years, but there have been moments when I thought we wouldn’t make it.</p>
<p>We’ve had financial difficulties and lifestyle constraints that have brought a lot of inner turmoil and suffering. You know the type that says <strong>run and start all over again</strong>. The statistics say that 1/3 of marriages faced with crises such as these would fall apart.</p>
<p>But we haven’t and I truly believe that the strength of our bond comes from our life of travel.</p>
<p>Travelling long-term with your partner can definitely break you, but here’s why I think often makes you instead.</p>
<h2>You learn how to put up with each other’s idiosyncrasies</h2>
<div id="attachment_17295" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 743px"><img class=" wp-image-17295 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fanpage_profile_2.png" width="733" height="414" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Kookiness</p></div>
<p>I can’t stand how he <a href="http://www.mojitomother.com/2012/09/why-i-spend-20-minutes-on-the-toilet/" target="_blank"><strong>sits on a toilet for 20 minutes</strong></a> and it drives him nuts how I always leave the butter out (Yes Mum, I know it drives you crazy too).</p>
<p>Think of the mile-long list you have of things that annoy you about your partner. When you travel 24/7 there is no escaping the irritants, you just have to learn to live with them. We’ve learned to work around these annoyances and adapt to them.</p>
<p>They still drive us nuts, but not enough to take us to the divorce courts. We’ve learned to make fun of them and love each other regardless. (but really 20 minutes?)</p>
<h2>You get to know what lies at the heart of your partner</h2>
<div id="attachment_30067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30067" alt="couples travel tips" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Tea-at-a-Tibetan-tea-house-in-Shrangri-la.jpg" width="640" height="480" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tea at a Tibetan tea house in Shrangri la</p></div>
<p>When you travel everything else in your life gets stripped away: possessions are stored in boxes, friendships are placed on hiatus, and expectations placed upon by others are gone.</p>
<p>For the first time in your life you can be yourself.</p>
<p>Suddenly you get to know the real heart of your partner (and that can be where relationships turn south! At least it can save you years of heartache finding out later).</p>
<blockquote><p>Once you know what lies at the core of your partner, it is difficult to not see that when you return home and go through trials and tribulations.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Everything becomes yours</h2>
<div id="attachment_30064" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30064 " alt="mud bath yangshao China" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/mud-bath-yangshao-China.jpg" width="800" height="561" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Two peas in the mud bath &#8211; Vietnam</p></div>
<p>There is no longer any separation of what is mine and yours, except for your clothes and I do have a habit of wearing his UNC sweaters and spilling food on it at the worst times!</p>
<p>You now own little and life becomes about experiencing moments together. You’ve spent months planning and saving and now your combined dream is being played out.</p>
<p>You don’t have girls and guys nights out. The friendships you form along the way are now your common friends.</p>
<p>You start to morph into this one person—which can be kinda scary. But don’t fear, you don’t have to lose your identity, more like take on a second one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two souls become one and that one can be the unifying strength you need to get through any major relationship hurdles in the years to come.</p></blockquote>
<h2>You have memories to fall back on</h2>
<div id="attachment_30096" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/can-travel-strengthen-marriages-and-long-term-relationships/caz-craig-in-bryce-canyon-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-30096"><img class="size-full wp-image-30096" alt="Bryce Canyon National Park" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Caz-craig-in-Bryce-canyon.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bryce Canyon National Park</p></div>
<p>This is one of the biggest saving graces for our marriage. 11 years of travel has given us a solid memory bank to pull us through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at all we have done during our relationship. We can&#8217;t throw that away!&#8221;</p>
<p>In times of stress we can quickly recall that time we went <a title="13 Photos of Bryce Canyon NP" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/12-photos-of-bryce-canyon-np/" target="_blank"><strong>horse riding in Bryce Canyon</strong></a>, or to bring more laughter in our life the time we <a title="Riding an Ostrich: A unique form of ‘Green’ Transportation" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/riding-an-ostrich-a-unique-form-of-green-transportation/" target="_blank"><strong>rode ostriches in Africa,</strong></a> or when we just want to feel chilled, the Jack Johnson concert in the forest by the lake in Raleigh.</p>
<p>I couldn’t ever imagine the memories of incredible adventures in over 40 countries and setting up homes in 5 different countries, suddenly disappear. As we say on this blog it is all about the memories!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Travel more. Create better memories.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>You’re learn how to work through challenges together</h2>
<div id="attachment_30097" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/can-travel-strengthen-marriages-and-long-term-relationships/389143498303-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-30097"><img class="size-full wp-image-30097" alt="Monument Valley, Utah" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/3891434983031.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Monument Valley, Utah</p></div>
<p>Think of most of the challenges that pop up in your life: work, family, friendships, unhappiness. A large percentage of it is individual problems where one has to help the other, it’s not often something both of you have to solve together.</p>
<p>When you are travelling the problems are yours to share. So again, you become that one person. That one mind has to be able to split to see the other’s needs, but bring it back to what is best for the one goal. How can the one mind use each other’s strength to come to the best solutions?</p>
<h2>Your lover becomes your best friend</h2>
<div id="attachment_26436" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-26436 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/things-to-do-in-phuket-5.jpg" width="800" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">cocktails by the pool &#8211; Thailand</p></div>
<p>There are not many other distractions. It’s just you and him. You have to work to keep the lover part to your relationship going, but soon enough you have more than that—a best friend.</p>
<p>People find it weird that Craig and I do almost everything together and I tell him everything. Why? He’s my best friend. I actually enjoying hanging out with him.</p>
<p>When I have a problem, Craig is the first person I turn to to help me solve it. I trust he’ll support and encourage me and give it to me straight. I know this, as for most of our marriage I have only had him to rely on. There’s a lot of strength in that trust and support.</p>
<h2>Your forced to deal with it and find the solution</h2>
<div id="attachment_6788" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 598px"><img class="size-full wp-image-6788" alt="Tips for Couples Travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/rsz_africa_104.jpg" width="588" height="350" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The beginning of the meltdown</p></div>
<p>Marriage is an easy thing to get out of, 72 days after the wedding you can decide you’ve gotten to know this person too much and those irritating things are too much to bear forever!</p>
<p>There are no divorce courts you can run to when you are sitting in the tray in a pick-up truck on a dusty road in the middle of nowhere in Africa and the wheel falls off mid turn. There are no counselors to steer you past the crash collision course brought on by frustration, tiredness and budget travel fed-upness. You have to find a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>You vent, swear, pick up your backpack and storm off. And storm until the anger diminishes and you realize you don’t like trying to figure this out on your own.</p>
<p>So you both come together &#8211; volatile feelings in check &#8211; heck you might even have a bit of a giggle at your predicament.</p>
<p>You sheepishly scuff your feet in the dirt and try to work out what next. And then you erupt into fits of laughter when 10 minutes later that old rusted crumbling pick-up truck comes bumbling down the track, wheel back on and ready to pick you up and continue on your journey.  (only to break down 30 minutes later, but by this time you are cuddling again)</p>
<h2>You work together as a team</h2>
<div id="attachment_30070" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-30070" alt="hiking zion national park utah" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/zion-national-park-utah.jpg" width="800" height="524" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hiking Angel Falls Zion NP</p></div>
<p>Strong teammates play to their strengths and support each other’s weaknesses. They inspire, encourage and motivate.</p>
<p>On our travels we have participated in many adventurous activities. We relied on each other to make it through. Craig always using his strength to help carry me over the line, protect me, and encourage me to keep pushing through. It was that same we-are-in-this-together strength that got me through childbirth twice.</p>
<p>Mentally, when things got too much, whoever was in the clearer frame of mind could bring clarity to the moment and help the other to refocus.</p>
<p>A long-term relationship will only survive if you see yourself as moving towards a common goal as a team.</p>
<h2>You’re visiting the world’s most romantic places</h2>
<div id="attachment_30063" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 727px"><img class=" wp-image-30063" alt="Namibia Soussesvlei" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Namibia-Soussesvlei.jpg" width="717" height="538" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise over Soussesvlei &#8211; Namibia</p></div>
<p>Travel presents you with ample opportunities to have the romantic moments every couple needs: camping under the stars on the Great Rift escarpment in Malawi, watching sunrises on the world’s tallest sand dunes, picnicking under the Eiffel tower, or <a title="Cycling Through Yangshuo Countryside China" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cycling-through-yangshuo-countryside-china/" target="_blank"><strong>bike riding through the Yangshuo</strong></a> countryside.</p>
<p>Variety is the spice of life—you know it!</p>
<h2>You’re doing what you love</h2>
<div id="attachment_30062" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-30062 " alt="couples travel" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Port-Douglas.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Doing what we love together &#8211; Port Douglas, Queensland</p></div>
<p>I think I can safely assume that by travelling the world together you are both doing what you love.</p>
<p>There will be compromises and you may have to ride the odd camel to help your partner check off their bucket list, but at least you are filled with happiness to know you are helping to fill their cup.</p>
<p>Joy is a powerful glue&#8211;the most magical of all emotions.</p>
<p>Think about those joyful experiences you have had with your family and friends. The laughter of them for years to come is what holds you together. When you travel there is an overabundance of joyful emotions &#8211; that is some sticking glue!</p>
<p>I also feel safe in saying people are generally better when they travel, because they are doing what they love. They are looking after their own interests, discovering new things, learning more about themselves, exploring beautiful parts of the earth and meeting new people.</p>
<p>The wowser moments just keep coming and sharing them with you is your partner. There’s nothing better than doing what you love beside the person who is also doing what they love and together you love each other.</p>
<blockquote><p>How many loves were just in that sentence? Enough to get the picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, there is the risk that travelling the world with your partner could be the recipe for disaster, but so could staying at home. The recipe for a solid relationship could be building a settled life together too. But, I believe travel can build a deep foundation that will hold you steady during those rocky times.</p>
<p>We all need a firm foundation and solid steel pylons to hold the walls of the house together.</p>
<p>Happy Anniversary Craig. 11 years of 24/7 with you has been <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tough</span> wonderful.  Sure don’t ever get sick of you!</p>
<p>Can you get off the toilet now? ( I need you to put the butter away).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is known to have the best calamari in the world.</p>
<p>I know this because I have conducted the experiment to find out. The only other person who has come close to cooking the most divine, melt in your mouth battered calamari rings has been my sister, the Chef.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woywoyfishermenswharf.com.au/" target="_blank">Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf Woy Woy</a> is a popular place for locals and day trippers from Sydney to enjoy a seafood feast on the water.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-002.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf</p></div>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29582" alt="Fisherman's Wharf Restaurant Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Restaurant-Woy-Woy.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>Not only does it have the BEST calamari in the world, but from 1994 -1997 it has been said that the best cook ever.</p>
<p>Craig may vehemently disagree, but what would he know? I know it to be true because that cook was me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29547" alt="Fishermans Wharf lunch" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-lunch.jpg" width="600" height="900" />    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29581" alt="Fisherman's Wharf Restaurant Woy Woy (3)" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Restaurant-Woy-Woy-3.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>Yes, just another thing you don&#8217;t know about me.</p>
<p>Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf did lend a great hand in my ability to travel the world. I worked as the aforementioned <del>chef</del> cook when I was a University student and earned a decent amount of cash to save for my travels.</p>
<p>I also worked there with a group of my friends and adored my bosses. It was one of the best jobs I ever had, even though I stunk of fish and the pub over the road smelt us long before we walked through the doors at knock off time.</p>
<p><strong>Fishos is an icon.</strong></p>
<p>During the summer months the restaurant on the deck over the water gets completely booked out over two sittings, for lunch and dinner. The lines would snake out the front into the kid&#8217;s playground as people happily waited for their take away orders, and you don&#8217;t even want to come near the Fresh seafood market section on Christmas Eve and Good Friday.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans Wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-Wharf-Woy-Woy.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beautiful views</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s changed quite a bit since I worked there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s styled up with the influence of Sam Clayton, the owner&#8217;s son. He has turned it into a tapas style restaurant, still with ample seafood choices, but a little more spunk and flair in the menu. The deck has been renovated, there&#8217;s often live music and the BYO has been replaced with a huge choice of craft beers, wine and my summer travel favourite, sangria.</p>
<p>We love this new addition to the restaurant as we are not big fans of Australian mainstream beer. This gives us an opportunity to drink the good stuff at reasonable prices.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="Fishermans wharf Woy Woy" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-029.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Love this beer in a bag</p></div>
<p>We visit Fishos a lot now for lunch or dinner and are never disappointed. The calamari is still smoking hot and is now in fierce competition with the BBQ Atlantic salmon salad for my order. We rarely fail to have an entree of anchovy toast either &#8211; you&#8217;ve not lived until you have eaten this.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 810px"><img alt="BBQ Atlantic Salmon salad" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fishermans-wharf-038.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">YUM!</p></div>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 610px"><img alt="oysters Fishermans Wharf" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/oysters-Fishermans-Wharf.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh local oysters</p></div>
<p>Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf is a popular day trip for those from Sydney. It&#8217;s a short walk from Woy Woy train station or if you have the means, a beautiful boat trip from Sydney. You can moor up at the wharf next door.</p>
<p>And when you have finished you can take a lovely walk along the waterfront to work off your indulgences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/grand-building-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29995"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29995" alt="Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Grand-Building-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-1.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<p>Looking for tips on <strong>things to do in Buenos Aires?</strong></p>
<p>As part of our <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/city-guide/" target="_blank"><strong>city guides</strong></a> series, we interviewed Stephanie from<a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/about/" target="_blank"><em><strong> The Travel Chica </strong></em></a>who fell in love with the city in 2009 and a short vacation and then decided to move there.</p>
<p>Stephanie shares with us her <em><strong>insider tips</strong></em> on the best things to do in Buenos Aires, plus advice on where to eat, sleep, drink, shop and explore.</p>
<h2>Why Visit Buenos Aires?</h2>
<p>The city is unlike any other I have experienced or read about.</p>
<p>There is a lot of European influence, but you definitely still get the Latin America vibe, yet the <em>porteños</em> have a distinct personality and culture. I love big cities, and in Buenos Aires, I feel that there is something (or many things) for everyone.</p>
<h2>Best Things to Do in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>Buenos Aires is a huge city, and it can be overwhelming to a traveler who wants to see and do it all (like me).</p>
<h3>My highlights include:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Checking out the graffiti art</strong>. Not only is the street art impressive, it is an important part of the city’s culture and history. You will easily find <strong><a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/2011/05/graffiti-art-in-buenos-aires/" target="_blank">graffiti art </a></strong>in the barrios (neighborhoods) of San Telmo and Palermo Soho.

<h2>Where to Eat in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>As Buenos Aires becomes a more sophisticated city with a growing expat community, the selection of international cuisine keeps growing.</p>
<p>For a special experience, check out a <strong><em>puerta cerrada</em> </strong>(closed door) restaurant where excellent chefs serve creative set menus for a small group of people (reservations required) sometimes at private tables and sometimes group dining.</p>
<p>Here are of my favorite places to grab a bite or enjoy a slow meal with friends.</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy excellent steak and excellent service at <strong><a href="http://www.parrillalacabrera.com.ar/" target="_blank">La Cabrera</a> </strong>in Palermo Soho. Be sure to order the provoleta for a starter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you’re craving Southeast Asian, the <em>puerta cerrada </em><a href="http://www.cocinasunae.com" target="_blank"><strong>Cocina Sunae</strong> </a>is both an incredible meal and a special dining experience.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The pizza at <strong><a href="http://www.galeriaelcuartito.com.ar/" target="_blank">El Cuartito</a></strong> is famous. Try the fugazzetta topped with onions and loads of melty cheese.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cumaná in Recoleta</strong> is a popular locals restaurant where you can get a variety of quality traditional Argentine cuisine including locro, empanadas, pizza, and picadas (meat and cheese plates). Location: Rodríguez Peña 1149</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you want a truly unique dining experience (and are an adventurous eater), check out <a href="http://www.restoelbaqueano.com/" target="_blank"><strong>El Baqueano</strong>. </a> Go with the 7-course tasting menu with wine pairings.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When you’re craving something sweet, <strong><a href="http://www.persicco.com/" target="_blank">Persicco</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.unaltravolta.com.ar/" target="_blank">Un ‘Altra Volta</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://moratto.com.ar/" target="_blank">Moratto</a></strong> are some of the top shops with locations throughout the city.</li>
</ul>
<h2>You Cannot Visit Without Eating?</h2>
<p>You cannot go to Buenos Aires without having an amazing steak, a great bottle (or five) of red wine, and a ¼ kilo of ice cream.</p>
<p>Other foods to try in Buenos Aires include empanadas, pizza, provoleta (baked cheese!), locro (a stew typical in the north of Argentina), and a picada (cheese and meat plate).</p>
<div id="attachment_29989" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/eat-steak-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29989"><img class="size-full wp-image-29989" alt="Eat Steak - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eat-Steak-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Amazing steak</p></div>
<h2>Where to Drink in Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>Buenos Aires is a city that never sleeps, and a lot of that late-night culture is fueled by alcohol. As you would expect, there is no shortage of options no matter your poison.</p>
<p>If you love wine, you are in the right city. Argentina is known for its big reds, including Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah. The northern region is also known for its white varietal Torrontes. The wine in Argentina is very affordable, and you can find good options in any restaurant and most shops.</p>
<p>For a really special experience, schedule a tasting with <strong><a href="http://www.anuvawines.com/signup/travel-chica" target="_blank">Anuva Wines</a></strong>, which features high-quality wines from smaller bodegas.</p>
<p>Argentina is not known for its beer. The best place to have a beer is outdoors on a beautiful day. <strong>Plaza Serrano</strong> in Palermo Soho is my favorite place to have an afternoon beer. There are several bars with large outdoor patios.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for artisanal beer, a good option is <strong><a href="http://www.cervezaantares.com/" target="_blank">Antares</a></strong> in Palermo Soho.</p>
<p>I typically stick to beer or wine, but expats and locals rave about the cocktails at <strong><a href="http://www.milion.com.ar/" target="_blank">Milion</a>.</strong> The setting inside an old mansion might make the drinks taste a little better too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/drink-wine-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29991"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29991" alt="Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Drink-Wine-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Best Place For a Night on the Town</h2>
<p>Most of the touristy areas are good for a night on the town. After all, this is the city that never sleeps.</p>
<p>The top neighborhoods are San Telmo, Recoleta, and Palermo Soho. The latter is my top pick because you have many options for dinner, drinks at a casual bar, and dancing at a club until the sun rises.</p>
<p>If you’re in Buenos Aires on a Monday, you must see La Bomba de Tiempo at <strong><a href="http://www.ciudadculturalkonex.org/" target="_blank">Ciudad Cultural Konex</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re into music, there are lots of opportunities to see performances. There are small venues all over, and you will see flyers advertising shows everywhere. Be adventurous and check out something new.</p>
<h2>Where to Stay in Buenos Aires</h2>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>For budget travelers, Couchsurfing and hostels provide several affordable options in all of the central <em>barrios</em>.</p>
<p>A couple of recommended hostels are <strong><a href="http://www.hostelgiramondo.com/%20english/hostel_habitaciones.html" target="_blank">Giramondo</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.hostelpampa.com.ar/" target="_blank">Hostel Eco Pampa</a></strong> in Palermo Soho and <strong><a href="http://www.americahostel.com.ar/" target="_blank">America del Sur Hostel</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Mid-Range</h3>
<p>Good mid-range options include <strong><a href="http://www.bonitobuenosaires.com/" target="_blank">Bonito Bed &amp; Breakfast</a></strong> in San Telmo and <strong><a href="http://www.cypressin.com/" target="_blank">Cypress In</a></strong> in Palermo Soho.</p>
<h3>High-End</h3>
<p>If you want something more luxurious but still good value, consider <strong><a href="http://www.ownhotels.com/" target="_blank">Own Hotel</a></strong> in Palermo Soho or <strong><a href="http://www.casacalmahotel.com/" target="_blank">Casa Calma</a></strong> in Recoleta.</p>
<h3>Luxury</h3>
<p>Super-luxury travelers will be thrilled by world-renowned options such as the<strong><a href="http://www.alvearpalace.com/v3/eng/" target="_blank"> Alvear Palace Hotel</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="http://www.faenahotelanduniverse.com/" target="_blank">Faena Hotel + Universe</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>Apartments</h3>
<p>Renting an apartment can also be an affordable and more comfortable option for couples or groups. There are many apartment rental services, but be careful dealing with landlords. It is best to use a service that is well-established and provides user reviews, such as <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank"><strong>VRBO</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AirBnB</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/eat-ice-cream-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29990"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29990" alt="Eat Ice cream - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Eat-Ice-cream-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a></p>
<h2>Markets and Shopping</h2>
<p>There are lots of shopping opportunities in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p><strong>San Telmo</strong> is known for its antiques shops, and the <strong>Sunday Feria</strong> outdoor fair is a must-do. <strong>Palermo Soho</strong> also hosts an outdoor market with a more bohemian style at Plaza Serrano and nearby streets on weekends.</p>
<p>If you are looking for trendy, boutique shops, you will find them throughout Palermo Soho, San Telmo, and Recoleta.</p>
<p><strong>Villa Crespo</strong> (next to the Palermo neighborhood) is where to find good deals. There is an outlet shopping area on Aguirre and a small leather district on Murrillo.</p>
<p>If you don’t mind busy, crowded areas, the pedestrian street Calle Florida is a well-known shopping district where you can find nicer stores, handmade goods, and junk.</p>
<h2>Festivals and Events</h2>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://festivales.buenosaires.gob.ar/tango/festivalymundial/web/es/index.html" target="_blank">World Tango Festival</a></strong> happens in May. Although you can find tango all over the city any day of the week, the city has a special energy during this two-week festival, and you can see the finest tango dancers in the world.</p>
<p>There are too many festivals and events to list here. Pay attention to flyers and billboards around the city, and you are bound to find something big happening. Also, the website <strong><a href="http:/agendacultural.buenosaires.gob.ar/" target="_blank">Agenda Cultural</a> </strong>which lists the government-sponsored cultural events going on in the city.</p>
<h2>Getting Around?</h2>
<p>Public transport is great. You can get all over the city by using the underground <strong><a href="http://www.subte.com.ar/" target="_blank">Subte</a></strong> and local buses.</p>
<p><strong>The Subte</strong> is quite easy to figure out, even if you don’t speak Spanish. Buses are a little trickier, but hardcore independent travelers with a little Spanish can figure it out. Best tip for the bus&#8230;always have <em>monedas</em> (coins). They don&#8217;t take bills.</p>
<p>The city is very large, but it is also <strong>walkable</strong> within and between neighboring <em>barrios, </em>and it’s a fun way to check out the architecture and stumble upon a local wine bar or café.</p>
<p><strong>Taxis</strong> are plentiful and not that expensive compared to other major cities like New York or London. Just be sure you have some idea where you are going and read about common taxi scams in a guide book.</p>
<h2>Finding WiFi</h2>
<p>Yes, the city is wifi friendly and growing more so every day. If your hotel or hostel doesn’t have wifi, you shouldn’t be staying there.</p>
<p>More and more cafés and restaurants are offering wifi too. McDonalds and Starbucks are a sure bet and easy to find in the most popular <em>barrios</em>.</p>
<h2>Best Time of Year to Visit</h2>
<p>The hottest and driest months are December and January and coincide with the busiest part of the high season.</p>
<p>If you prefer moderate temperatures, don’t mind chancing some rain, and prefer smaller crowds, I suggest October, November, March, or April.</p>
<div id="attachment_29992" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/grand-building-things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/" rel="attachment wp-att-29992"><img class="size-full wp-image-29992" alt="Grand Building - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Grand-Building-Things-to-Do-in-Buenos-Aires-.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grand Building</p></div>
<h2>Favorite Side Trip</h2>
<p>The affluent suburb of <strong><a href="http://www.thetravelchica.com/2011/07/buenos-aires-day-trip-san-isidro/" target="_blank">San Isidro is a great side trip</a></strong> because it gives you a break from the hustle and bustle of Buenos Aires, and it is a beautiful area to stroll.</p>
<p>It is best to go on the weekend when there is an antiques and crafts fair in the main plaza.</p>
<h2>Getting There and Away</h2>
<p>The major airlines with international flights to Buenos Aires are American Airlines, Delta, Air Canada, British Airways, and Iberia.</p>
<p>If you are in Latin America and looking for flights, check out LAN, TACA, and Aerolineas Argentinas.</p>
<p>From within Argentina, there is a good network of buses. Check out <strong><a href="http://www.plataforma10.com/" target="_blank">Plataforma10</a>.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_29993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-buenos-aires/buenos-aires-microcentro-201111-09-l/" rel="attachment wp-att-29993"><img class="size-full wp-image-29993" alt="City Center - Things to Do in Buenos Aires" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Buenos-Aires-Microcentro-201111-09-L.jpg" width="800" height="536" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Busy City Center</p></div>
<h2>Best <em>Insiders Tip</em></h2>
<p><strong>Bring US dollars with you</strong> and always ask about discounts for paying in dollars. Inflation has been and continues to be rampant in Argentina, and the people still don’t trust the banks.</p>
<p>The government has placed many restrictions on locals for buying US dollars, so businesses are happy to offer large discounts to travelers in order to get a more stable currency.</p>
<h2>I love Buenos Aires because_____?<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Buenos Aires has an eclectic mix of cultures, which you can see in its architecture, art, and food. The city has an incredible energy, and the people are creative and passionate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paleo evangelists have a reputation of being slightly nutty in their extreme healthy living choices.</p>
<p>But, I guess we are all a little nutty when we stand up for a cause we believe in, especially one that makes us feel full of energy and good health.</p>
<p>There are things about the paleo lifestyle I like and things I’m still not too sure about. I’m not completely sold on the idea of eating little fruit, nor am I a believer that a diet heavily focused on meat protein is good either.</p>
<p>The idea that paleo is founded on a caveman diet unsettles me; there is a thing called evolution. I no longer see men hunting, unless they are at the local nightclub on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>One thing I do really love about the Paleo lifestyle however is the <a href="http://www.paleo-cafe.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Paleo Café in Cairns</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It almost converted me.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29769" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-6.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>The Paleo Café opened in October 2012 and is already an institution.</p>
<p>Patrons steadily streamed in filling up the tables and stood around waiting for take away orders during our hour long lunch.</p>
<p>The owners, Marlies and Jai Hobbs, have taken a lifestyle they are passionate about and combined it with a unique opportunity to create a place people are flocking to.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The Paleo Café is the only paleo café in Australia and pretty much a first for the world. We have people flying from Western Australia and even the US just to come here. The success has been so huge that we just finished franchising it this week, so hopefully more stores will be opening soon across the country.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Our group of travelling journalists had just arrived into Cairns from our respective hometowns. We would be spending the next 3 days together exploring Far North Queensland region.</p>
<p>There is no better way to get to know one another then over an extended lunch of Paleo food.</p>
<div id="attachment_29765" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29765" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-1.jpg" width="800" height="478" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Difficult choice</p></div>
<p>I almost had to be airlifted out of the café from gorging so much on delicious menu items such as the Caveman&#8217;s breakfast, sweet potato shepherds pie and coconut ice-cream, forcing me to question whether a Paleo diet can really help you lose weight?</p>
<p>I started with a choc banana and honey smoothie made from raw cocoa and coconut milk.</p>
<p>Although it was filling, it also gave me a light boost of energy; I wasn’t bogged down by fat and sickly sugar.</p>
<p><strong>A healthy chocolate smoothie? Give me more.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_29766" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29766" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-2.jpg" width="600" height="1000" /><p class="wp-caption-text">YUM</p></div>
<p>A few bowls of sweet potato fries with lemon aioli arrived on our table while we waited to order.</p>
<p>Conversion number 1 occurred &#8211; out with those starchy potatoes and in with the orange equivalent that taste so much better!</p>
<p>Marlies shared with us how she fell into the paleo lifestyle. Her 4 month old son had severe dairy intolerance. She started investigating food and the effects it has on our bodies and the paleo lifestyle made sense and worked for her family: more energy, feeling lighter, healthier and clearer skin, weight loss and of course no allergic reactions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;We are cross fit trainers as well and cross fit goes hand in hand with paleo living. The exercise is based on the movements of cave men and so a paleo diet works well with that. A lot of our patrons regularly cross fit train&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Again not too sure if that is for me, but I was definitely hooked on the food.</p>
<p>What pushed me a little further over into the I am so excited about this cafe, is that every item on the menu is gluten-free. It ain&#8217;t easy to be a gluten-free, pescatarian traveller who also likes to eat low (if not free from) sugar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29768" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-5.jpg" width="541" height="612" /></p>
<p>Thank you Paleo Cafe for giving me these options with food that tastes bloody sensational!</p>
<p>Deciding what we wanted for lunch was a task in procrastination &#8211; the choices were far too good. I finally settled on the <strong>Dukkah crusted local ocean fish</strong> and Craig the <strong>mango and avocado salad with prawn.</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t care how full I was, I made sure to not leave a single flake of fish on my plate. The fullness was topped with a layer of deliciousness and missing that unhealthy, gluttonous fatty layer.</p>
<div id="attachment_29767" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29767" alt="Paleo cafe Cairns " src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Paleo-cafe-Cairns-3.jpg" width="800" height="539" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Dukkah fish</strong></p></div>
<p>I was going to call it a day until Marlies mentioned the coffees.</p>
<h3>“You use coconut milk in your coffee?”</h3>
<h3>“Yes. We didn’t want to segregate a whole market of people who like milk in their coffee so we do offer dairy and soy options, but the healthiest way is with almond or coconut milk.&#8221;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sat up creating a little extra space in my stomach. Maybe this paleo is for me. <a href="http://www.mojitomother.com/2013/01/my-coconut-addiction/" target="_blank"><strong>I am obsessed with coconut</strong></a> and ignoring my decision not to have coffee today, I  asked for a coffee with coconut milk.</p>
<p>Maybe if I had this every day I might not be so attacked by the coffee guilts each time I have one. It was delicious. The only problem is now I have to fly to the Paleo Café in Cairns if I want one as no other café in Australia would probably offer it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why the Paleo Cafe is becoming a Cairns destination rather than just a random place to eat. Put it on your bucket list and feel healthy on your travels.</p>
<h3>Are you a supporter of the Paleo lifestyle?</h3>
<h3>Would you like to eat here regardless?</h3>
