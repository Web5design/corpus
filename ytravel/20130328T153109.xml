				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-25-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29405"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29405" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-tribulation-251.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></h3>
<h3>How can something so old be so beautiful?</h3>
<p>I mean, at 110 million years old the <strong>Daintree Rainforest</strong> is pretty damn old, and possibly the oldest existing rainforest in the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m about to hit the big FOUR ZERO this year and feeling a little tattered, and I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s taken me this long to visit Tropical North Queensland.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re talking about not just one, but two <strong>World Heritage Listed</strong> sites smack bang against each other, well that&#8217;s a nature lovers paradise.</p>
<p>The Daintree Rainforest and <strong>Cape Tribulation &#8211; </strong>a headland located within Daintree National Park &#8211; look anything but tattered and old.</p>
<p>As a I sat quietly in my kayak a few hundred metres off-shore gazing back at the only place in the world where two World Heritage areas meet, all I could think of was beauty, serenity and being <strong>privileged. </strong>Privileged to be at the very spot where</p>
<blockquote><p>World Heritage Listed <strong>Daintree Rainforest</strong> meets the World Heritage Listed <strong>Great Barrier Reef.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I knew I was going to enjoy this day. The drive from the nearby town of Port Douglas in to the Daintree Rainfrest was breathtaking as we passed overlooks and wound our way through the stunning rainforest.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-21/" rel="attachment wp-att-29391"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29391" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-21.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The other thing that got me excited was meeting Pete, my guide for the kayaking trip. Pete has called Tropical North Queensland home for the past 15 years since relocating from his birth place in New Zealand &#8211; yeah another one &#8211; and his enthusiasm for this place was infectious!</p>
<p>Previous to starting his Kayaking adventure company, Pete was a chef, dive instructor and jungle surfing instructor, all within the Tropical North Queensland region. He&#8217;s an outdoor lover and his passion comes across naturally.</p>
<p>First things first was putting on our &#8220;stinger suits&#8221; for protection against the box jelly fish who make these pristine waters home. I then grabbed my single kayak whilst Pete and Chelsea, my guide from Port Douglas Tourism, chose the double and we made our way to the waters edge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-29403"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29403" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-tribulation.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>With Pete leading the way, our initial goal was spotting turtles that inhabited the reefs close to shore. We spotted them but you had to be quick with your camera, which I wasn&#8217;t, as the cheeky buggers broke the surface then swam away out of site.</p>
<p>We paddled slowly further off-shore, stopping numerous times to just float around and take in the beauty and peacefulness of the place. I was snapping a ton of photos but every so often reminded myself to put the camera down and just take it all in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-23/" rel="attachment wp-att-29393"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29393" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-23.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-24/" rel="attachment wp-att-29394"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29394" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-24.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-25/" rel="attachment wp-att-29395"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29395" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-tribulation-25.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Pete being the hospitable guy that he is, even had chocolate cake on-board his kayak for morning tea, and I never say no to cake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-26/" rel="attachment wp-att-29396"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29396" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-26.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-20/" rel="attachment wp-att-29388"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29388" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-20.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The stroke rate of our paddles increased again as we headed towards the point of the headland in search of the resident <strong>dugong</strong> who apparently likes this coastal habitat and is dependent upon sea-grasses that exist in the Cape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-8/" rel="attachment wp-att-29373"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29373" alt="Cape Tribulation 8" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-8-.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-9/" rel="attachment wp-att-29374"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29374" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-9.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><b></b>Under instructions from Pete, we then floated quietly in an area he had spotted them previously. We waited patiently for the not-so-attractive dugong to poke its head above water for air. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t see one, but Pete was adamant one surfaced a little way off in the distance, again you have to be quick with the camera.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the point, we paddled alongside the rocks and up close to the mangroves before rounding the bend and heading towards <strong>Cape Tribulation Beach. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-10/" rel="attachment wp-att-29377"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29377" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-10.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-29378"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29378" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-12.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-13/" rel="attachment wp-att-29379"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29379" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-13.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-14/" rel="attachment wp-att-29380"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29380" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-14.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>At this point all I wanted to do was jump in and have a swim. The beach was empty well, almost, and the water incredibly clear and inviting. Compared to a lot of famous tourist destinations along coastal Queensland, Cape Tribulation is still an off the beaten track destination.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-16/" rel="attachment wp-att-29381"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29381" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-16.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/img_3684/" rel="attachment wp-att-29382"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29382" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3684.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>But the risks of swimming at this time of year are too great so we settled for standing up in knee deep water protected by our &#8220;stinger suits&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the way back we paddled over another reef section and it was here we got a visit from a few stingrays. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, where are the pics, unfortunately I missed out again but have the memory forever etched in my mind.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation/" rel="attachment wp-att-29383"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29383" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-19/" rel="attachment wp-att-29387"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29387" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-19.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cape-tribulation-and-the-daintree-rainforest/cape-tribulation-17/" rel="attachment wp-att-29384"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29384" alt="Cape Tribulation" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cape-Tribulation-17.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Throughout our three hour morning paddle, Pete enthusiastically shared his future plans for his 20km kayak adventure tour, his 5 day epic kayaking tour supported by both boat and car on land, as well as his kayak and fishing combo tours.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want this tour to end, and I couldn&#8217;t think of a better way to experience this amazing tropical environment and the ancient Daintree Rainforest.</p>
<p><strong>Sea kayaking </strong>allows you to take in the natural beauty<strong> </strong>from a completely different perspective, seeing the amazing marine life, fringing coral reefs and World Heritage Daintree National Park.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first leg of our T-Qual Tick Race started with a spectacular morning on <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/category/destinations/oceania/australia-places/nsw-australia-places/sydney/" target="_blank"><strong>Sydney Harbour.</strong></a></p>
<p>Waking up to the sun quietly rising over the world&#8217;s most beautiful harbour (Yes I am calling it) is almost the perfect way to start any day.</p>
<div id="attachment_29318" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/sydney-harbour-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-29318"><img class="size-full wp-image-29318" alt="Good Morning Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sydney-Harbour1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Good Morning Sydney</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.mirvachotels.com/pullman-quay-grand-sydney-harbour/" target="_blank"><strong>Pullman Quay Grand</strong></a> is where we spent our first night of the adventure. The hotel is T-QUAL accredited and has an awesome location right on the harbour. It was also only a few doors down from where we were kicking off the event at Aria Restaurant.</p>
<div id="attachment_29319" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/pullman-quay-grand-sydney-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29319"><img class="size-full wp-image-29319" alt="Pullman Quay Grand Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pullman-Quay-Grand-Sydney1.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pullman Quay Grand Sydney</p></div>
<h2>The T-QUAL Tick Race</h2>
<p>Joining me in the race is the lovely Sarah from <a href="http://www.abeachcottage.com/" target="_blank"><strong>A Beach Cottage</strong></a> and Nat from <a href="http://www.mummysmiles.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mummy Smiles</strong></a>. Lauren E.P Bath, <a href="http://instagram.com/laurenepbath/" target="_blank"><strong>instagramming extraordinaire</strong></a> was also joining us as the official photographer. (Instagram #TQUAL)</p>
<div id="attachment_29303" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29303" alt="T-QUAL Tick team" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Lauren_Caz_Matt-Moran_Craig-Davidson_Sarah_Natalie.jpg" width="800" height="614" /><p class="wp-caption-text">With Matt Moran and Craig Davidson from Tourism Australia</p></div>
<p>We were all excited, although a little nervous about what lay ahead of us for the next three days.</p>
<p>The T-Qual Race is a big mystery to us. We participate in challenges and only find out what the next event and location is with a clue at the end of each challenge. Points are given to those who guess the clue first and win the challenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TQUAL" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL initiative</strong></a> is perfect for those time strapped travellers who want to have amazing experiences yet don’t have time to research them. Travellers can be assured that Australian tourism businesses that carry the T-QUAL tick have gone through rigorous accreditation to ensure they are quality.</p>
<h2>Day 1 &#8211; Sydney</h2>
<h2>Media Launch at Aria Restaurant with Matt Moran</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Creating a tuna sashimi dish</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ariarestaurant.com" target="_blank"><strong>Aria&#8217;s</strong></a> is owned by celebrity chef Matt Moran. Kalyra was most excited to hear that I would be preparing one of Matt&#8217;s dishes and he would be judging it!</p>
<p>I am really glad that it was simply copying his design of the dish rather than actually cooking something or I would have been out at the first stir.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="Cooking with Matt Moran" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/6704_579561715395387_1837443060_n.jpg" width="639" height="960" /></p>
<p>Not really knowing what I was doing, I relied on the power of flowers to pretty something up. All three plates were very similar and I was shocked when Matt judged mine the winner by a thin whisker.</p>
<h2>Lunch &#8211; Mickey&#8217;s Cafe, Oxford St Paddington</h2>
<p>On the much quieter, trendier side to Oxford St is <a href="http://www.mickyscafe.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Mickey&#8217;s Cafe</strong></a>, a funky and comfortable cafe to while a way a few hours. We didn&#8217;t have that much time, but enough to enjoy a delicious crispy skin salmon with green vegetables and freshly squeezed juice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/micekys-cafe-paddington-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29320"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29320" alt="Micekys-cafe-paddington" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Micekys-cafe-paddington1.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Mickey’s is well known for their pizzas, thick shakes and cappuccinos. The menu here offers a range from Mexican to burgers, salads and mains. Gluten-free and vegetarians are well catered for. Highly recommend it as a place to eat on your travels to Sydney.</p>
<h2>Kayaking on Sydney Harbour with Life&#8217;s an Adventure</h2>
<p><strong> Challenge:</strong> Best GoPro photo</p>
<p>The perfect afternoon for kayaking on the world’s most beautiful harbour.</p>
<p>I have kayaked before on Middle Harbour, but this time we set adrift from Elizabeth Bay on the south side of the harbour .This is the area where the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race starts and there are many touring options.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/photo-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29321"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29321" alt="photo" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo1.jpg" width="800" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>We paddled out to Clarke’s island. The tide was too low for us to disembark and investigate the tiny harbour island, instead we circumnavigated it, and took some great harbour photos from the kayak.</p>
<p>I felt incredibly vulnerably sitting so close to the surface of this immense body of water, but it was exhilarating.</p>

<h3>“Isn’t this so beautiful?”</h3>
<p>Mike, our guide and owner of the company enthusiastically repeated this question throughout our tour. His enthusiasm was contagious. “The water is so calming, you just come out here and any bad day you may have been having is just wiped away.” I couldn’t imagine how you could have a bad thought out here.</p>
<p>When we received our next clue, it took me two seconds to yell:</p>
<h2>Barbecue at Sydney YHA the Rocks</h2>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Challenge: Dig out the clue from the YHA&#8217;s archeological site</strong></p>
<p>My favourite recommendation for <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-sydney-2/" target="_blank"><strong>places to stay in Sydney</strong></a>. Visiting again verified for me what a cracker of a place this is to stay. Best location, awesome harbour views, modern amenities all with hostel prices. You can’t beat it.</p>
<p>We had a little archaeological dig for our next clue and headed to the rooftop for a bbq, some wine and magnificent sunset views.</p>

<p>The evening wasn’t finished with us yet. Nothing real exciting to report just a flight to Brisbane and a transfer to the Quest Ipswich.</p>
<h2>DAY 2 &#8211; Brisbane</h2>
<h2>Hot Air Ballooning over Fassifern Valley with Floating Images</h2>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Most likes on a photo uploaded to Facebook</p>
<p>I don’t really like being ready for lift off at 5:30am, but once I was soaring above the Fassifern Valley serenely welcoming the day I was happy I was forced out of bed so early.</p>
<p>The sun gently rose above the clouds shrouding the valley and the nearby Dandenong Ranges in mist. It was so beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29304" alt="Hor air ballooning Brisbane" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4786.jpg" width="800" height="533" /> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29305" alt="Fassifern Valley Ipswich balloon ride" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4804.jpg" width="800" height="533" /> <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-29306" alt="Fassifern Valley Ipswich balloon ride" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MG_4842.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p>Coming in slowly to land, when you are just high enough to to be on level with the trees and mountains is my favourite part.</p>
<p>The earth looks greener and fuller. You can see the cows being mustered and the kangaroos bouncing around the farm paddocks so much clearer. It is also a little thrilling as you glide over the treetops and land with a gentle thud to the ground and a shaky baby roller coaster ride when the basket drags to a holt along the grass.</p>
<p>Grahame, pilot and owner of <a href="http://www.floatingimages.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Floating Images</strong></a> made the experience even more enjoyable with his knowledge of the local area and his gentle, humorous spirit.</p>
<h2>Novotel Lunch and Accommodation</h2>
<p>I really loved the funky decor of the <a href="http://novotelbrisbane.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Novotel Brisbane</strong></a> and that they have a channel on the TV dedicated to yoga workouts! The staff here could easily win the award for happiest and friendliest service in Brisbane, I was so impressed.</p>
<div id="attachment_29325" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/novotel-brisbane-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29325"><img class=" wp-image-29325" alt="Novotel-Brisbane" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Novotel-Brisbane1.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Funky rooms</p></div>
<p>We filled our energy reserves with a delicious 3 course lunch before rolling out to abseil the cliffs at Kangaroo Point.</p>
<div id="attachment_29326" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/novotel-lunch-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29326"><img class="size-full wp-image-29326" alt="Yum" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Novotel-Lunch1.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Yum</p></div>
<h2>Abseling at Kangaroo Point with Riverlife Adventures</h2>
<div id="attachment_29327" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/img_4915-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29327"><img class="size-full wp-image-29327" alt="Scary!" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_49151.jpg" width="600" height="986" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Scary!</p></div>
<p>One of the best things about today was discovering Kangaroo Point, a tranquil area by the Brisbane River. There are plenty of activities here to do like cycling, kayaking or boardwalk river walking.</p>
<p>We opted for the adventurous abseiling with <a href="http://www.riverlife.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Riverlife Adventure Centre</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The sheer cliff face is about 15 metres high and I found myself frozen at the edge of it. Terror engulfed me, which is highly unlike me. I was so pleased to have a supportive guide and encouraging friends convincing me that I could do it. As soon as I took those first few steps over the edge, the fear evaporated and I really loved it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/t-qual-tick-race-sydney-and-brisbane/abseiling-in-brisbane-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29328"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29328" alt="Abseiling-in-Brisbane" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Abseiling-in-Brisbane1.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<h2>Dinner at Aria in Brisbane</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29333" alt="with Matt Moran" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Matt-Moran.jpg" width="640" height="428" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Day 2 finished full circle with an amazing dinner at <a href="http://www.ariarestaurant.com" target="_blank"><strong>Aria restaurant</strong></a> in Brisbane. We had an awesome surprise with Matt Moran flying up from Sydney to join us.</p>
<p>We had an enjoyable evening sharing travel stories with media representatives and learning about Matt&#8217;s success as a chef and TV personality. The views of the Brisbane River with the Story Bridge provided a perfect backdrop to the evening and gave us an insight into the elegant, yet casual atmosphere of this city.</p>
<p>The food was outstanding &#8212; possibly the finest dining I have ever experienced.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our favourite ways of discovering a new area is via tips from talking with the locals.</p>
<p>There is only so much a guidebook can tell you, and usually they are handy pieces of information on the must see attractions, which is great.</p>
<p>But, we love to dig a little deeper to get to the heart of a place.</p>
<h3>Where are the locals going and why?</h3>
<p>Recently we had a fabulous 4 day trip to Launceston and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>We had a couple of well-known places planned to visit, but the rest we were leaving to suggestions by the locals &#8211; which we know now to be the best way to discover Tasmania.</p>
<p>Besides getting great tips, this is also a fantastic way to learn more about the local culture.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: using this strategy can be fraught with time danger, especially when the local people are as friendly as they are in Tassie. There were several places on our itinerary we did not quite get to because we chatted with the local people for so long.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great delay to have and one of the reasons we fell in love with Tasmania &#8211; the people are so bloody nice! And they excel at local tips.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the places to visit suggested by the locals:</strong></p>
<h2>The Cataract Gorge</h2>
<p>We arrived in Launceston and went straight to the <em><strong>Cataract Gorge &#8211; </strong></em>a must see destination. (We&#8217;ll have a separate post for you on the Cataract coming soon). For this post though we want to focus on the other places to visit suggested by the locals.</p>
<div id="attachment_29091" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class=" wp-image-29091" alt="Cataract Gorge Launceston" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Cataract-Gorge-Launceston.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cataract Gorge</p></div>
<p>Firstly, we want to introduce you to Michael and his wife, Sarah.</p>
<p>We were finishing up a delicious breakfast at the Basin Cafe and ready to do a gorge walk when we started chatting to this friendly couple. They have been living in Tasmania for a few years and had the following amazing tips:</p>
<h2>The Tamar Island Wetlands Walk</h2>
<p>Our friend Christina also recommended this quiet reserve only 10 minutes drive north of Launceston. We knew 7:30am would be the perfect way to start the morning with a 3km return walk through the wetlands to Tamar Island.</p>
<div id="attachment_29232" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0181-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29232"><img class="size-full wp-image-29232" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_01811.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunrise over the wetlands</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s best to arrive at dawn or dusk when barely another soul can be seen. A boardwalk extends over swamps and crosses the river to two islets and then Tamar Island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29095" alt="Tamar Valley Wetlands" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_02221.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29094" alt="Beautiful wetlands" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0212.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></p>
<p>There is an abundance of bird life swopping amongst the reeds towering above your head; perched on the wooden bridges, flying off one by one as you approach; and playing in the rivers.</p>

<h2>Josef Chromy Vineyard</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Without a doubt the best winery in Launceston&#8221;</em> Michael cried. <em>&#8220;The views are spectacular and the food and wine world-class.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>He was not wrong.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.josefchromy.com.au/" target="_blank">Josef Chromy Wines </a>began in 2007 and in that short time it has amassed over 14 trophies and 170 medals which makes it one of the most successful launches in the history of the Tasmanian wine industry.</p>
<p>It also has gorgeous views over the lake and vineyards appreciated from either the outside deck of the restaurant, or from behind the full length glass windows. I also really loved the wrap around verandah next to the gardens where you can have bar snacks or a glass of their finest.</p>
<div id="attachment_29207" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3530/" rel="attachment wp-att-29207"><img class=" wp-image-29207" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3530.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">stunning lake views over to the vineyards</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3539/" rel="attachment wp-att-29208"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29208" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3539.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>The restaurant menu is intended to showcase the local Tasmanian produce. Our risotto with squid ink and salmon fish cakes washed down with a smooth pinot noir did just that.</p>
<div id="attachment_29209" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3543/" rel="attachment wp-att-29209"><img class="size-full wp-image-29209" alt="Discover Tasmani" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3543.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Risotto with squid ink and salmon</p></div>
<p>The restaurant is smart and contemporary. It is a little on the pricey side, but if you are looking for an experience that is a little classier Chromy&#8217;s would be the place to go. They frequently have<strong> jazz on the lawn</strong> days as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3546/" rel="attachment wp-att-29210"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29210" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3546.jpg" width="600" height="871" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3544/" rel="attachment wp-att-29214"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29214" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3544.jpg" width="800" height="560" /></a></p>
<p>The cellar door is located in the estates original 1880s homestead, surrounded by an expanse of established landscaped gardens making it an idyllic place to while away the hours.</p>
<p><strong>Getting There:</strong> Josef Chromy Wines is located at 370 Relbia Road, Relbia, 10 minutes south of Launceston, not far from the airport.</p>
<h2>Evandale</h2>
<p>We could not make the Sunday morning markets in Evandale &#8211; the home run event &#8211; but Michael and his wife&#8217;s enthusiasm for this <strong>&#8220;<em>Best town in Launceston&#8221;</em> </strong>convinced us to at least pass through for coffee and cake.</p>
<p>You arrive in Evandale and feel as if the clock has been wound back 100 years.</p>
<p>Evandale is a<strong> National Trust classified Georgian village.</strong> It&#8217;s unspoiled heritage buildings make it a popular place for tourists. Clarendon House, just outside of the village, is said to be one of Australia&#8217;s greatest Georgian houses.</p>
<p>We devoured a gluten-free rhubarb crumble at the <strong>Ingleside licensed bakery cafe</strong> located inside the old Council chambers built in 1867. There is a pretty courtyard bursting with flowers or, in the winter, a cozy roaring fire.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0553/" rel="attachment wp-att-29215"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29215" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0553.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a></p>
<div id="attachment_29216" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0568/" rel="attachment wp-att-29216"><img class=" wp-image-29216" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0568.jpg" width="800" height="505" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">gluten-free rhubarb crumble</p></div>

<p>I wish we had more time to enjoy a cold beverage in the beer garden of the historic Clarendon Hotel. Next time!</p>
<h2>Christmas Hills Raspberry Farm Cafe</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/yTravelBlog/posts/571669676184591" target="_blank">When we asked our facebook fans</a> prior to leaving for tips on things to see and do, quite a few of them recommended the <a href="http://www.raspberryfarmcafe.com/home_cafe.html" target="_blank">Raspberry Farm Cafe</a> and said we must go there. So we did and gorged ourselves on chocolate and raspberry mud cake, lemon tarts and scones.</p>
<div id="attachment_29102" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29102" alt="Mud cake with Raspberries at the Raspberry Farm Launceston" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mud-cake-with-Raspberries-at-the-Raspberry-Farm-Launceston.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Mud cake with Raspberries at the Raspberry Farm Launceston</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29069" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0284/" rel="attachment wp-att-29069"><img class=" wp-image-29069" alt="IMG_0284" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0284.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">lemon tarts and scones</p></div>
<p>Craig dared to try a raspberry latte and I had a refreshing raspberry and mint iced tea.</p>
<p>The stone and timber café overlooks lush green lawns running down to a lake filled with water lilies. The garden features native trees and a herb garden overlooking the raspberry canes in the distance.</p>
<div id="attachment_29101" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29101" alt="Raspberry Farm Launceston Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0293.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Raspberry Farm Cafe</p></div>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to grab a choc dipped raspberry on your way out &#8211; they melt in your mouth, finished with a silky hit of raspberry.</p>
<h2>Tips Discovered in the Tamar Valley</h2>
<p>We were staying our first night in the Tamar Valley at <a href="http://www.rosevears.com.au/" target="_blank">Rosevears Retreat</a>.</p>
<p>The Tamar Valley is a wine region only 10 minutes drive north of Launceston and is known (secretly) to be one of the best wine regions in Australia. The cool climate is perfect for producing high quality elegant wines.</p>
<p>Exploring the Tamar Valley was definitely the highlight of our Tasmanian trip.</p>
<p>Our guide book told us <a href="http://kreglingerwineestates.com/products/ninth-island/" target="_blank">The Ninth Island Winery</a> had extraordinary views, and as it was the first winery we came to on the drive out from Launceston we decided to pull in.</p>
<div id="attachment_29079" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3052/" rel="attachment wp-att-29079"><img class=" wp-image-29079" alt="IMG_3052" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3052.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">views from the Ninth Island Winery</p></div>
<h2>Meeting Jeremy from the Ninth Island Winery</h2>
<p>The guidebook was not wrong about the <em>achingly beautiful</em> views. The vineyard caught a cool breeze from the river; exactly what we needed on this rare hot day. The breeze also cools down the grapes helping to <strong><em>percol</em> </strong>their sweetness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0051-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29242"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29242" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_00511.jpg" width="600" height="830" /></a></p>
<p>It was perfect for wine tasting and for a lively conversation with Jeremy, our wine connoisseur. He loves to make up words like <em><strong>percol</strong></em>, and give strange palate cleansing tips such as put a grape in your tea or coffee and then eat it once the drink has finished for a taste explosion.</p>
<p><strong>As you can tell Jeremy was great fun.</strong></p>
<p>He brought us a range of wines to taste from Ninth Island and Pipers Brook, a winery further north owned by the same people. Jeremy helped us to distinguish the taste differences and why they were like that. After much discussion, we decided to purchase a bottle of the pinot gris to bring home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0068/" rel="attachment wp-att-29219"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29219" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0068.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy convinced us &#8211; despite being full &#8211; that the <a href="http://www.ilk-cafe.com/" target="_blank">Ilk Cafe</a> down the road had to be our next stop for a bite to eat.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;One of the best cafes in the region,&#8221;</em> he declared. <em>&#8220;The chef, Sam has moved with the times and creates amazing dishes.&#8221;</em></p>
<h2>Ilk Cafe and Gallery</h2>
<p><strong>OMG. The best bruschetta ever!</strong></p>
<p>We would never have stopped at the <a href="http://www.ilk-cafe.com" target="_blank">Ilk Cafe</a> if it wasn&#8217;t for Jeremy.</p>
<p>The waitress, Stephanie, was friendly and accommodating and when we told her Jeremy had sent us, she grinned broadly and said, &#8220;He&#8217;s my husband!&#8221;</p>
<p>The bruschetta, topped with roasted capsicum, pine nuts, grilled haloumi and smoked ocean trout was an explosion of flavours &#8211; very modern, healthy and made from fresh local produce.</p>
<div id="attachment_29076" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0076/" rel="attachment wp-att-29076"><img class=" wp-image-29076" alt="IMG_0076" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0076.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bruschetta</p></div>
<p>The small cafe sits opposite the river on Rosevears Drive. You can sit outside and soak up the views or enjoy the homely interior.</p>
<div id="attachment_29264" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3082/" rel="attachment wp-att-29264"><img class="size-full wp-image-29264" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3082.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">views from Ilk Cafe</p></div>
<p>It was time for more wine so of course we asked Stephanie for more tips. She sent us to her favourite winery just down the road, Moores Hill.</p>
<h2>Moores Hill</h2>
<p>We arrived to <a href="http://www.mooreshill.com.au/" target="_blank">Moores Hill</a> before closing time with minutes to spare for tasting. I&#8217;m so glad we could fit it in with the lovely owner, Fiona.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0105/" rel="attachment wp-att-29239"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29239" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0105.jpg" width="800" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>Originally from Adelaide, Fiona and Lance, her wine-making husband, decided to relocate to Tassie to produce excellent slow growing wines.</p>
<p>The winemakers believe in small batch winemaking as a way of maximising complexity in the wines, allowing the vineyard to fully express itself.</p>
<p>You can see the expression in <strong>their signature label</strong>, commissioned by an artist.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0096/" rel="attachment wp-att-29228"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29228" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0096.jpg" width="800" height="590" /></a></p>
<p>I also tasted it in their lightly oaked Chardonnay. It&#8217;s brought me back to my long lost love. It&#8217;s creamy, lemony taste gave it a fresh uniqueness that rolled and soothed the taste buds. We took a bottle of that one home to enjoy from the verandah of our eco-retreat cabin, along with Tasmanian cheese, olives, dips and eggplant balls.</p>
<div id="attachment_29229" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_3099/" rel="attachment wp-att-29229"><img class=" wp-image-29229" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3099.jpg" width="800" height="602" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">view from deck</p></div>
<p>Oh, and the cows singing in the fields just behind the vines added to the Tamar Valley serenity.</p>
<p>Fiona gave us the remainder of the bottle to their dessert Riesling to take home. Just enough for two glasses to wash the chocolate down with.</p>
<p>She also gave us a couple of hot tips for the following day as we were leaving. We of course had to follow them.</p>
<p><strong>Press play to hear why Fiona thinks you should visit Tasmania:<br />

<h2>Saturday Harvest Market, Launceston</h2>
<p>We find it difficult to resist a good farmer&#8217;s market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to eat well, help the local economy, and save money. This was a small one in the car park on Cimitiere St in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>The produce was fresh, local and cheap. Blueberries were the market superstars, with buckets overflowing from every second stall. We devoured some raw energy chocolate balls from the Vegan stall and tried wallaby for the first time. It is delicate and delicious.</p>
<div id="attachment_29221" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0240/" rel="attachment wp-att-29221"><img class="size-full wp-image-29221" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0240.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">raw energy chocolate balls</p></div>
<div id="attachment_29222" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0242/" rel="attachment wp-att-29222"><img class="size-full wp-image-29222" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0242.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">wallaby for sale</p></div>
<p>And guess who we saw wandering around the markets &#8211; Fiona! We were quickly becoming locals.</p>
<h2>Fresh Cafe, Launceston</h2>
<p>Fiona also recommended Fresh as a great cafe for vegetarian fare. The markets made us hungry so we headed to <a href="http://www.freshoncharles.com.au/" target="_blank">Fresh on Charles St</a> for breakfast.</p>
<div id="attachment_29223" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0243-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29223"><img class="size-full wp-image-29223" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_02431.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fresh Cafe</p></div>
<p>Fresh has grown since its opening in 1999. From a five table cafe to now including a restaurant, sundeck, and bar &amp; entertainment venue.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s the place all cafe bummers, musicians and writers aspire to be seen in.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_29230" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0246/" rel="attachment wp-att-29230"><img class="size-full wp-image-29230" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0246.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Good coffee</p></div>
<p>It checks off the terms cool, retro, bohemiam and funky, a place most typically found on Degraves St in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Craig went for the full veggie breakfast and I had a baked egg with chilli beans. Hearty and delicious and bursting with flavour.</p>
<div id="attachment_29224" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0247/" rel="attachment wp-att-29224"><img class="size-full wp-image-29224" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0247.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">vegie breakfast</p></div>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/discover-tasmania-launceston-and-surrounds-by-the-locals/img_0249/" rel="attachment wp-att-29225"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29225" alt="Discover Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0249.jpg" width="800" height="533" /></a></p>
<h2>John Temple Gallery</h2>
<p>We were driving through the historic towns of the Great Western Tier on the way to Sheffield when our Tourism Tasmania guide sent us a text.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Westbury is the John Temple Gallery. Feel free to stop there, he is one of the best photographers in Tasmania.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We decided to stop in the gallery situated in this historical English village.</p>
<div id="attachment_29099" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29099" alt="Westbury Tasmania" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0261.jpg" width="600" height="900" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Historical building Westbury</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.johntemplegallery.com.au/index.php" target="_blank"><strong>John Temple Gallery</strong> </a>is a brochure for Tasmania. Come here and your list of must see places will have a growth explosion. John&#8217;s panoramic photos showcase the stunning natural landscape of the state with a couple of other global landscape stunners like Monument Valley thrown in.</p>
<p>I was embarrassed to be wearing our camera around my neck. I just hoped he didn&#8217;t want to look at my portfolio of overexposed shots.</p>
<div id="attachment_29100" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29100 " alt="John Temple Gallery" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_0267.jpg" width="800" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">John Temple and Craig at his Gallery</p></div>
<p>John shoots on slide film, without filters, and doesn&#8217;t even take many photos.<em> </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I just wait until the lighting is right.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>He told us digital has about another 20 years before it can ever compete with slide film. Wow!</p>
<p>Again our planned itinerary was cut short as we chose to continue our interesting chat with John. He told us more about his life as a photographer and the local area.</p>
<p>As we stood chatting an unassuming lady got out of her ordinary looking 4WD and walked into the local butchers across the road.</p>
<h3>&#8220;See that lady there. She was the person who developed the Frequent Flyer concept.&#8221;</h3>
<h3>&#8220;No way.&#8221;</h3>
<h3>&#8220;Oh yes. There are some fascinating people around here.&#8221;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I was not surprised.</strong></p>
<p>In less than 24 hours we had already met a diverse bunch of locals. They certainly made our first Tassie experience so enriching.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I fulfill my dream of participating in the Amazing Race &#8211; not the TV version, one that is much better than that!</p>
<p>I will be be joining the <strong>T-QUAL</strong> Tick Race, an initiative by Tourism Australia to promote the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com.au/TQUAL" target="_blank"><strong>T-QUAL tick &#8211; </strong></a>the Australian Government&#8217;s national symbol of tourism quality.</p>
<div id="attachment_29231" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 786px"><img class="size-full wp-image-29231" alt="T-QUAL Tick Race Sydney" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/T-QUAL-Tick-Race-Sydney.jpg" width="776" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Digging for a clue</p></div>
<p>Tourism businesses that carry the T-QUAL Tick have undergone rigorous assessment to ensure they deliver quality experiences. So it saves the tourists time in researching. If they see a business with the T-QUAL Tick they know it&#8217;s good.</p>
<h3>The race has two legs: 25-28th March and 2-5 April.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating in challenges that earn points. And I&#8217;ll need to be unlocking clues along the way, so I may need your help.</p>
<p>Follow the adventure on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>facebook</strong></a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>twitter</strong></a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>instagram</strong></a> feeds and the hashtag <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>#TQUAL</strong></span></p>
<p>On this page I will be uploading a daily vlog sharing my experiences of the day and hopefully the fact that I am earning challenge points. The first one involves me cooking so I am not too confident!</p>
<p>Anyway you can see below how it all goes. Check back here daily to see the new vlog:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/how-to-save-money-on-travel/how-to-save-money-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-29122"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29122" alt="How to Save Money" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-save-money.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>How to save money</strong></em> whilst traveling is one of the most common questions we get asked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great question. Luckily for us, and you, we have some suggestions.</p>
<p>Like us, most people we know include travel high on their priority list each year, as they want to get away from life&#8217;s routines and create precious memories. But most people don&#8217;t have money trees growing in their back yards &#8211; if you do, what&#8217;s your address??</p>
<p>The other common question that comes up a lot is <em><strong>how do we get out of debt</strong> </em>so we can travel more? Unfortunately we&#8217;ve been there too, and it&#8217;s not a nice place to be. Thanks to our friend Jeremy Branham that challenge was <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/5-tips-to-get-out-of-debt-so-you-can-travel-more/" target="_blank"><strong>discussed here</strong></a> with some great insights.</p>
<p>Whilst increased competition between airlines and the ever growing accommodation options has helped lower travel costs, more and more people are finding themselves with less disposable income to play with each year.</p>
<h3>Where&#8217;s the fun in that?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a motto &#8211; <strong><em>Travel more. Create better memories -</em></strong><em> </em>it&#8217;s something we are very passionate about and have been following that travel motto for the past 15 years, first solo, then <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/tips-for-couples-travel/" target="_blank"><strong>as a couple</strong></a>, and now as a <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/25-tips-for-travel-with-kids/" target="_blank"><strong>traveling family</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Some people honestly think we are millionaires being able to travel as much as we do, if only.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s mostly been about making smart choices, having different priorities, and using certain strategies to save money as we go.</p>
<p>As they say, a dollar saved is a dollar earned and it&#8217;s better off in your pocket than theirs. Every little bit counts. Why pay more when you don&#8217;t have to!</p>
<p>The 52 ideas I&#8217;m about to share will be obvious to some of you, but if you&#8217;re new to travel and new to our site, I&#8217;m sure you will appreciate the heads up on a few strategies to help you save a dollar on the road.</p>
<h2>How to Save Money on Travel:</h2>
<h3>1. Use the Free Days</h3>
<p>Such a simple tip I know but simple is always good. Visit museums or tourist sites on <strong>free days</strong> or when they are discounted. Before you go anywhere, make sure you look on their website to find out if they offer free visiting hours or discounts.</p>
<h3>2. Talk to the Locals</h3>
<p>This is how we travel. We love getting insider tips from locals. It can go a long way to good advice, a friendship and even<strong> a discount</strong>. A good ice-breaker is to ask for directions or advice (“Where’s a good restaurant?”).</p>
<h3>3. Spend More Time in Fewer Places</h3>
<p>We LOVE slow travel. Instead of racing from one end of a country to another, or tearing through 6 countries in 6 weeks, get to know a region well. Undertaking too many flights, bus trips, train journeys and driving long distances can really eat into your budget. So slow down, take more in, and discover all the cool free stuff.</p>

<h3>4. Be Flexible with Your Flight Dates</h3>
<p>If possible, give yourself the best chance to capture any of the <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/cheap-international-flights/" target="_blank"><strong>cheap flights</strong></a> when the prices fluctuate by searching a couple of days, or even weeks, either side of your preferred departure date. A few booking engines we like using include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kayak.com/flights" target="_blank"><strong>Kayak</strong></a><strong> </strong>– Compares hundreds of sites at once.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vayama.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Vayama</strong></a> &#8211; specialises in cheap international flights.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.skyscanner.com.au/?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=3887010_UK+Skyscanner+468+x+60_10641624&amp;utm_source=CJ_UK" target="_blank"><strong>Skyscanner</strong> – </a>Provides instant comparison on flight prices for over 670,000 routes.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.airtreks.com/" target="_blank">Air Treks</a> </strong>- Around the world flight ticket experts.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Airfarewatchdog</a></strong> – Keeps track of deals and alerts you of price drops.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.airasia.com/au/en/home.page" target="_blank"><strong>Air Asia</strong></a> &#8211; Great for short flights within Asia, but to read why we will never fly long-haul as a family with them again click <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/the-good-and-bad-of-air-asia-x/" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Adjust Your Times for Flying</h3>
<p>Flying at unpopular hours, such as the red-eye or early in the AM increases your chance of getting discounted flights.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h3>6. Fly on a Midweek Day</h3>
<p>Tuesdays and Wednesdays are usually the cheapest times, and try and avoid holiday periods.</p>
<h3>7. Go Directly to the Airline Website</h3>
<p>Once you have looked at all the flight search websites and found the cheapest price, as a LAST resort go direct to that airlines own website. Many of the airlines have lower fares that you can only get when you book online at their site, or buy an e-ticket.</p>
<h3>8. Join a Frequent Flyer Program</h3>
<p>Earn points towards cheaper fares, upgrades, and free companion tickets. It may take a while to accumulate points, but they CAN pay off big time. I once used my points to fly round trip from the United States to South Africa.</p>
<h3>9. Use Your Age</h3>
<p>Ask about student discounts at<strong> <a href="http://www.statravel.com?wt.mc_id=CJ_statravel_110209" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">STA Travel.</a> </strong>(if only to be young again!)</p>
<h3>10. Stay More Than 1 Night</h3>
<p>Many hotels, hostels and certainly apartments provide their best deals when you stay over more than one night. A few sites we like to search on include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=FOzBzQoz428&amp;offerid=120349.10000002&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hotwire </a></strong>- For last minute deals. e.g. We got a 4 star hotel in the heart of the French Quarter in New Orleans for $50.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3887010-10784648" target="_blank"><strong>Hotels.com</strong></a> – has over 20,000 last minute deals each week.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.agoda.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Agoda </strong></a>- Great for deals in Asia.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.stayz.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Stayz </strong></a>(apartments).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-3887010-10392970" target="_blank"><strong>Priceline</strong></a> – Bid low on last-minute hotels. Check their pricebreaker deals.</li>
<li>and <a href="http://www.lastminute.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Last Minute</strong></a><strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>11. Call the Hotel Directly</h3>
<p>A last minute phone call directly to a hotel, or hostel, asking about cheap rooms can prove fruitful. They don’t like having empty rooms so will discount.</p>
<h3>12. Stay over Sunday</h3>
<p>Many hotels receive Friday-Saturday night bookings from leisure travelers and Monday-Friday bookings from business travelers, so there can be a void on Sunday nights and again they may discount.</p>
<h3>13. Sign Up for e-Mail Notifications</h3>
<p>The best <strong>airfare and hotel sales</strong> can go largely unannounced. Sign up for your favourite travel brands e-Newsletters. Special promotion codes can save you money and you can also be notified of last minute deals in this way.</p>
<h3>14. Follow on Social Media</h3>
<p>Go and “like” your favorite travel sites on <a href="http://facebook.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank"><strong>facebook</strong> </a>and “follow” them on <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/ytravelblog" target="_blank">twitter.</a></strong> It’s getting more common for travel companies to release hot deals directly through their social media channels.</p>
<h3>15. e-Newsletter Deals</h3>
<p>We are subscribed to a few e-newsletter’s that produce a list of current deals available on the net for any given time period.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.travelzoo.com/top20/" target="_blank">Travel Zoo</a>- </strong>Subscribe to their weekly FREE newsletter of their Top 20 deals<strong> &#8211; </strong>editions for different countries.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dealbase.com/#" target="_blank"><strong>Deal Base</strong></a> – Sign up for there free deal alerts. They have deals of unadvertised sales and offers you won’t find anywhere else.</li>
</ul>
<h3>16. Rent an Apartment</h3>
<p>Apartments are the BOMB for families or those looking for extra living space and a kitchen so you  can save on food. We haven&#8217;t personally used this site yet, but check out <strong><a href="http://www.airbnb.com/">AirBnB </a></strong>as a way to get low-cost vacation rentals and sublets from locals in <em>180 countries</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.homeaway.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Homeaway</strong> </a>has a large selection of apartments, and a good one we like to use in Australia is <a href="http://www.stayz.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Stayz.</strong></a></p>
<h3>17. Use Hotel Reward Programs</h3>
<p>Many brands have them and you can get perks like free nights or room upgrades. The <strong><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/hotels-com-welcome-rewards/" target="_blank">Hotels.com welcome rewards program</a> </strong>gives you one free night for every 10 booked through them.</p>
<div id="attachment_29109" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 610px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/how-to-save-money-on-travel/how-to-save-money-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-29109"><img class="size-full wp-image-29109" alt="Enjoying the benefits of Hilton Honors Rewards program in Phuket" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/How-to-save-money-2.jpg" width="600" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoying the benefits of Hilton Honors Rewards program in Phuket</p></div>
<h3>18. Check for Family Deals<strong> </strong></h3>
<p>Always ask about discounted rates, free meals for children, and an upgrade at check in – they can only say no.</p>
<h3>19. Use Coupons</h3>
<p>Do your research to find travel discounts and coupons for the areas you are visiting. Check out the brochure shelf in the lobby of your hotel.<strong>Visit the local tourist information offices</strong> for free maps and ideas.</p>
<p>Use the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tourist booklets and brochures.</li>
<li>Back of supermarket receipts.</li>
<li>Websites (local tourist boards and businesses and coupon sites).</li>
</ul>
<h3>20. Use Credit Card Reward Points</h3>
<p>Check the program and benefits for your particular credit card, you might be able to use your points for accommodation costs and frequent flyer points. We currently have an AMEX card that gives us three Qantas points for every dollar spent.</p>
<h3>21. Stay in Hostels and Guesthouses</h3>
<p>A great option for <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/how-to-find-budget-accommodation/" target="_blank"><strong>budget accommodation</strong></a> but they are not for everyone, and we have written a post about our <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/travel-tips/tips-for-backpackers-hostels" target="_blank"><strong>tips for staying in hostels. </strong></a>Hostels are usually well located allowing you to walk and save on transport.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Australia consider a <a href="http://www3.yha.com.au/membership/yha-membership/" target="_blank"><strong>YHA Membership</strong> </a>and get 10% discounts.</li>
<li>Search hostels worldwide at <a href="http://hostelzoo.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Hostel Zoo</strong></a> &#8211; a free hostel comparison site.<br />

<h3><strong>22. Couch Surf</strong></h3>
<p>A great way to meet locals for a drink, a tour, and accommodation is by <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org" target="_blank"><strong>Couchsurfing</strong></a>. It connects travelers with local people in various cities that offer members a place to sleep.</p>
<h3>23. WWOOF</h3>
<p>WWOOF or WWOOFING stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. It is a world wide network of organisations and they link volunteers with organic farmers<b>. </b>In return for volunteer help, WWOOF hosts offer food, accommodation and opportunities to learn about organic lifestyles. Learn more <a href="http://www.wwoof.org/" target="_blank"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>24. House Sitting</strong></h3>
<p>Make yourself at home with a spot of <a href="www.ytravelblog.com/house-sitting" target="_blank"><strong>house-sitting</strong></a>. House sitters provide their pet and house sitting services for free in exchange for the privilege of accommodation in the owner’s home.</p>
<h3>25. Do a <strong>Home Exchange</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/holiday-home-exchange/" target="_blank"><strong>home exchange strategy</strong></a> is possibly best for families or retired people who are looking to base themselves in another country or state for an agreed period of time. Just like the name suggests, you stay in their house whilst they stay in yours.</p>
<h3>26. VRBO – Vacation Rentals By Owner</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-3887010-10697640" target="_blank">Vacation Rentals By Owner</a></strong> was founded by owners who self-manage their second homes. Vacation rentals can sometimes offer more value, space and privacy to hotels. VRBO provide an online space for homeowners to advertise their vacation properties &#8211; <strong>130,000+ rentals in over 100 countries worldwide</strong>.</p>
<h3>27. Go Camping</h3>
<p>Camp in a National Park, a caravan park, or on the beach. You’ve got to be prepared for roughing it a little, but hey camping is probably your cheapest option. We have also camped cheaply in the grounds of hostels, and for free in out-of-town family and friends backyards.</p>

<h3>28. Sleep While Traveling</h3>
<p>When travelling by plane, train, or bus, try and time it so you are traveling at night. That way, you don’t have to pay for a night’s accommodation.</p>
<h3>29. Attend Time Share Presentations</h3>
<p>Not our favourite strategy &#8211; these can be aggressive sale pitches of 90 minutes or more, but just say no at the end and thank you for the free accommodation for your troubles. Over the years we have had free accommodation in Turkey, Daytona Beach, Orlando, and Key West.</p>
<h3>30. Walk as Much as You Can Walk.</h3>
<p>Get active and see things at a slower pace &#8211; walking is FREE. You can experience more just by wandering around a city and getting lost, talking with locals, and people watching. Explore local markets, wander and take photos, or even hike to the top of a hill for an awesome view.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/how-to-save-money-on-travel/bg-7412/" rel="attachment wp-att-29114"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29114" alt="how to save money" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BG-7412.jpg" width="480" height="640" /></a></p>
<h3>31. Rent a Bike</h3>
<p>Cheap price, more comfy than a bus, slightly faster pace than walking..</p>
<h3>32. Travel Like the Locals</h3>
<p>Use <strong>public transport</strong> where possible. You get great knowledge and insight by hanging with the locals, it costs you less, and is a more authentic travelling experience. We have done this extensively in Africa and Asia.</p>
<h3>33. Share Transport Costs</h3>
<p>When you do travel by other means, try and share a car with another traveller. Also, sharing a Taxi, mini-van, and tours etc are all more cost-effective when there’s a group of travelers to split the costs.</p>
<h3>34. Eat out for Breakfast, Lunch or Brunch</h3>
<p>Try and avoid dinner as restaurants raise prices. OR, have brunch instead of 3 meals a day. Many restaurants offer lunch specials where items on the dinner menu are offered for a fraction of the cost you’d pay in the evening.</p>
<h3><strong>35. Eat Away from the Tourist Streets</strong></h3>
<p>Just go one street or one block over and it will usually be <strong>much cheaper and more authentic! </strong></p>
<h3>36. Have Picnics and BBQ&#8217;s</h3>
<p>Purchase food in a local grocery store or a market and arrange a picnic in one of the city’s parks with great views. We&#8217;ve had picnics in Sydney&#8217;s Royal Botanic Gardens, New York&#8217;s Central Park, and BBQ&#8217;s world wide.</p>
<h3>37. Self-Cater Where You Can</h3>
<p>We make self-contained accommodation with kitchen facilities a priority. Purchasing your own supplies and cooking-in can save you big bucks &#8211; unless you are in Asia where eating out is incredibly cheap.</p>
<p>And take your own food on flights, buses and trains where practical.</p>
<h3>38. Have Breakfast Included</h3>
<p>When booking a hotel or hostel look for one with breakfast included.</p>
<h3>39. Eat Street Food</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/the-real-reason-you-should-eat-street-food/" target="_blank"><strong>The real reason you should eat street food</strong></a> is because it’s cheap, you help the locals, and it&#8217;s safe  &#8211; you can see what is actually being cooked and is cooked fresh right in front of you. Pay attention to where the locals eat and what is popular.</p>
<div id="attachment_28215" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/places-to-escape-the-bangkok-madness/index-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-28215"><img class="size-full wp-image-28215" alt="How to save money" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/index1.jpg" width="800" height="800" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheap street food in Thailand</p></div>
<h3>40. Drink in Before Going Out</h3>
<p>Just like eating, purchase your alcohol from a store. Then, take advantage of any happy hours and don’t drink expensive import stuff – give the local stuff a go.</p>
<h3>41. Leave your ATM Card at Home</h3>
<p>When out partying or out for dinner, only take a certain amount of cash, once it&#8217;s gone it&#8217;s gone. Your pocket, and your head, will thank you in the morning.</p>
<h3>42. Bargain &#8211; it&#8217;s expected in many countries</h3>
<p>But don&#8217;t over bargain. 50 cents is nothing to you, but may mean a days worth of meals to the person you are haggling with.</p>
<h3>43. Pre-Paid Travel Money Cards</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/prepaid-travel-money-cards/" target="_blank"><strong>Using pre-paid travel money cards</strong></a><strong> </strong>can save you on transaction fees and currency conversion rates (you can lock in a conversion rate) and is a safe and convenient way to carry your money.</p>
<h3>44. Shopping</h3>
<p>Shop for souvenirs, clothes and food where the locals shop. Look for weekend markets and outlet stores.</p>
<h3>45. Laundry</h3>
<p>Wash as much of your laundry as you can by yourself by hand, instead of pumping money through laundromats or using expensive hotel laundry services. Better still, stay in apartments that have washing machines included.</p>
<h3>46. Free Phone Calls</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.vonagemobile.com/apps/vonage-mobile-app.php" target="_blank"><strong>Vonage Moblie has an app</strong></a> that allows for free talk, text, and photo sharing worldwide, available on iPhone and Android.</p>
<p>If you have access to the internet here are two great options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.skype.com/apps/tracking/commissionjunction.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eskype%2Ecom%2Fgo%2Fgetconnected%3Fcm%5Fmmc%3Daffiliate%2D%5F%2Dcommission%5Fjunction%2D%5F%2Dbanner%2D%5F%2Dskype%5Fkey%5Ffeatures_pid=%zp" target="_blank">Skype</a></strong> is an internet based phone service that lets you call other skype users around the world for <strong>FREE. </strong>Just get a web cam.<strong><br />
</strong></li>
<li>If you are on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109859598166821255303/posts" target="_blank"><strong>Google+</strong></a> use hangouts to video call for free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>47. Internet Access</h3>
<p>When booking accommodation one of the first things we look for is <strong>free WiFi</strong>. In cities and towns seek out free wifi spots at cafes, libraries and hot spots.</p>
<p>If using an internet cafe access can be painfully slow, and if you are paying by the minute it can get expensive. If you have a laptop, pre-write out all your email responses before hand.</p>
<h3>48. How Strong is Your Currency?</h3>
<p>Think about traveling to countries where your currency is stronger and you will get more bang-for-your-buck. For us as Australian&#8217;s Asia, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and currently the USA offers good value!</p>
<h3>49. Compare Car Hire Prices</h3>
<p>We use sites that search all the major car hire companies around the world checking which supplier is offering the best prices for the date you need it. Two sites we use include <a href="http://www.traveljigsaw.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Travel Jigsaw</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.vroomvroomvroom.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>VrommVroomVroom.</strong></a></p>
<h3>50. Improve the Efficiency of Your Car</h3>
<p>When <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/road-trips-planning-guide/" target="_blank"><strong>taking road trips</strong></a><strong> </strong>make sure your car is operating efficiently and is fully serviced. Some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the pressure of your car tires.</li>
<li>Drive slower.</li>
<li>Use the right oil to increase mile usage.</li>
<li>Watch your luggage – the heavier the car the more fuel you’ll use.</li>
<li>Pack inside your car not on top.</li>
</ul>

<h3>51. Stay Local<strong><br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling doesn&#8217;t have to involve long flights and extensive road trips. A great way to <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/about-us-2/how-to-travel-more/" target="_blank"><strong>bring more travel into your life</strong></a> is by exploring new areas in your local region. Climb a new mountan, visit a new cafe or market, go kayaking in a nearby river, take a day trip to a new town.</p>
<h3>52. Do the FREE Stuff</h3>
<p>Many things to see and do are absolutely free:</p>
<ul>
<li>See a street fair, concert, or cultural event.</li>
<li>Catch a magnificent sunset or sunrise</li>
<li>Take a walk or bike ride.</li>
<li>Play in the park.</li>
<li>Free movie screenings in local cafes and hostels</li>
<li>Swim at the beach or lake.</li>
<li>Climb a mountain.</li>
<li>Visit a market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hit the street with your feet and get lost in a city or town. It&#8217;s amazing what you&#8217;ll discover around every corner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hands up if there is something you really want to do with your life, but you haven’t done it because you can’t figure out the hows?</p>
<h3>My hand is raised too.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how powerful the urge is, the <em>“How am I going to make this work”</em> roadblock can send us cowering in the trenches and waving goodbye to that life we just knew we would love.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty ridiculous right?</p>
<p>I’m not one to get bogged down in details; I&#8217;m more of a big picture person, which serves me well when working to make my dreams come to life.</p>
<p>I see the ultimate goal and go for it because I know:</p>
<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28957" alt="Marie Forleo quote" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Marie-Forleo-quote.jpg" width="600" height="900" /></h2>
<p><a href="http://rhhbschool.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Marie Forleo</strong></a> introduced me to this phrase recently and I realised I’ve been following this advice all my life. (If you don’t know her she is an amazing marketer who runs <a href="http://rhhbschool.com/" target="_blank"><strong>B-School</strong></a>, this fantastic course I have recently joined).</p>
<p>If you spend all your time and energy trying to figure out everything before you even start, you’ll never start.</p>
<p>It’s truly not as easy as it sounds, but it is also even easier.</p>
<p>Hmm. Try and figure that one out?</p>
<h2>The hard part</h2>
<p>It’s not easy because relying on this concept means you have to have a lot of confidence in yourself and faith in your dreams.</p>
<p>That’s the hard part. From an early age society loves to tell us we don’t know it all and to look to the experts before trusting the innate wisdom you hold.</p>
<p>We should be letting our urges and intuition guide us.</p>
<h2>The easy part</h2>
<p>If you have a dream to travel the world, or a desire itching you from deep within, that is your inner knowing telling you to follow and do.</p>
<p>That place of confidence is what you must dive into. Put your faith in the calling and go for it.</p>
<p>Forget all the things that can go wrong, forget the how am I going to make it happen. Just put one foot in front of the other and figure it out as you go along &#8211; the easy part.</p>
<p>Some of you are booking your travel tickets right now. Others need more hand holding and convincing. Sometimes we need to build confidence as we go. Take small steps and hold someone’s hand &#8211; a relatable person who has done what you want to do.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If they can do it, you can do it.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>This empowering phrase has driven and empowered me to live the life of my choosing.</p>
<p><strong>If someone else can do it why not me?</strong></p>
<p><em>If I can do it so can you. I am no more special than you are; I just figured it out along the way.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes you just gotta throw yourself in the deep end to convince yourself you can.</p>
<h2>Throwing myself in the deep end of travel</h2>
<p>When I first moved to London I was 21. I had not long graduated from University and had never lived on my own. I had some independence and self-confidence, but my parents were mostly looking after my needs.</p>
<p>I travelled first through Indonesia with two girlfriends. Thanks to a badly infected foot, I left early and moved to London. I had no money, no job, no place to stay and a badly infected foot. (You can read about it<a title="Arriving in London Alone and Without Any Money" href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/arriving-in-london-alone-and-without-any-money/" target="_blank"><strong> here</strong></a>).</p>
<p>I cried when there was no one around; I was so scared and lonely. But, out in public, I put on my brave face and said, “You’ve got this.”</p>
<p><strong>One foot after the other.</strong> I figured it out and 15 years later I am still going.</p>
<p>Stop for a minute and think about the inner power you tap into when you arrive in one of the biggest metropolises in the world with nothing but a backpack and a few dollars in your wallet, and then survive.</p>
<h2>What did I rely on?</h2>
<p>I knew I was capable of working. I had a working holiday visa, I also had a degree (yet no experiences), I had hospitality experience, and I knew how to work hard.</p>
<p>I had an acquaintance in London I could phone to see if she could lend me a couch to sleep on. They call it couch-surfing now, back then it was <strong>dossing.</strong> I phoned terrified, but her warm friendly voice soon took those fears away. I stayed with her and soon found my feet. She’s one of my best friends to this day.</p>
<div id="attachment_29020" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 704px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/everything-is-figureoutable/scan0066-l/" rel="attachment wp-att-29020"><img class="size-full wp-image-29020" alt="Teaching in London, 1997" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/scan0066-L.jpg" width="694" height="600" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Teaching in London, 1997</p></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Everything is figureoutable.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of years later, I broke up the disastrous relationship I had with my South African boyfriend.  I decided to leave London. But go where? And with what?</p>
<p><strong>What did I rely on?</strong></p>
<p>My brother, who had been traveling for years before me. New York or Dublin? He advised me Dublin would be easier. It was closer to London, he had contacts that could possibly help me find work, it wasn’t as big, and I should enjoy the craic.</p>
<p>So I went. Again in the space where no one was watching I cried. A lot. This time I was an emotional wreck. I had 70 Irish punt in the bank, no friends, no place to stay, and no job.</p>
<p><strong>What did I do?</strong></p>
<p>Relied on my ability to work. I forced myself to walk into bars and ask for work. I had zero confidence, but I knew I had to suck it up and swim. I was tired of sinking.</p>
<p>That evening I started my first shift in one of the busiest bars in Temple Bar. I was crap at serving Guinness—a sin in Ireland. An all in brawl started as I was collecting glasses and I ducked just in time before copping a flying fist to the face.</p>
<p>My manager was a jerk and we had a shouting match. He sent me upstairs to help out in the busy restaurant. I worked my butt off and asked the manager if I could work there instead of the bar. She said yes.</p>
<p>Every evening I walked out with a wallet overflowing with tips. My best friend soon moved over to join me. We found a flat share and made some amazing friends. It was one of the happiest times of my travel life.</p>
<div id="attachment_29021" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 810px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/everything-is-figureoutable/scan0039/" rel="attachment wp-att-29021"><img class="size-full wp-image-29021" alt="Enjoying a pint with my best friend Bec" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/scan0039.jpg" width="800" height="537" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoying a pint with my best friend Bec</p></div>
<blockquote><p>Everything is figureoutable.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How to trust yourself</h2>
<p>Now, I am happy to travel to a destination on a whim. Without knowing anything, without even having much money in the bank. I trust myself.</p>
<p>I know all I have to do is fall back on my skill levels. What do I know? What can I do? Who can I turn to?</p>
<p>I trust I am empowered enough to figure it out.</p>
<h2>Figuring it out to create your ultimate lifestyle</h2>
<p>I now apply this way of thinking to my business. I started not knowing a thing about <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/to-all-new-travel-bloggers/" target="_blank"><strong>travel blogging</strong></a>, writing, social media, or even networking.</p>
<p>Whenever an opportunity arose, which meant us progressing to another level, I said yes and then in my quiet spaces either cried or said, <em>“Shit. I don’t know how to do this.”</em></p>
<p>But, one thing I do know is that <strong>Everything is figureoutable. </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.beautifulyoubyjulie.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Julie Parker</strong></a>, </strong>a life coach I&#8217;ve recently met through B-School described it beautifully.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-28949" alt="inspiring quote" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/inspiring-quote.jpg" width="488" height="600" /></p>
<p>Craig and I have been focused on getting ourselves into mainstream media. We know that it is the next step up for us. But, it is pretty damn scary (not to mention difficult).</p>
<p>Last week we were asked by the producer of 702 ABC radio in Sydney to chat about places to see in Sydney Harbour on their travel segment.</p>
<p><em>“We are looking at the undiscovered places that not many people will know about. Do you think you can do it?”</em> the producer asked over the phone.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Yes, sure.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you come in tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I had no idea what my schedule was. I just knew I could not say no. As I was saying yes, my mind was shaking,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Shit. I don’t know enough. How am I going to talk for 10 minutes? I haven’t been everywhere on the harbour. I think I only know the well-known places. Shit shit shit.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I was forced to fall back on what I know. I went through old blog posts and realized I actually did know more than I thought about undiscovered places. I had enough material to chat for 10 minutes. What I didn’t know I did a little research on.</p>
<h3>Phew.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I arrived. I took a deep breath, told myself “You’ve got this, just be yourself.” I chatted live on radio, only stumbled once, and was greeted with a smile and thumbs up when it was over.</p>
<p>(press play to hear the interview- Recording courtesy of &#8220;Mornings with Linda Mottram on <a href="http://abc.net.au/sydney" target="_blank"><strong>702 ABC Sydney</strong></a>&#8220;)</p>

<p>I had fun and I want to do more of it.</p>
<p>I was buzzing because I knew the new realm of confidence I leapt into would bring new opportunities.</p>
<p>When you shove aside the fears and just do what you truly want to do, the Universe will bring you what you want. You don’t need to have it perfect before you start.</p>
<h2>Everything is figureoutable.</h2>
<p>Listen to your heart and leap, the Universe will fly you to the perfect place.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Hands up if there is something you really want to do with your life, but you haven’t done it because you can’t figure out the hows?
My hand is raised too.
 

It doesn’t matter how powerful the urge is, the “How am I going to make this work” roadblock can send us cowering in the trenches and waving goodbye to that life we just knew we would love.

Sounds pretty ridiculous right?

I’m not one to get bogged down in details; I'm more of a big picture person, which serves me well when working to make my dreams come to life.

I see the ultimate goal and go for it because I know:

Marie Forleo introduced me to this phrase recently and I realised I’ve been following this advice all my life. (If you don’t know her she is an amazing marketer who runs B-School, this fantastic course I have recently joined).

If you spend all your time and energy trying to figure out everything before you even start, you’ll never start.

It’s truly not as easy as it sounds, but it is also even easier.

Hmm. Try and figure that one out?
The hard part
It’s not easy because relying on this concept means you have to have a lot of confidence in yourself and faith in your dreams.

That’s the hard part. From an early age society loves to tell us we don’t know it all and to look to the experts before trusting the innate wisdom you hold.

We should be letting our urges and intuition guide us.
The easy part
If you have a dream to travel the world, or a desire itching you from deep within, that is your inner knowing telling you to follow and do.

That place of confidence is what you must dive into. Put your faith in the calling and go for it.

Forget all the things that can go wrong, forget the how am I going to make it happen. Just put one foot in front of the other and figure it out as you go along - the easy part.

Some of you are booking your travel tickets right now. Others need more hand holding and convincing. Sometimes we need to build confidence as we go. Take small steps and hold someone’s hand - a relatable person who has done what you want to do.
If they can do it, you can do it.
This empowering phrase has driven and empowered me to live the life of my choosing.

If someone else can do it why not me?

If I can do it so can you. I am no more special than you are; I just figured it out along the way.

Sometimes you just gotta throw yourself in the deep end to convince yourself you can.
Throwing myself in the deep end of travel
When I first moved to London I was 21. I had not long graduated from University and had never lived on my own. I had some independence and self-confidence, but my parents were mostly looking after my needs.

I travelled first through Indonesia with two girlfriends. Thanks to a badly infected foot, I left early and moved to London. I had no money, no job, no place to stay and a badly infected foot. (You can read about it here).

I cried when there was no one around; I was so scared and lonely. But, out in public, I put on my brave face and said, “You’ve got this.”

One foot after the other. I figured it out and 15 years later I am still going.

Stop for a minute and think about the inner power you tap into when you arrive in one of the biggest metropolises in the world with nothing but a backpack and a few dollars in your wallet, and then survive.
What did I rely on?
I knew I was capable of working. I had a working holiday visa, I also had a degree (yet no experiences), I had hospitality experience, and I knew how to work hard.

I had an acquaintance in London I could phone to see if she could lend me a couch to sleep on. They call it couch-surfing now, back then it was dossing. I phoned terrified, but her warm friendly voice soon took those fears away. I stayed with her and soon found my feet. She’s one of my best friends to this day.


Everything is figureoutable.
A couple of years later, I broke up the disastrous relationship I had with my South African boyfriend.</itunes:summary>

<p>Are you looking for tips on <strong>things to do in Adelaide?</strong></p>
<p>As part of our <a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/city-guide/" target="_blank"><strong>city guides</strong></a> series, we interviewed Nicole Smith from <a href="http://www.bittenbythetravelbug.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Bitten by the Travel Bug </strong></a>who is an Adelaide native.</p>
<p>Nicole shares with us her <em><strong>insider tips</strong></em> on the best things to do in Adelaide, plus advice on where to eat, sleep, drink, shop and explore.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why Visit Adelaide?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide is often the ‘forgotten’ city of Australia or considered ‘for the old fogies’ because it’s more food and wine country. That said, Adelaide is one of the greenest cities in the world, the <strong>most affordable city in Australia</strong>, and we have a huge passion for sport and the arts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide has the best of everything Australia offers within 20-minutes of the city centre – who wouldn’t love that?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Best of all, there’s minimal traffic problems in Adelaide.</p>
<div id="attachment_28982" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-koala/" rel="attachment wp-att-28982"><img class="size-full wp-image-28982" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Koala.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">See koala&#8217;s and other Australian wildlife at Cleland Wildlife Park</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Things to Do in Adelaide</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Take in a game of cricket at Adelaide Oval</strong> &#8211; Widely considered the best pitch in the world by players and one of the few places where you can still sit ‘on the hill’ and have a picnic.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Spend an evening at Henley Beach</strong> &#8211; This has to be my favourite area of Adelaide. Beautiful clean beach that not many tourists frequent (they seem to head to dirty Glenelg), wonderful meals, and a great atmosphere in what is turning out to be quite an artsy neighborhood.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Take a wine tour</strong> &#8211; We’re mad about our wine and know that ours is the best in Australia – take that Victoria! I recommend either arranging for a short-stay in one of the wine regions – we have 18 to choose from whether you want to be near the water or close to the city – or doing a Wine tour with a reputable company, such as Groovy Grapes.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Enjoy Hahndorf</strong> &#8211; The oldest Germany community in Australia, Hahndorf hasn’t lost all of it’s old-style architecture or fun, and don’t forget to have a pint at the Hahndorf Inn.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Meet the locals at Cleland National Park</strong> &#8211; If you want to see some of Australia’s native flora and fauna, head to the Adelaide hills and see kangaroos and koalas up close.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Explore the River Torrens</strong> &#8211; The river that runs through the heart of the city is small but there is plenty going on. A hub for festivals, paddle boat for some fun, or take the Popeye river cruise.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Eat Haigh&#8217;s Chocolate</strong> &#8211; Whilst there is a shop in Rundle Mall, visit the <strong><a title="Haigh's Chocolate factory" href="http://www.haighschocolates.com.au/" target="_blank">Haigh&#8217;s factory on Greenhill Road</a></strong> to see chocolates being made and taste samples of this South Australian companies chocolate.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_28992" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-haighs-chocolate-factory-greenhill-road/" rel="attachment wp-att-28992"><img class="size-full wp-image-28992" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Haighs-Chocolate-Factory-Greenhill-Road.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chocolate time at Haigh’s Chocolate factory!</p></div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Mount Lofty</strong> &#8211; For a view across Adelaide this is the place to visit. It’s quite a way out so if you’re happy with something a little closer to town visit Windy Point instead.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Victor Harbour</strong> &#8211; Horse drawn carriages, fairy penguins and cute markets are found in this coastal town about two-hours out of Adelaide. Especially popular in summer with locals who own beach-side properties.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Kangaroo Island</strong> &#8211; Made famous by Oprah, Kangaroo Island is a wildlife paradise. Sea-lions, koalas, little penguins and of course a few kangaroos; Kangaroo Island is the perfect place to visit all year round. See a lavender farm, birds of prey display or taste the local produce, there&#8217;s plenty to do on this island.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Best Neighborhoods to Explore?</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hahndorf</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wander the main street and enjoy a proper German stout at the Hahndorf Inn, enjoy the leather or wood-craft stores, eat some lebkuchen (that is, gingerbread) or other traditional German cakes at the bakery, and enjoy the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you have time I highly recommend you walk or take the bus one stop out-of-town to the <strong>Beerenberg Farm</strong>. The jams and condiments made by Beerenberg can be found around Australia and internationally, and if it’s strawberry season you can pick your own berries to enjoy.</p>
<h3>Glenelg</h3>
<p>Connected to the city by Adelaide’s trams (and the historic carriages on the weekends), Glenelg is Adelaide’s busiest beach. Personally, I’d choose to visit <b>Henley Beach</b> if you want to escape the crowds and have clean sands, but you can’t go past the restaurants, bars, shopping and nightlife in Glenelg.</p>
<h3>Henley Beach</h3>
<p>Glenelg’s cleaner and quieter cousin, Henley Beach has white sands, volleyball courts, and quality restaurants and cafes – alongside the local fish&amp;chip and yiros/souvlaki stores.</p>
<p>Henley Beach is quite an artsy places with plenty of galleries along Seaview Road popping up and a weekend organic market.</p>
<h3>Rundle Street East<b> </b></h3>
<p>In the city centre, but if you’re looking for boutique stores, a range of pubs and plenty of great places to eat then Rundle Street East is your place to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be sure to check out the laneways as there are more galleries, more restaurants and more shops than just on the main road!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Where to Eat in Adelaide</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Restaurants</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Lenzerheide restaurant Adelaide" href="http://www.lenzerheide.com.au/index.php" target="_blank">Lenzerheide</a></strong> – celebrating Adelaide’s abundant fresh food and Swiss/Austrian cuisine, the Lenzerheide has taken home a slew of awards, including ‘Best European Restaurant’. Located 10 minutes out of the city the restaurant is easy to get to by public transport or car.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I highly recommend the potato &amp; leek soup and the chateaubriant (roasted beef tenderloin) at this somewhat pricey, but worth it, restaurant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Alphutte restaurant in Adelaide" href="http://www.alphutte.com.au/" target="_blank">Alphutte</a></strong> – comparable to the Lenzerheide (they were once sister restaurants), Alphutte brings German and Austrian cuisine to Adelaide. Centrally located on the corner of Pultney St and Wakefield St, the prices are quite expensive by Adelaide-standards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Estia Greek Restaurant in Adelaide" href="http://www.estia.com.au/" target="_blank">Estia</a></strong> – If you took my advice and headed to Henley Beach then Estia is the restaurant I’d recommend you dine at. Greek cuisine in Henley Square, tapas or single servings, a laid-back family atmosphere, and the sounds of the beach in the background – do I need to say more?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I recommend the Tis Skaras Arnaki (marinated grilled chicken) and loukoumathes (honey puffs) for dessert.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spats</strong> – blink and you’ll miss it; Spats on King William Road, Hyde Park is fast becoming the locals favourite dinner and late night café and restaurant. Serving Eastern European food, I wasn’t blown away by it but for the prices it’s worth a visit. My tip would be to eat elsewhere and come for drinks and dessert.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Goodlife Pizza Adelaide" href="http://www.goodlifepizza.com/" target="_blank"><strong>GoodLife Pizza</strong></a> – Hutt Street has plenty of choices but I go for cheap and cheerful Good Life pizza any day of the week. Wood oven fired organic pizza which not only is healthy but tasty – perfecto.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dumpling King</strong> – A student favourite in China town. Cheap, cheerful, and tasty Chinese food on a budget. The dumplings aren’t standout but when you’re paying AU$6 for a plate of 15, I’m not complaining. Top picks are the pork dumplings and the silver thread loaf.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a title="Joy Discovery Cafe Restaurant" href="http://www.joydiscoverycafe.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Joy Discovery Vegetarian Cafe</strong></a> &#8211; A really simple Vegetarian restaurant just off of Rundle Street East on Bent Street (next to American Apparel). Highly recommend one of their curries and some samosas!</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_28983" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-chocolate-bean-union-street/" rel="attachment wp-att-28983"><img class="size-full wp-image-28983" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Chocolate-Bean-Union-Street.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Welcome to chocolate heaven at the Chocolate Bean Cafe</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Cafes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Chocolate Bean cafe Adelaide" href="http://www.chocolatebean.com/" target="_blank">Chocolate Bean</a></strong> – have you ever wanted to try chocolate soup? Well this is the place to do it. Located on Union Street, just off of Rundle Street East, they serve great sandwiches and chocolate everything! They’re also vegan and vegetarian friendly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Cibo Espresso cafe in Adelaide and Queensland" href="http://www.ciboespresso.com.au/" target="_blank">Cibo Espresso</a></strong> &#8211; Alright, I’m not much for chains but in Adelaide Cibo does coffee best. Located through the city and metropolitan area and expanding rapidly into Queensland and other Australian states, their coffee knocks all of the competition out of the water.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_8293" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://bittenbythetravelbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adelaide-Zambreros-Rundle-Street-East.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8293" alt="Zambreros Mexican Adelaide" src="http://bittenbythetravelbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adelaide-Zambreros-Rundle-Street-East.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Grab a late night Mexican feast at Zambreros</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Late Eats</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Vilis Pies and Cakes in Adelaide" href="http://www.vilis.com/vilis-cafe/" target="_blank">Vilis Pies &amp; Bakery</a></strong> &#8211; Vili’s is an Australian icon and it started business in Adelaide. Forget fast food if your hungry at night, Vili’s Café’ which is just outside the city on Manchester St, Mile End is the place to go for a meat pie and frog cake. It’s not just the pies and cakes we love, the owner – Vili Milisits – is an icon around Adelaide who doesn’t let it get to his head by participating in on air pranks (he has his own rap!) and most days you’ll find him manning the fryer in the café.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><a title="Zambrero" href="http://www.zambrero.com/" target="_blank">Zambreros</a></strong> &#8211; gourmet Mexican food. I&#8217;m talking close to foot-long burritos burritos made in front of you. There are two great things about Zambreros: 1. they&#8217;re open late. 2. They can serve beer and tequila!</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Where to Drink in Adelaide</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong><a title="Coopers Brewery Adelaide" href="http://www.coopers.com.au/" target="_blank">Cooper&#8217;s Brewery</a> &#8211; </strong>Located in Mile End, the brewery offers tours of the enormous factory that makes SA’s favourite beer.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong><a title="The Duke of York Hotel Adelaide" href="http://www.dukeofyork.com.au/" target="_blank">The Duke</a> (of York)</strong> &#8211; Cheap pizzas throughout the week, a beer garden out the back and DJ + dance floor upstairs Thursday til Sunday makes it the perfect place to hang and have a good time.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong><a title="Zhivago Adelaide" href="http://zhivago.com.au/" target="_blank">Zhivago</a></strong> &#8211; One of Adelaide’s newest and perhaps most edgy club, Zhivago is one of the hottest places to be and perfect for the inner hipster.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong><a title="The Austral bar in Adelaide" href="http://www.theaustral.com.au/" target="_blank">The Austral</a></strong> &#8211; if you want a pub, a real pub, with a pub atmosphere, the Austral on Rundle Street East is the place that you need to go. Three areas, a few video games, seating out the front and a bar – what more do you need?</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_28984" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-austral-hotel-rundle-street-east-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-28984"><img class="size-full wp-image-28984" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Austral-Hotel-Rundle-Street-East1.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Austral – a great pub on Rundle Street East</p></div>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong><a title="Boho bar" href="http://www.bohobar.com.au/" target="_blank">Boho Bar</a></strong> &#8211; risqué and circus themed, Boho bar on the bottom of Unley Road is a feast for all of your senses. Come for a meal, drink, or one of their Halloween extravaganzas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Where to Stay in Adelaide</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re looking for a central location that’s <strong>budget friendly</strong> my top choice would be<strong> <a title="Adelaide Central YHA" href="http://www3.yha.com.au/hostels/sa/adelaide/adelaide-backpackers-hostel/" target="_blank">Adelaide Central YHA</a></strong>. Located in Light Square it’s a two blocks to Rundle Mall – Adelaide’s main shopping strip and there are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re after <strong>luxury</strong> in Adelaide then you can’t go past the<strong><a href="http://www.icadelaide.com.au/" target="_blank"> Intercontinental Adelaide</a></strong>. On North Terrace, you are a stone throw away from Adelaide’s main sights – the Torrens River, Rundle Mall, the museums, and even Adelaide Zoo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are wanting a beachside getaway be sure to enquire about two properties that <strong><a title="Oaks" href="http://www.oakshotelsresorts.com/glenelg-accommodation/" target="_blank">Oaks</a></strong> have at Glenelg. One is on the water and Marina whilst the other is one street back. Offering larger apartment-style rooms it is a great choice for families looking to stretch out and relax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If <strong>boutique</strong> is more your style then I’ve heard good things about the <a title="Clarion Hotel Soho Adelaide" href="http://www.clarionhotelsoho.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Clarion Hotel Soho</strong></a>. Slick, sexy and modern, the Clarion Hotel Soho is perfect boutique hotel for a couple’s getaway.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Markets and Shopping in Adelaide</h2>
<p>My personal favourite type of shopping is through little boutiques and <strong>King William Road, Hyde Park </strong>and <strong>Rundle Street East</strong> take the cake for choices. King William Road can be a little higher priced but check out Wild Child for a great range, though sizes do run small.</p>
<p>Rundle Street has big name bands like Australian designer Lisa Ho and Zimmerman to favourite miss gladys sym choon and alternative chain, Dangerfield. There are also some quirky boutiques in the backstreets including Mid-West Traders.</p>
<div id="attachment_28993" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-shopping-ms-gladys-sim-choo-rundle-street-east-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-28993"><img class="size-full wp-image-28993" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Shopping-Ms-Gladys-Sim-Choo-Rundle-Street-East1.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Go shopping at Miss Gladys Sym Choon on Rundle Street East</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Adelaide love their markets</strong>, but the one closest to our heart has to be <strong><a title="Adelaide's Central Markets" href="http://www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au/" target="_blank">Adelaide’s Central Market</a></strong>. Open Monday to Saturday the restaurant is home to fresh produce from across the state, an array of boutique stalls, as well as a camera store and second-hand book seller. If you want a quick, cheap, fresh bite then this is the place to go.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide also has a <strong><a title="Adelaide Farmers Market" href="http://www.asfm.org.au/" target="_blank">Farmers Market</a></strong> at the Wayville Showgrounds. Farmers from across the state come every Sunday to sell their produce and cut out the middle man, meaning you get great tasting produce and get to support farmers from around the state. There’s everything from fruit &amp; veg to baked goods, bottled cordials and small goods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If <strong>fashion and design</strong> are more your style then the <strong><a title="Gillies Street Market" href="http://gillesstreetmarket.com.au/" target="_blank">Gillies Street Market</a></strong>, which happens twice a month, will be a winner with you. Find your inner vintage goddess amongst live music and food stalls.</p>
<div id="attachment_8296" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://bittenbythetravelbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adelaide-Farmers-Market-Cordial-Tasting.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8296" alt="Adelaide Farmers Market" src="http://bittenbythetravelbug.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Adelaide-Farmers-Market-Cordial-Tasting.jpg" width="730" height="550" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taste cordials and lots more at the Adelaide Farmers Market at Wayville Showgrounds</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Events and Festivals in Adelaide</h2>
<p>January we play host to the <a title="Tour Down Under" href="http://www.tourdownunder.com.au/" target="_blank"><b>Tour Down Under</b></a>. Forgiving all the locals who will done lycra and think they are the next Cadel Williams, Adelaide puts on a good show. Think outdoor parties by the Torrens River, a big parade welcoming the athletes, 7-days of intense racing through the best areas of South Australia, and of course – street parties, the chance for many of the neighborhoods that riders will start/finish in to host a party and celebrate what’s best in that area.</p>
<p>For four weeks during February and March Australia’s largest arts event, the <a title="Adelaide Fringe Festival" href="http://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/" target="_blank"><b>Adelaide Fringe Festival</b></a> comes to town. Similar to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Adelaide opens its doors to artists from around the world to share their art forms – cabaret, comedy, circus, dance, film, theatre, puppetry, music, visual art and design.</p>
<div id="attachment_28987" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-fringe-festival-hans/" rel="attachment wp-att-28987"><img class="size-full wp-image-28987" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Fringe-Festival-Hans.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Adelaide Fringe Festival is a flurry of dance, cabaret, circus and comedy – favourite show has to go to ‘Hans’</p></div>
<p>The <a title="Clipsal 500" href="http://www.clipsal500.com.au/" target="_blank"><b>Clipsal 500</b></a> is the beginning of a busy March. V8 supercars turn the cities East into a race track. It&#8217;s not just the V8 Supercars that will take to the track as the GT championship is back in 2013, as well as playing host to the Dunlop racing series.</p>
<p><a title="Womadelaide" href="http://www.womadelaide.com.au/" target="_blank"><b>WOMADelaide</b></a>, the dance, music and arts festival is held mid-March. A unique music experience runs over four days in the cities Botanic Park and show cases performances and workshops by the best traditional and contemporary musicians, dancers and DJs.<br />
WOMADelaide also has a very cool ‘Taste the World’ cooking program and environmental discussion forum, and supports a number of charitable causes. Best of for families, all kids 12 and under get free entry into the festival!</p>
<p>If contemporary and traditional isn’t the beat to your drum I highly recommend checking out the <a title="Future Music Festival" href="http://www.futuremusicfestival.com.au/" target="_blank"><b>Future Music Festival</b></a>. A one-day festival from noon til 10pm, Future Music Festival showcases the best of up &amp; coming or the summers top performers. This year features big name performers like The Prodigy, Bloc Party, Dizzee Rascal, Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding, Fun, The Temper Trap and Psy – and that’s not even half the line up!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide is also home to the <strong><a title="Schutzenfest Adelaide" href="http://schutzenfest.com.au/" target="_blank">Schutzenfest</a></strong> in January – the cities equivalent to a German beer fest; the <strong><a title="Adelaide Festival" href="http://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/2013/index" target="_blank">Adelaide Festival</a></strong> , an arts festival which runs alongside the Fringe Festival in March, and the <strong><a title="Adelaide Cabaret Festival" href="http://www.adelaidecabaret.com/" target="_blank">Adelaide Cabaret Festival</a></strong> in June. There&#8217;s also the <strong><a title="Adelaide Fashion Festival" href="http://adelaidefashionfestival.com.au/" target="_blank">Adelaide Fashion Festival</a></strong> in October for the fashionistas among us!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Getting Around Adelaide</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re in the city centre it’s pretty easy to walk around between the main sites or take the <strong><a title="Adelaide Connector Bus" href="http://www.adelaidecitycouncil.com/community/your-transport-options/free-connector-bus/" target="_blank">free connector bus</a>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re heading to <strong>Glenelg</strong>, from one side of the city to the other, King William Road, or the Entertainment Centre, I recommend you take the <strong><a title="Adelaide Metro Tram" href="http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/routes/Tram" target="_blank">tram</a></strong>. It’s one route so easy to get on or off, and if you’re travelling through the city its free!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I’d recommend visitors use buses to get around but to make your own decision check out the <strong><a title="Adelaide Metro website" href="http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/" target="_blank">Adelaide Metro website</a> </strong>or visit the Adelaide Metro store on the corner of Currie Street and King William Street in the city to plan your journeys.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Finding WiFi in Adelaide</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide isn’t the most WiFi friendly city. I’d say that all hotels and hostels will have WiFi, and many cafes will but it won’t be the best quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re having connection problems I’d check out China Town and Grote Street as there is quite a few Internet cafes, otherwise check out <a title="Internode hotspots Adelaide" href="https://hotspot.internode.on.net/coverage/index.php" target="_blank">I<strong>nternodes Hot Spot</strong></a> locations for cafes that offer free WiFi.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Best Time of Year to Visit Adelaide</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Little tip from a local – <strong>visit between January and March</strong>. Not only will you get the best weather but this is when Adelaide really shines and proves that it can compete with Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
<div id="attachment_28988" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-henley-square-beach/" rel="attachment wp-att-28988"><img class="size-full wp-image-28988" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Henley-Square-Beach.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Henley Beach is stunning in the summer time!</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Getting There and Away?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide is a big city and serviced by all Australian airlines (Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar), including many regional ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting from the airport to the city is easy. It’s about AU$15-20 for a taxi or there are <strong><a title="Airport jet bus service Adelaide" href="http://www.adelaidemetro.com.au/Timetables-Maps/Special-Services/JetBus-Airport-Service" target="_blank">airport JetBus</a> </strong>services from the city and many surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you prefer the scenic route, Adelaide is the heart of many of the overland train journeys offered by <strong><a title="Great Southern Rail" href="http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/site/home.jsp" target="_blank">Great Southern Rail</a>.</strong> Take the Ghan from Adelaide to Darwin, via. Alice Springs; The Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth, via Adelaide; the Overland from Melbourne to Adelaide; or the Southern Spirit from Adelaide to Brisbane, via. Melbourne.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trains get into the station at Mile End, and though only minutes from the city I recommend you take a taxi or catch a public bus from Richmond Road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you prefer taking the bus then they arrive at the Adelaide Central Bus Station. Two choices of operators are <strong><a title="Greyhound Australia" href="http://www.greyhound.com.au/" target="_blank">Greyhound Australia</a></strong> and <strong><a title="FireFly bus service" href="http://www.fireflyexpress.com.au/FFNew/Index.asp" target="_blank">Firefly</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Best &#8220;insiders&#8221; Tip</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want a view of the city, a great place for a picnic or somewhere to go ice blocking (yes, you sit on a rug on a huge piece of ice and hurtle down a hill!) then I recommend visiting <strong>Light&#8217;s Point</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_28989" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-lights-point-city-landscape/" rel="attachment wp-att-28989"><img class="size-full wp-image-28989" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-Lights-Point-City-Landscape.jpg" width="730" height="550" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Enjoy the view over Adelaide from Light’s Point</p></div>
<div id="attachment_28990" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 740px"><a href="http://www.ytravelblog.com/things-to-do-in-adelaide/adelaide-river-torrens-adelaide-uni/" rel="attachment wp-att-28990"><img class="size-full wp-image-28990" alt="Things to Do in Adelaide" src="http://www.ytravelblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Adelaide-River-Torrens-Adelaide-Uni.jpg" width="730" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Take a walk along the River Torrens or find a quiet spot for a picnic</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">I love Adelaide because ________?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adelaide has the beaches people travel to Sydney for, the arts &amp; culture of Melbourne, plenty of great food, but the laid back attitude of a small city/country town, which makes Adelaide a brilliant blend of everything I want in a city.</p>
