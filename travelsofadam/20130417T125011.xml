				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/103845216349114091071?rel=author">Adam Groffman</a></p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6282" alt="Persistal Signum" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/entrance-persistal-signum.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></p>
<p>It finally looks like spring has arrived in Berlin! Which means it&#8217;s time for some beer gardens and good ol&#8217; fashioned outdoor drinking. Last year I visited Berlin&#8217;s most surrealist bar and now that the weather&#8217;s good, I think you should too!</p>
<p><img alt="Wilde Renate" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/token-for-entrance.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></p>
<h1><strong>Peristal Signum</strong>: Berlin&#8217;s Labyrinth Bar</h1>
<p>Berlin&#8217;s most surrealist bar experience is right where you&#8217;d expect it to be—in the trendy Friedrichshain borough where all the American hipsters and drunk tourists hang out. Just a few blocks from some of Berlin&#8217;s most legendary nightclubs, the club <a href="http://www.renate.cc/" target="_blank">Wilde Renate</a> is a mismatched collection of buildings surrounding a small beer garden. An easy place to get lost in—even more so because there&#8217;s a purposely built labyrinth underneath the club.</p>
<p>The labyrinth, <a title="http://www.karmanoia.org/peristal" href="http://www.karmanoia.org/peristal" target="_blank"><strong>Peristal Signum</strong></a>, isn&#8217;t just an art installation but a full-on experience for the mind. It was designed haphazardly by three artists over nine months in 2010. The maze was built completely out of found scrap materials (kind of like everything else in Berlin) and includes everything from glass bottles to car parts.</p>
<p>I visited the labyrinth for the first time on a cool summer evening last year. It took over an hour before we could enter (there&#8217;s a queue—find the person taking down names, usually under the tree with the canoe). When I visited last year it was a Bosnian woman wearing a white headband.</p>
<p>She took mine and my friends&#8217; money, handed us each a surprisingly heavy gold-painted coin and told us she&#8217;d find us when it was our time to enter. In the meantime: beer.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6286" alt="Peristal Signum Berlin bar" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/peristal-signum.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></p>
<p>When my time to enter the labyrinth finally arrived, I was blindfolded and escorted to a small chamber beside a stairwell and told to simply &#8220;<em>follow the instructions</em>.&#8221; You enter the labyrinth one at a time—it helps to keep the mystery, I suppose. The world outside, all those people drinking beers and enjoying the summer evening, quickly disappeared from my mind. I was alone in a dark room. I can still remember the strange quietness that overcame me in the blindfolded walk to the dark room. It&#8217;s amazing what you hear when you can&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>With the blindfold removed, everything from then on just got&#8230;weird.</p>
<p>The purpose of the labyrinth is to drive people forward (developmentally, emotionally, physically) through a unique and truly one-of-a-kind experience. Everyone has a different experience inside because the labyrinth itself is so strange and bizarre. One person might find something another didn&#8217;t, and though there are a few parts of the maze that are impossible to avoid, everyone seems to come out of it in a different state of mind. Inside you might feel lost and alone, but then the labyrinth changes and suddenly you&#8217;re no longer alone, no longer scared, but ready. Ready to get out. Ready to move forward.</p>
<p>My recommendation: visit Peristal Signum with a friend. And be prepared for a night you won&#8217;t forget anytime soon. Please note: photos aren&#8217;t technically allowed inside. Here&#8217;s a sample of some of the weird stuff you&#8217;ll see in there, but be prepared for much, much more extreme environments.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6283" alt="Labyrinth Wilde Renate" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/inside-labyrinth1.jpg" width="900" height="675" /></p>

<p><strong>Persistal Signum</strong> is open Wednesday to Saturday, from 6pm to 10pm, at Salon zur wilden Renate, Alt-Strahlau 70, Berlin. Expect a wait to get inside. The cost when I visited was 10€.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/103845216349114091071?rel=author">Adam Groffman</a></p><p>When staying in Jerusalem a few months back, I had a few goals in mind for my return trip to Israel. One of them was to finally visit Hebron—a city in the West Bank predominantly Palestinian. The city&#8217;s history is one of the most complex and controversial in Israel, Palestine and the West Bank and has long been a center of strife.</p>
<p>The previous time I was in Israel, in 2011, I tried to visit Hebron on a tour with <a title="Breaking the Silence" href="http://travelsofadam.com/tag/breaking-the-silence/" target="_blank">Breaking the Silence</a>. They&#8217;re a left-wing peace/activist organization, but as I detailed in my previous report from <a title="Breaking the Silence tour of the South Hebron Hills" href="http://travelsofadam.com/2010/09/breaking-the-silence-tour-of-the-south-hebron-hills/" target="_blank">South Hebron Hills</a>, we weren&#8217;t able to visit on that particular tour because of recent conflicts.</p>
<p>Eager to see this hotly-contested city for myself, I was invited to take a day trip with Abraham Tours. The full-day tour departs every Wednesday, and while it&#8217;s not cheap (ILS 280 — about $75), it&#8217;s definitely one of the more interesting tours I&#8217;ve been on. <a href="http://abrahamtours.rezgo.com/details/33478/Hebron-City-of-Abraham" target="_blank">As the itinerary explains</a>, Abraham Tours&#8217; <strong>day trip to Hebron</strong> is a dual-narrative tour. The tour was founded by the group, <a href="http://jerusalempeacemakers.org/" target="_blank">Jerusalem Peace Makers</a> which is also responsible for an annual &#8220;hug&#8221; that takes place around the Old City of Jerusalem each year.</p>
<p>Run with Israeli and Palestinian guides (from in the respective neighborhoods, and with the chance to meet locals living in Hebron from both sides of the story, the tour doesn&#8217;t try to preach to you, but instead presents you with other people&#8217;s stories about Hebron&#8217;s history and life there today. The tour provides plenty of opportunities to ask questions and in fact, encourages difficult questions.</p>
<h3>A brief introduction to Hebron&#8217;s history</h3>
<p>Hebron is a religiously historical city. It is the sight of the <strong>Tomb of the Patriarchs / Abraham Mosque</strong>, where several prophets tombs lay. For thousands of years, Hebron was a peaceful city where Jews &amp; Arabs lived and worked together. With the first zionist waves in the late 1800s and early 20th century, the land that is today Israel &amp; Palestine (then it was under Ottoman rule) saw hundreds of riots and clashes between the two cultures. As our tour guide explained, the trouble started when in 1929, because of the riots elsewhere in the land, the Jewish defense forces (a precursor to the Mossad) wanted to arm the Jewish civilians of Hebron. Because they lived peacefully with their Arab neighbors, they turned down the weapons and, as riots spread, eventually the riots did come to Hebron. The 1929 riots saw 67 Jews murdered, though as our guide pointed out, not every Arab was against the Jews. There are as many stories of heroes and saviors as there are terrors and tragedies.</p>
<p>Throughout modern history, Hebron has been the sight of more controversy. Following the Oslo Accords peace treaty, Hebron was split in 1997 into two zones: H1 and H2. H1 areas of the city are under Palestinian control and H2 areas under Israel control. Today there are approximately 500 Jews living in Hebron, and 250,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>My thoughts on Israel and Palestine have been discussed to death on this website. As always, when it comes to travel within controversial areas, I recommend talking to as many people as possible. To ask questions, read reports, read the news, talk to the people living there. The political situation surrounding Israel and Palestine is far from any easy-to-understand narrative. The best you can do is try to understand it yourself by talking to as many people as possible. The <strong><a href="http://www.abraham-hostel-jerusalem.com/ABOUT/Article/tabid/158/ArticleId/59/language/en-US/Hebron-City-of-Abraham.aspx" target="_blank">Hebron Tour</a></strong> I took was a quick and easy introduction to both sides of the story. And a great chance to speak directly with people who are affected by their politics every day.</p>
<p>Below are my photos from the tour. While I usually limit how many photos I share in a blog, I felt it necessary to show a more complete picture from my day trip, hence the 38 photos in chronological order.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6230" alt="hebron-day-trip-01" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-01.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Taking the public bus from Jerusalem, you&#8217;ll know from the very beginning that this is a different kind of trip. A young Yeshiva woman read some of her prayers during the bus journey, not to mention the bullet-proof windows on the outside of the bus. It&#8217;s not necessarily a dangerous trip—even during these times—but there are certainly some aspects of this journey which make it different from most.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6231" alt="hebron-day-trip-02" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-02.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Taking the public bus from Jerusalem means you&#8217;re entering the part of Hebron under Israeli control, rather than the larger part of the city which is under full Palestinian control (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank#Palestinian_administration" target="_blank">Area A</a>). There was some construction going on near the Jewish school.</p>

<p>Our tour guide for the day, Eliyahu, was extremely knowledgeable and tried his best to be as objective as possible. He was very open to answering (or attempting to answer) any of our tour group&#8217;s questions. Even if I was skeptical of his objectivism at the beginning of the day, by the end he had me convinced!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6233" alt="hebron-day-trip-04" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-04.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Throughout Hebron, barbed wire and security cameras seemed to be just about everywhere.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6234" alt="hebron-day-trip-05" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-05.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Cages and walls block even doorways and staircases in Hebron.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6235" alt="hebron-day-trip-06" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-06.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>A sign printed by the Hebron settlers explaining the facts as they see them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6236" alt="hebron-day-trip-07" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-07.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>There are 32 checkpoints and 18 military towers in Hebron.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6237" alt="hebron-day-trip-08" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-08.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>The Hebron Skyline &#8211; can you spot the lone Palestinian flag?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6238" alt="hebron-day-trip-09" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-09.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Free Israel or Free Palestine?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6239" alt="hebron-day-trip-10" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-10.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>The Settler Spokesperson for the Jewish Community of Hebron, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wilder_(activist)" target="_blank">David Wilder</a>. In speaking with him, he said a few notable things: that living in Hebron is &#8220;considered a privilege&#8221; and he wants to &#8220;make sure Hebron has a Jewish presence.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6240" alt="hebron-day-trip-11" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-11.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Artists 4 Israel has painted many walls in the Jewish Community of Hebron—often with political objectives</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6241" alt="hebron-day-trip-12" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-12.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>This balcony is on Shuhada Street (see below). The street is home to many Palestinian shops which have been forced to close by the IDF because of security concerns. Because of this, the street has been nicknamed Apartheid Street, though Israelis in return call it Security Street. Only tourists and Jews/Israelis are allowed on the street.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6242" alt="hebron-day-trip-13" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-13.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>The deserted street. Call it what you want, but it was a depressing sight.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6243" alt="hebron-day-trip-14" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-14.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Another sign printed by the Jewish Community of Hebron</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6244" alt="hebron-day-trip-15" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-15.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Hebron is home to countless watchtowers and surveillance booths set up by the IDF army. There are over 2,000 IDF soldiers in Hebron.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6245" alt="hebron-day-trip-16" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-16.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Hebron is much more than the conflict. It&#8217;s also one of the most important ancient cities to the Abrahamic religions. This is the outside of the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6246" alt="hebron-day-trip-17" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-17.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>At the corner of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, allegedly once the entrance to the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6247" alt="hebron-day-trip-18" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-18.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Like most religious sites in Israel, there is extensive security. Metal detectors are also programmed to adhere to strict religious laws.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6248" alt="hebron-day-trip-19" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-19.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Once inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs &amp; Matriarchs, as a non-Israeli, I was allowed to enter the Abraham Mosque within the very same building.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6249" alt="hebron-day-trip-20" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-20.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>This is the tomb of Abraham, as seen from the Palestinian side of the building. It&#8217;s also visible from the Israeli/Jewish side.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6250" alt="hebron-day-trip-21" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-21.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>The Abraham Mosque was the sight of a massacre against Arabs. A lone gunmen in 1994 killed 29 people and wounded 124 others while praying in the mosque. The massacre in turn set off riots throughout Palestine which led to attacks by IDF soldiers. Like most stories heard in Hebron, there were two sides to this one as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6251" alt="hebron-day-trip-22" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-22.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6253" alt="hebron-day-trip-24" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-24.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>My tour guide through the Palestinian parts of Hebron&#8217;s Old City (H1), Ibrahim. Working with <a href="http://www.visithebron.ps" target="_blank">Visit Hebron</a>, Ibrahim was a great source of information and completely willing to speak openly and personally about his life.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6254" alt="hebron-day-trip-25" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-25.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Part of the Hebron tour includes lunch with a Palestinian family. A delicious home-cooked meal!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6256" alt="hebron-day-trip-27" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-27.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Our host during lunch, Ribki and his son and family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6257" alt="hebron-day-trip-28" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-28.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Hebron&#8217;s Old City and souq &#8211; it was actually much more lively in other areas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6258" alt="hebron-day-trip-29" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-29.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>In the Old City&#8217;s souq (market), is an ancient bathhouse converted into a museum with archaeological discoveries.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6259" alt="hebron-day-trip-30" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-30.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Parts of the souq in the Palestinian side of Hebron (H1) were surrounded by areas under Israeli control H2. We heard stories about settlers dumping trash and throwing waste on the market below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6260" alt="hebron-day-trip-31" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-31.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6261" alt="hebron-day-trip-32" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-32.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6262" alt="hebron-day-trip-33" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-33.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>If posted signs were any indication of who belonged to what, things would be even more confusing than they actually are.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6263" alt="hebron-day-trip-34" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-34.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Rubbish in the H1 area of Hebron&#8217;s Old City—apparently dumped by a family living above the market in the H2 area.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6264" alt="hebron-day-trip-35" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-35.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>In H1, we had tea with Abed (originally from Iraq) who told us the story of how his pregnant wife was killed just steps away from his home.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6265" alt="hebron-day-trip-36" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-36.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Stepping out of the H1 Hebron Old City souq, you immediately remember that this isn&#8217;t just a city tormented by its political situation: hundreds of thousands of people live and work here. With universities and modern infrastructure, there is much more to Hebron than just the conflict.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" alt="hebron-day-trip-37" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-37.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>Headed back to the H2 zone to catch our bus back to Jerusalem, it&#8217;s necessary to cross through a security checkpoint.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" alt="hebron-day-trip-38" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-38.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>The path leading up to the checkpoint had plenty of pro-Palestinian graffiti.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" alt="hebron-day-trip-39" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hebron-day-trip-39.jpg" width="620" height="413" /></p>
<p>A final sign points out the obvious separation that divides much of the political heart of Hebron. Some areas are controlled by Israelis, some by Palestinians. Jews aren&#8217;t allowed in some areas (usually by Israeli law) and Arabs aren&#8217;t allowed in others. One of the strangest parts of our tour was when Ibrahim, our Palestinian guide, pointed out an invisible line on the street we were walking on. He wouldn&#8217;t be permitted to walk any further despite any visible sign of a line or checkpoint. That was the end of the road for him.</p>
<p>Israel and Palestine are strange countries. It&#8217;s a land where foreigners have more mobility than the people who actually live there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/103845216349114091071?rel=author">Adam Groffman</a></p><p>If you couldn&#8217;t tell from my fairly philosophical (ie, rambling) posts of late, I was in serious need of some inspiration last week. So rather than my typical fail-safes of visiting museums or walking around, I opted to stay indoors. On Sunday night I curled up with my Kindle <em>(read my review of the <a title="Amazon Kindle Paperwhite review: travel tech that’s good for travelers" href="http://travelsofadam.com/2012/11/travel-review-amazon-kindle-paperwhite/">Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</a>)</em>, and opened one of my favorite childhood books: <strong>The Twenty-One Balloons</strong>.</p>
<p><a title="Twenty-One Balloons" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014240330X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=014240330X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=traofada-20" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" alt="21 balloons book" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/21-balloons-book-197x300.jpg" width="197" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a book obviously mean to inspire curiosity and an adventurous spirit among children. Published in 1947 and set in the 19th century, the book still is relevant today. The story focuses on one intrepid explorer, Professor William Waterman Sherman, and his desire to leave San Francisco behind and set off in a balloon to travel around the world. Once he sets off, though, a series of unfortunate events change his plans quite dramatically and he&#8217;s forced to make a crash landing—on what you would expect to be a deserted island in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In fact, he lands on the island of Krakatoa. When I first read the book, it was my first introduction to the Javanese island. <strong>Krakatoa</strong> is most famous for its volcano—which exploded in 1883 and is, to date, the loudest sound ever heard. The sound of the explosion was heard all the way in Australia and the tsunamis from the explosion killed nearly 40,000 people. If that doesn&#8217;t get your fingers trembling, I don&#8217;t know what will.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>If you&#8217;re looking for a good book about the Krakatoa explosion (from the non-fiction perspective), I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838590/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060838590&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=traofada-20" target="_blank">Simon Winchester&#8217;s book</a>. If you&#8217;re looking for information on what Krakatoa is like today and how you can visit, check out <a href="http://jackandjilltravel.com/visiting-krakatoa-and-krakatoa-facts/  " target="_blank">this blog post</a> from Jack &amp; Jill Travel.</em></p>
<p>So this book, The Twenty-One Balloons, it&#8217;s a fun story about this Professor who&#8217;s stranded on an island. Turns out the island (if you haven&#8217;t guessed, it&#8217;s Krakatoa pre-explosion) isn&#8217;t uninhabited and there are all these American families living there. The island is full of diamonds and the families (named by the letter of the alphabet) have all decided to create a utopian society, living off the wealth of the island. There are quite a few contradictions within the children&#8217;s novel. For one: there&#8217;s the contradiction between the importance of wealth (necessary for this utopia to exist), but then the fact that there&#8217;s no currency and no need for it among the society they&#8217;ve created for themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our only work now, besides cooking, is in trying to make life more pleasant for ourselves and for each other.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see, what I loved about this book as a kid is the focus on architecture and food in this utopian society. Each family is responsible for bringing a country&#8217;s culture to the island nation. There&#8217;s a Moroccan-themed house, an American townhouse, a French palace, and so on. The author, William Pene du Bois, illustrates several of these houses and their silly inventions (the children of Krakatoa created a merry-go-round which works with hot-air balloons) throughout the novel.</p>
<p>As a kid, I was always fascinated with inventions and architecture. I remember drawing and designing made-up houses. There was even a high school project in my world history class which involved creating a constitution and government plan for my very own island nation. There&#8217;s something adventurous and exciting about this kind of thinking, and I believe that&#8217;s why this book is one of many responsible for my wanderlust.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the people of Krakatoa are inspired by the Professor&#8217;s tales of home. Reminiscing on the past, they&#8217;ve got this to say about what home is:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suppose one doesn’t think of one’s home town in terms of streets and buildings as much as one does of personal associations, friends, and relatives.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>And like all good things, this story ends with an explosion</strong> (can you guess which?!). The book&#8217;s a good one, du Bois&#8217; illustrations are fanciful (and surprisingly came across well in my Kindle edition), and there&#8217;s much to be wondered about when finishing the story. It&#8217;s a short read; it&#8217;s a children&#8217;s book after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Buy it on Amazon (available as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014240330X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=014240330X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=traofada-20" target="_blank">paperback</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014240330X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=014240330X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=traofada-20" target="_blank">Kindle edition</a>).</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/103845216349114091071?rel=author">Adam Groffman</a></p><p><img class="alignright  wp-image-6213" alt="welcome to berlin" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/welcome-to-berlin-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" />I just returned from the first day (yay <a href="http://travelsofadam.com/tag/beginning/" target="_blank">beginnings</a>!) of my newest German language course here in Berlin. To say I was nervous before this class started would be a severe understatement. Just walking from my apartment to the u-bahn station today was nerve-wracking. I&#8217;ve been off-and-on (but mostly on) in Berlin for a long while now (too long to count) and my German is just&#8230;<em>schlecht. Sehr schlecht!</em></p>
<p><em><a href="http://travelsofadam.com/tag/learn-german-in-berlin/" target="_blank">Read my previous adventures of learning German in Berlin in the archives.</a></em></p>
<p>The past few weeks, in between German language lessons, my language skills have decreased dramatically. Not least because I holed myself up in a warm bed to avoid the <a title="Why you should visit Berlin…in the winter!" href="http://travelsofadam.com/2013/03/why-visit-berlin/" target="_blank">winter</a> that doesn&#8217;t seem to want to end. Then there&#8217;s this anxiousness I feel when trying to learn German. I&#8217;m not sure where it comes from—maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m worried about unavoidable mistakes, worried about making a fool of myself, or worse, of some sort of strange, German-language induced death. (It can happen, right??) Of course, as soon as I made my way into the school (this time it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.vhs.berlin.de" target="_blank"><strong>VHS</strong></a> if you&#8217;re counting), most of my fears dissipated.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s teacher (<em>Lehrerin</em>) wasn&#8217;t much older than me from what I could tell. The 14 or so other students didn&#8217;t try to eat my brains, nor did they laugh at my mistakes. No pit opened up to swallow me as soon as the wrong article <em>(der,die,das,den,who-really-cares?!)</em> sputtered from my tongue. In fact, as soon as the tennis ball landed in my hands and it was my turn to introduce myself, I was quite calm. And ready to give it my best.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><strong>But that&#8217;s when it hit me.</strong> This must be the umpteenth time I&#8217;ve had to introduce myself in a German language course. With my limited language skills, my introduction to the who/what/where I am is pretty fine-tuned at this point. When backpacking around the world, most travelers are already familiar with &#8220;<a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/15-things-i-hate-about-backpacking/" target="_blank">the same conversation</a>&#8221; where you repeat your story, over and over to new, fast friends and casual acquaintances. The travel questions that you have to answer when backpacking typically goes the likes of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Where are you from?</span></li>
<li>Where have you been?</li>
<li>Where are you going?</li>
<li>How long are you traveling for?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers can vary widely but the conversation does seem to get repetitive. In language class, however, the questions we have to answer about ourselves are this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are you from?</li>
<li>What/where is your family?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s your job?</li>
<li>What are your hobbies?</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s something worth noting about these two sets of questions. For one, the <strong>language questions</strong> are much more focused on who you are, things you cannot control. The <strong>travel questions</strong> are more about your experiences and the choices you&#8217;ve made. I&#8217;m not saying one&#8217;s better than the other, because even if I tried to say that, I wouldn&#8217;t believe myself, but I do think each set of questions has their significance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6212" alt="questions" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/questions.jpg" width="630" height="361" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Having to answer these questions about myself, however, has led me to some interesting answers. When I was backpacking, my <strong>travel answers</strong> were pretty clear-cut. I knew where I&#8217;d come from, and where I was going was pretty much always open for discussion. I knew how long I was traveling for, but was less sure how much longer the trip would last.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">My language answers, though, have been a whole other beast. I&#8217;ve got my location and my family down pat — that&#8217;s easy. It&#8217;s when I try to figure out how long I&#8217;ve been in Berlin, why I live here, and what exactly it is that I&#8217;m doing here—that&#8217;s where I run into trouble. How long have I been here? Off-and-on for over a year and a half, but with several long breaks. Sometimes I was working, sometimes I wasn&#8217;t. Now: defining my job is a tricky question and sometimes I&#8217;m not even sure what it is that I&#8217;m doing. My hobbies? I suppose it&#8217;s travel (or is that my job?).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It seems no matter which questions I answer these days, there&#8217;s always ambiguity. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a good or a bad thing, and <a title="Some rambling thoughts on living the 20-something life" href="http://travelsofadam.com/2013/04/20-something-life/" target="_blank">like I wondered aloud last week</a>, I don&#8217;t particularly mind that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. <strong>I&#8217;ll save the real answers for later and just focus on asking someone else the questions.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Who are you and what are you doing here? <em>Wer bist du und was machst du hier?</em></p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Puzzled looks on characters from the web series, The Outs—about 20-somethings living in Brooklyn</p>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling a bit funny today. Whether it&#8217;s because of the grey sky outside my window, my mind aflutter with ideas, or simply because I&#8217;ve been laying in bed for over an hour distracted by one too many emails, I don&#8217;t know. <em>Ich weiss es nicht.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday was one of those days where your mind is racing and you&#8217;ve got a million little ideas floating around—none of them will stick, likely, but it&#8217;s nice to have them, to collect them. Thoughts of the future, my goals, my seemingly non-existant plans for a future. I don&#8217;t know about you, but these are things that pop up in my mind all the time. And while I&#8217;m always <em>trying</em> to physically do things to achieve them, more often than not I just circle back around—lost and as confused as ever. And that is what&#8217;s about to happen with this blog post.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Is there anything worse than an elder (and by that I mean, anyone a day older than me) looking down upon you and treating you like a fool? Simply because you&#8217;re younger and therefore must be more naive? We&#8217;re supposed to treat people with respect, but so often I find people who don&#8217;t treat the younger generations with any modicum of respect. Simply providing veiled wisdom wrapped up in a friendly, &#8220;I know what&#8217;s best for you&#8221; tone. And I&#8217;m not talking about grandfathers and grandmothers. Everyone wants to impart their wisdom on a different generation. From the 30-somethings looking down upon the 20-somethings, the yuppies upon the hippies. And so on and so forth. Of course, it&#8217;s not all bad. And some people want the advice. But it&#8217;s that tone. That &#8220;I know you more than you&#8221; tone that destroys.</p>
<p>So how do I fight it? I listen to my peers. Maybe some call it peer pressure. And maybe it&#8217;s a bubble, but hey&#8230; we can figure this out together, can&#8217;t we? Sure it can be dangerous if you hang out with dangerous people. But it can also be beneficial if you&#8217;re brainstorming life, thinking about the world, with those that share your passion. This comes up all the time when backpacking. I remember weeks of sitting on Indian beaches, meeting and talking with travelers from the world over. We may have been different ages—from those in college to 40-somethings—but we were all on an adventure. We were looking for answers. Asking questions and listening. Not willing to say &#8220;this is the way&#8221; but instead we were thinking.</p>
<p>Thinking is a thing I really love to do. Perhaps I spend too much time thinking and not enough time doing. And that&#8217;s something I plan to work on. But for now: we&#8217;re thinking.</p>
<p>TV shows like &#8216;<em>Girls</em>&#8216; (I know, I know &#8211; I&#8217;m sorry for bringing up the series that everyone loves to talk about) seem to embrace this thinking mentality. It&#8217;s what attracted me to the show in the first place. It&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s written by a 20-something because it pretty much captures the crazy thoughts and ideas going through my mind. I mean, it&#8217;s a TV show so some of it is exaggerated obviously, but the mood and atmosphere of the show certainly match the mood and atmosphere of my life. Or at least of the life I&#8217;m working on building today. It&#8217;s no surprise that there have been so many reviews and criticisms of the show as much as of the writer. <em>Girls</em> pretty much dares to speak for the 20-somethings today—something no one else is going to do for us. And it does it pretty well, too.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another show I watched recently: <a href="http://theouts.tv" target="_blank">The Outs</a>. Again, it&#8217;s written by a 20-something in Brooklyn. It&#8217;s about—you guessed it: 20-somethings in Brooklyn. But this web series <strong>(available for free in its entirety online)</strong> is different. The show got its successful start through Kickstarter last year, and then hit the tipping point when it reached the gay media. I like it because its characters are <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/futures-the-outs-creator-writer-director-star-is-making-a-webseries-worth-talking-about" target="_blank">ones I can identify with</a>, but also because the characters seem as dysfunctional and confused as the actual people I know in my life—to a much more <em>real</em> degree than in <em>Girls</em>.</p>
<p>What keeps me enamored with these 20-something TV shows is that they&#8217;re not written by some stuffy person looking down upon my generation—but instead they&#8217;re <em>from</em> my generation. Listening to characters talk about not having enough money, about &#8220;blogging&#8221; (is that all we 20-somethings do these days?) or bitching and whining—this is my life. And I suspect it&#8217;s also a part of yours.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I realize I may not be on the side of the majority with this one, but I appreciate the inward-looking nature of my generation. I&#8217;m proud of the fact that I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing and that I&#8217;m trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just some punk kid (not a punk, fyi). One of these days I&#8217;ll finally figure out what I want out of life. And maybe then I&#8217;ll stop asking questions (don&#8217;t count on it). But for now, I just want people to stop telling me what to be or how to act. <strong>I am me.</strong> And I&#8217;m okay with that. I&#8217;ll figure something out.</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230;I&#8217;m rambling. You should just watch this web series. Because it &#8220;gets&#8221; me. And I get it. Plus each episode is full of sexy Brooklyn hipsters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By <a href="https://plus.google.com/103845216349114091071?rel=author">Adam Groffman</a></p><p>This winter in Berlin is really starting to drag on. The forecast even for early April includes snow days. Thankfully I spent seven winters living in Boston, which seems to have a similar weather pattern—cold and snowy for the vast majority of the year—so I&#8217;m somehow able to manage.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6182" alt="Berlin weather is terrible!" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/berlin-winter.png" width="270" height="176" /></p>
<p>Last spring, when winter was dragging on in Berlin, I took a day trip out to probably one of the weirdest places I&#8217;ve been in Germany. Traveling with my friend <a href="http://cherylhoward.com" target="_blank">Cheryl</a>, we left Berlin early on a Saturday morning with beers and McDonald&#8217;s for breakfast. The train ride wasn&#8217;t more than an hour and from the looks of some of the other people in our train carriage, we weren&#8217;t the only ones looking for a winter escape.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Islands_Resort"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6189" alt="indoor rainforest" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/biodome-germany-300x225.png" width="210" height="158" /></a>Stepping off the train right back into the chilly air, we boarded a free shuttle bus which drove us to&#8230; a tropical island? No, it was to a giant biosphere once used as a facility for building aircraft and other big things. I&#8217;ve also heard it&#8217;s where zeppelins were constructed, but that might be a myth. Upon approaching the giant hangar (the largest free-standing hall in the world), the sight is incredible. It really is massive. And without really knowing what the inside would be like, the whole situation just seems bizarre.</p>
<p>Essentially, <strong>Tropical Islands</strong> is a resort. In fact, it reminded me a lot of the <a href="http://travelsofadam.com/tag/great-wolf-lodge/" target="_blank">Great Wolf Lodge</a> I visited in my Texas hometown: a large indoor water-park that&#8217;s exceptionally kid-friendly. And for a tourist like me looking for something weird to do, Tropical Islands met all the crazy requirements!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6183" alt="Tropical Islands trip" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tropical-islands.jpg" width="630" height="367" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When entering you&#8217;re given a bracelet that tracks all your purchases in the resort. Cheryl and I opted to pay extra to visit the spa and sauna area. It was my very first trip to a German sauna, and as I quickly learned, Germans aren&#8217;t afraid of nudity. It was my first foray into public nudity&#8230;and to be completely honest—it wasn&#8217;t half-bad! It might&#8217;ve taken me a moment to get comfortable with the idea, but once I did, there was little turning back.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The rest of our day at Tropical Islands included water slides (see them in the distance in the photo above?) and lounging on the sandy beach. I also made a point to explore the entire resort so I could see just how bizarre this place was. There were themed areas (I especially liked the <a href="http://travelsofadam.com/tag/angkor-wat/" target="_blank">Angkor Wat</a> replicas because everything just seemed so out-of-place. In a strangely large, grey hangar in the German countryside. But hey! Once you embrace the silliness of a trip or a destination, it&#8217;s suddenly awesome. Cheryl and I enjoyed the afternoon exploring the Tropical Islands, I had a great Caesar salad (even if it was expensive) and we got to do some serious people-watching of Germans on a beach. Brill.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6185" alt="Caesar Salad" src="http://travelsofadam.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/caesar-salad.jpg" width="630" height="472" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Now you&#8217;re probably curious how much a day trip to a resort costs? Well, even if it was more expensive than how I would&#8217;ve spent my day in Berlin, for less than €80 I can&#8217;t complain much. It was an awesome experience and I&#8217;d definitely go again.

<p>*Note: An earlier version of this story included another myth about the building&#8217;s origins: that the Nazis constructed it as an airbase and hangar. Information on the Tropical Islands website is vague concerning the building&#8217;s origins.</p>
