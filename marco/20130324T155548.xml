&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is hard to trust Google anymore to make rational and consumer centric decisions. I said — nuanced as it might be — that I don’t trust Google to introduce new apps and keep them around, because despite what the company says, these apps are not their main business. Their main business is advertising and search — regardless of whatever nonsense you might read. &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I am far more likely to believe in and use products that are the main focus of the company behind them. Online storage? Dropbox. Time-shifting web content? &amp;#8230; Instapaper. Short form communication? Twitter. Baby pictures and wedding photos to make single people miserable (or happy for being single)? Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;The point is that a company whose main focus is a specific service or a singular product, like Evernote, is far more likely to focus its energies to build a business around it and keep it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a good distinction to make. I&amp;#8217;m more conservative about what I invest my time into and who I trust with my data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It might actually be good, or even better than Evernote. But I still won’t use Keep. You know why? Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;I spent about seven years of my &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/13/chris-wetherll-google-reader/"&gt;online life on that service&lt;/a&gt;. I sent feedback, used it to annotate information and they killed it like a butcher slaughters a chicken. No conversation — dead. The service &lt;a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/google-reader-still-sends-far-more-traffic-than-google"&gt;that drives more traffic than&lt;/a&gt; Google+ was sacrificed because it didn’t meet some vague corporate goals; users — many of them life long — be damned.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Looking from that perspective, it is hard to trust Google to keep an app alive. What if I spend months using the app, and then Google decides it doesn’t meet some arbitrary objective?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this business, you can&amp;#8217;t count on anything having longevity. To avoid new services that are likely to get shut down within a few years, you&amp;#8217;d have to avoid &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; new tech product. Products and services lasting more than a few years are the exception, not the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately for users, Google doesn&amp;#8217;t owe anyone a &amp;#8220;conversation&amp;#8221; about what they do with their products. Companies can do whatever they want. They could shut down Gmail tomorrow if it made business sense. There wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users have no power.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can complain about Google Reader&amp;#8217;s shutdown and start as many online petitions as we think will make a difference,&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but we all have short memories and can&amp;#8217;t resist free stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to really stick it to them? Stop using Google. All of it. Search, Gmail, Maps, the works. Delete your account and start using Bing. Ready?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That&amp;#8217;s the problem. You won&amp;#8217;t. I won&amp;#8217;t. Nobody will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just Google. Everyone does this. Facebook introduces some giant privacy invasion or horrible redesign every six months, then when its users &amp;#8220;revolt&amp;#8221;, they roll back &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of it, and everyone forgets about it because they got what they wanted: Facebook still accomplished most of what they wanted to do, and the users feel like they matter. Almost nobody left Twitter when they started screwing over their API developers, almost nobody switches away from iOS when Apple controversially rejects an app, and almost nobody stopped going to your corner deli after they raised the price of your favorite Thursday sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re not all evil or mean &amp;#8212; business owners often need to make decisions that anger some people. That&amp;#8217;s the nature of business, government, parenthood, and life. Facebook and Google need to collect more of your personal data and keep you on their sites longer so they can keep increasing their ad revenue. Twitter needs to take control of its product and its users&amp;#8217; attention away from third-party clients so it doesn&amp;#8217;t become an unprofitable dumb pipe like AOL Instant Messenger. Apple needs to keep the App Store locked down so people feel safe buying apps (and more iOS devices) and developers are forced to use Apple&amp;#8217;s services, APIs, and stores. Your corner deli needed to raise the price of your favorite Thursday sandwich because their health-insurance premium increased by 10% this year. The deli&amp;#8217;s health-insurance company needed to raise premiums by 10% because that&amp;#8217;s the most that New York State would permit, and how would the insurance company&amp;#8217;s CEO justify &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; taking that opportunity for more profits to the board and shareholders?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Keep will probably get as many users as Google&amp;#8217;s other low-priority side projects: not many. They&amp;#8217;ll probably shut it down within two years. A few people will complain then, too, and they&amp;#8217;ll be powerless then, too, but they&amp;#8217;ll keep using Google&amp;#8217;s stuff after that, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users need to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; trusting of specific products, services, and companies having too much power over their technical lives, jobs, and workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this business, &lt;strong&gt;expect turbulence.&lt;/strong&gt; And this is going to be increasingly problematic as (no turbulence pun intended) we move so much more to &amp;#8220;the cloud&amp;#8221;, which usually means services controlled by others, designed to use limited or no local storage of your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always have one foot out the door. Be ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t cynical or pessimistic: it&amp;#8217;s realistic, pragmatic, and responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you use Gmail, what happens if Google locks you out of your account permanently and without warning? (&lt;a href="http://ehsanakhgari.org/blog/2012-04-13/how-i-lost-access-my-google-account-today"&gt;It happens&lt;/a&gt;.) What if they kill IMAP support and you rely on it? Or what if they simply start to suck otherwise? How easily can you move to a different email host?&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; How much disruption will it cause in your workflow? Does your email address end in &lt;code&gt;@gmail.com&lt;/code&gt;? What would have happened if we all switched to Wave? What happens if Facebook messages replace email for most people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/19/free-works"&gt;Proprietary monocultures&lt;/a&gt; are so harmful because they hinder or prevent you from moving away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it&amp;#8217;s so important to keep as much of your data as possible in the most common, widespread, open-if-possible formats, in local files that you can move, copy, and back up yourself.&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And if you care about developing a long-lasting online audience or presence, you&amp;#8217;re best served by &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity"&gt;owning your identity&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing too heavily in someone else&amp;#8217;s proprietary system for too long rarely ends gracefully, but when it bites us, we have nobody to blame but ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has an online petition ever effected change? (The vague, unquantifiable, feel-good fallback of &amp;#8220;raising awareness&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t count.)&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down"&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t use Gmail&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t mind using Dropbox because it&amp;#8217;s compatible with responsible practices. If Dropbox goes away, you still have a folder full of files, and there will always be other ways to sync folders full of files between computers. Even if Dropbox&amp;#8217;s client somehow screws up and deletes all of its files, you can just restore them from a backup, because it&amp;#8217;s just a folder full of regular files on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most &amp;#8220;cloud&amp;#8221; companies or proprietary platforms cease to exist, they fall out of the sky like a plane without power, and everything is lost. Dropbox failing or ceasing to exist would be more like a train losing power: it stops moving, but everything&amp;#8217;s still there and everyone&amp;#8217;s fine, albeit mildly inconvenienced.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android has done little to radically disrupt the mobile industry.&lt;/strong&gt; The majority of power still belongs to the same telecom operators that ruled five years ago, and many of the same handset/component makers.&amp;nbsp;Google has helped Samsung boringly ascend and has accelerated decline at Nokia &lt;a href="http://www.splatf.com/2012/09/rim-share-chart/"&gt;and BlackBerry&lt;/a&gt;. It has perhaps stopped Apple from selling as many phones as it might in an Android-free world, and has helped prevent Microsoft from gaining a solid foothold in mobile. &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true that the carrier model hasn&amp;#8217;t been disrupted, and in fact, Android has helped strengthen it (and build an uncomfortably close, &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2010/08/google-verizon-propose-open-vs-paid-internets/"&gt;&amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221;-internet-hostile&lt;/a&gt; relationship between Google and Verizon Wireless).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back when the first iPhone was making a huge splash, when Google started taking Android seriously and quickly pivoted it from a BlackBerry ripoff into an iOS ripoff, I don&amp;#8217;t think they intended to disrupt the established carrier or retail models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was a &lt;em&gt;defensive&lt;/em&gt; move. Mainstream computing and internet usage were clearly moving away from PCs and toward mobile devices, and Google saw a potential future where their core business &amp;#8212; web search with their ads &amp;#8212; could be wiped out by a single Bing-exclusive deal on a dominant, locked-down platform.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google needs Android to have substantial market share to prevent any other platform vendor from ever locking Google&amp;#8217;s most important services out of a major part of mainstream computing. It&amp;#8217;s the same reason Chrome and Chrome OS exist. In an industry dominated by vertically integrated control freaks, &lt;a href="http://hypercritical.co/2013/03/19/self-reliance"&gt;everyone must become one&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that nobody else can lock them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flaw with the Android strategy is that, in practice, it doesn&amp;#8217;t prevent powerful manufacturers from forking it and cutting Google out. Google probably assumed that no single manufacturer would ever get powerful enough to create their own alternatives to Google&amp;#8217;s integrated apps, store, and services, and that Android would be deployed much like Windows on PCs: largely unmodified, with manufacturers all shipping almost the same software and differentiating themselves only in hardware. But as we&amp;#8217;ve seen already with Amazon and the Kindle Fire platform (and maybe soon, the powerful Samsung Galaxy line), that&amp;#8217;s not a safe assumption anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I agree with Frommer&amp;#8217;s conclusions: maybe big changes are on the horizon at Google to fix this. Old Google, in 2007, frequently toyed around with &amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221; projects that might not lead anywhere useful for the overall business. Old Google made Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx"&gt;New Google&lt;/a&gt; is much more strategic, cold, and focused. Let&amp;#8217;s see what they do to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concern isn&amp;#8217;t overly paranoid or unwarranted: it already happened with iOS 6 Maps. Sure, there&amp;#8217;s now a Google Maps app that you can download separately, but most iOS users aren&amp;#8217;t likely to bother, and it can never be as deeply integrated into other parts of iOS as Apple&amp;#8217;s native Maps service.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As it turned out, sharing was not broken. Sharing was working fine and dandy, Google just wasn’t part of it. People were sharing all around us and seemed quite happy. A user exodus from Facebook never materialized. I couldn’t even get my own teenage daughter to look at Google+ twice, “social isn’t a product,” she told me after I gave her a demo, “social is &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; and the people are on Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a year old, but it appears from the outside that it&amp;#8217;s still probably accurate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/20/why-i-left-google"&gt;&amp;#8734; Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>→ Why Android Updates Are So Slow</title><link>http://gizmodo.com/5987508/why-android-updates-are-so-slow</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://gizmodo.com/5987508/why-android-updates-are-so-slow</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 20:48:24 EDT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Good explanation of the process, but I think it gives too many of the involved parties a pass on their sluggish behavior. It seemingly asked the subjects, &amp;#8220;How long do you usually take to do each of these steps?&amp;#8221;, rather than &amp;#8220;How can you make this faster?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dismissing Apple&amp;#8217;s faster update speed with iOS as an &amp;#8220;illusion&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t hold up to scrutiny. Apple has released &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history#iOS_6.x"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; iOS updates to all still-supported devices in the last two months, with one bugfix update (6.1.1) appearing just nine days after the previous update. Apple has a much smaller pool of devices to test, but that can&amp;#8217;t be the only thing they&amp;#8217;re doing differently and the only way the Android ecosystem could improve this fairly severe problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better explanation of Android&amp;#8217;s slow update speed is buried in the article, but not given enough credence: Google doesn&amp;#8217;t do everyone&amp;#8217;s testing, so it&amp;#8217;s left to the manufacturers and carriers, who just don&amp;#8217;t give a shit about updating your year-old phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Consumers aren&amp;#8217;t completely powerless, though. Almost every phone on the market today can be rooted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Android way: Our problems become your problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/19/why-android-updates-are-so-slow"&gt;&amp;#8734; Permalink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free works</title><link>http://www.marco.org/2013/03/19/free-works</link><guid isPermaLink="false">/2013/03/19/free-works</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:03:12 EDT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;Google Reader&amp;#8217;s upcoming shutdown and Mailbox&amp;#8217;s rapid acquisition have reignited the discussion of free vs. paid services and whether people should pay for products they love to keep them running sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But users aren&amp;#8217;t the problem. As &lt;a href="http://jury.me/blog/2013/3/19/the-price-of-free"&gt;Michael Jurewitz wrote&lt;/a&gt;, many tech startups never even attempt to reach profitability before they&amp;#8217;re acquired or shut down. Nobody ever had a chance to pay for Google Reader or Mailbox.&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a free option is available in a market of paid alternatives, &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more people will choose the free product, often by an order of magnitude or more. Asking people to pay unnecessarily is asking them to behave irrationally and against their own immediate best interests, even if it&amp;#8217;s probably worse long-term. (This behavior affects far more than the tech industry.) And when the free product is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in some ways, which is often the case when a tech giant or well-funded startup enters a market previously occupied only by small and sustainable businesses, the others don&amp;#8217;t stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The risks are very low for new consumer tech startups because everything required to start one is relatively cheap and can often be ready to launch within a few months of starting development. If a product grows huge quickly, which almost always requires it to be free, it will probably be acquired for a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of money. Free products that don&amp;#8217;t grow quickly enough can usually die with an &amp;#8220;acquihire&amp;#8221;, which lets everyone save face and ensures that the investors get something out of the deal. Investors make so much from big acquisitions that they can afford to lose a lot of other unsuccessful products in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So even in the worst cases, free products don&amp;#8217;t usually end too badly. Well, unless you&amp;#8217;re a user, or one of the alternatives that gets crushed along the way. But everyone who funds and builds a free product usually comes out of it pretty well, especially if they don&amp;#8217;t care what happens to their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free is so prevalent in our industry not because everyone&amp;#8217;s irresponsible, but because it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other industries, this is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing"&gt;predatory pricing&lt;/a&gt;, and many forms of it are illegal because they&amp;#8217;re so destructive to healthy businesses and the welfare of an economy. But the tech industry is far less regulated, younger, and faster-moving than most industries. We celebrate our ability to do things that are illegal or economically infeasible in other markets with productive-sounding words like &amp;#8220;disruption&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of our rapid progress wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened if we had to play by the rest of the world&amp;#8217;s rules, and I think we&amp;#8217;re better off overall the way it is. But like any regulation (or lack thereof), it&amp;#8217;s a double-edged sword. Our industry is prone to many common failures of unregulated capitalism, with the added instability of extremely low barriers to entry and near-zero cost per user in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try to play by the traditional rules and regulations, you run the risk of getting steamrolled by someone who&amp;#8217;s perfectly willing to ignore them. Usually, that&amp;#8217;s the biggest potential failure of the tech world&amp;#8217;s crazy economy, which sucks for you but doesn&amp;#8217;t matter much to everyone else. But sometimes, just like unregulated capitalism, it fails in ways that suck for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Reader dominated the feed-reading and feed-sync markets so much that almost no alternatives exist, and the few alternatives are very unpopular. Reader is effectively a monoculture, if not a monopoly. And it isn&amp;#8217;t just one popular provider of an open standard &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s a proprietary service that takes a lot of work for anyone else to replicate (as many people are going to &lt;a href="http://inessential.com/2013/03/18/brians_stupid_feed_tricks"&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; over the next few months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the constant churn of young free products doesn&amp;#8217;t usually do much harm, proprietary monocultures are extremely vulnerable to outcomes that suck for everyone. And a proprietary monoculture that&amp;#8217;s unprofitable, shrinking in popularity, or strategically inconvenient for its owner is far worse. It&amp;#8217;s likely to disappear at any moment, and there may not be anything to fill the gap for months or years, if ever. For all of the people who use RSS every day, as part of their jobs or hobbies, imagine the disruption to their lives if Google had shut down Reader immediately without notice. (Now think of how far off July isn&amp;#8217;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Reader was just a free, popular host running open-source software, anyone could just set up the same services on any web host and migrate their data without much disruption. But it&amp;#8217;s not, so it&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot more work and much more disruption to our workflows and habits in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we lucked out with Reader &amp;#8212; imagine how much worse it would be if website owners weren&amp;#8217;t publishing open RSS feeds for anyone to fetch and process, but were instead posting each item to a proprietary Google API. We&amp;#8217;d have almost no chance of building a successful alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. (Does the shutdown make more sense now?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing we can do isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily to try to pay for everything, which is unrealistic and often not an option. Our best option is to &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down"&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt; supporting and using proprietary monocultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The implications of this smaller, lower power A5 SoC are unclear to me at this point. It seems to me that the Apple TV now sells well enough to warrant the creation of its own SoC, rather than using a handmedown from the iPad/iPhone lineup. The only question that remains is whether or not we’ll see this unique A5 revision appear in any other devices. There’s not a whole lot of room for a single-core Cortex A9 in Apple’s existing product lineup, so I’m encouraged to believe that this part is exclusively for the Apple TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still torn on this. I bet that if Apple engineers a whole new device to be the &amp;#8220;cheaper iPhone&amp;#8221; rather than continuing to sell old models, or if they do a similar move for a future cheaper iPad Mini, this would be an obvious CPU candidate: not only is it tiny, cheap, and fast enough for an iPhone or iPad while leaving a big enough performance gap to drive higher-end buyers to the higher-priced products, but the low power requirements would let Apple shrink the battery a bit, further reducing weight and cost. Every cent matters at Apple&amp;#8217;s scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the fundamental assumption I made when this CPU was first rumored &amp;#8212; that the Apple TV sold too few units to justify its own custom CPU &amp;#8212; was probably wrong, leaving a very boring, plausible explanation for this new CPU that has nothing to do with future iPhones or iPads.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is elegance. It derives from the design of the internet and the web and its many open standards — designed so that no entity can control it, so that it survives stupidity and greed when it appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS isn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;dead&amp;#8221;. Not even close. We&amp;#8217;ve just come up with a lot of alternatives to traditional RSS readers in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

But my posts often rank well there and gather a lot of comments, then &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/newsyc150/status/312333827995471875"&gt;various Twitter bots&lt;/a&gt; start showing up in my saved search for Marco.org links, so I usually end up reading the comment threads on my posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s remarkable (and quite sad) how so many commenters there get so &lt;a href="http://the-magazine.org/4/anti-apple-anger"&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt; and have so much hatred toward people who write opinions they disagree with about electronics. But &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5377591"&gt;this epic rant&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most unintentionally amusing, ridiculous one I&amp;#8217;ve seen against me to date, by someone I&amp;#8217;ve never met, in response to my boring, uncontroversial &lt;a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader"&gt;Google Reader API post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  Please, as an advice to general HN posters, please avoid posting marco.org links here on HN, because his sole intention is to sell his readers out more than focusing on writing. That&amp;#8217;s a fairly grande accusation, but it&amp;#8217;s justified.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Do you know why is he writing about Google Reader now? Go to your HN homepage right now, as of writing this comment, the Google reader announcement has about 1700 upvotes. Ouch, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of views for someone to let go of. Hence, if someone writes something that compliments this announcement, common sense tells me that they would get more page views.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothing wrong in having ads on your blog/website, people do it all the time. What&amp;#8217;s wrong is trying to create an impression to your readers that your sole intention is to write quality content, while you care just about pageviews. Please, realize that marco.org is no different from Techcrunch!&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Marco isn&amp;#8217;t innocent, if you&amp;#8217;ve been following him closely. Also, I think it would help if you take a look at this page where he just blatantly sells us, his readers like some piece of junk commodity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</description></item><item><title>Baby steps toward replacing Google Reader</title><link>http://www.marco.org/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader</link><guid isPermaLink="false">/2013/03/14/baby-steps-replacing-google-reader</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 Mar 2013 15:36:05 EDT</pubDate><description>&lt;p&gt;With Google Reader&amp;#8217;s impending shutdown, lots of new feed-sync services and self-hostable projects will be popping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly every mobile and desktop RSS client syncs with Google Reader today, often as the only option. Getting widespread client support for any other service will be difficult since it&amp;#8217;s probably going to be a while before there&amp;#8217;s a clear &amp;#8220;winner&amp;#8221; to switch to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing we need is a format war &amp;#8212; with Reader&amp;#8217;s shutdown in July, we don&amp;#8217;t have time for one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious idea that many have proposed (or already implemented) is to make a new service mirror the (&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyrfeed/wiki/GoogleReaderAPI"&gt;never-officially-documented&lt;/a&gt;) Google Reader API. Even if it also offers its own standalone API for more functionality, any candidates to replace Google Reader should mirror the fundamentals of its API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients then only need to change two simple things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revert back to the old POST authentication method instead of Google&amp;#8217;s more recent authorization flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a text field to the login form: &lt;strong&gt;Hostname&lt;/strong&gt;, that defaults to &lt;code&gt;www.google.com&lt;/code&gt; for now. Once popular services emerge, they can add optional presets, but for now, this is all we need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then use that as the hostname for all API requests: &lt;code&gt;https://{hostname}/reader/api/0/...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, the Google Reader API &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the feed-sync &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; today. Until this business shakes out, which could take years (and might never happen), this is the best way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to start simple. We don&amp;#8217;t have much time. And if we &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; do it this way, the likely alternative is that a few major clients will make their own custom sync solutions that won&amp;#8217;t work with any other company&amp;#8217;s clients, which won&amp;#8217;t bring them nearly as much value as it will remove from their users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s get Reeder and NetNewsWire to support the Hostname field ASAP so we can build alternative services to back them. Once they support it, other clients will need to follow from the competitive pressure of checklist feature comparisons. The result will be the easiest, fastest solution for everyone and a healthier ecosystem for feed-sync platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reederapp"&gt;Silvio Rizzi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://blackpixel.com/blog/2011/06/black-pixel-acquires-netnewswire.html"&gt;Black Pixel&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By implementing a suitable syncing API for RSS, &lt;em&gt;and implementing a reasonably useful web interface,&lt;/em&gt; Black Pixel could establish NetNewsWire Cloud as the de facto replacement for Google Reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

But it&amp;#8217;s single-core:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If we compare this with the earlier 32-nm APL2498 part, it looks as though we now have a single-core ARM A9 CPU, together with a dual-core GPU as in the APL2498. The Apple TV has always been 1-core, but the APL2498 had one core disabled – maybe Apple now thinks that sales will be enough to justify a dedicated part, or maybe we are going to see another single-core device in a different product line.&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;To get the almost 50% die size reduction that we have, though, there has to be more than removal of one core – other changes have been made. As yet we haven’t quantified them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting interesting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing Apple, this revised, single-core A5 wasn&amp;#8217;t made &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the Apple TV. The big question, then: Where else might Apple want to use a small, cheap, single-core A5?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d guess it&amp;#8217;s still too big and power-hungry for a watch, but if they want to shave component costs down for a low-cost iPhone or an even cheaper iPad Mini, this could be a good CPU candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

Client innovation completely stopped for a few years until iOS made it a market again &amp;#8212; but every major iOS RSS client is still dependent on Google Reader for feed crawling and sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we&amp;#8217;ll be forced to fill the hole that Reader will leave behind, and there&amp;#8217;s no immediately obvious alternative. We&amp;#8217;re finally likely to see substantial innovation and competition in RSS desktop apps and sync platforms for the first time in almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may suck in the interim before great alternatives mature and become widely supported, but in the long run, trust me: this is excellent news.&lt;/p&gt;
