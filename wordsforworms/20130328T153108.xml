				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Splendid Thursday, Bookworms.</p>
<p>Remember back when I read <a title="Mythology vs. Technology: American Gods by NeilÂ Gaiman" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/16/mythology-vs-technology-american-gods-by-neil-gaiman/" target="_blank"><em>American Gods</em></a> and I was all &#8220;I need more Neil Gaiman in my life?&#8221; Well. I made good on my promise to myself. During a Kindle sale I noticed another Gaiman title and snapped it up at a bargain price. This novel? <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Frost-Giants-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061671738" target="_blank">Odd and the Frost Giants</a>. </em>Neil Gaiman writes for a variety of age groups. Me being me, I paid absolutely no attention to whether or not this was an adult book or a children&#8217;s book. Luckily, Gaiman&#8217;s whimsy is so delightful it really doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1597" alt="odd-and-the-frost-giants" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg?w=222&#038;h=363" width="222" height="363" /></a></p>
<p><em>Odd and the Frost Giants </em>centers on a young Viking boy named Odd. Odd is aptly named (although in Viking lore the name is meant to be lucky) because he&#8217;s the &#8220;odd&#8221; man out. His father died and his mother remarried a major tool. Also, Odd managed to chop a tree down which landed on his leg and thus needs to use a crutch to get around. I really can&#8217;t discuss this book much further without getting spoiler-happy. It&#8217;s really short, y&#8217;all. So. If you want to avoid spoilers, you can stop reading now.</p>
<p>Is it safe? Good. Okay. So. Odd has had quite enough of his crappy stepfather&#8217;s antics and decides to run away. He makes it out to his old hut (because they&#8217;re Vikings and they live in huts surrounding the Mead Hall, yo) only to meet up with a weird trio of animals. A bear, a fox, and an eagle follow him home. Odd lets them in, gives them some salmon, and goes to sleep. (I guess Odd figured if the bear had just eaten he wouldn&#8217;t be interested in devouring him? I realize I shouldn&#8217;t question the judgement of children&#8217;s characters, but really, Odd. What would your mother say?)</p>
<p>As it turns out, the animals aren&#8217;t REALLY animals. They&#8217;re Odin, Thor, and Loki who are trapped in animal form. Which explains why the bear didn&#8217;t eat him. They figure all of this out and Odd decides to join them on their quest to get back into their normal bodies.</p>
<div id="attachment_603" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 236px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/odin-viking-gods.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-603   " alt="How is Odin supposed to get his swagger on when he's stuck in the body of a bird, for heaven's sake?" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/odin-viking-gods.jpg?w=226&#038;h=343" width="226" height="343" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">How is Odin supposed to get his swagger on when he&#8217;s stuck in the body of a bird, for heaven&#8217;s sake?</p></div>
<p>Oh yeah. And because of Odd&#8217;s busted leg slowing down the trio, Thor (who is stuck in the form of a bear) totally lets him ride on his back. I wonder if God-Bears are stinky. Would immortality keep you from smelling like a gross bear? Let&#8217;s say that this is the case. Because I would totally ride a bear, if it smelled decent. Who am I kidding? I&#8217;d ride a stinky bear too. I&#8217;d get a fancy bear saddle and a Viking helmet. Glorious. (I realize this paragraph is probably going to lead to me getting a LOT of hits from people looking for animal porn. Sigh.)</p>
<p>This book was totally entertaining. Norse mythology and all that. It&#8217;s for kids, so maybe it&#8217;d make for a good chapter book bedtime story for those of you with youngins at home? A nice change of pace from <em>Captain Underpants</em> or what-have-you. So, Bookworms. The question I pose to you is this: if you could ride any wild animal, what would you choose, and why? Bonus points for creativity and stench reduction implements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Bookworms!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Tuesday, and you know what THAT means. No, no, it is not time for tacos. (But dangit, now I want tacos!) It&#8217;s time for Top Ten Tuesday with <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">The Broke and The Bookish</a>! Today they&#8217;ve asked me to list out the ten books I recommend most often. So. Without further ado&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.dianagabaldon.com/books/outlander-series/" target="_blank"><em>Outlander </em></a>by Diana Gabaldon. I have foisted this series upon countless friends. I love to recommend it because it&#8217;s got a little bit of something for everyone. It&#8217;s one of those rare finds where I&#8217;m confident most of my pals will enjoy it. There are few things as awkward as giving someone a book and hearing they hated it, you know? <em>Outlander </em>has a little sci fi, some historical fiction, a touch of steamy romance novel, and, well, Jamie Fraser. (Siiiigh)</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Paperback-Box-Books/dp/0545162076" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter </em></a>by JK Rowling. This is kind of a throwaway answer because it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s possible for someone to have never heard of Harry Potter. However. Anyone who seems skeptical about the series? I implore them to read it. Like&#8230; I&#8217;m sincerely concerned about people who don&#8217;t enjoy HP. How can you not like MAGIC and WHIMSY and AWESOMENESS?!</p>
<div id="attachment_1233" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8219.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1233   " alt="My patronus is a penguin. Demetors don't stand a CHANCE against the impossible cutness... And pecking." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/img_8219.jpg?w=190&#038;h=254" width="190" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My patronus is a penguin. Demetors don&#8217;t stand a CHANCE against the impossible cutness&#8230; And pecking.</p></div>
<p>3. <a title="Books That Scare Me: The Handmaidâs Tale by MargaretÂ Atwood" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/31/books-that-scare-me-the-handmaids-tale-by-margaret-atwood/" target="_blank"><em>The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale </em></a>by Margaret Atwood. This book is amazing and I think everyone should read it. Everyone. I&#8217;ve loaned out my copy on multiple occasions. It&#8217;s a cautionary tale for the ages, my friends.</p>
<p>4. <em><a title="Pope Joan: More ThanÂ Myth?" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/29/pope-joan-more-than-myth/" target="_blank">Pope Joan </a></em>by Diana Woolfolk Cross. Some of the best historical fiction I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s about an accidental lady Pope. Timely, what with a new Pope being elected and all.</p>
<p>5. <a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THEÂ OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank"><em>Les Miserables </em></a>by Victor Hugo. Occasionally, people will ask me for recommendations on classics I really enjoyed. I won&#8217;t lie, it&#8217;s a long ass book, but it&#8217;s totally worth the read. If you&#8217;re familiar with the musical already, it gives you a great back story on Fantine, which is fabulous. Oh and did you know that Gavroche and Eponine are siblings? I know. I. KNOW! Crazy right? You need to read this.</p>
<div id="attachment_1084" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 151px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/les-miserables-176x300.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1084" alt="les-miserables-176x300" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/les-miserables-176x300.jpg?w=141&#038;h=240" width="141" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cosette is still little more than a plot catalyst, though.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">6. <em><a title="The Book Thief by Markus Zusak: A Good Read, A DignifiedÂ Cry" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/11/26/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak-a-good-read-a-dignified-cry/" target="_blank">The Book Thief</a> </em>by Markus Zusak. I try to get people to read this all the time. It&#8217;s another one of those that I&#8217;ve found is almost universally appealing. This one, of course, requires you to have an entire box of tissues on hand as you engage in the catharsis of bawling your eyes out. Worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">7. <a title="Song of Achilles: Yes, Thereâs aÂ Centaur!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/11/28/song-of-achilles-yes-theres-a-centaur/" target="_blank"><em>Song of Achilles </em></a>by Madeline Miller. This book tells the most incredible love story. Miller did such a great job of drawing her characters&#8217; personalities that you get completely engrossed in their love story. You follow Achilles and Patroclus from childhood and watch their relationship grow and mature. Just beautiful. And yeah. It&#8217;s about two dudes. Which is a nice change of pace from what I normally read, you know? (You probably need tissues for this one too.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a title="My BFF and The Pillars of the Earth by KenÂ Follett" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/11/15/the-pillars-of-the-earth/" target="_blank"><em>Pillars of the Earth </em></a>by Ken Follett. It&#8217;s just really well drawn historical fiction. I love it to pieces. It&#8217;s another chunkster, but it moves fast. Don&#8217;t be intimidated by its length, you&#8217;ll enjoy yourself! (And then you&#8217;ll be really grateful that you have indoor plumbing and floors that aren&#8217;t dirt and stuff, because the Middle Ages were DIRTY, y&#8217;all.)</p>
<div id="attachment_1650" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 370px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eddie-in-pillars.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1650 " alt="Starz did a mini series based on the book. Eddie Redmayne played Jack. You're welcome. (Image from Oprah.com)" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/eddie-in-pillars.jpg?w=360&#038;h=247" width="360" height="247" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Starz did a mini series based on the book. Eddie Redmayne played Jack. You&#8217;re welcome. (Image from <a href="http://www.oprah.com/entertainment/The-Pillars-of-the-Earth-Cast-and-Character-Guide/4" target="_blank">Oprah.com</a>)</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">9. <a title="Gone with theÂ Wind" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/26/gone-with-the-wind/" target="_blank"><em>Gone With The Wind </em></a>by Margaret Mitchell. No, having seen the movie is NOT the same thing. Not at all. It leaves out Scarlett&#8217;s first two children, for heaven&#8217;s sake! (That&#8217;s really not a spoiler, they aren&#8217;t major plot points, and the fact that they aren&#8217;t makes Scarlett all the more Scarlett-y.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">10. <a title="ZombieÂ Apocalypse" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/27/zombie-apocalypse/" target="_blank"><em>World War Z</em></a> by Max Brooks. I don&#8217;t read a whole lot of zombie literature, but I thought this book rocked in a big way. I&#8217;m a huge fan of <em>The Walking Dead </em>(TV series, I haven&#8217;t read the comics) so the zombie lore intrigues me. I thought this book gave an awesome and realistic account of how a zombie apocalypse might go down. You&#8217;ll probably have nightmares. Fair warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">There we are- ten books I recommend to people on the regular. What are some of your favorite titles to pass around?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello my Beautiful Bookworms!</p>
<p>Thank you ALL for the fabulous birthday wishes and making me want to eat ALL THE CAKE. You&#8217;ve still got a few days to enter the giveaway, so be sure to enter for $30 Amazon bucks- international entries welcome! Also, I&#8217;ve guest posted today on my friend <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/" target="_blank">Chrissy&#8217;s site</a>. If you&#8217;re so inclined, I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I took a trip to attend my <a title="Beware the Ides of March: A Letter to My âNephewâ on his FifthÂ Birthday" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/03/15/beware-the-ides-of-march-a-letter-to-my-nephew-on-his-fifth-birthday/" target="_blank">&#8220;nephew&#8217;s&#8221; birthday party</a>. When I take a long drive, I like to listen to books on tape. They keep me alert better than listening to music, plus, I mean, BOOKS. I took this trip with a book I&#8217;ve been meaning to read for a while, Karen Russell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Swamplandia-Vintage-Contemporaries-Karen-Russell/dp/0307276686" target="_blank"><em>Swamplandia! </em></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swamplandia.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1639" alt="swamplandia" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/swamplandia.jpeg?w=277&#038;h=277" width="277" height="277" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Are you aware that Florida boasts the most oddball theme parks per capita in the world? I may have made up that statistic, but I think I could be right. <em>Swamplandia! </em>is the account of a fictional family owned theme park on an island off the coast of Florida, known as (appropriately) Swamplandia. The Bigtree family is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; of alligator wrestlers. They renamed themselves &#8220;Bigtree&#8221; to sound more native, but their clan originated in Ohio. As PT Barnum would tell you, there&#8217;s a sucker born every minute. People believe what they want to believe, so if they prefer to think of alligator wrestlers as endowed with magical Native American gator charming talents, the Bigtrees are happy to oblige their delusions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The family alligator wrestling matches are only one of the attractions. The main event is watching the family matriarch, Hilola Bigtree, dive into the gator pit and swim through unscathed. It&#8217;s a fantastic spectacle and crowd favorite. The gators are all referred to as &#8220;Seth,&#8221; I&#8217;m assuming, because &#8220;Sawtooth&#8221; was already taken. (No, they never really explained why they chose Seth. But yes, Grandpa was named Sawtooth.) Sadly, as we learn about Swamplandia&#8217;s glory days, we also learn of its demise.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Hilola Bigtree, headliner and matriarch, falls victim to cancer. Grandpa Sawtooth falls victim to Alzheimer&#8217;s. Chief Bigtree falls victim to his pride. Young Osceola falls victim to obsession. Kiwi falls victim to his limited home-school education. Ava, our 14 year old protagonist, falls victim to everyone else&#8217;s bad decisions.</p>
<div id="attachment_1642" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 279px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/redseth.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1642  " alt="Image courtesy of genius book blogger and generous soul Andi of Estella's Revenge." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/redseth.jpg?w=269&#038;h=200" width="269" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of genius book blogger and generous soul Andi of <a href="http://estellasrevenge.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Estella&#8217;s Revenge</a>.</p></div>
<p>So. What did I think? I&#8217;ve got mixed feelings on this novel. On the one hand, I LOVED the language. The writing was gorgeous, and the actors reading the audio book were fantastic. That said, I think sometimes the story fell by the wayside so the language could shine. Some people wouldn&#8217;t be bothered by this, but as you know, I&#8217;m a story girl. I felt parts of the novel were more drawn out than necessary (particularly Louis Thanksgiving&#8217;s extremely detailed back story&#8230;) On the upside, I now have a fantastically vivid mental image of Florida&#8217;s swamplands. Overall, the prose reminded me of Gabriel Garcia Marquez&#8217;s magical realism, only set in North America. With alligators and stuff. Also a theme park based on Hell. Complete with saltwater drinking fountains. (Kudos for imagination!)</p>
<p>For reasons I will not disclose to you, as they might be considered &#8220;spoilers,&#8221; a red gator makes an appearance in this novel. I really wanted to know if such a thing existed in nature. As it turns out, they&#8217;re not really a thing. Which means, of course, that there aren&#8217;t a whole lot of readily available images (unless you happen to email a cool blogger like Andi and she lets you borrow her stuff.) I actually thought it might be a good idea to try and make my own art! I convinced <a href="http://www.filing-jointly.com/" target="_blank">Lauren of Filing Jointly</a>&#8230;Finally to help me with the project and&#8230; well&#8230; This happened:</p>
<div id="attachment_1645" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 287px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_5146.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1645   " alt="I drew a really horrible alligator." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_5146.jpg?w=277&#038;h=207" width="277" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I drew a really horrible alligator and embellished it with a voice bubble for extreme fierceness.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1646" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 287px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1646  " alt="And then Lauren drew an alligator who thinks he's a stegosaurus." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/photo.jpg?w=277&#038;h=207" width="277" height="207" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And then Lauren drew an alligator who thinks he&#8217;s a stegosaurus. (Which, in spite of its dino-ness is infinitely better executed than my doodle&#8230;)</p></div>
<p>And now we know why Katie and Lauren don&#8217;t have promising futures in the lucrative world of alligator caricatures. Luckily, there&#8217;s not much of a market for that sort of thing in Illinois. It&#8217;s really the deer and skunk caricature niche that&#8217;s our bread and butter, so. You know. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>Have any of you read <em>Swamplandia!? </em>What did you think? Did it spur you to do anything unusual, say, sketch a species-confused alligator? Tell me about it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey There Bookworms,</p>
<p>Today I turn 30 years old. I say &#8220;today&#8221; even though technically I&#8217;m writing this in the evening on March 21st. By the time this posts, I will already be 30. Though I made my entrance into this world at 4:02 am, I don&#8217;t make it a habit to either a. get up that early or b. stay up that late. So. I&#8217;m 30. More or less.</p>
<p>How do I feel about this? Not great. I really didn&#8217;t think turning 30 would be a big deal to me, but I&#8217;m kind of freaking out. I STILL don&#8217;t know what I want to be when I grow up. As you can see, my initial career ambition didn&#8217;t exactly work out&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_6728-e1363916693322.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1633 aligncenter" alt="" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_6728-e1363916693322.jpg?w=238&#038;h=318" width="238" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>But you know. Life happens. Thighs happen. You improvise. So. I am 30. And I have a choice. I can continue to wallow and mourn my lost youth, OR I can CELEBRATE! Guess who&#8217;s celebrating and looked freaking adorable in a tutu at 5? THIS GIRL!</p>
<div id="attachment_1456" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 269px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/birthday-cake-clip-art-4.png"><img class=" wp-image-1456   " alt="There will be cake. Oh yes, there will be cake." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/birthday-cake-clip-art-4.png?w=259&#038;h=254" width="259" height="254" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">There will be cake. Oh yes, there will be cake.</p></div>
<p>I may not be able to send cake to each and every one of you GORGEOUS bookworms, but I can sponsor a giveaway. This giveaway is open to EVERYONE (except people from North Dakota. Just kidding. I love you, North Dakota.) I am giving away an Amazon gift card in the amount of&#8230; THIRTY DOLLARS! (Because I&#8217;m 30, see?) Anyway, since it&#8217;s an Amazon gift card, anybody with an email address is eligible to win. International entries are totally welcome (just like I promised, Rhian. Tell your Aussie pals.)</p>
<p>You can enter by:</p>
<p>1. Leaving a comment on this blog telling me what your favorite kind of cake is (anyone who says they don&#8217;t like cake is disqualified. Lie to me y&#8217;all. It&#8217;s my birthday!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Bookworms!</p>
<p>You know when you&#8217;re in a bookstore, browsing, and you get sucked in by picking up a title in the bargain bin? How about when you have grand intentions of bettering yourself and pick up a pile o&#8217; classics only to watch them collect dust on your shelves? We&#8217;ve all got the shelf of shame. And the ladies at the <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">Broke and the Bookish</a>? They want us to own up to it. Today&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday: Stuff I Bought But Never Read.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-ebook/dp/B0084A6XBS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655836&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=madame+bovary" target="_blank"><em>Madame Bovary</em></a> by Gustave Flaubert. Sometimes (okay, a lot of times) I get self important and think that I will be able to appreciate even the most highbrow of classics. That&#8217;s when I buy things like <em>Madame Bovary </em>and then watch them moulder on my shelves for an eternity. I mean, I SHOULD like this. A doctor&#8217;s wife has adulterous affairs? I mean, hello <a title="The Greatest Sleep Aids Disguised asÂ Books" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/24/the-greatest-sleep-aids-disguised-as-books/" target="_blank"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a>. How&#8217;s it going, <a title="Banned Books Week: Lady Chatterleyâs Lover by DHÂ Lawrence" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/04/banned-books-week-lady-chatterlys-lover-by-dh-lawrence/" target="_blank"><em>Lady Chatterley</em></a>? Why did I never get down with <em>Madame Bovary</em>? No idea.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heart-of-Darkness-ebook/dp/B0084AMNWQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655803&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=heart+of+darkness" target="_blank"><em>Heart of Darkness </em></a>by Joseph Conrad. This is always on smart people&#8217;s lists of favorite books. I&#8217;m highly susceptible to peer pressure whilst making decisions inside the Barnes and Noble&#8230; Amazon doesn&#8217;t judge me the way a hipster cashier would!</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge-ebook/dp/B0084AYLK8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655757&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+mayor+of+casterbridge" target="_blank"><em>The Mayor of Casterbridge </em></a>by Thomas Hardy. I bought this because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tess-of-the-dUrbervilles-ebook/dp/B0084B0CKA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655867&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tess+of+the+d%27urbervilles+kindle+free" target="_blank"><em>Tess of the d&#8217;Urbervilles </em></a>was so fantastic. However&#8230; The lack of female main character and/or the really unappealing portrait of what I assume to be the &#8220;mayor&#8221; on the cover has kept me from actually bending the spine of this one.</p>
<p>4. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Count-Cristo-Illustrated-Edition-ebook/dp/B007M5QT10/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655965&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=count+of+monte+cristo+kindle+free" target="_blank">The Count of Monte Cristo </a></em>by Alexandre Dumas. I really do want to read this&#8230; It&#8217;s just so THICK. I&#8217;m not easily intimidated by big books, but this sucker is the size of <a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THEÂ OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank"><em>Les Miserables,</em></a> but lacks a magnificent soundtrack to play in my head&#8230; And no Gavroche.</p>
<div id="attachment_1626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3298.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1626" alt="IMG_3298" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3298-e1363656351913.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Classics&#8230; Of Shame.</p></div>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Pink-Carnation-ebook/dp/B000PC0SFK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363656574&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+secret+history+of+the+pink+carnation" target="_blank"><em>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation</em></a> by Lauren Willig. It&#8217;s historical fiction with a pretty cover. I couldn&#8217;t be expected to resist the purchase, and yet&#8230; Still unread.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Wife-P-S-ebook/dp/B0013TPVII/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363656765&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=shakespeare%27s+wife" target="_blank"><em>Shakespeare&#8217;s Wife </em></a>by Germaine Greer. It&#8217;s historical fiction about, uh, Shakespeare&#8217;s wife. You know. Anne Hathaway. The one that didn&#8217;t win an Oscar. I found it in a bargain bin. I really loved the movie <em>Shakespeare in Love, </em>so perhaps I just don&#8217;t want to hear the sad tale of the wife who was left behind when the dashing Joseph Fiennes fell for a not-yet-openly-pretentious Gwyneth Paltrow. Siiigh.</p>
<p>7. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Meaning-Night-Confession-ebook/dp/B0015VTPDG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657072&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+meaning+of+night" target="_blank">The Meaning of Night </a></em>by Michael Cox. I bought this because it&#8217;s historical fiction. I&#8217;ve been putting off reading it because it&#8217;s about a Victorian era murderer. I&#8217;m not big on crime novels, even historical ones. I frequently question my bargain bin judgement.</p>
<div id="attachment_1627" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_7873.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1627 " alt="You can see the bargain stickers! " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_7873.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can see the bargain stickers!</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladder-Years-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B003E8AIEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657500&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ladder+of+years" target="_blank"><em>Ladder of Years </em></a>by Anne Tyler. I bought this with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Homesick-Restaurant-Ballantine-ebook/dp/B004GTLKIW/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657478&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=dinner+at+the+homesick+restaurant+by+anne+tyler" target="_blank"><em>Dinner At The Homesick</em> <em>Restaurant </em></a>because I thought they sounded smart and fabulous. I read <em>Dinner At The Homesick Restaurant </em>and didn&#8217;t love it, so I didn&#8217;t bother with the other one on the shelf.</p>
<p>9. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-Taxonomy-Barnacles-Novel/dp/0312426518/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657557&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=a+taxonomy+of+barnacles" target="_blank">A Taxonomy of Barnacles </a></em>by Galt Niederhoffer. Yeah. I bought this solely for the AWESOME title. I didn&#8217;t even read the abstract. Maybe I should. Maybe I will. Who knows?</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Sand-Fog-Andre-Dubus/dp/0393338118/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=house+of+sand+and+fog" target="_blank"><em>House of Sand and Fog </em></a>by Andre Dubus III. There was an Oprah sticker, and I am not immune to the influence of The Oprah. I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t read it. STOP JUDGING ME, OPRAH!</p>
<div id="attachment_1628" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4883.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1628" alt="IMG_4883" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4883-e1363657878210.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Haven&#8217;t read these. Scandalous.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Alright, Bookworms. You know you&#8217;ve got some of these bad boys on your shelves. I want to hear about them so I don&#8217;t feel so alone. Spill it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Bookworms,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Monday, so let&#8217;s wallow in our collective case of the Mondays, shall we? I&#8217;ve got the perfect book to put you in the appropriate mood.Â <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Last-One-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812976886" target="_blank">Every Last One</a>Â </em>by Anna Quindlen will make you feel ALL THE FEELINGS.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Latham is a landscape designer and mother of three. She and her husband live an upper middle class life in an upper middle class suburb and have upper middle class problems. Their beautiful teenage daughter Ruby had a bout with an eating disorder, but seems to be recovering well. Though Mary Beth worries about Ruby leaving for college in a year, she&#8217;s proud of her remarkable girl. The twin boys pose a bit of a challenge, but they&#8217;re at an age when you&#8217;d expect them to be complicated. Alex is a soccer star and popular in school. His fraternal twin brother Max, on the other hand, is withdrawn and depressed. But, you know. What&#8217;s a little teen angst between twins? Nothing a little cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication can&#8217;t help with. After their experience with Ruby, the Lathams take Max&#8217;s suffering seriously.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1620" alt="everylastone" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/everylastone.jpg?w=660"   /></p>
<p>To add to this little dramatic suburban slurry, Ruby has recently dumped her boyfriend Kiernan, which has been tough on the whole family. He&#8217;s been a fixture in their lives since he was a small child. Kiernan&#8217;s family makes the Lathams look like the Waltons, so he was extraordinary attached their &#8220;happy&#8221; family. Kiernan is heartbroken. Ruby feels guilty. Everyone is hurting. It&#8217;s a recipe for a highly rated TV drama, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; Tragedy strikes. Serious horrible nightmarish tragedy. Your heart will break. You will cry. A lot, probably. I did. Telling you what happens would ruin the book for you, and I gave up massive spoilers for Lent. I will tell you that I didn&#8217;t see it coming, and that it hit me like a punch in the gut.</p>
<p>This is going to sound a little masochistic, but the way this book bites into the reader&#8230; It&#8217;s aÂ <em>goodÂ </em>pain. Even if it scars your psyche, a book that can make you FEEL this much is worth the read. It reminds you of how trivial every day annoyances in life can seem when you&#8217;re confronted with true unimaginable horror. I definitely recommend this book, but with the caveat that it WILL be a difficult read, emotionally. If you&#8217;re in a vulnerable place, it might be a good idea to pass on this one. At least for the time being.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/traumapaperback.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1621" alt="traumapaperback" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/traumapaperback.jpg?w=350&#038;h=451" width="350" height="451" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">In solidarity, let us all lament this Monday with our own tales of traumatic reads. What are some of your favorites, bookworms?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jack,</p>
<p>The first letter I ever wrote to you, I addressed to &#8220;Fetus.&#8221; You see, you were just a little ball of cells multiplying in your mommy&#8217;s tummy. Like most of the very best presents, you came as a surprise, but it didn&#8217;t take long for the excitement to set in. I started buying you penguin pajamas before you were even born!</p>

You won&#8217;t be able to escape them. Muahahahaha!</p></div>
<p>I talked to your mom a few hours after you were born. The first sound I ever heard you make was a hiccup! It was the most adorable hiccup I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life. When you were a few weeks old, I drove to Cincinnati to meet you.</p>
<div id="attachment_1611" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 372px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/meetingjack.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1611 " alt="&quot;Hello, sir.

I&#8217;m your Aunt Katie. I love you already!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have minded if you stayed that small forever. You were so tiny and perfect. But, as you know, the thing kids do best is GROW.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And so you grew&#8230;</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1612" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 259px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/katiejack.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1612 " alt="And grew..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/katiejack.jpg?w=249&#038;h=265" width="249" height="265" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You don&#8217;t typically find me this dull&#8230;</p></div>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong></strong><strong>BUT YOU JUST KEPT GROWING!</strong></p>

<p>When your mommy was waiting around for you to be born, I remember telling her that it would be fabulous if you were born on March 15th because every year I&#8217;d get to make a <em>Julius Caesar </em>joke on your birthday. You must have known how much I love literary jokes, because sure enough, you made your appearance on March 15th. Beware the Ides of March, indeed. The world will never be the same. Love you, Bubby.</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>
<p>Aunt Katie</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;ll be there soon! With presents!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How are all the Bookworms out there doing today?</p>
<p>Not so great? Well. I have something wonderful that will be sure to cheer you up. You&#8217;ve met my friend <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/2013/03/12/embarrassed-front-bloggess-good-in-500-words-less-with-photos/" target="_blank">Chrissy</a> before, haven&#8217;t you? In my more philosophical moments, I like to think that there&#8217;s a grand plan behind the way things work. There are people that are meant to be in your life, and it&#8217;s weird, because once you meet them, it feels like you&#8217;re already acquainted. I like to refer to Chrissy as my &#8220;butter churning sister from a past life,&#8221; because, you know, if we DID live lives before this one, we probably would have had to churn our own butter. I tell you this so you understand that she&#8217;s got a special place in my heart, and she had that WAY PRIOR to this story. (&#8220;Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love&#8221; and all that. The Beatles are always right.)</p>
<p>Remember once upon a time when I reviewed <a title="Funny Females and the Readers Who LoveÂ Them" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/23/funny-females-and-the-readers-who-love-them/" target="_blank"><em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened </em></a>by Jenny Lawson, otherwise known as The Great and Powerful Bloggess<strong>â¢</strong>? If you need to take a break and catch up, I&#8217;ll wait. You&#8217;re back? Wonderful. Suffice it to say that I&#8217;m a fan. I mean, Beyonce the giant metal chicken? The traveling red dress? She is a thousand kinds of awesome plus whipped cream plus a wine slushie and an order of fried pickles on the side.</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened </em>was released in paperback recently (I own a Kindle copy of the original release) and to celebrate, The Great and Powerful Bloggess<strong>â¢</strong> went on a book tour. One of the stops on the tour was in Chicagoland, which was fantastic news for Chrissy. It would have been great news for me too, but the event was on a Thursday. I had to work the following Friday, so making a 4 hour round trip journey wasn&#8217;t in the cards for me. Chrissy, of course, decided to go, and I was super excited for her and more than a tiny bit jealous. In fact, while she was waiting for the event to start, I did what anyone would do&#8230; I took a pathetic selfie and texted it to her so she&#8217;d feel guilty that I was missing out on the fun. Oh yeah. I&#8217;m THAT friend.</p>
<div id="attachment_1602" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 273px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess8.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1602   " alt="That's my best puppy dog face. I only bust it out for serious guilt trips... And the occasional foot massage." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess8.jpg?w=263&#038;h=350" width="263" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;s my best puppy dog face. I only bust it out for serious guilt trips&#8230; And the occasional foot massage.</p></div>
<p>I got home from a ho-hum day to find a surprise package on my doorstep. I was most pleased to see that the return address was from Chrissy. I assumed she&#8217;d located a package of deeply discounted penguin greeting cards, or perhaps a thrift store <a title="Confession Friday: Craving Cheese? Harlequin Romance NovelsÂ Satisfy!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/28/confession-friday-craving-cheese-harlequin-romance-novels-satisfy/" target="_blank">Harlequin romance novel</a>. I was FLABBERGASTED and DELIGHTED and OVERJOYED to find an autographed copy ofÂ <em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never HappenedÂ </em>(with bonus chapter!) Chrissy used a few moments of her precious Bloggess face time to get ME a birthday gift! (I&#8217;m about to turn 30. It&#8217;s&#8230; Well. It is what it is. Presents take the edge off.)</p>
<p>Now, Chrissy can tell you her version of this story (I highly recommend you click <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/2013/03/12/embarrassed-front-bloggess-good-in-500-words-less-with-photos/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to read it), but the gist of it is this: Chrissy showed the Bloggess my selfie. The Bloggess KNOWS I EXIST! AND! She thinks I&#8217;m cute! Just read the inscription!</p>
<div id="attachment_1603" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 670px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess4-1024x768.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1603" alt="Can you hear me squealing through the computer?! It's so LOUD!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess4-1024x768.jpg?w=660&#038;h=495" width="660" height="495" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Can you hear me squealing through the computer?! It&#8217;s so LOUD!</p></div>
<p>Chrissy also inscribed her own message, of course. She likes to prove me wrong, see? I don&#8217;t like to write in books I give as gifts just in case the recipient decides to pass it on to someone else one day. (I&#8217;m not saying this happened, but MAYBE, just MAYBE at some point in my life I was the owner of a pocket sized illustrated version of the <em>Kama Sutra</em>&#8230; And said pocket sized edition would have made an excellent saucy bachelorette party gift, but my re-gifting attempt was THWARTED by a personalized inscription&#8230;That COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL situation would be totally frustrating, right?) Chrissy&#8217;s inscription basically told me that I&#8217;d probably hang on to this book. She always has to win, you know?!</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that the sweetest?! Couldn&#8217;t this story have ended RIGHT THERE and been the best thing ever? It could have, but it DIDN&#8217;T! Because Jenny Lawson is so super fantastic, she posed for a picture with Chrissy, putting her arm around an invisible ME. And Chrissy, having somehow learned how to photoshop things in a surprisingly respectable manner made me THIS:</p>
<div id="attachment_1604" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 670px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggessphotoshop-1024x733.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1604" alt="Just let the awesomeness sink in for a minute..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggessphotoshop-1024x733.jpg?w=660&#038;h=472" width="660" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just let the awesomeness sink in for a minute&#8230; And do not question why I&#8217;m wearing a bridesmaid dress to a book signing.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s like I was actually there, only better. It&#8217;s better because my friend cared enough about me to blather incoherently to a famous person on my behalf. It&#8217;s better because Jenny has an incredible sense of humor and went along with the shenanigans. It&#8217;s the BEST because now I have my favorite thing in the world (a book) written by one of the people I admire most (The Bloggess) from one of my favorite people in the universe (including, but not limited to, all potential past lives.) And that, Bookworms, is how a book can be more than just a book.</p>
<p>Anybody out there have a story about a book inscription they&#8217;d like to share? I know not everyone&#8217;s story will be so full of superlatives and SHOUTY CAPITALS, but I&#8217;d love to hear them. Tell me something good, Worms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy Bookworms!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in an area that gleefully flouts Daylight Savings Time, everyone else in the world is mad at you right now. We are all still recovering from the hour of &#8220;lost&#8221; sleep due to the time shift. Truth be told, most of the time I look forward to springing forward because I LOVE having excess daylight after work. Unfortunately, this spring has started off with a whiny whimper and nary a ray of sunshine has been seen. This week&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday topic (thanks to <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">The Broke and the Bookish</a>) is our Top Ten 2013 Spring TBR (to be read, in case you don&#8217;t speak fluent Book Blogger.) I&#8217;m not great about paying attention to new releases unless it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been really looking forward to (cough cough OUTLANDER) so, I&#8217;m just going to list off stuff I&#8217;m planning to read next-ish, because I&#8217;m still waiting for a burst of springtime energy.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Last-One-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812976886" target="_blank"><em>Every Last One</em></a> by Anna Quindlen. I&#8217;m in the middle of this right now. TECHNICALLY it is Wine and Whining&#8217;s (one of the two In-Real-Life book clubs I belong to) selection for May, but it was only swapped to that position after I&#8217;d acquired it digitally from the library. If your library is anything like mine, the good downloadable titles are hard to come by- I wasn&#8217;t going to return it and hope it came available again. I figured I&#8217;d just read it early. And so I am.</p>
<p>2. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Round-House-Louise-Erdrich/dp/0062065246" target="_blank">The Round House </a></em>by Louise Erdrich. This is the March selection for the My Neighbors Are Better Than Your Neighbors Book Club. Sadly (or not sadly, because I totally have awesome plans) the March meeting falls on the 22nd, and if you didn&#8217;t know already, THAT&#8217;S MY BIRTHDAY! Now, if it were any old birthday, I&#8217;d probably consider an evening at book club a great way to spend it, but it&#8217;s a banner year y&#8217;all. 30. (After much internal debate I&#8217;ve decided to embrace my oldness and not refer to myself as perpetually 29..) Anyway. Just because I won&#8217;t be at this meeting doesn&#8217;t mean I want to be out of the book loop. So. I&#8217;ll be reading it anyway.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shoemakers-Wife-Novel-Adriana-Trigiani/dp/0061257109" target="_blank"><em>The Shoemaker&#8217;s Wife </em></a>by Adriana Trigiani. This was meant to be the Wine and Whining selection for May, but we swapped it out for April, and I totally got it for a song during an Amazon sale. It&#8217;s historical fiction (wahoo!)</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Frost-Giants-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061671738" target="_blank"><em>Odd and the Frost Giants</em></a> by Neil Gaiman. Perhaps I should have titled this post &#8220;Spring Cleaning,&#8221; because I&#8217;ve got several titles waiting around on my kindle that I bought when prices were good knowing I&#8217;d get around to them. Now is the time to be getting around to them, yes?</p>
<div id="attachment_1597" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 193px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1597" alt="odd-and-the-frost-giants" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg?w=183&#038;h=299" width="183" height="299" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Who doesn&#8217;t want to ride a bear into battle? I mean, that&#8217;s significantly more awesome than a horse. Less awesome than a unicorn, though&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">5. <em>Lord of the Rings</em> by JRR Tolkien. I bought these in December when I was making New Year&#8217;s Resolutions and I&#8217;m STILL procrastinating. I need to just get to Middle Earth and read them already. This is getting ridiculous.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Hall-Novel-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0312429983" target="_blank"><em>Wolf Hall </em></a>by Hilary Mantel has been chilling on my kindle for a while now too. I started it, but it was slow going. I just haven&#8217;t had the attention span for something so meaty in a while. It&#8217;s really meaty, y&#8217;all. Not in a bad way. Just in an &#8220;I need all of my neurons to be firing so I don&#8217;t lose track of what&#8217;s going on&#8221; sort of way. My neurons are pissed right now and hibernating. Still.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Winter_%28novel%29" target="_blank"><em>The Long Winter </em></a>by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I have a confession to make. I quit the <em>Little House</em> books after they hit the prairie. As much as I dug the pioneer girl thing, there were all kinds of dramatized serials about ballerinas and girls at summer camp filling the library shelves distracting my childish attention&#8230; Anyway, I&#8217;ve been told that I must read this book in particular to revel in the greatest love story of our time. Or, uh, pioneer time. The turn of phrase &#8220;you will die of happiness&#8221; was involved in me getting this recommendation- I really cannot be expected to ignore that. (Side note: this is apparently set in South Dakota. Remember back a few Top Ten Tuesdays ago when I claimed <a title="Top Ten Tuesday: Settings We Need MoreÂ Of!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/01/22/top-ten-tuesday-settings-we-need-more-of/" target="_blank">North Dakota was an under represented setting</a>? It still is. But we&#8217;re getting closer, aren&#8217;t we?)</p>
<div id="attachment_1598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 344px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/north-dakota.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1598 " alt="Dude. North Dakota cannot win. It's even got a boring shape. " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/north-dakota.jpg?w=334&#038;h=262" width="334" height="262" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dude. North Dakota cannot win. It&#8217;s even got a boring shape.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slammerkin-Emma-Donoghue/dp/B001O9CG6M" target="_blank"><em>Slammerkin </em></a>by Emma Donoghue. I haven&#8217;t bought this yet, but yeah. Emma Donoghue writing about historical prostitution is the sort of thing I need to be reading. For real.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s it. Technically I&#8217;m including the entire LOTR trilogy in #5, so that makes 10 books. I might be a cutting corners, but I&#8217;m blaming the LOST HOUR OF SLEEP. And the abysmal grayness that&#8217;s refused to lift for the last couple of weeks. Shoo, winter! Get on out of here! Katie needs some SUNSHINE if she&#8217;s going to cope with her advancing age!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So. Bookworms. What have you got in the hopper? Big plans for reading? Spring cleaning your bookshelves? Angry at Daylight Savings Time? Let&#8217;s chat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bonjour, Bookworms!</p>
<p>Please excuse the pun, I cannot help myself. I&#8217;m incorrigible. Today we are taking a trip to 19th Century Paris as we discuss <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Painted-Girls-A-Novel/dp/1594486247" target="_blank">The Painted Girls</a>Â </em>by Cathy Marie Buchanan. I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I think of ballet, I think of frothy tutus and toe shoes. I danced growing up, so I can tell you that dance apparel is not inexpensive. Thus, I was surprised to learn that the ballet dancers of the famed opera houses were often more Gavroche than Baryshnikov. (It&#8217;s probably also part of the reason ballet loves super svelte dancers&#8230; The early ones were half starved!) The youngest of the ballet girls were known as the &#8220;petite rats,&#8221; and successful dancers were frequently, uh, sponsored? by creepy old dudes. So. Yeah. The beautiful ballet had a dirty, seedy, underbelly. Scandalous.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paintedgirls.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1582" alt="paintedgirls" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paintedgirls.jpg?w=189&#038;h=285" width="189" height="285" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be too shocked by this whole thing- this novel takes place a few decades after <em><a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THEÂ OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank">Les Miserables</a>,Â </em>it&#8217;s not as though a comprehensive initiative to eradicate poverty had been undertaken. This is a society where a girl could legally prostitute herself at the age of 16 (assuming she was declared STD free, of course. Syphilis was colloquially known as &#8220;French Pox.&#8221;) When artists were looking for ladies to model in the nude, they didn&#8217;t go knocking on the doors of aristocrats, what with all the young nubile flesh for sale. Edgar Degas was one such artist, and if you know anything about his art, you&#8217;ll know that ballet girls were among his favorite subjects. Much in the way Tracy Chevalier brought to life the subject in Vermeer&#8217;s painting in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Pearl-Earring-The-ebook/dp/B000OCXIDK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345336646&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=girl+with+a+pearl+earring" target="_blank">Girl With A Pearl Earring</a>,Â </em>Buchanan does for Marie Van Goethem, the model for Degas&#8217; sculpture <em>Little Dancer Aged 14</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Marie lives in a sketchy Parisian neighborhood with her widowed, absinthe-swilling mother and her two sisters Antoinette and Charlotte. Antoinette had been a ballet girl, though she&#8217;d been tossed out of the company for mouthing off to the director. Instead she began working as an extra in the opera, earning a ridiculously small salary. After the death of their father (and the loss of his income) it is decided that Marie and Charlotte must audition to join the ballet school. Underfed &#8220;rats&#8221; from the wrong side of the proverbial tracks they may be, but super flexible hips are a commodity worth paying for. Both Charlotte and Marie begin their dance careers, in large part to contribute to the family baguette fund. Dancing for their suppers, as it were.</p>
<div id="attachment_1579" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 178px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/degasdancer.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1579  " alt="Image from Metropolitan Museum of Art" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/degasdancer.jpg?w=168&#038;h=307" width="168" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the sculpture in question. Image from Metropolitan Museum of Art</p></div>
<p>Eventually Marie catches the eye of Degas, and she is more than willing to pose for him in varying states of undress if it keeps her family from starving (absinthe isn&#8217;t cheap, you know.) While Marie is busy being naked in front of weird old men, Antoinette strikes up a romance with a potentially sketchy fellow named Emile, who seems incapable of saving money but terribly fond of spending it (bad combination, Antoinette!) Both Marie and Antoinette (LET THEM EAT CAKE!) try to find ways to hustle for cash so tiny Charlotte will be less affected by their poverty.</p>
<p>In the spirit of not being a major spoilsport, I shall tell you that this novel contains prostitution, petty theft, murder, guillotines, alcoholism, scientific misinformation, and one rather disturbing incident of animal cruelty (you&#8217;ve been warned.) It&#8217;s all based on true events! A triumph of historical fiction, my friends.</p>
<p>So, Bookworms, how much do you love it when art imitates art?! I even made <a href="https://read.rifflebooks.com/list/28283" target="_blank">a list of such novels on Riffle</a>! (Not on Riffle and want to be?! Let me know and I&#8217;ll send you an invite.) Tell me, Bookworms. Ballet, street urchins, Paris, art. and scandal- you&#8217;ve got to have thoughts on some of those things. Tell me, tell me, tell me!</p>
