				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, Bookworms!</p>
<p>You know when you&#8217;re in a bookstore, browsing, and you get sucked in by picking up a title in the bargain bin? How about when you have grand intentions of bettering yourself and pick up a pile o&#8217; classics only to watch them collect dust on your shelves? We&#8217;ve all got the shelf of shame. And the ladies at the <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">Broke and the Bookish</a>? They want us to own up to it. Today&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday: Stuff I Bought But Never Read.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Madame-Bovary-ebook/dp/B0084A6XBS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655836&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=madame+bovary" target="_blank"><em>Madame Bovary</em></a> by Gustave Flaubert. Sometimes (okay, a lot of times) I get self important and think that I will be able to appreciate even the most highbrow of classics. That&#8217;s when I buy things like <em>Madame Bovary </em>and then watch them moulder on my shelves for an eternity. I mean, I SHOULD like this. A doctor&#8217;s wife has adulterous affairs? I mean, hello <a title="The Greatest Sleep Aids Disguised as Books" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/24/the-greatest-sleep-aids-disguised-as-books/" target="_blank"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a>. How&#8217;s it going, <a title="Banned Books Week: Lady Chatterley’s Lover by DH Lawrence" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/04/banned-books-week-lady-chatterlys-lover-by-dh-lawrence/" target="_blank"><em>Lady Chatterley</em></a>? Why did I never get down with <em>Madame Bovary</em>? No idea.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heart-of-Darkness-ebook/dp/B0084AMNWQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655803&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=heart+of+darkness" target="_blank"><em>Heart of Darkness </em></a>by Joseph Conrad. This is always on smart people&#8217;s lists of favorite books. I&#8217;m highly susceptible to peer pressure whilst making decisions inside the Barnes and Noble&#8230; Amazon doesn&#8217;t judge me the way a hipster cashier would!</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mayor-of-Casterbridge-ebook/dp/B0084AYLK8/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655757&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+mayor+of+casterbridge" target="_blank"><em>The Mayor of Casterbridge </em></a>by Thomas Hardy. I bought this because <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tess-of-the-dUrbervilles-ebook/dp/B0084B0CKA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655867&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tess+of+the+d%27urbervilles+kindle+free" target="_blank"><em>Tess of the d&#8217;Urbervilles </em></a>was so fantastic. However&#8230; The lack of female main character and/or the really unappealing portrait of what I assume to be the &#8220;mayor&#8221; on the cover has kept me from actually bending the spine of this one.</p>
<p>4. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Count-Cristo-Illustrated-Edition-ebook/dp/B007M5QT10/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363655965&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=count+of+monte+cristo+kindle+free" target="_blank">The Count of Monte Cristo </a></em>by Alexandre Dumas. I really do want to read this&#8230; It&#8217;s just so THICK. I&#8217;m not easily intimidated by big books, but this sucker is the size of <a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THE OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank"><em>Les Miserables,</em></a> but lacks a magnificent soundtrack to play in my head&#8230; And no Gavroche.</p>
<div id="attachment_1626" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3298.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1626" alt="IMG_3298" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_3298-e1363656351913.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Classics&#8230; Of Shame.</p></div>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secret-History-Pink-Carnation-ebook/dp/B000PC0SFK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363656574&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+secret+history+of+the+pink+carnation" target="_blank"><em>The Secret History of the Pink Carnation</em></a> by Lauren Willig. It&#8217;s historical fiction with a pretty cover. I couldn&#8217;t be expected to resist the purchase, and yet&#8230; Still unread.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Wife-P-S-ebook/dp/B0013TPVII/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363656765&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=shakespeare%27s+wife" target="_blank"><em>Shakespeare&#8217;s Wife </em></a>by Germaine Greer. It&#8217;s historical fiction about, uh, Shakespeare&#8217;s wife. You know. Anne Hathaway. The one that didn&#8217;t win an Oscar. I found it in a bargain bin. I really loved the movie <em>Shakespeare in Love, </em>so perhaps I just don&#8217;t want to hear the sad tale of the wife who was left behind when the dashing Joseph Fiennes fell for a not-yet-openly-pretentious Gwyneth Paltrow. Siiigh.</p>
<p>7. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Meaning-Night-Confession-ebook/dp/B0015VTPDG/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657072&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+meaning+of+night" target="_blank">The Meaning of Night </a></em>by Michael Cox. I bought this because it&#8217;s historical fiction. I&#8217;ve been putting off reading it because it&#8217;s about a Victorian era murderer. I&#8217;m not big on crime novels, even historical ones. I frequently question my bargain bin judgement.</p>
<div id="attachment_1627" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_7873.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1627 " alt="You can see the bargain stickers! " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_7873.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can see the bargain stickers!</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ladder-Years-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B003E8AIEI/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657500&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ladder+of+years" target="_blank"><em>Ladder of Years </em></a>by Anne Tyler. I bought this with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dinner-Homesick-Restaurant-Ballantine-ebook/dp/B004GTLKIW/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657478&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=dinner+at+the+homesick+restaurant+by+anne+tyler" target="_blank"><em>Dinner At The Homesick</em> <em>Restaurant </em></a>because I thought they sounded smart and fabulous. I read <em>Dinner At The Homesick Restaurant </em>and didn&#8217;t love it, so I didn&#8217;t bother with the other one on the shelf.</p>
<p>9. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-Taxonomy-Barnacles-Novel/dp/0312426518/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657557&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=a+taxonomy+of+barnacles" target="_blank">A Taxonomy of Barnacles </a></em>by Galt Niederhoffer. Yeah. I bought this solely for the AWESOME title. I didn&#8217;t even read the abstract. Maybe I should. Maybe I will. Who knows?</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/House-Sand-Fog-Andre-Dubus/dp/0393338118/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363657643&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=house+of+sand+and+fog" target="_blank"><em>House of Sand and Fog </em></a>by Andre Dubus III. There was an Oprah sticker, and I am not immune to the influence of The Oprah. I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t read it. STOP JUDGING ME, OPRAH!</p>
<div id="attachment_1628" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4883.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1628" alt="IMG_4883" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4883-e1363657878210.jpg?w=462&#038;h=344" width="462" height="344" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Haven&#8217;t read these. Scandalous.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Alright, Bookworms. You know you&#8217;ve got some of these bad boys on your shelves. I want to hear about them so I don&#8217;t feel so alone. Spill it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Bookworms,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Monday, so let&#8217;s wallow in our collective case of the Mondays, shall we? I&#8217;ve got the perfect book to put you in the appropriate mood. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Last-One-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812976886" target="_blank">Every Last One</a> </em>by Anna Quindlen will make you feel ALL THE FEELINGS.</p>
<p>Mary Beth Latham is a landscape designer and mother of three. She and her husband live an upper middle class life in an upper middle class suburb and have upper middle class problems. Their beautiful teenage daughter Ruby had a bout with an eating disorder, but seems to be recovering well. Though Mary Beth worries about Ruby leaving for college in a year, she&#8217;s proud of her remarkable girl. The twin boys pose a bit of a challenge, but they&#8217;re at an age when you&#8217;d expect them to be complicated. Alex is a soccer star and popular in school. His fraternal twin brother Max, on the other hand, is withdrawn and depressed. But, you know. What&#8217;s a little teen angst between twins? Nothing a little cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication can&#8217;t help with. After their experience with Ruby, the Lathams take Max&#8217;s suffering seriously.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1620" alt="everylastone" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/everylastone.jpg?w=660"   /></p>
<p>To add to this little dramatic suburban slurry, Ruby has recently dumped her boyfriend Kiernan, which has been tough on the whole family. He&#8217;s been a fixture in their lives since he was a small child. Kiernan&#8217;s family makes the Lathams look like the Waltons, so he was extraordinary attached their &#8220;happy&#8221; family. Kiernan is heartbroken. Ruby feels guilty. Everyone is hurting. It&#8217;s a recipe for a highly rated TV drama, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then&#8230; Tragedy strikes. Serious horrible nightmarish tragedy. Your heart will break. You will cry. A lot, probably. I did. Telling you what happens would ruin the book for you, and I gave up massive spoilers for Lent. I will tell you that I didn&#8217;t see it coming, and that it hit me like a punch in the gut.</p>
<p>This is going to sound a little masochistic, but the way this book bites into the reader&#8230; It&#8217;s a <em>good </em>pain. Even if it scars your psyche, a book that can make you FEEL this much is worth the read. It reminds you of how trivial every day annoyances in life can seem when you&#8217;re confronted with true unimaginable horror. I definitely recommend this book, but with the caveat that it WILL be a difficult read, emotionally. If you&#8217;re in a vulnerable place, it might be a good idea to pass on this one. At least for the time being.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/traumapaperback.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1621" alt="traumapaperback" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/traumapaperback.jpg?w=350&#038;h=451" width="350" height="451" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<p style="text-align:left;">In solidarity, let us all lament this Monday with our own tales of traumatic reads. What are some of your favorites, bookworms?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jack,</p>
<p>The first letter I ever wrote to you, I addressed to &#8220;Fetus.&#8221; You see, you were just a little ball of cells multiplying in your mommy&#8217;s tummy. Like most of the very best presents, you came as a surprise, but it didn&#8217;t take long for the excitement to set in. I started buying you penguin pajamas before you were even born!</p>
<div id="attachment_1610" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 230px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/preggohjm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1610  " alt="See those books?

You won&#8217;t be able to escape them. Muahahahaha!</p></div>
<p>I talked to your mom a few hours after you were born. The first sound I ever heard you make was a hiccup! It was the most adorable hiccup I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life. When you were a few weeks old, I drove to Cincinnati to meet you.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have minded if you stayed that small forever. You were so tiny and perfect. But, as you know, the thing kids do best is GROW.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>And so you grew&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>When your mommy was waiting around for you to be born, I remember telling her that it would be fabulous if you were born on March 15th because every year I&#8217;d get to make a <em>Julius Caesar </em>joke on your birthday. You must have known how much I love literary jokes, because sure enough, you made your appearance on March 15th. Beware the Ides of March, indeed. The world will never be the same. Love you, Bubby.</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>
<p>Aunt Katie</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;ll be there soon! With presents!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How are all the Bookworms out there doing today?</p>
<p>Not so great? Well. I have something wonderful that will be sure to cheer you up. You&#8217;ve met my friend <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/2013/03/12/embarrassed-front-bloggess-good-in-500-words-less-with-photos/" target="_blank">Chrissy</a> before, haven&#8217;t you? In my more philosophical moments, I like to think that there&#8217;s a grand plan behind the way things work. There are people that are meant to be in your life, and it&#8217;s weird, because once you meet them, it feels like you&#8217;re already acquainted. I like to refer to Chrissy as my &#8220;butter churning sister from a past life,&#8221; because, you know, if we DID live lives before this one, we probably would have had to churn our own butter. I tell you this so you understand that she&#8217;s got a special place in my heart, and she had that WAY PRIOR to this story. (&#8220;Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love&#8221; and all that. The Beatles are always right.)</p>
<p>Remember once upon a time when I reviewed <a title="Funny Females and the Readers Who Love Them" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/23/funny-females-and-the-readers-who-love-them/" target="_blank"><em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened </em></a>by Jenny Lawson, otherwise known as The Great and Powerful Bloggess<strong>™</strong>? If you need to take a break and catch up, I&#8217;ll wait. You&#8217;re back? Wonderful. Suffice it to say that I&#8217;m a fan. I mean, Beyonce the giant metal chicken? The traveling red dress? She is a thousand kinds of awesome plus whipped cream plus a wine slushie and an order of fried pickles on the side.</p>
<p><em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened </em>was released in paperback recently (I own a Kindle copy of the original release) and to celebrate, The Great and Powerful Bloggess<strong>™</strong> went on a book tour. One of the stops on the tour was in Chicagoland, which was fantastic news for Chrissy. It would have been great news for me too, but the event was on a Thursday. I had to work the following Friday, so making a 4 hour round trip journey wasn&#8217;t in the cards for me. Chrissy, of course, decided to go, and I was super excited for her and more than a tiny bit jealous. In fact, while she was waiting for the event to start, I did what anyone would do&#8230; I took a pathetic selfie and texted it to her so she&#8217;d feel guilty that I was missing out on the fun. Oh yeah. I&#8217;m THAT friend.</p>
<div id="attachment_1602" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 273px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess8.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1602   " alt="That's my best puppy dog face. I only bust it out for serious guilt trips... And the occasional foot massage." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess8.jpg?w=263&#038;h=350" width="263" height="350" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#8217;s my best puppy dog face. I only bust it out for serious guilt trips&#8230; And the occasional foot massage.</p></div>
<p>I got home from a ho-hum day to find a surprise package on my doorstep. I was most pleased to see that the return address was from Chrissy. I assumed she&#8217;d located a package of deeply discounted penguin greeting cards, or perhaps a thrift store <a title="Confession Friday: Craving Cheese? Harlequin Romance Novels Satisfy!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/28/confession-friday-craving-cheese-harlequin-romance-novels-satisfy/" target="_blank">Harlequin romance novel</a>. I was FLABBERGASTED and DELIGHTED and OVERJOYED to find an autographed copy of <em>Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened </em>(with bonus chapter!) Chrissy used a few moments of her precious Bloggess face time to get ME a birthday gift! (I&#8217;m about to turn 30. It&#8217;s&#8230; Well. It is what it is. Presents take the edge off.)</p>
<p>Now, Chrissy can tell you her version of this story (I highly recommend you click <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/2013/03/12/embarrassed-front-bloggess-good-in-500-words-less-with-photos/" target="_blank">HERE</a> to read it), but the gist of it is this: Chrissy showed the Bloggess my selfie. The Bloggess KNOWS I EXIST! AND! She thinks I&#8217;m cute! Just read the inscription!</p>
<div id="attachment_1603" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 670px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess4-1024x768.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1603" alt="Can you hear me squealing through the computer?! It's so LOUD!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggess4-1024x768.jpg?w=660&#038;h=495" width="660" height="495" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Can you hear me squealing through the computer?! It&#8217;s so LOUD!</p></div>
<p>Chrissy also inscribed her own message, of course. She likes to prove me wrong, see? I don&#8217;t like to write in books I give as gifts just in case the recipient decides to pass it on to someone else one day. (I&#8217;m not saying this happened, but MAYBE, just MAYBE at some point in my life I was the owner of a pocket sized illustrated version of the <em>Kama Sutra</em>&#8230; And said pocket sized edition would have made an excellent saucy bachelorette party gift, but my re-gifting attempt was THWARTED by a personalized inscription&#8230;That COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL situation would be totally frustrating, right?) Chrissy&#8217;s inscription basically told me that I&#8217;d probably hang on to this book. She always has to win, you know?!</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that the sweetest?! Couldn&#8217;t this story have ended RIGHT THERE and been the best thing ever? It could have, but it DIDN&#8217;T! Because Jenny Lawson is so super fantastic, she posed for a picture with Chrissy, putting her arm around an invisible ME. And Chrissy, having somehow learned how to photoshop things in a surprisingly respectable manner made me THIS:</p>
<div id="attachment_1604" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 670px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggessphotoshop-1024x733.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1604" alt="Just let the awesomeness sink in for a minute..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/bloggessphotoshop-1024x733.jpg?w=660&#038;h=472" width="660" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just let the awesomeness sink in for a minute&#8230; And do not question why I&#8217;m wearing a bridesmaid dress to a book signing.</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s like I was actually there, only better. It&#8217;s better because my friend cared enough about me to blather incoherently to a famous person on my behalf. It&#8217;s better because Jenny has an incredible sense of humor and went along with the shenanigans. It&#8217;s the BEST because now I have my favorite thing in the world (a book) written by one of the people I admire most (The Bloggess) from one of my favorite people in the universe (including, but not limited to, all potential past lives.) And that, Bookworms, is how a book can be more than just a book.</p>
<p>Anybody out there have a story about a book inscription they&#8217;d like to share? I know not everyone&#8217;s story will be so full of superlatives and SHOUTY CAPITALS, but I&#8217;d love to hear them. Tell me something good, Worms.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy Bookworms!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in an area that gleefully flouts Daylight Savings Time, everyone else in the world is mad at you right now. We are all still recovering from the hour of &#8220;lost&#8221; sleep due to the time shift. Truth be told, most of the time I look forward to springing forward because I LOVE having excess daylight after work. Unfortunately, this spring has started off with a whiny whimper and nary a ray of sunshine has been seen. This week&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday topic (thanks to <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">The Broke and the Bookish</a>) is our Top Ten 2013 Spring TBR (to be read, in case you don&#8217;t speak fluent Book Blogger.) I&#8217;m not great about paying attention to new releases unless it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve been really looking forward to (cough cough OUTLANDER) so, I&#8217;m just going to list off stuff I&#8217;m planning to read next-ish, because I&#8217;m still waiting for a burst of springtime energy.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Every-Last-One-Anna-Quindlen/dp/0812976886" target="_blank"><em>Every Last One</em></a> by Anna Quindlen. I&#8217;m in the middle of this right now. TECHNICALLY it is Wine and Whining&#8217;s (one of the two In-Real-Life book clubs I belong to) selection for May, but it was only swapped to that position after I&#8217;d acquired it digitally from the library. If your library is anything like mine, the good downloadable titles are hard to come by- I wasn&#8217;t going to return it and hope it came available again. I figured I&#8217;d just read it early. And so I am.</p>
<p>2. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Round-House-Louise-Erdrich/dp/0062065246" target="_blank">The Round House </a></em>by Louise Erdrich. This is the March selection for the My Neighbors Are Better Than Your Neighbors Book Club. Sadly (or not sadly, because I totally have awesome plans) the March meeting falls on the 22nd, and if you didn&#8217;t know already, THAT&#8217;S MY BIRTHDAY! Now, if it were any old birthday, I&#8217;d probably consider an evening at book club a great way to spend it, but it&#8217;s a banner year y&#8217;all. 30. (After much internal debate I&#8217;ve decided to embrace my oldness and not refer to myself as perpetually 29..) Anyway. Just because I won&#8217;t be at this meeting doesn&#8217;t mean I want to be out of the book loop. So. I&#8217;ll be reading it anyway.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shoemakers-Wife-Novel-Adriana-Trigiani/dp/0061257109" target="_blank"><em>The Shoemaker&#8217;s Wife </em></a>by Adriana Trigiani. This was meant to be the Wine and Whining selection for May, but we swapped it out for April, and I totally got it for a song during an Amazon sale. It&#8217;s historical fiction (wahoo!)</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Frost-Giants-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0061671738" target="_blank"><em>Odd and the Frost Giants</em></a> by Neil Gaiman. Perhaps I should have titled this post &#8220;Spring Cleaning,&#8221; because I&#8217;ve got several titles waiting around on my kindle that I bought when prices were good knowing I&#8217;d get around to them. Now is the time to be getting around to them, yes?</p>
<div id="attachment_1597" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 193px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1597" alt="odd-and-the-frost-giants" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/odd-and-the-frost-giants.jpg?w=183&#038;h=299" width="183" height="299" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Who doesn&#8217;t want to ride a bear into battle? I mean, that&#8217;s significantly more awesome than a horse. Less awesome than a unicorn, though&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">5. <em>Lord of the Rings</em> by JRR Tolkien. I bought these in December when I was making New Year&#8217;s Resolutions and I&#8217;m STILL procrastinating. I need to just get to Middle Earth and read them already. This is getting ridiculous.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wolf-Hall-Novel-Hilary-Mantel/dp/0312429983" target="_blank"><em>Wolf Hall </em></a>by Hilary Mantel has been chilling on my kindle for a while now too. I started it, but it was slow going. I just haven&#8217;t had the attention span for something so meaty in a while. It&#8217;s really meaty, y&#8217;all. Not in a bad way. Just in an &#8220;I need all of my neurons to be firing so I don&#8217;t lose track of what&#8217;s going on&#8221; sort of way. My neurons are pissed right now and hibernating. Still.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">7. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Winter_%28novel%29" target="_blank"><em>The Long Winter </em></a>by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I have a confession to make. I quit the <em>Little House</em> books after they hit the prairie. As much as I dug the pioneer girl thing, there were all kinds of dramatized serials about ballerinas and girls at summer camp filling the library shelves distracting my childish attention&#8230; Anyway, I&#8217;ve been told that I must read this book in particular to revel in the greatest love story of our time. Or, uh, pioneer time. The turn of phrase &#8220;you will die of happiness&#8221; was involved in me getting this recommendation- I really cannot be expected to ignore that. (Side note: this is apparently set in South Dakota. Remember back a few Top Ten Tuesdays ago when I claimed <a title="Top Ten Tuesday: Settings We Need More Of!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/01/22/top-ten-tuesday-settings-we-need-more-of/" target="_blank">North Dakota was an under represented setting</a>? It still is. But we&#8217;re getting closer, aren&#8217;t we?)</p>
<div id="attachment_1598" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 344px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/north-dakota.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1598 " alt="Dude. North Dakota cannot win. It's even got a boring shape.

It&#8217;s even got a boring shape.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slammerkin-Emma-Donoghue/dp/B001O9CG6M" target="_blank"><em>Slammerkin </em></a>by Emma Donoghue. I haven&#8217;t bought this yet, but yeah. Emma Donoghue writing about historical prostitution is the sort of thing I need to be reading. For real.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">That&#8217;s it. Technically I&#8217;m including the entire LOTR trilogy in #5, so that makes 10 books. I might be a cutting corners, but I&#8217;m blaming the LOST HOUR OF SLEEP. And the abysmal grayness that&#8217;s refused to lift for the last couple of weeks. Shoo, winter! Get on out of here! Katie needs some SUNSHINE if she&#8217;s going to cope with her advancing age!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So. Bookworms. What have you got in the hopper? Big plans for reading? Spring cleaning your bookshelves? Angry at Daylight Savings Time? Let&#8217;s chat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bonjour, Bookworms!</p>
<p>Please excuse the pun, I cannot help myself. I&#8217;m incorrigible. Today we are taking a trip to 19th Century Paris as we discuss <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Painted-Girls-A-Novel/dp/1594486247" target="_blank">The Painted Girls</a> </em>by Cathy Marie Buchanan. I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I think of ballet, I think of frothy tutus and toe shoes. I danced growing up, so I can tell you that dance apparel is not inexpensive. Thus, I was surprised to learn that the ballet dancers of the famed opera houses were often more Gavroche than Baryshnikov. (It&#8217;s probably also part of the reason ballet loves super svelte dancers&#8230; The early ones were half starved!) The youngest of the ballet girls were known as the &#8220;petite rats,&#8221; and successful dancers were frequently, uh, sponsored? by creepy old dudes. So. Yeah. The beautiful ballet had a dirty, seedy, underbelly. Scandalous.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paintedgirls.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1582" alt="paintedgirls" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/paintedgirls.jpg?w=189&#038;h=285" width="189" height="285" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t be too shocked by this whole thing- this novel takes place a few decades after <em><a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THE OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank">Les Miserables</a>, </em>it&#8217;s not as though a comprehensive initiative to eradicate poverty had been undertaken. This is a society where a girl could legally prostitute herself at the age of 16 (assuming she was declared STD free, of course. Syphilis was colloquially known as &#8220;French Pox.&#8221;) When artists were looking for ladies to model in the nude, they didn&#8217;t go knocking on the doors of aristocrats, what with all the young nubile flesh for sale. Edgar Degas was one such artist, and if you know anything about his art, you&#8217;ll know that ballet girls were among his favorite subjects. Much in the way Tracy Chevalier brought to life the subject in Vermeer&#8217;s painting in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Pearl-Earring-The-ebook/dp/B000OCXIDK/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1345336646&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=girl+with+a+pearl+earring" target="_blank">Girl With A Pearl Earring</a>, </em>Buchanan does for Marie Van Goethem, the model for Degas&#8217; sculpture <em>Little Dancer Aged 14</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Marie lives in a sketchy Parisian neighborhood with her widowed, absinthe-swilling mother and her two sisters Antoinette and Charlotte. Antoinette had been a ballet girl, though she&#8217;d been tossed out of the company for mouthing off to the director. Instead she began working as an extra in the opera, earning a ridiculously small salary. After the death of their father (and the loss of his income) it is decided that Marie and Charlotte must audition to join the ballet school. Underfed &#8220;rats&#8221; from the wrong side of the proverbial tracks they may be, but super flexible hips are a commodity worth paying for. Both Charlotte and Marie begin their dance careers, in large part to contribute to the family baguette fund. Dancing for their suppers, as it were.</p>
<div id="attachment_1579" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 178px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/degasdancer.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1579  " alt="Image from Metropolitan Museum of Art" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/degasdancer.jpg?w=168&#038;h=307" width="168" height="307" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the sculpture in question. Image from Metropolitan Museum of Art</p></div>
<p>Eventually Marie catches the eye of Degas, and she is more than willing to pose for him in varying states of undress if it keeps her family from starving (absinthe isn&#8217;t cheap, you know.) While Marie is busy being naked in front of weird old men, Antoinette strikes up a romance with a potentially sketchy fellow named Emile, who seems incapable of saving money but terribly fond of spending it (bad combination, Antoinette!) Both Marie and Antoinette (LET THEM EAT CAKE!) try to find ways to hustle for cash so tiny Charlotte will be less affected by their poverty.</p>
<p>In the spirit of not being a major spoilsport, I shall tell you that this novel contains prostitution, petty theft, murder, guillotines, alcoholism, scientific misinformation, and one rather disturbing incident of animal cruelty (you&#8217;ve been warned.) It&#8217;s all based on true events! A triumph of historical fiction, my friends.</p>
<p>So, Bookworms, how much do you love it when art imitates art?! I even made <a href="https://read.rifflebooks.com/list/28283" target="_blank">a list of such novels on Riffle</a>! (Not on Riffle and want to be?! Let me know and I&#8217;ll send you an invite.) Tell me, Bookworms. Ballet, street urchins, Paris, art. and scandal- you&#8217;ve got to have thoughts on some of those things. Tell me, tell me, tell me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday, Bookworms!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while, but it&#8217;s time to ready the confessional: I take an inordinate amount of pride in having beaten my 13 year old cousin in a battle of wits. You like personal stories, right? No? TOO BAD.</p>
<p>When my dad was about 15, he was attending high school at a seminary because he thought he wanted to be a Catholic priest when he grew up. (Obviously, given my existence, that isn&#8217;t the path he chose, but I digress.) My dad was MORTIFIED to learn that he would soon be getting a new sibling. Even 15 year old boys who think they want to be priests know good and well where babies come from, you know? My dad&#8217;s only other sibling had arrived before he was old enough to understand the birds and the bees. This is a long way of explaining why I, age 29 (still, but just barely), have a pair of cute as a button full on genetically bona fide first cousins that are 13 and 11 (it&#8217;s because my uncle is waaaay younger than my dad, see?)</p>
<p>Adam (the elder of the baby cousins) was born when I was 16. I took a day off of my first real job (working concessions at a movie theater) so I could attend his baptism. The whole time my aunt was pregnant, I insisted on referring to the baby as &#8220;Bunny.&#8221; When we found out he was going to be a boy, I was undeterred, then calling him &#8220;my Bunny Boy.&#8221; My extended family lives out of state, so I don&#8217;t see them often. About a year ago, my cousin Adam got himself a Facebook page. (Don&#8217;t turn him in- I KNOW the youngest age for Facebook is 14 or something- don&#8217;t be a bloghole.)</p>
<p>Anyway. Since Adam has gotten a Facebook page I&#8217;ve gotten to know him, digitally. This kid is such a smart ass- it&#8217;s fantastic. I take ALL THE CREDIT for his snarky eyebrows. He likes to send me messages containing puns and then we battle to out-pun each other. He usually wins, he&#8217;s far more practiced (also, I imagine, more adept at internet CHEATING.) A few weeks back, however, I won and it was GLORIOUS.</p>
<div id="attachment_1568" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 538px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/snarky-eyebrow-syndrome.png"><img class=" wp-image-1568 " alt="We have a similar &quot;question mark&quot; face..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/snarky-eyebrow-syndrome.png?w=528&#038;h=228" width="528" height="228" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We have a similar &#8220;question mark&#8221; face&#8230;</p></div>
<p><strong>This painful exchange occurred. Be warned, this reads like consecutive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffy_Taffy" target="_blank">Laffy Taffy</a> jokes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Animal Puns! You ready?! Alpaca your things so we can leave!</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> I don&#8217;t think I have the necessary koala-fications to compete with you.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> You&#8217;re frogging right you don&#8217;t!</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> That&#8217;s irr-elephant!</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> You&#8217;re giraffing me crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> This is getting hawk-ward.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> Let minnow when you&#8217;re read to forfeit.</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> You&#8217;re lion to yourself if you think I&#8217;ll give up!</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong> I&#8217;m not going to worm out if that&#8217;s what you think.</p>
<p><strong>Katie:</strong> That&#8217;s not so much a pun as an expression&#8230; (Says the girl who is running out of ideas&#8230;) WAIT! I-DEERS! &#8220;I&#8217;m running out of I-DEERS!&#8221; I WIN! HA!</p>
<p>I then went on to shout my victory from the mountaintops of Facebook. Adam has contested my supremacy, claiming that I was undeserving&#8230; Considering this win was isolated and I&#8217;ll probably lose the next five battles, I&#8217;m still counting it! (Is anybody else glad they didn&#8217;t have a Facebook page at 13? I mean, I didn&#8217;t have any significantly older and irrefutably delightful cousins to pun with, but my 13 year old self was a nightmare. Pretty glad Adam didn&#8217;t inherit THAT.)</p>
<p>Adam, buddy. Be careful what you put out there, mmmkay? You can&#8217;t take back anything you say in <del>a hormonal rage</del> the heat of the moment once it&#8217;s out on the internet. Trust me on this one, Bunny Boy. Also. Don&#8217;t do drugs. Sorry to go all &#8220;after school special&#8221; on you, but I feel like i need to impart WISDOM and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got. Please tell your little sister that I will happily pun with her once she&#8217;s old enough for Facebook. I&#8217;m an equal opportunity AWESOME cousin.</p>
<p>XOXO,</p>
<p>Katie</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Salvate, Bookworms!</p>
<p>That was a greeting in Latin&#8230; In honor of creepy secret societies everywhere, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Others_%28Lost%29" target="_blank">The Others</a>, and, uh, Catholicism prior to Vatican II. I just read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-ebook/dp/B008FPOIT6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362621685&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mr+penumbra%27s+24-hour+bookstore" target="_blank"><em>Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24 Hour Bookstore </em></a>by Robin Sloan. Spoiler Alert: there&#8217;s Latin in it!</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/penumbra.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1555" alt="penumbra" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/penumbra.jpg?w=660"   /></a>A little synopsis for you: Clay is a recently unemployed design school graduate in desperate need of a job. While wandering the streets of San Fransisco one afternoon, Clay stumbles upon a odd little bookstore with a &#8220;help wanted&#8221; sign. Mr. Penumbra is an eccentric old man and the proprietor of an impossibly narrow three story book store. (One of my favorite things about this book was the description of the sliding ladders. I would LOVE to live in a ginormous house someday with a dedicated library that had sliding ladders!)</p>
<p>Clay is hired and soon realizes that there is no way this book store can stay afloat with the sales figures he&#8217;s running. There&#8217;s also the business of the oddball patrons who are mostly highly eccentric characters that show up at all hours of the night&#8230; Rather than purchasing books, they&#8217;re all borrowing from a mysterious collection huddled at the back of the store.</p>
<p>Around this time Clay starts dating a girl who works at Google named Kat Potente. Kat is brilliant and quirky, owning a dozen of the very same t-shirt so she need not fret about her wardrobe. Once Clay discloses some of his insights into the mysterious bookstore, Kat jumps on board with his adventure. Somewhere between the Gertizsoon font and a museum about knitting, Clay, Kat, and his buddy Neel set about uncovering a 500 year old mystery. (I&#8217;d like to mention that I loved the way Google&#8217;s headquarters were portrayed in this book. It was really fun to compare the fictionally enhanced Google to the way Microsoft was portrayed in <em><a title="“Where’d You Go, Bernadette” by Maria Semple. (Why Did Nobody Mention the PENGUINS?!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/01/21/whered-you-go-bernadette-by-maria-semple-why-did-nobody-mention-the-penguins/" target="_blank">Where&#8217;d You Go Bernadette</a>.)</em></p>
<div id="attachment_1558" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belle.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-1558" alt="(Source: Mad Disney Dreamer)" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/belle.gif?w=660"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(Source: <a href="http://just-a-mad-disney-dreamer.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Mad Disney Dreamer</a>)</p></div>
<p>Without getting excessively spoiler-ish, this book involves uncovering the mysteries of a secret society. It actually reminded me a LOT of Dan Brown&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Da-Vinci-Code-ebook/dp/B000FA675C/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362623064&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=the+da+vinci+code" target="_blank">The </a></em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Da-Vinci-Code-ebook/dp/B000FA675C/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362623064&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=the+da+vinci+code" target="_blank"><em>DaVinci Code </em></a>(I don&#8217;t really care what the literati has to say, I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The DaVinci Code, </em>for reals.) What differentiates this from <em>The DaVinci Code </em>is the whimsy. This book deals with mysteries surrounding a 500 year old publisher and a bunch of bookish weirdos. No matter what their secrets hold, they&#8217;re not as potentially earth shattering to civilization as discovering that one of the world&#8217;s major religions is based on intentionally misleading information. This allows Sloane&#8217;s secret society an element of comedy and charm that the danger and melodrama of <em>The DaVinci Code </em>cannot achieve.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. I found it to be a quick read and it held my interest. In celebration of this work, I started googling to find the Geritzsoon font that was, according to the book, very common and pre-loaded into most computers. Yeah. Griffo Gertiszoon, our mysterious ancient font designer? Fiction. I must admit I was quite disappointed. I like it when my conspiracy books are less easily debunked. All in all though? Still totally worth the read. Knowing the Griffo Gertizsoon is not a real person won&#8217;t hamper your enjoyment of the book at all. Look at me! I&#8217;m GROWING with not SPOILING everything. SOMEBODY GIVE ME A COOKIE!</p>
<p>So. Bookworms. Mysteries. Do you dig them? Do you despise them? Don&#8217;t you want a house with sliding ladders?! (You do. Don&#8217;t bother lying.) Tell me about it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Bookworms!</p>
<p>For this week&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday, the ladies at <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">The Broke and The Bookish </a>have asked a very important question. What are the top ten series you&#8217;d like to start that you haven&#8217;t yet? Admittedly, I had a tough time with this category. Most series that I&#8217;m interested in, I&#8217;ve already started and/or finished. Luckily, I have fabulous friends who don&#8217;t mind me whining to them when I can&#8217;t think of anything to blog about. I shall dedicate this post to <a href="http://www.filing-jointly.com/" target="_blank">Lauren</a> and <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/" target="_blank">Chrissy</a> for helping me compile this GLORIOUS post&#8230; Allow me to direct you to THE LIST!</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ttt3w.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1247" alt="TTT3W" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ttt3w.jpg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lord-Rings-Volume-ebook/dp/B007978OY6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362361746&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lord+of+the+rings+trilogy+kindle+edition" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> by JRR Tolkien. Oh yeah. I&#8217;m procrastinating. I know I should start it, I just can&#8217;t get my head into that fantasy space. It was a New Year&#8217;s Resolution. It&#8217;s only March. Plenty of time still. (Yes Chrissy. I know. I know I should just get on with it. Now shoosh.)</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Divergent-ebook/dp/B004CFA9RS/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362361786&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=divergent" target="_blank"><em>Divergent </em></a>by Veronica Roth. What can I tell you? I cannot get enough dystopian teen fiction. I&#8217;ve got a fever, and the only cure is more <del>cowbell</del> post apocalyptic teen angst!</p>
<p>3.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Passage-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B003F3PM7A/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362361826&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+passage+trilogy" target="_blank"><em> The Passage</em></a> by Justin Cronin. Zombies meet vampires in a tale of human devastation?! Sign me up! But&#8230; I&#8217;m going to wait until after Daylight Savings Time because I prefer to read about terrifying things with natural light. You can&#8217;t be too careful!</p>
<div id="attachment_1547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 181px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-passage-nz-cover.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1547    " alt="Creepy!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/the-passage-nz-cover.jpg?w=171&#038;h=261" width="171" height="261" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Creepy!</p></div>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Dead-Collected-Editions/lm/R3DLKI0S20B6L6" target="_blank"><em>The Walking Dead </em></a>by Robert Kirkman. I love the show so much I really should read the comics. I know they&#8217;re very different from the show, so it&#8217;ll be a whole new way for me to appreciate the zombie apocalypse. Zombies are indifferent to light and dark, so DST won&#8217;t save me here.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Discovery-Witches-Novel-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B004DI7HZ6/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362445893&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=a+discovery+of+witches" target="_blank"><em>Discovery of Witches </em></a>by Deborah Harkness. Witches and vampires and such? I can get down with that. Actually, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of good things about these books, so I&#8217;m intrigued.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lonesome-Dove-ebook/dp/B003NE6HD4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362446193&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lonesome+dove+kindle+edition" target="_blank"><em>Lonesome Dove</em></a> by Larry McMurtry. Westerns aren&#8217;t normally my thing, but I really like historical fiction, and Lauren swears by the <em>Lonesome Dove </em>books. If it turns out I hate them, I&#8217;ll hold her completely responsible, stand beneath her window in the night, and yodel in retribution. (I can&#8217;t yodel. It will be very punishing.)</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Magicians-A-Novel-ebook/dp/B002AU7MJU/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362446976&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+magicians" target="_blank"><em>The Magicians</em></a> by Lev Grossman. Obviously I&#8217;m in the mood for supernatural hijinks. But the last book I read about magicians was so dang MAGICAL. I mean, hello, <em><a title="I Want To Join The Night Circus" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/04/i-want-to-join-the-night-circus/" target="_blank">The Night Circus</a></em>!</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/North-South-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B008DMUQVK/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362447161&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=north+and+south" target="_blank"><em>North &amp; South</em></a> by John Jakes. Civil War drama! I&#8217;m guessing sort of like<a title="Gone with the Wind" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/26/gone-with-the-wind/" target="_blank"> <em>Gone With The Wind </em></a>minus Scarlet, which is awesome, because I spent an awful lot of time wanting to punch Scarlet. All good books have someone you love to hate in them, though, so I&#8217;m sure this will be no exception. I look forward to meeting my next favorite frustrating character!</p>
<p>9. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Narnia-Complete-Collection-ebook/dp/B008LUYSAE/ref=sr_1_3?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362447240&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=the+chronicles+of+narnia" target="_blank"><em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em></a> by CS Lewis. Don&#8217;t get your undies in a twist. I have read <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. </em>Twice even. I also read <em>The Magician&#8217;s Nephew. </em>I ran into trouble when I hit <em>The Horse and His Boy. </em>I got halfway through that bad boy and decided to take a break from Narnia&#8230; I&#8217;ve yet to return.<em> </em></p>
<div id="attachment_1545" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 181px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/narnia.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1545" alt="Oh. In case you were wondering. Turkish Delight is NOT delicious. It's quite repulsive, actually. If you find yourself in the UK, stick to Cadbury." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/narnia.jpg?w=660"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh. In case you were wondering. Turkish Delight is NOT delicious. &#8220;Turkish&#8221; in UK candy means &#8220;gross gelatinous substance that is icky.&#8221;</p></div>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enders-Game-Ender-Quintet-ebook/dp/B003G4W49C/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362447502&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ender%27s+game" target="_blank"><em>Ender&#8217;s Game </em></a>by Orson Scott Card. I read and enjoyed <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em> (well, I DID have some trouble with my crappy spacial reasoning skills imagining all the interplanetary zero gravity training scenarios&#8230; But that&#8217;s minor.) I just haven&#8217;t delved into the 80 thousand sequels/parallel series.</p>
<p>What about you, Bookworms? Do you enjoy reading series? Do you prefer your books to stand alone? I&#8217;m interested. Talk to me!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Dear Bookworms,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a bit grouchy with Ally Condie&#8217;s <em><a title="Matched by Ally Condie: It’s A Little Like A Lot" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/02/26/matched-by-ally-condie-its-a-little-like-a-lot/" target="_blank">Matched </a></em>series so far, so it is with great pleasure that I announce: I liked <em>Reached!</em> How is this even possible?! Read on my friends, read on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/condie-ally-reached.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1529" alt="Condie-Ally-Reached" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/condie-ally-reached.jpg?w=179&#038;h=270" width="179" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>When we last left the gang, Cassia, Ky, Indie, and Xander has all joined The Rising. Ky and Indie are sent to flight school while Cassia and Xander have been assigned to serve The Rising from within The Society. Now they&#8217;re double agents.</p>
<p>You know how The Rising decides to take over The Society? Biological warfare. A plague &#8220;mysteriously&#8221; breaks out that renders people comatose. If they&#8217;re left untreated, they die. Now, I&#8217;m not giving Condie a free pass here. The &#8220;plague&#8221; sounded an AWFUL lot like being petrified by the basilisk in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Chamber-Secrets-Book/dp/0439064872" target="_blank"><em>Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets</em></a>. The Rising plans to take over things by riding in on their white horse of a vaccine and cure. (Which, thankfully, is not made of mandrake root&#8230;) I realize The Society eliminated most pre-society history, but seriously. Why do people never learn? Viruses mutate! If you release a virus on a large population, you should expect it to mutate. For heaven&#8217;s sake, they have to make new flu vaccines every year! Ugh. People. No matter how much science they get, they still do dumb things.</p>
<p>So. Now there&#8217;s a plague. Cassia and Ky are separated. Indie is still kind of a sociopath. Xander is busy being a doctor and trying to do the right thing. I&#8217;m just so thankful that Cassia and Ky were separated because Cassia finally becomes her own person! She stops being the &#8220;OMG I LOVE KY&#8221; single minded teen-bot and starts writing poetry and organizing an art gallery and thinking thoughts. Thank heavens, because she was a few pages away from being thrown into the uninspiring heroine category with <a title="50 Shades of Shenanigans" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/14/50-shades-of-shenanigans/" target="_blank">Ana Steele</a> and <a title="Campy Vamps: My Secret Shame" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/15/campy-vamps-my-secret-shame/" target="_blank">Bella Swan</a>.</p>
<p>How is it that I don&#8217;t even want to get all spoiler-y on you when I&#8217;ve been so mean to the rest of this series? Really, I didn&#8217;t HATE the other two books, they were just formulaic and seemed to &#8220;borrow&#8221; a bit too liberally from everything that had gone before. But then. THEN! Condie like, recognizes that and ADDRESSES it in one of Cassia&#8217;s &#8220;A-Ha&#8221; moments. She comes out and says something to the effect of &#8220;there is nothing original and someone has already done it better, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t create.&#8221; Self awareness.</p>
<div id="attachment_1530" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 287px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/leichtlins_mariposa_lily_yosemite.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1530" alt="Leichtlins_Mariposa_Lily,_Yosemite" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/leichtlins_mariposa_lily_yosemite.jpg?w=277&#038;h=208" width="277" height="208" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This flower SAVES THE WORLD. Well. Mostly anyway.</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">Remember the people who lived outside The Society? The farmers who were chilling in the Carving? The Rising has is flabbergasted by the mutation of the plague and is on the cusp of killing off the very people they tried to &#8220;liberate.&#8221; As a last ditch effort, the illustrious Pilot sends Ky, Cassia, and Xander out into an agrarian village to try and work on a cure for the mutated plague. Now, I love the idea that the antidote to the plague was a flower, but&#8230; I&#8217;m a big fan of Western medicine. Like, if you&#8217;ve got, oh I don&#8217;t know, <a title="Tropical Paradise meets Tragic Disease: Moloka’i by Alan Brennert" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/02/22/my-neighbors-are-better-than-your-neighbors-molokai-by-alan-brennert/" target="_blank">LEPROSY</a>, I think you should get thee to a doctor and get some antibiotics. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to go digging up flower bulbs to try and cure ailments that have clear effective established treatments. However. When regular medicine isn&#8217;t working? Maybe trying some herbal remedies wouldn&#8217;t hurt.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I don&#8217;t know if it was the plague (because, HELLO <a title="The Stand by Stephen King… Or Katie vs. Taylor Swift" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/18/the-stand-by-stephen-king-or-katie-vs-taylor-swift/" target="_blank"><em>The Stand</em></a>) or the fact that the characters seemed to mature emotionally or the idea that a FLOWER saved humanity. Probably the flower part. <a title="I Speak Fluent Daffodil" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/20/i-speak-fluent-daffodil/" target="_blank">Katie loves flowers.  </a>But. The <em>Matched </em>series was saved by <em>Reached. </em>I feel a whole lot less hostile now, which is always a good thing. What do you think, Bookworms? Anybody else finish the series?</p>
