<p align="justify">I have some very exciting news. So exciting in fact that it is taking all my focus and concentration to write coherent sentences instead of simply resorting to loud cheering noises while fist pumping the air (which I would still do if it was not for the fact that that would look very weird written down).</p>
<p align="justify">Basically the exciting news is this; Invading Holland has won. Thanks to your amazing help and support Invading Holland has won the <a href="http://2013.bloggi.es/#european" target="_blank">Best European Blog</a> category of the 2013 Bloggies. I owe each and every one of you a huge thank you.</p>
<p align="justify">If it was not for the fact that I am already married and a father I would say this is the happiest day of my life but I cannot say such things without getting into a lot of trouble. So instead lets agree that this achievement ranks somewhere below my wedding day and the birth of my daughter but much higher than the time I broke my ankle&#8230; And that I am extremely happy and honoured.</p>
<p align="justify">I was not the only Holland based expat blog to make it to the finals this year either. Also nominated were <a href="http://www.likeasponge.nl/" target="_blank">Like a Sponge</a> and <a href="http://nomadmomdiary.com/" target="_blank">Nomad Mum</a>. Proof that we are not just taking over Holland but the rest of Europe too.</p>
<p align="justify">In closing; if you are a long term reader, a short term reader or even a medium term reader; Thank You.</p>
<p align="justify">And if you are finding this blog for the first time&#8230; Hello. My name is Stuart, accident prone Englishman and self proclaimed <a href="http://www.invadingholland.com/new-leadership/" target="_blank">King of Holland</a>. Nice to meet you. Welcome to my strange little corner of the internet.</p>

The first snowflake of spring has fallen. The Easter bunny has wrapped up in his warmest scarf and woolliest jumper. The tulips have frozen and cute baby animals everywhere are huddling together for warmth.  Spring has truly arrived in Holland.</p>
