<p align="justify">A few weeks ago I was asked by the people from <a href="http://www.expatsblog.com/" target="_blank">Expatsblog.com</a> to take part in one of their interviews. Naturally I jumped at the chance (while trying keep my calm British composure).</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ddd;">&#8220;Stuart’s transition from Britain to The Netherlands didn&#8217;t exactly go to plan. In fact, it wasn&#8217;t even part of the plan. That’s what happens when you are a self-declared accident prone Englishman. Originally from London Stuart has spent over the last decade living in the land of clogs and windmills otherwise known as The Netherlands and has even started a family of his own. Language misunderstandings, cultural confusion, bizarre adventures and a few cases of mistaken identity are just a few of the things that have happened to him during his time in the country.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the full interview I explain the bizarre events which led to my arrival in Holland, the virtues of having a friend who regularly calls you an idiot, and how a broken ankle can sometimes be a good cure for home sickness&#8230; <a href="http://www.expatsblog.com/articles/1448/from-london-to-rotterdam-expat-interview-with-stuart" target="_blank">Click here to read the full thing</a></p>

<p align="justify">Many of the long term readers will already know the story of my long and difficult <a href="http://www.invadingholland.com/addiction-2/" target="_blank">struggle with Speculoos addiction</a>. For a long time I was powerless against the desire and the uncontrollable need for its delicious goodness. My addiction to the Speculoos sandwich paste was particularly bad.</p>
<p align="justify">When the addiction was at its worst I was on two, sometimes three jars of the stuff a month. Sometimes the need would get so bad that I would lick the empty jars clean. In fact, I would continue to eat the stuff even when it made me feel unwell. I tried to seek help but apparently you can&#8217;t actually OD from Speculoos addiction according to the so called doctors who dismissed me from the hospital emergency room.</p>
<p align="justify">I just couldn’t stop myself. One time, when the shops were shut and I desperately needed a fix, I tried crushing Speculoos biscuits and mixing them with butter to make my own. It was not a pretty sight (also, it didn&#8217;t work) .</p>
<p align="justify">It took hitting rock bottom to make me realize just how serious my problem was. I knew something had to be done.</p>
<p align="justify">It was not easy. It was a long and difficult road to recovery but I got myself clean. I got my addiction under control and I got my life back. I have not touch Speculoos for three years. I am no longer tempted by its delicious goodness. I am free of its control&#8230; At least I thought I was until I saw this&#8230;</p>

<p>Oh my god. It&#8217;s sooooo good! I can&#8217;t help myself.</p>
