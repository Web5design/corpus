			<description>&lt;p>On Monday of this week, somewhat quietly, we released the docs for the outliner we've been developing at Small Picture, Inc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The docs are interesting, if you like outliners -- but also interesting because they illustrate something important about the outliner. It's very easy to include the editor in a web page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's written in JavaScript. Yet it's indistinguishable from the outliners we've been using, for many years, running native on Windows and Mac. This outliner runs in any HTML-5 compatible browser, on any OS. You install the software by reloading the page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next Monday we'll show the next bit in our queue. And the Monday after that, the next one, etc. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our cup runneth over! (Finally.)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>Google's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">motto&lt;/a> is "Don't be evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paraphrasing HL Mencken's &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532804-when-somebody-says-it-s-not-about-the-money-it-s-about">motto&lt;/a> -- "When somebody says 'don't be evil'-- they're being evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>The literal quote: "When somebody says it's not about the money, it's about the money."&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, the thing to know about evil is there's good evil and bad evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike cholesterol, both are bad for you, but good evil is hard to pin on the purveyor. He makes it seem like someone else is the problem. Bad evil is the kind that comes with a bull's eye on your back that says "Hit me -- please." Google does the latter kind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/21/mrBurns.gif" width="95" height="236" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mrBurns.gif">&lt;/a>It would have been so easy to ease the pain of Reader withdrawal by putting some effort into creating a scapegoat. Someone to blame for the trouble users are having. "At least Google did xxx," their supporters might say. But their withdrawal has all the care and sensitivity of DuPont refusing to clean up a chemical &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/">disaster site&lt;/a>. Sure it happens all the time, quietly -- but the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=death+of+google+reader">death&lt;/a> of Google Reader is not and could not be quiet. All the reporters and bloggers use it! And there's no one to blame but Larry and Sergey. Who end up looking like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">Mr Burns&lt;/a> on The Simpsons. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that they're so bad at evil is encouraging. Maybe deep down inside they aren't. Maybe they truly don't see that the 1 or 2 million people, or how ever many use GR, are actual people, like members of their family, who liked Google, but now will have a hard time doing that when they associate the name with the pain of withdrawal they &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">feel&lt;/a>, from the void of news flow.&lt;/p>

I disagree. If you're going to call someone an asshole, it's impolite to address it to them. If you're objectifying them, saying something you wouldn't say to their face -- then don't say it to their face dammit. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know because I'm sometimes on the receiving end of this. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner&lt;/a>, he's such an idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would much prefer if they left the @ off it. Otherwise I have to look at that idiotic thing over and over until it scrolls off. If you think it's going to get a reply, no way. And if you think I give a shit, I don't. It's just annoying to see a bit of stupidity staying there, like a turd in a toilet that someone refuses to flush. So I usually just &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/06/whyYouGotBlocked.html">block&lt;/a> em. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes it &lt;i>makes sense&lt;/i> to say something about someone you wouldn't want them to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example. The other day at lunch I was saying that Carmelo Anthony, the star of the Knicks, is never going to lead the team to a championship. I wouldn't want Anthony, a fine player, and a nice guy, to see that. I doubt if it would motivate him. And sheez it's not his fault he's in the same division as Lebron James (or for that matter occupying the same NBA as Lebron James). Even Kevin Durant, who is a great leader and player, and totally capable of being a champion, probably can't overcome the audacity and tenacity of the Miami Heat. At least not for the next few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I vote for leaving off the at-sign if you're saying trash about a celeb. &lt;/p>

My panelists didn't buy it. So we wandered in an unsatisfying way (to me at least) around various ideas of what media is about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the speakers was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton">Nick Denton&lt;/a>, founder, publisher and ego of Gawker. Nick says that media is about gate-keeping. Your power and value is in what you let through and what you don't. He said that at the beginning of the blogging era, I had that power (me, as in Dave). He recounted a visit he and his partner made to Palo Alto, probably around 2001 or 2002 or so. They were running a startup called Moreover, and according to Nick, they wanted me to write about it on Scripting News. I didn't know. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I sure didn't want to be a gatekeeper! To me it's a silly idea, and antithetical to what blogging is about. I want you to say what you have to say and if I'm interested or &lt;i>when&lt;/i> I'm interested, I'll read it -- and not because I have to or because there's nothing else to read. We were going from the time of scarcity to overload, and that's what I wanted. Not gatekeeping. Because look who's doing the gatekeeping, some miserable person who will be dead in at most 70 years and probably a lot sooner. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I once &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html">wrote&lt;/a> about how we're all barking, farting Chihuahuas pretending our will means anything. I was thinking about the wonderful character in the Taco Bell commercials. I guess he didn't sell burritos and tacos and challupas or whatever, but I loved the dog, and now that I think of him, I miss him too. I wish they'd bring him back. I'd trade the dog for a million bankruptcy attorney ambulance-chasing mesothelioma profiteers. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>"The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one."&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I was thinking of Bill Gates. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8sZ1DWsAHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nick is now a gatekeeper, I suppose -- and I guess he must have a soft spot for me, because anytime I want publicity from Gawker I seem to be able to get it. I wonder who he's turning down and why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I think of people I know who really are gatekeepers. And then I think of the great scene in The Godfather where all the bosses get together to tell Don Corleone to share his politicians with them. He says if you let my son come back to America you can have the politicians and judges. Now that I can get behind. An old man, in his final years, wants the comfort of his son, to drink wine with, and to tell stories to. What could be better than that! :-)&lt;/p>

My panelists didn't buy it. So we wandered in an unsatisfying way (to me at least) around various ideas of what media is about.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 13:59:11 GMT" pgfnum="20756" text="One of the speakers was &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Nick Denton&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, founder, publisher and ego of Gawker. Nick says that media is about gate-keeping. Your power and value is in what you let through and what you don't. He said that at the beginning of the blogging era, I had that power (me, as in Dave). He recounted a visit he and his partner made to Palo Alto, probably around 2001 or 2002 or so. They were running a startup called Moreover, and according to Nick, they wanted me to write about it on Scripting News. I didn't know. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:01:18 GMT" pgfnum="20757" text="And I sure didn't want to be a gatekeeper! To me it's a silly idea, and antithetical to what blogging is about. I want you to say what you have to say and if I'm interested or &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; I'm interested, I'll read it -- and not because I have to or because there's nothing else to read. We were going from the time of scarcity to overload, and that's what I wanted. Not gatekeeping. Because look who's doing the gatekeeping, some miserable person who will be dead in at most 70 years and probably a lot sooner. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:08:21 GMT" pgfnum="20761" text="I once &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;wrote&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about how we're all barking, farting Chihuahuas pretending our will means anything. I was thinking about the wonderful character in the Taco Bell commercials. I guess he didn't sell burritos and tacos and challupas or whatever, but I loved the dog, and now that I think of him, I miss him too. I wish they'd bring him back. I'd trade the dog for a million bankruptcy attorney ambulance-chasing mesothelioma profiteers. ">
	&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:13:35 GMT" pgfnum="20762" text="&amp;quot;The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one.&amp;quot;">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:13:45 GMT" pgfnum="20763" text="I was thinking of Bill Gates. ">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;outline text="&amp;lt;iframe width=&amp;quot;420&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;315&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8sZ1DWsAHE&amp;quot; frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:03:16 GMT" pgfnum="20758" text="Nick is now a gatekeeper, I suppose -- and I guess he must have a soft spot for me, because anytime I want publicity from Gawker I seem to be able to get it. I wonder who he's turning down and why. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 14:03:52 GMT" pgfnum="20759" text="And then I think of people I know who really are gatekeepers. And then I think of the great scene in The Godfather where all the bosses get together to tell Don Corleone to share his politicians with them. He says if you let my son come back to America you can have the politicians and judges. Now that I can get behind. An old man, in his final years, wants the comfort of his son, to drink wine with, and to tell stories to. What could be better than that! :-)">&lt;/outline>

			<description>&lt;p>Over the weekend Charles Pierce took a &lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/out-on-the-weekend-031513">swipe&lt;/a> at my earlier &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/charlesPierceIsWrongAboutEzraKleinBeingWrong">piece&lt;/a> about sources going direct. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>He has summarized my thoughts: "Journalism is no longer an actual profession because everyone can do it because BLOGS!, that's why. Well, fine, that's an argument. But it's not a good one."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nor does it in any way resemble what I said. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Or anything I have &lt;i>ever&lt;/i> said or thought or even dreamed.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>And btw, how insulting to be called that superficial and that stupid.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>This is what I mean about reporters not listening to people outside their own profession.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>To Klein, he was condescending, but respectful, at least superficially. He didn't read Klein's piece either, or if he did, none of the meaning was reflected in his critique. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>My piece? Clearly he didn't even read it. And he didn't care how stupid it made &lt;i>him&lt;/i> look, to be so dismissive and condescending without even bothering to find out what it was he was dismissing.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Regardless, he's an entertaining and often insightful writer. But I'll always remember when reading him that I've seen some pretty sloppy thinking on his part, and it'll make me question the other stuff he says.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To Mr Pierce: I love reading your stuff, and if your getting paid is what it takes for you to continue, I hope you continue to get paid for a long time to come. I hope that puts to rest any thought that I begrudge you your salary. :-)&lt;/p>

This is the discussion so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Max wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>RSS has a decentralized pub/sub model; the format has been open and stable for a long time; the addressing scheme has no reliance on a specific client. How does the death of one, particularly good even, client, carry with it a threat to the whole ecosystem?&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I responded:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They weren't just "one client" -- they dominated, in the way that MSIE dominated the browser space. And they did what MSIE did, once they gained dominance they froze development (that might have happened through competition) and stopped moving. Everything that was broken in GR became a feature of RSS. And all the things that should have happened, to mature the market, couldn't happen.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Now maybe that's about to change for the better. I hope so. But I'm not encouraged. This is a market where, in order for it to flourish, there HAS to be cooperation among vendors. That's what Twitter proved. Because they control the whole user experience they were able to solve problems that the RSS market couldn't. First, because the vendors wouldn't cooperate, and then because Google took the whole market. So we are now locked into a single vendor -- Twitter.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>So the way it looks to me is that there are three possible outcomes:&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1. GR's demise is also the end of RSS (which seems to me is Google's desired outcome, based on other things they did).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>2. A market develops, but we're unable to get the new features into it that simplify the subscription process, so it has a chance re Twitter. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3. A new dominant reader comes about, and if they're good then maybe something good happens.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I don't think there's the slightest possibility of #3. People in tech are just too insular, they don't study prior art, or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are, much less what the potential solutions are. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I think more likely is a mix between #1 and #2. A continued decline for RSS as an activity and more and more reliance on big companies that don't give a fuck.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>1. Use the email address that Amazon provides for your Kindle. It's on the Amazon site, poke around, you'll find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. The Kindle app shows up under Apps in iTunes. You can drag .mobi files into its Documents directory and they show up in the Kindle app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. You can use Dropbox.

&lt;p>Think about that for a minute. Scripting News was the &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">first feed&lt;/a>. The specs were all written in such a way that Scripting News worked. It would be impossible, unthinkable that somehow the first feed could not be read by a reader from Google.

&lt;p>Eventually I caved, and got rid of the features that Google couldn't handle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here's the good thing -- I can put things into my feeds that Google Reader doesn't like. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not that I haven't already been doing that for a couple of years. ;-)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>It's always controversial to say that big tech companies make money by controlling the flows to and from users and charging others for access. But that is at least one of the businesses Silicon Valley is in. And it's definitely the business &lt;i>Google&lt;/i> is in, so if you want to understand why they might do something to restrict or try to control the flow of RSS, that's probably part of the story, at least. (I'm bending over backwards to be conservative here.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing to fear is that Google intends to control the news people can subscribe to, the same way Apple controls what apps you can buy for the iPad. And the way Twitter decides what clients can have access to our tweets.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They've got a pretty nice interface for it, btw -- the magical Google Now. It knows what information you're likely to want to see, and shows it to you. It's really good. &lt;/li>
	&lt;ul>
		&lt;li>An example of how good/creepy it is. My friend Jen was coming to visit from SLC. Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK. I had never told them what flight she was on. &lt;i>I didn't know what flight she was on.&lt;/i> But they did. Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar, and somehow connected me to that trip (or did they just guess!) and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight. I was!&lt;/li>
		&lt;/ul>
	&lt;li>But it's creepy, in two ways. One way most people see (it's snooping on what you do to figure out what you want to see). The second way: it's also deciding what you &lt;i>don't&lt;/i> see. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Centralizing this decision-making, for now, is the only way that works. But we're giving something up here. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I love that the content of my river is not determined by any tech company. Do I think it will stay that way? It's possible that it might not. Even though I'm not running any Google software to manage it. (I run the aggregator on a Rackspace server, and the content is served from an Amazon S3 bucket.)&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We broke free for a bit there with unrestricted flow from blogs and news orgs via RSS. There are people who would like to put the genie back in the bottle. They're not going to run press releases saying that. This is one of those cases where the reporters have to investigate to get the news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>News people -- if your plan for the future includes free flow of news from journalists to readers, now's the time to take a look. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main thing we &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/18/rebootingRssTwoKeyPoints.html">learned&lt;/a> is that subscription needs to be centralized to make the process as simple as possible for the user. That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator. Also, this feature opens the possibility of a sort of super-curator, someone who manages a collections of feeds that people can subscribe to in a unit. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also in the argument betw mailbox and river type readers, why not do both? The same data can be viewed either way. Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/14/rss.gif" width="65" height="59" border="0" style="float: left; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named rss.gif">Also a feed should have a way to tell readers "I'm done" -- no more updates, stop reading me. That would make it possible to do more things with RSS. I don't want to subscribe to a special feed about a specific event, knowing I'll have to remember to unsub. Better to let the feed tell the reader. This feature is documented in my &lt;a href="http://microblog.reallysimple.org/">microblog namespace&lt;/a> and it's supported in my &lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&lt;/a> linkblogging tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of other ideas like this. I'll write them up as I remember them. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>I've been doing a lot more with outliners in the last few months, in a project I've been working on with a new programming partner, Kyle Shank, at a new company we founded late last year, &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&lt;/a>. It has both a server side and a client side. Next week we will show the first bits of the client software. I think it will surprise people what it can do and how it does it. But this wouldn't be a good tease if I told you more about what it is. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meantime, if you have stories to tell about how you love outlining, please consider posting them. I love outliners, but I love outliner &lt;i>users&lt;/i> even more. They're such bright people and so incredibly powerful and creative. Software that enables powerful people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much more to say and I hope to say it all.&lt;/p>

I love Pierce's irreverent writing style, and his political opinions match up pretty well with mine. I learn stuff by reading his columns in Esquire. Same with Klein. He's intelligent, and asks good questions, and backs up his thinking with information. It's sad that his way of working is so rare among political analysts these days. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But guys like Pierce (who criticizes Klein in his &lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/icoynoiu">recent piece&lt;/a>, more about that in a minute) only read other news people. The chances of either of them reading what I write are pretty close to nil, so the chances of them passing along a good idea that I might have are therefore also nil. This is embarassing, because the epiphany of Klein's that Pierce mocks happens to be one that I have been writing about for almost 20 years, over and over. Think of all the time everyone could have saved if they deigned to pay attention to people who don't do what they do. It's tragic that it took a smart guy like Klein so long to understand such a basic structural truth about how news, his own profession, has been working &lt;i>for the last 15 years.&lt;/i> Gives you some idea about the power of the blinders this community puts on.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">Upton Sinclair&lt;/a>: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, in the past, any idea that didn't penetrate the haze of guys like Klein and Pierce would have very little chance of being heard by people like myself who might be interested. However, because we live in the times of the Internet and what Klein calls The &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/10/revenge-of-the-sources/">Revenge of the Sources&lt;/a>, I can go ahead and be heard without them listening. I call this &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html">Sources Go Direct&lt;/a>, which means the same thing, but in a more positive less journalist-centered view. It's not revenge, it's more pragmatic. The old system didn't work. So we use the new one instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the mechanics of how a news story is created and flows, there are sources, a reporter, an editor or two, a production and design group, a printing press or web site, a delivery system and finally readers. In the past I have been a source, and I still am, because reporters can and sometimes do quote my blog. I wish they would do it more. I am also an avid reader. I am not, and never have been, and don't want to be, a reporter or an editor or any of the other things. I do write publishing systems, and have created some of the software that these guys probably use. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pierce incorrectly thinks that every act of journalism is done by reporters. Look at the list of people in the paragraph above. There are lots of other roles. The sources aren't covering a fatal crash on Sunday night on Route 128 (his example). Instead they're writing, on their blogs, about the things they know about. Perhaps they were involved in the crash. Perhaps they witnessed it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In software, lots of stuff gets created that isn't on the radar of people like Pierce or Klein. They have very limited focus. They look to big rich companies with lots of employees for technology innovation. Makes sense, because they're employees of big rich companies. Of course that's what they understand. But if you look at the history of software (and very few people do) you'll notice that the big ideas almost never come from those places. If you understand the process of software, you'd understand why that's so. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So while I admire both Klein and Pierce for their work as news people, boy would it be great if they looked outside their close-knit little community. Klein is a pioneer in his field for noticing Sources Go Direct first among his peers. But the idea was available to him long ago. And Pierce, a very flexible thinker when it comes to politics, has no flexibility in thinking about media, no ability to see things from other peoples' point of view, as demonstrated by his piece about Klein. And that's so important, and has been important for a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've met Pierce's attitude many times, from all kinds of ink-stained pros, some very accomplished. The arrogance is impressive, but they're still wrong. I don't care how many Pulitzers you have. The news process has been reorganizing for quite some time. You may not choose to see it, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Do I think either of them will read this piece? Nah. :-)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>It's pretty obvious what comes next, via extrapolation -- from past turns of the wheel in software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What comes next is an easy way for the generation of people who grew up on Facebook to create their own social networks, accessible only by the people they want to share it with. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A somewhat easier to use version of what AWS is today will be the platform. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Harvard dropouts of the day will create AMIs their friends will configure cleverly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The art in this new way of doing things will be clever twists on "share."&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So I'll give you a list of 20 movies, Mr Movie Theater Owner, and one night every other week, you'll play one of them, and I'll guarantee a certain number of tickets sold. Above that, we'll split the revenue. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way we get to watch old movies in a theater setting, with popcorn and restrooms, and then we can all go out to dinner after and talk about the movies and why we like them so much. Maybe we could even get one of the actors or the director to join us. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Movie theaters should be hubs for social activity. Watching a movie at home or on a laptop or a tablet isn't the same as watching it in a theater. And most of the great movies  aren't showing in theaters now.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>I watched the Evan Williams &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBDPO8b-NUg">interview&lt;/a> with Jason Calacanis at the &lt;a href="http://festival.launch.co/">Launchfest&lt;/a> conference in SF, and that gave me a better idea of what he's thinking about with his new company, Medium. The next day we learned that &lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/07/ex-wired-editor-evan-hansen-lands-at-obvious-corp-will-lead-editorial-for-medium/">Evan Hansen&lt;/a> is now working for Medium. Evan was the longtime editor of wired.com. Highly respected guy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is Medium doing? My guess -- if you were to draw a line and at one end put blogging tools and at the other put BuzzFeed, SB Nation and Huffington, that Medium is on that line, and closer to the right than the left.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/08/diagram.gif" width="500" height="111" border="0" alt="A picture named diagram.gif">&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Medium's strength appears to be the elegance and HTML 5-ness of its editorial tools. It feels nice using their editor. Like the content networks, being able to create content there is invite-only. But I'm assuming at some point it will be open to everyone, the way Tumblr or WordPress are. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>An advantage Medium is likely to have is a connection to Twitter, which doesn't have a blogging system, and has recently had success with Vine. Twitter giving Medium a boost is good business, for the owners of both companies. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm very interested in where all  this is going, keeping an ear out and listening. &lt;/p>
