			<description>&lt;p>As developers rush to fill the Google Reader hole, it seems everyone is trying to reproduce Google Reader, almost verbatim. It's understandable. There are a huge number of fans of Google Reader who will be without  Google Reader as of July 1. So when they tell you what they want, it's no surprise that what they come up with is basically, Google Reader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think/hope they will be well-served. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there's an opportunity to do something different that might be equally interesting. Without asking users what they want, create a product based on a different hypothesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>A famous platform vendor once &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2001/01/03.html#aStory">asked&lt;/a> me if the users were asking for ThinkTank, my first product, before I created it. He had a point. There were no users before there was a product. So they couldn't ask. Because they didn't exist.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The hypothesis: What if Twitter were, in every way, open. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/28/rssTShirt.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named rssTShirt.gif">What would that look like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. First, it would look like Twitter. There would be a box at the top of the page that asks What's Happening, and below that a sequence of new items from people you follow, in reverse-chronologic order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. It would be easy to follow someone. When you're looking at their profile page, there would be a big easy to see button that says Follow. It would not say Follow in Product X or Follow in Product Y, etc. It would not open up a huge dialog with a list of products you could follow it in. It would say Follow. And when you click it you Follow that person. No questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. It's a web app. No synchronization among different clients. Supply an API if you like. But like Twitter it's always reverse-chronologic, and it doesn't remember what you haven't read. Yes, some users won't like that. They will use the other kind of RSS app, the ones that synch between clients. (See the first paragraph of this piece.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. No lock-in. That's where it gets tricky. But it's a different kind of tricky than the people cloning Google Reader will encounter. Over there, you have to synchronize news items among lots of possible clients. Here you have to let the user tell you where she stores her subscriptions (and that will determine who gets the message when the user clicks on the Follow button). Beyond that, every developer could experiment with different scanning possibilities, and different presentations, and different whatevers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my dream system. I would happily make components for it. I'm just one user, for sure, and you might have to think a bit more to do this one vs the straight Google Reader clone. But there's also more opportunity to innovate. And it won't just be a repeat of the last 8 years.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>We just did a great rollout, the &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&lt;/a> is fantastic. This is going to move tech in a new direction. It'll create new standards. I'm absolutely sure of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, even with my track record as one who leads change in technology, the release of this software has gotten almost no note from leading tech bloggers and reporters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's okay, because it'll happen without them. Last time I pushed something through, it didn't get support from the press either. And the time before that. We &lt;i>can&lt;/i> make it happen without their help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they're comfortable with big software ideas coming from big companies. But I can't make change happen within the context of a big corporation. Too much second-guessing, too many strategy taxes, too many phony business models. So I choose to do it as an independent. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/bike.gif" width="145" height="88" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bike.gif">I think software is like other creative arts -- music, architecture, cooking, even design of everyday things like bikes and clothes. It takes a relentless focus on the act of using, and what kind of effect you want to create. Learning from others, and stealing from the best. Only. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can do it on our own but it would be &lt;i>easier&lt;/i> if we got help from influencers and gatekeepers. So if you like anything that I helped bring about, blogging, RSS and podcasting and a few other things, please have a look at &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&lt;/a>. It's a little product, yes -- but one with very big ambitions. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are early days, the &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&lt;/a> is very simple, and well-&lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">documented&lt;/a>. We went to great lengths to &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/littleOutlinerPressGuide.html">make&lt;/a> it &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/demo.html">easy&lt;/a> to understand. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Helping users understand new relevant technology &lt;i>is&lt;/i> what you do, after all. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: I did not include comments on this post because this is the kind of thing that attracts a lot of trolls. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PPS: To users, this is why you haven't heard much about Little Outliner in the tech press. There's nothing wrong with the product. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>On our Q&amp;A &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/questions.html">page&lt;/a>, he asked how do you select-all in an outline. He was disappointed that when you press Cmd-A it only selects the siblings at the same level as the bar cursor headline. He felt it should select all the text in the outline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &lt;i>scoped.&lt;/i> When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it. So if you want to select everything in an outline, move the cursor to one of the summits, and do the select-all there. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is fundamentally different from the way a word processor or spreadsheet works, but it's exactly the way the Finder or Windows Explorer works, which are also scoped. When you select-all in a folder, it doesn't select all the files on your computer -- it just selects the files in the folder you're working in. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does it work this way? Well, an outline can logically contain many documents, not just one. For example, I'm writing this blog post in an outline that contains all my posts dating back to March of last year. If I did a &lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllInBlogPost.gif">select-all here&lt;/a>, I'd want it to select all the text in this post, not all the text in all posts. However if I wanted to select everything, I could do that, by putting the cursor on the top level headline, as illustrated in this &lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllTop.gif">screen shot&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

For many, apparently this is the first time they have encoutered this HTML 5 feature. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked for a user-oriented FAQ on local storage but all I found were descriptions of the feature for developers. And for developers, there really isn't that much to know. I've put the details under this headline, you can expand it if you care.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>There's a new browser object called localStorage. It behaves like any other JavaScript object except it persists. That means the next time the user comes back to your site, the storage will still be there, exactly as it was last time they visited.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>In most browsers the object is attached to a single domain, so joe.userland.com and mary.userland.com will have different localStorage objects. Apparently Firefox is different, in that joe and mary share a localStorage object. There are reasons to do it either way. It would be nice if they all did it the &lt;i>same&lt;/i> way. ;-)&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So here are some answers to frequently asked question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Where is local storage stored? It varies from browser to browser. Some users have explored in the system settings folders on various operating systems and found the files. They look like they're SQL databases. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. How much space does it use? The per-domain limit is 5MB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable. That said, localStorage &lt;i>is&lt;/i> a potentially dangerous feature, in the hands of a malicious website. This is something the browser vendors will probably have to address sooner or later. Probably sooner. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet. If even this is too much to bear, we can add a way for you to delete that too. (I imagine someone will say that it is, so I'm already preparing to write the code.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have other questions, ask them below and we'll try to answer them, the best we can.&lt;/p>

			<title>Scripting News: The missing HTML 5 local storage FAQ.</title>

For many, apparently this is the first time they have encoutered this HTML 5 feature. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline collapse="true" created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:19:02 GMT" pgfnum="21415" text="I looked for a user-oriented FAQ on local storage but all I found were descriptions of the feature for developers. And for developers, there really isn't that much to know. I've put the details under this headline, you can expand it if you care.">
	&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:19:57 GMT" pgfnum="21417" text="There's a new browser object called localStorage. It behaves like any other JavaScript object except it persists. That means the next time the user comes back to your site, the storage will still be there, exactly as it was last time they visited.">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:20:19 GMT" pgfnum="21418" text="In most browsers the object is attached to a single domain, so joe.userland.com and mary.userland.com will have different localStorage objects. Apparently Firefox is different, in that joe and mary share a localStorage object. There are reasons to do it either way. It would be nice if they all did it the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;same&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; way. ;-)">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:22:23 GMT" pgfnum="21419" text="So here are some answers to frequently asked question.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:22:39 GMT" pgfnum="21420" text="1. Where is local storage stored? It varies from browser to browser. Some users have explored in the system settings folders on various operating systems and found the files. They look like they're SQL databases. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:23:34 GMT" pgfnum="21421" text="2. How much space does it use? The per-domain limit is 5MB.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:28 GMT" pgfnum="21425" text="3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:39:50 GMT" pgfnum="21426" text="4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:30:41 GMT" pgfnum="21423" text="5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable. That said, localStorage &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; a potentially dangerous feature, in the hands of a malicious website. This is something the browser vendors will probably have to address sooner or later. Probably sooner. ;-)">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:28:04 GMT" pgfnum="21422" text="6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet. If even this is too much to bear, we can add a way for you to delete that too. (I imagine someone will say that it is, so I'm already preparing to write the code.)">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 26 Mar 2013 12:34:21 GMT" pgfnum="21424" text="If you have other questions, ask them below and we'll try to answer them, the best we can.">&lt;/outline>

			<description>&lt;p>We just shipped a &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">new product&lt;/a>, promoted the hell out of it (with great results, thanks!), the site is getting huge traffic, but our server is as quiet as it was yesterday. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because this web app uses no server resources. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's the magic of HTML 5 &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/usersGuideToLocalStorage">local storage&lt;/a>, and static pages on S3. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the W3C and to Werner Vogels (for persisting in getting the ability to access the root of a domain from an S3 bucket). As a result, we get unlimited scaling with zero investment. Consider this an endorsement for both innovations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, that said, in future incarnations, we will have a server component, and scaling &lt;i>will&lt;/i> be an issue. But for right now we can bask in the glory. ;-)&lt;/p>

			<title>Small Picture: Little Outliner press guide.</title>
			</item>
		<item>
			<description>&lt;p>On Monday of this week, somewhat quietly, we released the docs for the &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/doYouLoveOutliners">outliner&lt;/a> we've been developing at Small Picture, Inc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The docs are interesting, if you like outliners -- but also interesting because they illustrate something important about the outliner. It's very easy to include in a web page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's a practice outliner right there on the docs page. Kind of subtle. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's written in JavaScript. Yet it's indistinguishable from the outliners we've been using, for many years, running native on Windows and Mac. This outliner runs in any HTML-5 compatible browser, on any OS. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>You install the software by reloading the page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next Monday we'll show the next bit in our queue. And the Monday after that, the next one, etc. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our cup runneth over! (Finally.)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>Google's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">motto&lt;/a> is "Don't be evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paraphrasing HL Mencken's &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532804-when-somebody-says-it-s-not-about-the-money-it-s-about">motto&lt;/a> -- "When somebody says 'don't be evil'-- they're being evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>The literal quote: "When somebody says it's not about the money, it's about the money."&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, the thing to know about evil is there's good evil and bad evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike cholesterol, both are bad for you, but good evil is hard to pin on the purveyor. He makes it seem like someone else is the problem. Bad evil is the kind that comes with a bull's eye on your back that says "Hit me -- please." Google does the latter kind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/21/mrBurns.gif" width="95" height="236" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named mrBurns.gif">&lt;/a>It would have been so easy to ease the pain of Reader withdrawal by putting some effort into creating a scapegoat. Someone to blame for the trouble users are having. "At least Google did xxx," their supporters might say. But their withdrawal has all the care and sensitivity of DuPont refusing to clean up a chemical &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/">disaster site&lt;/a>. Sure it happens all the time, quietly -- but the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=death+of+google+reader">death&lt;/a> of Google Reader is not and could not be quiet. All the reporters and bloggers use it! And there's no one to blame but Larry and Sergey. Who end up looking like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Burns">Mr Burns&lt;/a> on The Simpsons. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that they're so bad at evil is encouraging. Maybe deep down inside they aren't. Maybe they truly don't see that the 1 or 2 million people, or how ever many use GR, are actual people, like members of their family, who liked Google, but now will have a hard time doing that when they associate the name with the pain of withdrawal they &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/20/sorry-google-you-can-keep-it-to-yourself/">feel&lt;/a>, from the void of news flow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I would much prefer if they left the @ off it. Otherwise I have to look at that idiotic thing over and over until it scrolls off. If you think it's going to get a reply, no way. And if you think I give a shit, I don't. It's just annoying to see a bit of stupidity staying there, like a turd in a toilet that someone refuses to flush. So I usually just &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/06/whyYouGotBlocked.html">block&lt;/a> em. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes it &lt;i>makes sense&lt;/i> to say something about someone you wouldn't want them to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example. The other day at lunch I was saying that Carmelo Anthony, the star of the Knicks, is never going to lead the team to a championship. I wouldn't want Anthony, a fine player, and a nice guy, to see that. I doubt if it would motivate him. And sheez it's not his fault he's in the same division as Lebron James (or for that matter occupying the same NBA as Lebron James). Even Kevin Durant, who is a great leader and player, and totally capable of being a champion, probably can't overcome the audacity and tenacity of the Miami Heat. At least not for the next few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I vote for leaving off the at-sign if you're saying trash about a celeb. &lt;/p>

I disagree. If you're going to call someone an asshole, it's impolite to address it to them. If you're objectifying them, saying something you wouldn't say to their face -- then don't say it to their face dammit. :-)">&lt;/outline>

My panelists didn't buy it. So we wandered in an unsatisfying way (to me at least) around various ideas of what media is about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the speakers was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton">Nick Denton&lt;/a>, founder, publisher and ego of Gawker. Nick says that media is about gate-keeping. Your power and value is in what you let through and what you don't. He said that at the beginning of the blogging era, I had that power (me, as in Dave). He recounted a visit he and his partner made to Palo Alto, probably around 2001 or 2002 or so. They were running a startup called Moreover, and according to Nick, they wanted me to write about it on Scripting News. I didn't know. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I sure didn't want to be a gatekeeper! To me it's a silly idea, and antithetical to what blogging is about. I want you to say what you have to say and if I'm interested or &lt;i>when&lt;/i> I'm interested, I'll read it -- and not because I have to or because there's nothing else to read. We were going from the time of scarcity to overload, and that's what I wanted. Not gatekeeping. Because look who's doing the gatekeeping, some miserable person who will be dead in at most 70 years and probably a lot sooner. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I once &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html">wrote&lt;/a> about how we're all barking, farting Chihuahuas pretending our will means anything. I was thinking about the wonderful character in the Taco Bell commercials. I guess he didn't sell burritos and tacos and challupas or whatever, but I loved the dog, and now that I think of him, I miss him too. I wish they'd bring him back. I'd trade the dog for a million bankruptcy attorney ambulance-chasing mesothelioma profiteers. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>"The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one."&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I was thinking of Bill Gates. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8sZ1DWsAHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nick is now a gatekeeper, I suppose -- and I guess he must have a soft spot for me, because anytime I want publicity from Gawker I seem to be able to get it. I wonder who he's turning down and why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I think of people I know who really are gatekeepers. And then I think of the great scene in The Godfather where all the bosses get together to tell Don Corleone to share his politicians with them. He says if you let my son come back to America you can have the politicians and judges. Now that I can get behind. An old man, in his final years, wants the comfort of his son, to drink wine with, and to tell stories to. What could be better than that! :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As hobbled as Google Reader was, it was largely a creation of its users. They did the programming for themselves. They chose what channels of news they wanted to listen to, assembling a highly customized news flow and sharing their discoveries.&lt;/p>

A news system where the users have even more power to shape the news that they will receive from you. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's long-past time to trust the users and just do what they want you to do. You will probably be surprised at how profitable that turns out to be. Imho of course.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>Over the weekend Charles Pierce took a &lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/out-on-the-weekend-031513">swipe&lt;/a> at my earlier &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/charlesPierceIsWrongAboutEzraKleinBeingWrong">piece&lt;/a> about sources going direct. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>He has summarized my thoughts: "Journalism is no longer an actual profession because everyone can do it because BLOGS!, that's why. Well, fine, that's an argument. But it's not a good one."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nor does it in any way resemble what I said. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Or anything I have &lt;i>ever&lt;/i> said or thought or even dreamed.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>And btw, how insulting to be called that superficial and that stupid.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>This is what I mean about reporters not listening to people outside their own profession.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>To Klein, he was condescending, but respectful, at least superficially. He didn't read Klein's piece either, or if he did, none of the meaning was reflected in his critique. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>My piece? Clearly he didn't even read it. And he didn't care how stupid it made &lt;i>him&lt;/i> look, to be so dismissive and condescending without even bothering to find out what it was he was dismissing.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Regardless, he's an entertaining and often insightful writer. But I'll always remember when reading him that I've seen some pretty sloppy thinking on his part, and it'll make me question the other stuff he says.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To Mr Pierce: I love reading your stuff, and if your getting paid is what it takes for you to continue, I hope you continue to get paid for a long time to come. I hope that puts to rest any thought that I begrudge you your salary. :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I remember once watching him talk on stage at a conference in Copenhagen. I had this instant visceral thought that he might be the Rupert Murdoch of this medium we were creating. I knew I wasn't that. I'm more of a creative guy, I eschew empire building. (But I do like an interesting word or phrase!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I was just reading this &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/mitt-romneys-last-hurrah.html">piece&lt;/a> in the New Yorker. It's short and to the point, and asks an interesting question. Why doesn't Mitt Romney finally let his hair down a little. It's of course well-written, it's in the New Yorker after all. I thought to myself -- "I bet this is the kind of writing they're looking for at Medium."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm more casual a writer. I think of blogging as a written form of fresco. Made of plaster with a little coloring. It hardens fast, and you move on to something else. I used to say "we're just folks here." That's the kind of writing I aspire to. &lt;/p>

This is the discussion so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Max wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>RSS has a decentralized pub/sub model; the format has been open and stable for a long time; the addressing scheme has no reliance on a specific client. How does the death of one, particularly good even, client, carry with it a threat to the whole ecosystem?&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I responded:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They weren't just "one client" -- they dominated, in the way that MSIE dominated the browser space. And they did what MSIE did, once they gained dominance they froze development (that might have happened through competition) and stopped moving. Everything that was broken in GR became a feature of RSS. And all the things that should have happened, to mature the market, couldn't happen.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Now maybe that's about to change for the better. I hope so. But I'm not encouraged. This is a market where, in order for it to flourish, there HAS to be cooperation among vendors. That's what Twitter proved. Because they control the whole user experience they were able to solve problems that the RSS market couldn't. First, because the vendors wouldn't cooperate, and then because Google took the whole market. So we are now locked into a single vendor -- Twitter.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>So the way it looks to me is that there are three possible outcomes:&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1. GR's demise is also the end of RSS (which seems to me is Google's desired outcome, based on other things they did).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>2. A market develops, but we're unable to get the new features into it that simplify the subscription process, so it has a chance re Twitter. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3. A new dominant reader comes about, and if they're good then maybe something good happens.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I don't think there's the slightest possibility of #3. People in tech are just too insular, they don't study prior art, or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are, much less what the potential solutions are. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I think more likely is a mix between #1 and #2. A continued decline for RSS as an activity and more and more reliance on big companies that don't give a fuck.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>1. Use the email address that Amazon provides for your Kindle. It's on the Amazon site, poke around, you'll find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. The Kindle app shows up under Apps in iTunes. You can drag .mobi files into its Documents directory and they show up in the Kindle app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. You can use Dropbox. It will report it can't open the files but if you look in the upper right corner of the screen there's a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phil_b/status/312666111059578880/photo/1">way&lt;/a> to send them to a bunch of apps, for .mobi files this includes the Kindle app. &lt;/p>

That was after an awkward period, when Google Reader started up, that it couldn't do a good job of reading &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">Scripting News's feed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about that for a minute. Scripting News was the &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">first feed&lt;/a>. The specs were all written in such a way that Scripting News worked. It would be impossible, unthinkable that somehow the first feed could not be read by a reader from Google. But that's the way it worked. From day one, Google came in with the attitude of The Boss Man. We run this show. I always thought well fuck that shit. What's the point of creating something new if a big asshole company can come along and break you. On day one. Not even a Hello World from a Humble Newbie. Nahh. We're Google. You're nothin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually I caved, and got rid of the features that Google couldn't handle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here's the good thing -- I can put things into my feeds that Google Reader doesn't like. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not that I haven't already been doing that for a couple of years. ;-)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>It's always controversial to say that big tech companies make money by controlling the flows to and from users and charging others for access. But that is at least one of the businesses Silicon Valley is in. And it's definitely the business &lt;i>Google&lt;/i> is in, so if you want to understand why they might do something to restrict or try to control the flow of RSS, that's probably part of the story, at least. (I'm bending over backwards to be conservative here.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing to fear is that Google intends to control the news people can subscribe to, the same way Apple controls what apps you can buy for the iPad. And the way Twitter decides what clients can have access to our tweets.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They've got a pretty nice interface for it, btw -- the magical Google Now. It knows what information you're likely to want to see, and shows it to you. It's really good. &lt;/li>
	&lt;ul>
		&lt;li>An example of how good/creepy it is. My friend Jen was coming to visit from SLC. Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK. I had never told them what flight she was on. &lt;i>I didn't know what flight she was on.&lt;/i> But they did. Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar, and somehow connected me to that trip (or did they just guess!) and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight. I was!&lt;/li>
		&lt;/ul>
	&lt;li>But it's creepy, in two ways. One way most people see (it's snooping on what you do to figure out what you want to see). The second way: it's also deciding what you &lt;i>don't&lt;/i> see. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Centralizing this decision-making, for now, is the only way that works. But we're giving something up here. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I love that the content of my river is not determined by any tech company. Do I think it will stay that way? It's possible that it might not. Even though I'm not running any Google software to manage it. (I run the aggregator on a Rackspace server, and the content is served from an Amazon S3 bucket.)&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We broke free for a bit there with unrestricted flow from blogs and news orgs via RSS. There are people who would like to put the genie back in the bottle. They're not going to run press releases saying that. This is one of those cases where the reporters have to investigate to get the news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>News people -- if your plan for the future includes free flow of news from journalists to readers, now's the time to take a look. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main thing we &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/18/rebootingRssTwoKeyPoints.html">learned&lt;/a> is that subscription needs to be centralized to make the process as simple as possible for the user. That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator. Also, this feature opens the possibility of a sort of super-curator, someone who manages a collections of feeds that people can subscribe to in a unit. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also in the argument betw mailbox and river type readers, why not do both? The same data can be viewed either way. Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try).&lt;/p>

That would make it possible to do more things with RSS. I don't want to subscribe to a special feed about a specific event, knowing I'll have to remember to unsub. Better to let the feed tell the reader. This feature is documented in my &lt;a href="http://microblog.reallysimple.org/">microblog namespace&lt;/a> and it's supported in my &lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&lt;/a> linkblogging tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of other ideas like this. I'll write them up as I remember them. &lt;/p>

It was character-based, on a scrolling display. You'd type commands like &lt;code>1,$p&lt;/code> to show all the lines at the current level. You could view the subs of any headline, by typing the number next to it, and pressing Return. The basic operations were "dive" and "surface." Moving things around was a little more difficult, but it was the best you could do with the computers of the day. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools advanced through the years. Influenced by Visicalc, then Lotus 1-2-3. That's when the outliner got a "bar cursor" which points to a structure, much like Visicalc's cursor points to a spreadsheet cell. You moved the cursor around with the arrow keys, and expanded by pressing &lt; and collapsed by pressing >. These keys were chosen as mnemonics, they looked symbolically like the operations they were performing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty soon after that we got the mouse, so you could double-click to expand and collapse and also drag things from one place to another. This made stuff flow better. That's a key idea -- outlines are about flow, they make text fluid (i.e. able to flow).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then came graphics, and with that bullet charts and tree charts. All of a sudden there was a production application for outliners, they could be made to do things more efficiently on a computer than could be done with ink, paper and scissors. The business exploded. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>All along, I have been writing code and prose with the outliner. These days I use it to narrate my work and to coordinate with the people I work with. It's an amazingly flexible swiss-army-knife-like super-adaptable tool. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've been doing a lot more with outliners in the last few months, in a project I've been working on with a new programming partner, Kyle Shank, at a new company we founded late last year, &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&lt;/a>. It has both a server side and a client side. Next week we will show the first bits of the client software. I think it will surprise people what it can do and how it does it. But this wouldn't be a good tease if I told you more about what it is. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the meantime, if you have stories to tell about how you love outlining, please consider posting them. I love outliners, but I love outliner &lt;i>users&lt;/i> even more. They're such bright people and so incredibly powerful and creative. Software that enables powerful people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much more to say and I hope to say it all.&lt;/p>
