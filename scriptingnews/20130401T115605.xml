			<description>&lt;p>It's been 10 years since the Berkman-Thursday group started, and with it, blogging at Harvard. It all happened at the same time Facebook was booting up on campus. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was an &lt;a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/bloggroup/about/">informal group&lt;/a> that met at &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/">Berkman Center&lt;/a> every Thursday evening. Our goal was to boot up a blogging community at the university and in the surrounding community. It was the first university at the time to offer blogging. We needed a way to create a pulse, a weekly event that was open to anyone where you could learn about blogging, and we could learn from each other. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It evolved in a number of directions. New software came out of the group. We planned and succesfully ran the first blogging conferences in the US. We taught a lot of people how to blog. And the sessions themselves were a lot like blog posts. Someone comes in with an idea, talks about it, we ask questions and discuss it. We discussed the things we were writing on our blogs. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The group continued running as a weekly seminar series until a couple of years ago. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we're approaching the 10th anniversary and some of the members have expressed an interest in a reunion. I've asked for space at Berkman, and they got pretty excited about the idea, so we're having a &lt;i>Old Timers Day&lt;/i> meetup on April 25 at Berkman Center at 7PM, &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=23+Everett+St,+Cambridge,+MA&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=40.697488,-73.979681&amp;sspn=1.086989,1.274414&amp;oq=23+everett+St,+cam&amp;hnear=23+Everett+St,+Cambridge,+Middlesex,+Massachusetts+02138&amp;t=m&amp;z=17">23 Everett Street&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We'll talk about what we've been doing, what we learned, how life evolved in the last ten years, what we got right and what we got wrong, and what role the Thursday evening meetings played for us. I will also show off the software I've been developing, Little Outliner and other goodies. Some of them will already be shipping by the end of April. ;-) &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There should be room for 25-30 people. I've set up an Eventbrite page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://berkmanthursday2013.eventbrite.com/">http://berkmanthursday2013.eventbrite.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope to see you in Cambridge on April 25. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Here's the archive of Scripting News for &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2003/03.html">March 2003&lt;/a>. You'll see a lot of the developments at Berkman recorded there. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>It was a Fred Wilson thing. Fred Wilson is to developers what &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/04/nyregion/spike-lee-to-stick-with-his-knicks.html?pagewanted=all">Spike Lee&lt;/a> is to the Knicks. The guy who shows up at every game and roots the team on, through thick and thin, no matter if they start a Brooklyn team (Lee is also a cultural icon of Brooklyn). He loves the orange and blue uniforms of the Knicks and Madison Square Garden. Only in this sport, the fan is confused for the great player by the opinion leaders and gatekeepers. As if all there were to being a champion is having a lot of money (you might argue the opposite is true, the most interesting players are the ones who don't have any money, but hunger for recognition).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Board of Ed liked the idea so much they stole it and usurped it, and now instead of creating great young talent to flow into Fred's NY startups, they'll create Certified Cisco maintenence guys. Or people who can keep Windows networks running as long as Microsoft is making them. Or Oracle databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fight is a familiar one. Should we create hackers for Wall Street or for the nascent high tech startup industry that's trying to get a foothold in NYC. Fred of course wants the flow for Foursquare and Stack Exchange and Etsy etc. And Bloomberg wants them for Chase, Citibank and the Department of Sanitation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a third possibility. Tell the captains of finance to back off, and let's create some developers who are capable of taking us in new directions. Not into Wilson's companies or Bloomberg's. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not much chance of that of course. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we'll still have Spike Lee coaching the team. Let's keep everything on a steady predictable course. As long as it makes me richer. (Paraphrasing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New York has always been run for the benefit of the already-rich at the expense of the gifted artist. Maybe it's not true in every art, but it totally so in the art of creating great world-changing software. In a few years when these kids are ready to work there will be a new league, and no one is prepared today to teach them the skills they will need for that. So it doesn't matter much who controls the curriculum. The really smart ones will figure it out. And they will surprise us and teach us a lot. (And if there's any sanity we will get to teach them a thing or two as well.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: I went to Bronx Science, which is an elite public school, like Stuyvesant. Neither they nor I discovered, while I was a student there, that I had a talent for tech, and my media hacking was seen as a social behavior problem. So I don't have a lot of faith in the idea of elite NYC high schools. However, the students taught each other a lot, and we created our own fun. Which is kind of what I'm getting at in this piece. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PPS: In addition to teaching kids how to be great commercial developers, I'd teach them how to create open systems without lock-in. That's the equivalent of the scientific method for software design. Schools have an obligation to teach the idealism of art, not only the craft. &lt;/p>

There are lots of companies doing this, so there are lots of teams. I'm on the team that puts all the content on the web. That means that every bit can have an address. That means it can all be plugged into other applications. So our work multiplies. The value of ideas deposited on the web is much greater than ideas that are trapped in a silo. There are lots of people, companies, universities, libraries, open source projects and governments in "web team" space. It may seem naive for any single company to throw its lot in with us, but when you see the full picture, you see it's actually the other way around. What we create together can be much much bigger than anything a single company can do. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&lt;/a> is on the web team too. ;-)&lt;/p>

There are lots of companies doing this, so there are lots of teams. I'm on the team that puts all the content on the web. That means that every bit can have an address. That means it can all be plugged into other applications. So our work multiplies. The value of ideas deposited on the web is much greater than ideas that are trapped in a silo. There are lots of people, companies, universities, libraries, open source projects and governments in &amp;quot;web team&amp;quot; space. It may seem naive for any single company to throw its lot in with us, but when you see the full picture, you see it's actually the other way around. What we create together can be much much bigger than anything a single company can do. ">&lt;/outline>

			<description>&lt;p>First, I really appreciate &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/28/watch-out-internet-dave-winer-is-back-in-the-business-of-making-blogging-tools/">Mathew Ingram's writeup&lt;/a> in Gigaom about what we're doing at &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/">Small Picture&lt;/a>. If you haven't read it, and you're a regular here, go read it now. Lots of good stuff. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However.. (you knew that was coming)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are not making blogging tools. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are making software for creative people -- writers, designers and programmers. Inevitably that means it will connect to blogging systems, because blogs are fixtures in the world of 2013 and beyond. And it's certainly possible that one can create a blogging system using our backend (not released yet). But our business is not what his headline says it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mathew is totally entitled to his interpretation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course I'm entitled to comment on his interpretation. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why this is important?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Our product should not be evalutated based on its capability as a blogging tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. We see blogging products as complementary to ours, not competitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. I even made a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/349109119cee">proposition&lt;/a> to vendors of blogging tools, and the offer is still open (and I will make it again, in new contexts as the software develops).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to make great editing tools, for writers, designers and programmers. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's our mantra, at least one of them. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally thanks to Mathew for such a thoughtful and otherwise accurate piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: I can totally see why it's confusing, esp based on some of the things I've said. I will try to be more careful about that! :-)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>As developers rush to fill the Google Reader hole, it seems everyone is trying to reproduce Google Reader, almost verbatim. It's understandable. There are a huge number of fans of Google Reader who will be without  Google Reader as of July 1. So when they tell you what they want, it's no surprise that what they come up with is basically, Google Reader.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think/hope they will be well-served. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there's an opportunity to do something different that might be equally interesting. Without asking users what they want, create a product based on a different hypothesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>A famous platform vendor once &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/2001/01/03.html#aStory">asked&lt;/a> me if the users were asking for ThinkTank, my first product, before I created it. He had a point. There were no users before there was a product. So they couldn't ask. Because they didn't exist.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The hypothesis: What if Twitter were, in every way, open. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/28/rssTShirt.gif" width="150" height="150" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named rssTShirt.gif">What would that look like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. First, it would look like Twitter. There would be a box at the top of the page that asks What's Happening, and below that a sequence of new items from people you follow, in reverse-chronologic order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. It would be easy to follow someone. When you're looking at their profile page, there would be a big easy to see button that says Follow. It would not say Follow in Product X or Follow in Product Y, etc. It would not open up a huge dialog with a list of products you could follow it in. It would say Follow. And when you click it you Follow that person. No questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. It's a web app. No synchronization among different clients. Supply an API if you like. But like Twitter it's always reverse-chronologic, and it doesn't remember what you haven't read. Yes, some users won't like that. They will use the other kind of RSS app, the ones that synch between clients. (See the first paragraph of this piece.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. No lock-in. That's where it gets tricky. But it's a different kind of tricky than the people cloning Google Reader will encounter. Over there, you have to synchronize news items among lots of possible clients. Here you have to let the user tell you where she stores her subscriptions (and that will determine who gets the message when the user clicks on the Follow button). Beyond that, every developer could experiment with different scanning possibilities, and different presentations, and different whatevers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my dream system. I would happily make components for it. I'm just one user, for sure, and you might have to think a bit more to do this one vs the straight Google Reader clone. But there's also more opportunity to innovate. And it won't just be a repeat of the last 8 years.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>We just did a great rollout, the &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&lt;/a> is fantastic. This is going to move tech in a new direction. It'll create new standards. I'm absolutely sure of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, even with my track record as one who leads change in technology, the release of this software has gotten almost no note from leading tech bloggers and reporters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's okay, because it'll happen without them. Last time I pushed something through, it didn't get support from the press either. And the time before that. We &lt;i>can&lt;/i> make it happen without their help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they're comfortable with big software ideas coming from big companies. But I can't make change happen within the context of a big corporation. Too much second-guessing, too many strategy taxes, too many phony business models. So I choose to do it as an independent. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/bike.gif" width="145" height="88" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named bike.gif">I think software is like other creative arts -- music, architecture, cooking, even design of everyday things like bikes and clothes. It takes a relentless focus on the act of using, and what kind of effect you want to create. Learning from others, and stealing from the best. Only. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can do it on our own but it would be &lt;i>easier&lt;/i> if we got help from influencers and gatekeepers. So if you like anything that I helped bring about, blogging, RSS and podcasting and a few other things, please have a look at &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner&lt;/a>. It's a little product, yes -- but one with very big ambitions. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are early days, the &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">product&lt;/a> is very simple, and well-&lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">documented&lt;/a>. We went to great lengths to &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/littleOutlinerPressGuide.html">make&lt;/a> it &lt;a href="http://littleoutliner.com/demo.html">easy&lt;/a> to understand. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Helping users understand new relevant technology &lt;i>is&lt;/i> what you do, after all. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: I did not include comments on this post because this is the kind of thing that attracts a lot of trolls. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PPS: To users, this is why you haven't heard much about Little Outliner in the tech press. There's nothing wrong with the product. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>On our Q&amp;A &lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/questions.html">page&lt;/a>, he asked how do you select-all in an outline. He was disappointed that when you press Cmd-A it only selects the siblings at the same level as the bar cursor headline. He felt it should select all the text in the outline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &lt;i>scoped.&lt;/i> When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it. So if you want to select everything in an outline, move the cursor to one of the summits, and do the select-all there. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is fundamentally different from the way a word processor or spreadsheet works, but it's exactly the way the Finder or Windows Explorer works, which are also scoped. When you select-all in a folder, it doesn't select all the files on your computer -- it just selects the files in the folder you're working in. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why does it work this way? Well, an outline can logically contain many documents, not just one. For example, I'm writing this blog post in an outline that contains all my posts dating back to March of last year. If I did a &lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllInBlogPost.gif">select-all here&lt;/a>, I'd want it to select all the text in this post, not all the text in all posts. However if I wanted to select everything, I could do that, by putting the cursor on the top level headline, as illustrated in this &lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllTop.gif">screen shot&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:25:47 GMT" pgfnum="21474" text="&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/tales.gif&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;165&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;218&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;A picture named tales.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;I'm sure Bob Stepno won't mind if I use his &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://smallpicture.com/questions.html#comment-843254327&amp;quot;&amp;gt;question/suggestion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as an example of how outliners are different from most other programs. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:45:45 GMT" pgfnum="21478" text="On our Q&amp;amp;A &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://smallpicture.com/questions.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;page&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, he asked how do you select-all in an outline. He was disappointed that when you press Cmd-A it only selects the siblings at the same level as the bar cursor headline. He felt it should select all the text in the outline.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:27:19 GMT" pgfnum="21475" text="My answer was that like almost every operation in an outliner, select-all is &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;scoped.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; When you select a headline, you are implicitly selecting all the headlines that are subordinate to it. So if you want to select everything in an outline, move the cursor to one of the summits, and do the select-all there. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:28:34 GMT" pgfnum="21476" text="This is fundamentally different from the way a word processor or spreadsheet works, but it's exactly the way the Finder or Windows Explorer works, which are also scoped. When you select-all in a folder, it doesn't select all the files on your computer -- it just selects the files in the folder you're working in. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 13:29:46 GMT" pgfnum="21477" text="Why does it work this way? Well, an outline can logically contain many documents, not just one. For example, I'm writing this blog post in an outline that contains all my posts dating back to March of last year. If I did a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllInBlogPost.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;select-all here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, I'd want it to select all the text in this post, not all the text in all posts. However if I wanted to select everything, I could do that, by putting the cursor on the top level headline, as illustrated in this &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/27/selectAllTop.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;screen shot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.">&lt;/outline>

For many, apparently this is the first time they have encoutered this HTML 5 feature. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked for a user-oriented FAQ on local storage but all I found were descriptions of the feature for developers. And for developers, there really isn't that much to know. I've put the details under this headline, you can expand it if you care.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>There's a new browser object called localStorage. It behaves like any other JavaScript object except it persists. That means the next time the user comes back to your site, the storage will still be there, exactly as it was last time they visited.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>In most browsers the object is attached to a single domain, so joe.userland.com and mary.userland.com will have different localStorage objects. Apparently Firefox is different, in that joe and mary share a localStorage object. There are reasons to do it either way. It would be nice if they all did it the &lt;i>same&lt;/i> way. ;-)&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So here are some answers to frequently asked question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Where is local storage stored? It varies from browser to browser. Some users have explored in the system settings folders on various operating systems and found the files. They look like they're SQL databases. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. How much space does it use? The per-domain limit is 5MB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. When you clear the cache does local storage get cleared too? I don't know. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. Isn't local storage like cookies? Yes, it's very much like cookies, except cookies are limited to 4K, and local storage can go up to 5MB. The difference in size reflects the difference in times. When cookies were invented, in the mid-90s, computers had a lot less memory. Today it's not uncommon for a new computer to have a terabyte of disk space. 5MB today is like what 4K was back then. It seems silly to live in a world limited by the machines of the past. But cookies couldn't change without risking breakage, of the web itself. So local storage was a good answer. Also local storage is simpler to program than cookies, but not so much simpler as to make a huge difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5. Isn't this a potentially dangerous feature? We are very responsible about our software, we just want people to make outlines and be happy and want to use the new stuff we come out with. This is a business for us. So we would never use it in a harmful way. Not only would it be against our interest, but it would be professionally unthinkable. That said, localStorage &lt;i>is&lt;/i> a potentially dangerous feature, in the hands of a malicious website. This is something the browser vendors will probably have to address sooner or later. Probably sooner. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6. How can I get rid of what you stored on my computer? I can only answer for our product. If you delete all the text in your outline, that will get rid of most of what we store. There will still be an empty outline in local storage, and a count of the number of times you saved. That takes up about 140 characters, or coincidentally, the size of a tweet. If even this is too much to bear, we can add a way for you to delete that too. (I imagine someone will say that it is, so I'm already preparing to write the code.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have other questions, ask them below and we'll try to answer them, the best we can.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Because this web app uses no server resources. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's the magic of HTML 5 &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/usersGuideToLocalStorage">local storage&lt;/a>, and static pages on S3. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the W3C and to Werner Vogels (for persisting in getting the ability to access the root of a domain from an S3 bucket). As a result, we get unlimited scaling with zero investment. Consider this an endorsement for both innovations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, that said, in future incarnations, we will have a server component, and scaling &lt;i>will&lt;/i> be an issue. But for right now we can bask in the glory. ;-)&lt;/p>

			<title>Small Picture: Little Outliner press guide.</title>
			</item>
		<item>
			<description>&lt;p>On Monday of this week, somewhat quietly, we released the docs for the &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/doYouLoveOutliners">outliner&lt;/a> we've been developing at Small Picture, Inc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html">http://smallpicture.com/outlinerHowto.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The docs are interesting, if you like outliners -- but also interesting because they illustrate something important about the outliner. It's very easy to include in a web page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's a practice outliner right there on the docs page. Kind of subtle. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's written in JavaScript. Yet it's indistinguishable from the outliners we've been using, for many years, running native on Windows and Mac. This outliner runs in any HTML-5 compatible browser, on any OS. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>You install the software by reloading the page. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next Monday we'll show the next bit in our queue. And the Monday after that, the next one, etc. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our cup runneth over! (Finally.)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>Google's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_be_evil">motto&lt;/a> is "Don't be evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paraphrasing HL Mencken's &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/532804-when-somebody-says-it-s-not-about-the-money-it-s-about">motto&lt;/a> -- "When somebody says 'don't be evil'-- they're being evil."&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>The literal quote: "When somebody says it's not about the money, it's about the money."&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, the thing to know about evil is there's good evil and bad evil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike cholesterol, both are bad for you, but good evil is hard to pin on the purveyor. He makes it seem like someone else is the problem. Bad evil is the kind that comes with a bull's eye on your back that says "Hit me -- please." Google does the latter kind.&lt;/p>

I disagree. If you're going to call someone an asshole, it's impolite to address it to them. If you're objectifying them, saying something you wouldn't say to their face -- then don't say it to their face dammit. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know because I'm sometimes on the receiving end of this. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner">@davewiner&lt;/a>, he's such an idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would much prefer if they left the @ off it. Otherwise I have to look at that idiotic thing over and over until it scrolls off. If you think it's going to get a reply, no way. And if you think I give a shit, I don't. It's just annoying to see a bit of stupidity staying there, like a turd in a toilet that someone refuses to flush. So I usually just &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/06/whyYouGotBlocked.html">block&lt;/a> em. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes it &lt;i>makes sense&lt;/i> to say something about someone you wouldn't want them to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example. The other day at lunch I was saying that Carmelo Anthony, the star of the Knicks, is never going to lead the team to a championship. I wouldn't want Anthony, a fine player, and a nice guy, to see that. I doubt if it would motivate him. And sheez it's not his fault he's in the same division as Lebron James (or for that matter occupying the same NBA as Lebron James). Even Kevin Durant, who is a great leader and player, and totally capable of being a champion, probably can't overcome the audacity and tenacity of the Miami Heat. At least not for the next few years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I vote for leaving off the at-sign if you're saying trash about a celeb. &lt;/p>

My panelists didn't buy it. So we wandered in an unsatisfying way (to me at least) around various ideas of what media is about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the speakers was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Denton">Nick Denton&lt;/a>, founder, publisher and ego of Gawker. Nick says that media is about gate-keeping. Your power and value is in what you let through and what you don't. He said that at the beginning of the blogging era, I had that power (me, as in Dave). He recounted a visit he and his partner made to Palo Alto, probably around 2001 or 2002 or so. They were running a startup called Moreover, and according to Nick, they wanted me to write about it on Scripting News. I didn't know. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I sure didn't want to be a gatekeeper! To me it's a silly idea, and antithetical to what blogging is about. I want you to say what you have to say and if I'm interested or &lt;i>when&lt;/i> I'm interested, I'll read it -- and not because I have to or because there's nothing else to read. We were going from the time of scarcity to overload, and that's what I wanted. Not gatekeeping. Because look who's doing the gatekeeping, some miserable person who will be dead in at most 70 years and probably a lot sooner. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I once &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1998/05/06/yoQuieroScriptingNews.html">wrote&lt;/a> about how we're all barking, farting Chihuahuas pretending our will means anything. I was thinking about the wonderful character in the Taco Bell commercials. I guess he didn't sell burritos and tacos and challupas or whatever, but I loved the dog, and now that I think of him, I miss him too. I wish they'd bring him back. I'd trade the dog for a million bankruptcy attorney ambulance-chasing mesothelioma profiteers. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>"The universe is so damned big. Billions and billions of galaxies. Every one of them filled with chihuahuas and captains of industry. None of them get out of it alive. What's it all about? Who knows? No one."&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I was thinking of Bill Gates. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8sZ1DWsAHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe>&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nick is now a gatekeeper, I suppose -- and I guess he must have a soft spot for me, because anytime I want publicity from Gawker I seem to be able to get it. I wonder who he's turning down and why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then I think of people I know who really are gatekeepers. And then I think of the great scene in The Godfather where all the bosses get together to tell Don Corleone to share his politicians with them. He says if you let my son come back to America you can have the politicians and judges. Now that I can get behind. An old man, in his final years, wants the comfort of his son, to drink wine with, and to tell stories to. What could be better than that! :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They did something remarkable, Netflix did -- that most companies can't seem to do. They viewed the world through the eyes of their users. And decided simply to give them exactly what they wanted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What we don't know is &lt;a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?articleid=20130319_52_E3_Google20338">why&lt;/a> Google shut it down. But one possible reason is that they are trying to give the news industry what it wants, and in doing so, not only not giving the users what they want, but &lt;i>willfully throwing out the work of the users,&lt;/i> in building their own distribution system for news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As hobbled as Google Reader was, it was largely a creation of its users. They did the programming for themselves. They chose what channels of news they wanted to listen to, assembling a highly customized news flow and sharing their discoveries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I could say one thing to the the execs of the news industry, it would be this. Stop viewing today through the lens of the past. View it from the point of view of the future. Look back to today and imagine how you could get to the future we all know is coming. And when you do that, I think you'll see that it's time for something new and Netflix-like. A news system where the users have even more power to shape the news that they will receive from you. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's long-past time to trust the users and just do what they want you to do. You will probably be surprised at how profitable that turns out to be. Imho of course.&lt;/p>

And when you do that, I think you'll see that it's time for something new and Netflix-like. A news system where the users have even more power to shape the news that they will receive from you.

			<description>&lt;p>Over the weekend Charles Pierce took a &lt;a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/out-on-the-weekend-031513">swipe&lt;/a> at my earlier &lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/march/charlesPierceIsWrongAboutEzraKleinBeingWrong">piece&lt;/a> about sources going direct. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>He has summarized my thoughts: "Journalism is no longer an actual profession because everyone can do it because BLOGS!, that's why. Well, fine, that's an argument. But it's not a good one."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nor does it in any way resemble what I said. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>Or anything I have &lt;i>ever&lt;/i> said or thought or even dreamed.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>And btw, how insulting to be called that superficial and that stupid.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>This is what I mean about reporters not listening to people outside their own profession.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>To Klein, he was condescending, but respectful, at least superficially. He didn't read Klein's piece either, or if he did, none of the meaning was reflected in his critique. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>My piece? Clearly he didn't even read it. And he didn't care how stupid it made &lt;i>him&lt;/i> look, to be so dismissive and condescending without even bothering to find out what it was he was dismissing.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Regardless, he's an entertaining and often insightful writer. But I'll always remember when reading him that I've seen some pretty sloppy thinking on his part, and it'll make me question the other stuff he says.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To Mr Pierce: I love reading your stuff, and if your getting paid is what it takes for you to continue, I hope you continue to get paid for a long time to come. I hope that puts to rest any thought that I begrudge you your salary. :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why do I watch the Knicks? Certainly not because I hope they'll win. I'm just interested. Maybe I feel the same way about Medium. I'm invested in the Evan Williams story, having watched from almost the beginning, way before most other people in tech thought he was interesting. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>I'm more casual a writer. I think of blogging as a written form of fresco. Made of plaster with a little coloring. It hardens fast, and you move on to something else. I used to say "we're just folks here." That's the kind of writing I aspire to. &lt;/p>

This is the discussion so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Max wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>RSS has a decentralized pub/sub model; the format has been open and stable for a long time; the addressing scheme has no reliance on a specific client. How does the death of one, particularly good even, client, carry with it a threat to the whole ecosystem?&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I responded:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They weren't just "one client" -- they dominated, in the way that MSIE dominated the browser space. And they did what MSIE did, once they gained dominance they froze development (that might have happened through competition) and stopped moving. Everything that was broken in GR became a feature of RSS. And all the things that should have happened, to mature the market, couldn't happen.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Now maybe that's about to change for the better. I hope so. But I'm not encouraged. This is a market where, in order for it to flourish, there HAS to be cooperation among vendors. That's what Twitter proved. Because they control the whole user experience they were able to solve problems that the RSS market couldn't. First, because the vendors wouldn't cooperate, and then because Google took the whole market. So we are now locked into a single vendor -- Twitter.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>So the way it looks to me is that there are three possible outcomes:&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1. GR's demise is also the end of RSS (which seems to me is Google's desired outcome, based on other things they did).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>2. A market develops, but we're unable to get the new features into it that simplify the subscription process, so it has a chance re Twitter. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3. A new dominant reader comes about, and if they're good then maybe something good happens.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I don't think there's the slightest possibility of #3. People in tech are just too insular, they don't study prior art, or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are, much less what the potential solutions are. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I think more likely is a mix between #1 and #2. A continued decline for RSS as an activity and more and more reliance on big companies that don't give a fuck.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
