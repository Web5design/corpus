			<description>&lt;p>A friend sent an email last week when I wrote yet another piece about Medium that I seem obsessed with it. Not really. I watch it. Not sure why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do I watch the Knicks? Certainly not because I hope they'll win. I'm just interested. Maybe I feel the same way about Medium. I'm invested in the Evan Williams story, having watched from almost the beginning, way before most other people in tech thought he was interesting. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember once watching him talk on stage at a conference in Copenhagen of all places. I had this instant visceral thought that he might be the Rupert Murdoch of this medium we were creating. I knew I wasn't that. I'm more of a creative guy, I eschew empire building. (But I do like an interesting word or phrase!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I was just reading this &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/03/mitt-romneys-last-hurrah.html">piece&lt;/a> in the New Yorker. It's short and to the point, and asks an interesting question. Why doesn't Mitt Romney finally let his hair down a little. It's of course well-written, it's in the New Yorker after all. I thought to myself -- "I bet this is the kind of writing they're looking for at Medium."&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm more casual a writer. I think of blogging as a written form of fresco. Made of plaster with a little coloring. It hardens fast, and you move on to something else. I used to say "we're just folks here." That's the kind of writing I aspire to. &lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bilb02/status/312336563533127681">A discussion began&lt;/a> on Twitter about Google Reader between myself and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin">Max Levchin&lt;/a>, and at my request moved over to email. This is the discussion so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Max wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>RSS has a decentralized pub/sub model; the format has been open and stable for a long time; the addressing scheme has no reliance on a specific client. How does the death of one, particularly good even, client, carry with it a threat to the whole ecosystem?&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I responded:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They weren't just "one client" -- they dominated, in the way that MSIE dominated the browser space. And they did what MSIE did, once they gained dominance they froze development (that might have happened through competition) and stopped moving. Everything that was broken in GR became a feature of RSS. And all the things that should have happened, to mature the market, couldn't happen.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Now maybe that's about to change for the better. I hope so. But I'm not encouraged. This is a market where, in order for it to flourish, there HAS to be cooperation among vendors. That's what Twitter proved. Because they control the whole user experience they were able to solve problems that the RSS market couldn't. First, because the vendors wouldn't cooperate, and then because Google took the whole market. So we are now locked into a single vendor -- Twitter.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>So the way it looks to me is that there are three possible outcomes:&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>1. GR's demise is also the end of RSS (which seems to me is Google's desired outcome, based on other things they did).&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>2. A market develops, but we're unable to get the new features into it that simplify the subscription process, so it has a chance re Twitter. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>3. A new dominant reader comes about, and if they're good then maybe something good happens.&lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I don't think there's the slightest possibility of #3. People in tech are just too insular, they don't study prior art, or even study their competition enough to know where the problems are, much less what the potential solutions are. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I think more likely is a mix between #1 and #2. A continued decline for RSS as an activity and more and more reliance on big companies that don't give a fuck.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>

			<description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/312662420424372224">I tweeted&lt;/a> that you couldn't do this, and got replies from a dozen or more people with ways to do it. And I'm happy to report at least one of them works. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. Use the email address that Amazon provides for your Kindle. It's on the Amazon site, poke around, you'll find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. The Kindle app shows up under Apps in iTunes. You can drag .mobi files into its Documents directory and they show up in the Kindle app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. You can use Dropbox. It will report it can't open the files but if you look in the upper right corner of the screen there's a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phil_b/status/312666111059578880/photo/1">way&lt;/a> to send them to a bunch of apps, for .mobi files this includes the Kindle app. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There may be other methods, if you know of them, please add a comment below.&lt;/p>

That was after an awkward period, when Google Reader started up, that it couldn't do a good job of reading &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/rss.xml">Scripting News's feed&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about that for a minute. Scripting News was the &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML.html">first feed&lt;/a>. The specs were all written in such a way that Scripting News worked. It would be impossible, unthinkable that somehow the first feed could not be read by a reader from Google. But that's the way it worked. From day one, Google came in with the attitude of The Boss Man. We run this show. I always thought well fuck that shit. What's the point of creating something new if a big asshole company can come along and break you. On day one. Not even a Hello World from a Humble Newbie. Nahh. We're Google. You're nothin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually I caved, and got rid of the features that Google couldn't handle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here's the good thing -- I can put things into my feeds that Google Reader doesn't like. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not that I haven't already been doing that for a couple of years. ;-)&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>It's always controversial to say that big tech companies make money by controlling the flows to and from users and charging others for access. But that is at least one of the businesses Silicon Valley is in. And it's definitely the business &lt;i>Google&lt;/i> is in, so if you want to understand why they might do something to restrict or try to control the flow of RSS, that's probably part of the story, at least. (I'm bending over backwards to be conservative here.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing to fear is that Google intends to control the news people can subscribe to, the same way Apple controls what apps you can buy for the iPad. And the way Twitter decides what clients can have access to our tweets.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>They've got a pretty nice interface for it, btw -- the magical Google Now. It knows what information you're likely to want to see, and shows it to you. It's really good. &lt;/li>
	&lt;ul>
		&lt;li>An example of how good/creepy it is. My friend Jen was coming to visit from SLC. Google Now told me her plane was 24 minutes from arriving at the gate at JFK. I had never told them what flight she was on. &lt;i>I didn't know what flight she was on.&lt;/i> But they did. Probably because she uses Gmail or their calendar, and somehow connected me to that trip (or did they just guess!) and thought I might be impressed if they told me about her flight. I was!&lt;/li>
		&lt;/ul>
	&lt;li>But it's creepy, in two ways. One way most people see (it's snooping on what you do to figure out what you want to see). The second way: it's also deciding what you &lt;i>don't&lt;/i> see. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>Centralizing this decision-making, for now, is the only way that works. But we're giving something up here. &lt;/li>
	&lt;li>I love that the content of my river is not determined by any tech company. Do I think it will stay that way? It's possible that it might not. Even though I'm not running any Google software to manage it. (I run the aggregator on a Rackspace server, and the content is served from an Amazon S3 bucket.)&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We broke free for a bit there with unrestricted flow from blogs and news orgs via RSS. There are people who would like to put the genie back in the bottle. They're not going to run press releases saying that. This is one of those cases where the reporters have to investigate to get the news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>News people -- if your plan for the future includes free flow of news from journalists to readers, now's the time to take a look. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main thing we &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/18/rebootingRssTwoKeyPoints.html">learned&lt;/a> is that subscription needs to be centralized to make the process as simple as possible for the user. That's one of the main reasons Twitter was such an effective competitor. The central server keeps an OPML file for each user. Each site with a feed links to that site with the URL of its feed as a parameter. When the user clicks a Subscribe link, a dialog appears confirming that you want to subscribe. If you say OK that's it, nothing more to do. The user never sees a URL. No browser has to cooperate (not that they would). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>OPML should be a file type you can subscribe to. That makes it possible for the user to connect their account on the central subscription server to your aggregator. Also, this feature opens the possibility of a sort of super-curator, someone who manages a collections of feeds that people can subscribe to in a unit. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also in the argument betw mailbox and river type readers, why not do both? The same data can be viewed either way. Some times you may just have a few minutes to quickly skim the news, and other times you may be able to read feeds individually at a slower pace. I did something like this in the LBBS software in the early 80s. There was a river, and a hierarchic view. You could switch instantly between the two views, and stay on the same item. The same approach would work well for RSS (though I've never seen it done, if I were doing a new reader, I'd definitely give it a try).&lt;/p>

That would make it possible to do more things with RSS. I don't want to subscribe to a special feed about a specific event, knowing I'll have to remember to unsub. Better to let the feed tell the reader. This feature is documented in my &lt;a href="http://microblog.reallysimple.org/">microblog namespace&lt;/a> and it's supported in my &lt;a href="http://docs.reallysimple.org/">Radio2&lt;/a> linkblogging tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of other ideas like this. I'll write them up as I remember them. &lt;/p>

It has both a server side and a client side. Next week we will show the first bits of the client software. I think it will surprise people what it can do and how it does it.

&lt;p>In the meantime, if you have stories to tell about how you love outlining, please consider posting them. I love outliners, but I love outliner &lt;i>users&lt;/i> even more. They're such bright people and so incredibly powerful and creative. Software that enables powerful people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So much more to say and I hope to say it all.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/12/hope.gif" width="150" height="253" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named hope.gif">I'm a big fan of both Pierce and Klein. I love Pierce's irreverent writing style, and his political opinions match up pretty well with mine. I learn stuff by reading his columns in Esquire. Same with Klein. He's intelligent, and asks good questions, and backs up his thinking with information. It's sad that his way of working is so rare among political analysts these days. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But guys like Pierce (who criticizes Klein in his &lt;a href="http://www.readability.com/articles/icoynoiu">recent piece&lt;/a>, more about that in a minute) only read other news people. The chances of either of them reading what I write are pretty close to nil, so the chances of them passing along a good idea that I might have are therefore also nil. This is embarassing, because the epiphany of Klein's that Pierce mocks happens to be one that I have been writing about for almost 20 years, over and over. Think of all the time everyone could have saved if they deigned to pay attention to people who don't do what they do. It's tragic that it took a smart guy like Klein so long to understand such a basic structural truth about how news, his own profession, has been working &lt;i>for the last 15 years.&lt;/i> Gives you some idea about the power of the blinders this community puts on.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">Upton Sinclair&lt;/a>: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, in the past, any idea that didn't penetrate the haze of guys like Klein and Pierce would have very little chance of being heard by people like myself who might be interested. However, because we live in the times of the Internet and what Klein calls The &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/10/revenge-of-the-sources/">Revenge of the Sources&lt;/a>, I can go ahead and be heard without them listening. I call this &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html">Sources Go Direct&lt;/a>, which means the same thing, but in a more positive less journalist-centered view. It's not revenge, it's more pragmatic. The old system didn't work. So we use the new one instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you look at the mechanics of how a news story is created and flows, there are sources, a reporter, an editor or two, a production and design group, a printing press or web site, a delivery system and finally readers. In the past I have been a source, and I still am, because reporters can and sometimes do quote my blog. I wish they would do it more. I am also an avid reader. I am not, and never have been, and don't want to be, a reporter or an editor or any of the other things. I do write publishing systems, and have created some of the software that these guys probably use. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pierce incorrectly thinks that every act of journalism is done by reporters. Look at the list of people in the paragraph above. There are lots of other roles. The sources aren't covering a fatal crash on Sunday night on Route 128 (his example). Instead they're writing, on their blogs, about the things they know about. Perhaps they were involved in the crash. Perhaps they witnessed it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In software, lots of stuff gets created that isn't on the radar of people like Pierce or Klein. They have very limited focus. They look to big rich companies with lots of employees for technology innovation. Makes sense, because they're employees of big rich companies. Of course that's what they understand. But if you look at the history of software (and very few people do) you'll notice that the big ideas almost never come from those places. If you understand the process of software, you'd understand why that's so. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So while I admire both Klein and Pierce for their work as news people, boy would it be great if they looked outside their close-knit little community. Klein is a pioneer in his field for noticing Sources Go Direct first among his peers. But the idea was available to him long ago. And Pierce, a very flexible thinker when it comes to politics, has no flexibility in thinking about media, no ability to see things from other peoples' point of view, as demonstrated by his piece about Klein. And that's so important, and has been important for a very long time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've met Pierce's attitude many times, from all kinds of ink-stained pros, some very accomplished. The arrogance is impressive, but they're still wrong. I don't care how many Pulitzers you have. The news process has been reorganizing for quite some time. You may not choose to see it, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>PS: Do I think either of them will read this piece? Nah. :-)&lt;/p>

			<title>Scripting News: Why Charles Pierce is wrong about Ezra Klein being wrong.</title>

&lt;outline created="Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:50:38 GMT" pgfnum="20218" text="&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/12/hope.gif&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;253&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;A picture named hope.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;I'm a big fan of both Pierce and Klein. I love Pierce's irreverent writing style, and his political opinions match up pretty well with mine. I learn stuff by reading his columns in Esquire. Same with Klein. He's intelligent, and asks good questions, and backs up his thinking with information. It's sad that his way of working is so rare among political analysts these days. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline collapse="true" created="Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:51:29 GMT" pgfnum="20219" text="But guys like Pierce (who criticizes Klein in his &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.readability.com/articles/icoynoiu&amp;quot;&amp;gt;recent piece&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, more about that in a minute) only read other news people. The chances of either of them reading what I write are pretty close to nil, so the chances of them passing along a good idea that I might have are therefore also nil. This is embarassing, because the epiphany of Klein's that Pierce mocks happens to be one that I have been writing about for almost 20 years, over and over. Think of all the time everyone could have saved if they deigned to pay attention to people who don't do what they do. It's tragic that it took a smart guy like Klein so long to understand such a basic structural truth about how news, his own profession, has been working &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;for the last 15 years.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; Gives you some idea about the power of the blinders this community puts on.">

&lt;outline created="Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:53:15 GMT" pgfnum="20220" text="Now, in the past, any idea that didn't penetrate the haze of guys like Klein and Pierce would have very little chance of being heard by people like myself who might be interested. However, because we live in the times of the Internet and what Klein calls The &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/10/revenge-of-the-sources/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Revenge of the Sources&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, I can go ahead and be heard without them listening. I call this &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2009/05/15/sourcesGoDirect.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Sources Go Direct&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which means the same thing, but in a more positive less journalist-centered view. It's not revenge, it's more pragmatic. The old system didn't work. So we use the new one instead.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:55:14 GMT" pgfnum="20221" text="If you look at the mechanics of how a news story is created and flows, there are sources, a reporter, an editor or two, a production and design group, a printing press or web site, a delivery system and finally readers. In the past I have been a source, and I still am, because reporters can and sometimes do quote my blog. I wish they would do it more. I am also an avid reader. I am not, and never have been, and don't want to be, a reporter or an editor or any of the other things. I do write publishing systems, and have created some of the software that these guys probably use. ">&lt;/outline>

			<description>&lt;p>I watched the Evan Williams &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBDPO8b-NUg">interview&lt;/a> with Jason Calacanis at the &lt;a href="http://festival.launch.co/">Launchfest&lt;/a> conference in SF, and that gave me a better idea of what he's thinking about with his new company, Medium. The next day we learned that &lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/07/ex-wired-editor-evan-hansen-lands-at-obvious-corp-will-lead-editorial-for-medium/">Evan Hansen&lt;/a> is now working for Medium. Evan was the longtime editor of wired.com. Highly respected guy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is Medium doing? My guess -- if you were to draw a line and at one end put blogging tools and at the other put BuzzFeed, SB Nation and Huffington, that Medium is on that line, and closer to the right than the left.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/08/diagram.gif" width="500" height="111" border="0" alt="A picture named diagram.gif">&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Medium's strength appears to be the elegance and HTML 5-ness of its editorial tools. It feels nice using their editor. Like the content networks, being able to create content there is invite-only. But I'm assuming at some point it will be open to everyone, the way Tumblr or WordPress are. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>An advantage Medium is likely to have is a connection to Twitter, which doesn't have a blogging system, and has recently had success with Vine. Twitter giving Medium a boost is good business, for the owners of both companies. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm very interested in where all  this is going, keeping an ear out and listening. &lt;/p>

In NYC, you go for two days, and sit and wait for a trial. Then they herd 75 citizens of New York County into a courtroom and winnow us until there are 14 left -- 12 jurors and two alternates, and the rest go back into the pool. If you make it through two days without being selected, you go home and resume your life. Otherwise you're a juror. But the education process begins the minute you sit down in the waiting room. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I made it as far as a courtroom, but I wasn't chosen as one of the initial group of 24 to be interviewed, but I was required to stay, to wait for the selection to be final. I got to relax while watching my fellow citizens go through the process, where each of the sides, prosecution first, then defense, asks questions to see if you'd be a good juror. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was an eye-opener. The judge had explained a few of important points: 1. The defendent, accused of burglary, is innocent until proven guilty. 2. The standard of proof is high. You had to be certain the person had done what he was accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise -- innocent. 3. The burden of proof is on the state. The defendent can remain silent, and you can't use that fact in coming up with a decision. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some jurors didn't seem to understand any of this. They would agree with all ideas when the judge explained it, but when asked a question: "If you think there's a decent chance the person committed the crime, what would your verdict be?" Many of them said  something like this: "Well, it would depend on the evidence." You could see the frustration with the lawyers in the room. It's as if you were teaching someone how to enter a command on a computer. "First you type some characters then you press the Return key." They would say they understand, but still not be able to enter a command. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What would you think if the accused did not speak in his own defense, would that make you think he's guilty? Yes, some said. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end they had to go with jurors who were pretty hazy on the decision-making process, what the rights of the accused are, and how jurors are supposed to think about the crime and the evidence and testimony. I was reminded that it was like this on the jury I served on. Some people just didn't get that there were rules to innocence and guilt. That it isn't like a family, where you live in a fog of who-did-what-to-whom-when, that in the end we will make a decision, and based on that, this person will go free, or go to jail. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jury duty is all about teaching us what it means to be a juror. There's a lot to learn, and the education system or television or our parents, or whatever, didn't do a very good job.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>One of the neatest features in HTML 5 is &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">localStorage&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It lets an app store as much as 5MB of data on the local machine. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to understand how it works so I wrote a demo.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>Last summer I went back to Madison, and part of the trip was a tour of the Computer Science &lt;a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=computer+science+building+madison+wi+dayton&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=computer+science+building+madison+wi+dayton&amp;cid=0,0,416637037957643769&amp;t=m&amp;z=16">building&lt;/a>, where I had been a graduate student many years ago. The building had changed in many ways, and in others, not at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. The outside was exactly the same. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. The mainframes were gone, replaced by labs of personal computers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. The basement was divided up in a totally different way than it was before. The two rooms I spent most of my time in were gone. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. And most important, the most exciting idea -- there's now a computer store in the front of the building. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was excited because I assumed that this meant that computer science students were actually meeting users, and learning how they think. But no, they staff the store with employees, just like any other store. My guide looked at me with what I imagined was puzzlement. Why would they want their students to work with users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Me, I'm always thinking about users, what I can and can't get them to do. What I can get away with, and how can I make them tell other people about my software, and even better, get them to get others to use it. ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are frustrations, both ways. But if you see software development as a performing art, as I do, inevitably you're going to be judged by them. They will determine your success or failure. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And over the years, I've found this is the hardest point to make to the developers I work with.&lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>First, understand that this is a blog post, a highly prejudiced thing, completely determined by one self-important person's experiences. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm a hypocrite too. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I lived through this. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/whiteMacLaptop.gif">&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/smallLaptop.gif" width="145" height="103" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named smallLaptop.gif">&lt;/a>I was a Windows user in 2005, when I had to get a Mac because I was supporting people who used my OPML Editor app on the Mac, as well as Windows. It didn't seem right that I couldn't see what the updates looked like on the Mac, even if it was open source software, and not generating any money for me. So I bought a $1000 white plastic &lt;a href="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/03/04/whiteMacLaptop.gif">laptop&lt;/a> in the Apple &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/retail/yorkdale/">store&lt;/a> in Toronto. It was the first time I had been in an Apple store. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's a long story why I was so uninterested in using Apple products at the time. I had been an early Mac developer, shipping a product in 1984, and continuing to develop through the mid-90s. But when my product, Frontier, became available on Windows in 1998, I switched to Windows. Windows machines performed much better than the Macs of the day, and Apple had a new strategy every four months. I was very happy to get onto the safe ground that Windows offered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back to 2005, the first thing I noticed about the white Mac laptop, that aside from being a really nice computer, there was no malware. In 2005, Windows was a horror. Once a virus got on your machine, that was pretty much it. And Microsoft wasn't doing much to stop the infestation. For a long time they didn't even see it as their problem. In retrospect, it was the computer equivalent of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, that's why when I read &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/03/open_and_shut">Gruber's&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/03/there-was-that-whole-internet-thing-too/">Arrington's&lt;/a> discussion about why the Mac won, I was once again amazed about what a fog we all live in, and how little grasp there is of other people's experiences. I don't doubt that for these guys malware didn't make a big difference. Maybe &lt;i>I&lt;/i> was the outlier, maybe not many other people thought it would be nice to take a vacation from fighting the viruses. And then the vaction became permanent. (As it did for me. I dabbled in PCs after getting the white laptop. But I bought basically every bit of hardware Apple has offered since then. And I made most of my friends do so too.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don't do well at sharing experiences on the net about these subjects. The flamers pretty much control discourse, or have in the past. I think that's one reason our grasp of history is so hazy. A lot like the great movie, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fog-War-Lessons-McNamara/dp/B0001L3LUE">Fog of War&lt;/a>. See it if you want to understand more about the tech industry. &lt;/p>

			<description>&lt;p>I actually &lt;i>do&lt;/i> think people should learn to code, at least a little -- just as you learn a little chemistry, biology and math in school. Learning how to program is imho easier than those things, but then I have a natural ability to program, so what do I know. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I don't like the way people at &lt;a href="http://www.code.org/quotes">code.org&lt;/a> are pitching it. And I don't like &lt;i>who&lt;/i> is doing the pitching, and who isn't. Out of the 83 people they quote, I doubt if many of them have written code recently, and most of them have never done it, and have no idea what they're talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I were encouraging young people to learn to play basketball, at least I would have had the experience of playing a little myself when I was younger, and having watched a lot of it recently. I'm in awe of basketball players. How fast they charge at the basket with such reckless abandon for their own safety. They fall on hard wood at high speeed. That must hurt! But they get right up and play as if nothing happened. But there are plenty of basketball players to talk about basketball. So why aren't there very many programmers who can talk about coding? If I were a young person looking at this, I'd wonder what was up with that. They're telling me what a wonderful career it is. Where are the people who do it, and what do &lt;i>they&lt;/i> have to say?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/27/clyde.gif" width="161" height="258" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;" alt="A picture named clyde.gif">Which brings me to the second problem I have with the way they pitch it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose I said you should learn to play basketball because you can make a lot of money doing it. I wonder how Chris Bosh would feel about that. Or if I said you should learn to create music for the same reason? I bet will.i.am would have a problem with that. You don't learn an art to make money -- you learn it because it's fun and satisfying. Because it's what you were meant to do. You do it because you like it so much that it's what you want to do every day of your life. Because you want to get really good at it. To perfect your art, and achieve a greater goal. Imagine telling young people they should learn to do something because "To compete in a global market, our students need high quality STEM education including computer science skills such as coding." Okay. I'd run away from that as fast as I can. &lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
	&lt;li>I like what Bill Gates said: "Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains." It's very true, and a good argument for students in all disciplines learning at least a little programming.&lt;/li>
	&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These people don't themselves know how to do what they want you to do. So what they say makes no sense. It won't make you rich, but it will make &lt;i>them&lt;/i> rich. And if you do it, they won't listen to you. And even worse, if you do what they want you to do, you'll be tossed out on the street without any way to earn a living when you turn 35 or 40. Even though you're still a perfectly good programmer. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's a shitty system, and it needs to be fixed. And we have to get these spokespeople who don't know anytihng about what we do to stop speaking for us. To get out of the way. What we need to do, as programmers, is start helping young people become really good at what we do, so they can do it even if there are a lot of carpetbaggers trying to redefine it. (What's a carpetbagger? You should study a little history too!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be clear, you should learn to code if:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1. You love writing and debugging and refining and documenting and supporting code. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>2. You love to see the working result of your labors. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>3. It excites you to empower other people (your users and other developers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4. You have modest financial needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>5. Don't mind spending a lot of time working by yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>6. Don't mind being misunderstood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Primarily you should do it because you love it, because it's fun -- because it's wonderful to create machines with your mind. Hugely empowering. Emotionally gratifying. Software is math-in-motion. It's a miracle of the mind. And if you can do it, really well, there's absolutely nothing like it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote a piece about &lt;a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/05/07/Programmers.html#5">programmers&lt;/a> in 1997. "Successful programmers know how to ask questions, and they know how to ask the &lt;i>right&lt;/i> question. You can't go forward until that happens. A programmer is a rigorous scientist determined to coax the truth out of the ones and zeros. There's the beauty." &lt;/p>
&lt;p>BTW, I also think every student should learn to be a journalist and a lawyer and an accountant too. That way you'll be able to blog with authority. And will know when you're getting screwed. And keep your taxes down like rich people do. :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:30:03 GMT" pgfnum="19187" text="I actually &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;do&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; think people should learn to code, at least a little -- just as you learn a little chemistry, biology and math in school. Learning how to program is imho easier than those things, but then I have a natural ability to program, so what do I know. :-)">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:31:25 GMT" pgfnum="19188" text="But I don't like the way people at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.code.org/quotes&amp;quot;&amp;gt;code.org&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; are pitching it. And I don't like &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;who&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is doing the pitching, and who isn't. Out of the 83 people they quote, I doubt if many of them have written code recently, and most of them have never done it, and have no idea what they're talking about.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:32:25 GMT" pgfnum="19190" text="If I were encouraging young people to learn to play basketball, at least I would have had the experience of playing a little myself when I was younger, and having watched a lot of it recently. I'm in awe of basketball players. How fast they charge at the basket with such reckless abandon for their own safety. They fall on hard wood at high speeed. That must hurt! But they get right up and play as if nothing happened. But there are plenty of basketball players to talk about basketball. So why aren't there very many programmers who can talk about coding? If I were a young person looking at this, I'd wonder what was up with that. They're telling me what a wonderful career it is. Where are the people who do it, and what do &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;they&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; have to say?">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:33:43 GMT" pgfnum="19191" text="&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;http://static.scripting.com/larryKing/images/2013/02/27/clyde.gif&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;161&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;258&amp;quot; border=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;A picture named clyde.gif&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Which brings me to the second problem I have with the way they pitch it.">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline collapse="true" created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:33:56 GMT" pgfnum="19192" text="Suppose I said you should learn to play basketball because you can make a lot of money doing it. I wonder how Chris Bosh would feel about that. Or if I said you should learn to create music for the same reason? I bet will.i.am would have a problem with that. You don't learn an art to make money -- you learn it because it's fun and satisfying. Because it's what you were meant to do. You do it because you like it so much that it's what you want to do every day of your life. Because you want to get really good at it. To perfect your art, and achieve a greater goal. Imagine telling young people they should learn to do something because &amp;quot;To compete in a global market, our students need high quality STEM education including computer science skills such as coding.&amp;quot; Okay. I'd run away from that as fast as I can. ">
	&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:11:59 GMT" pgfnum="19207" text="I like what Bill Gates said: &amp;quot;Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.&amp;quot; It's very true, and a good argument for students in all disciplines learning at least a little programming.">&lt;/outline>
	&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:46:08 GMT" pgfnum="19204" text="These people don't themselves know how to do what they want you to do. So what they say makes no sense. It won't make you rich, but it will make &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;them&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; rich. And if you do it, they won't listen to you. And even worse, if you do what they want you to do, you'll be tossed out on the street without any way to earn a living when you turn 35 or 40. Even though you're still a perfectly good programmer. ">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:36:27 GMT" pgfnum="19195" text="It's a shitty system, and it needs to be fixed. And we have to get these spokespeople who don't know anytihng about what we do to stop speaking for us. To get out of the way. What we need to do, as programmers, is start helping young people become really good at what we do, so they can do it even if there are a lot of carpetbaggers trying to redefine it. (What's a carpetbagger? You should study a little history too!)">&lt;/outline>
&lt;outline created="Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:37:04 GMT" pgfnum="19196" text="To be clear, you should learn to code if:">&lt;/outline>

			<description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/february/doYouUseYourOwnProduct#comment-806241319">A comment&lt;/a> from Michael Markman: &lt;i>"I'm an older dog than Dave Winer -- by about a decade. And I've managed to learn this new trick: move one finger, the pointer moves. Use two fingers and the window scrolls."&lt;/i>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Necessary recital: I'm 57 and have been developing software since I was 18. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>He's wrong. I would have been just as upset about the feature-removal at 25 as I am today. It has nothing to do with age. And as a software designer, something that I've been doing for a long time and know quite well, I can tell you why it's bad to remove features. I learned it the hard way, by doing it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I once shipped a product for the Apple II and IBM PC. When we made the Mac version we started a new codebase, largely because of the new way of doing UI. We wanted to ship before we had all the features ported and debugged, so we did. The users saw this as &lt;i>taking features out of the product,&lt;/i> even though technically that isn't what we did. They were angry about the removal. I bet a lot of them were my age at the time (28), that is, younger than Michael and myself. And they were right to be upset. We called both products ThinkTank. They expected when they opened the box (software shipped in boxes back then) they would get the same thing, but translated to the Macintosh. They didn't. So they concluded that we had removed features. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key lesson: Users don't see things from the same perspective as we do. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And users build up processes that designers know nothing about. They work around the limits of our software by using other features to emulate the ones they wish were there. When we play with the mix of features, we break them. Why would you want to do that to someone who was smart enough to buy your product, and might buy an upgrade someday. Don't you want your users to be successful? Isn't that why you're making software. All these are reasons why anyone, not just Apple, should strive for continutity for users. I suppose there are times when you &lt;i>have&lt;/i> to break users. But to break them for aesthetic reasons, when it's totally optional, that's a sign of bad things to come. A company that has decided willfully not to value their users. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm reminded of this many times every day, as I work around the missing scroll-arrows feature. I remember it used to be there. A sin that's hard to forgive. And it's an important one to observe, because more and more the designers at big tech companies are, for some reason impossible for me to understand, sabotaging their own products by removing features that users depend on. It's becoming more commonplace. And it's a trend that will make users seek out stability as a desired feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People do switch for stability, btw. I switched from Windows to Mac, at considerable expense, because at the time Windows was  infected with malware and the platform vendor wasn't fixing the product. I could switch again, if the Mac becomes too unstable and another platform appears to be rocking less. &lt;/p>
