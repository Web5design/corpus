<em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer.">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent an entire morning and early afternoon catching up with my closest friend and confidante, Cindy. Together we serve on the board of our local homeschool cooperative, plan and attend field trips, scrutinize and select curriculum and discuss our daily homeschooling challenges. She is a certified teacher and a phenomenal listener, and I am certifiably annoying, and an avid talker, so we balance beautifully.</p>
<p>Outside of my family, she is probably my biggest fan, but recently confessed she does not actually read my posts, <em>&#8220;But I always look at the pictures&#8221;</em>, she emphatically proclaimed.  I quickly forgave her because I know that by the time I muster the words to post she has heard them at least a half-dozen times, tossed out in far too many theoretical arguments for her to have to read them again.  God bless her because yesterday&#8217;s conversation was no different. </p>
<p>After reading all the <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2013/03/how-do-you-handle-the-inherent-differences-in-the-way-your-children-learn/#comments" title="comments about homeschooling styles" target="_blank">comments</a> about homeschooling styles in <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2013/03/how-do-you-handle-the-inherent-differences-in-the-way-your-children-learn" title="How do you handle the inherent differences in the way your children learn?" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s post</a>, I want to talk about my favorite new brain drain, Unschooling, or rather, how, or if, parents should play a role in shaping what they teach, and their children learn.</p>
<p>I am in the process of working through my own thoughts regarding the whole Structured Homeschooling versus Unschooling conundrum.  I don&#8217;t think it is a black and white issue; it appears that, just as with homeschooling, there are all different shades of grey between the two.  </p>
<p>Here are the questions I&#8217;m knocking around in my head this week.  Feel free to respond to any one of them, or all of them, in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Is structure necessary for the early elementary years?</strong></p>
<p>It was my experience that all three of my children loved having books read to them from an early age.  Jeff and I took turns reading their favorite stories over and over until they could recite them from memory while running their pudgy little fingers under the words across the page.</p>
<p>While I remember pointing out letter names and sounds, the basic 3-letter words seemed to progress naturally; however, when the kids advanced to sight words there was considerably more work involved for all of us.  I made up games and activities to help memorize the words, and soon we began stringing words together in sentences.  At times,  they were frustrated or bored, but then they would have what I call &#8220;break through moments&#8221;, when they would shine with pride at what they just achieved or understood.</p>
<p>The same thing was true with Math.  In the beginning, it was easy to show them that when they had one block, and added one more, then they had two blocks.  As the concepts built on each other, so have the challenges.</p>
<p>While I understand that the philosophy behind Unschooling is to set the stage for natural learning to thrive, I am not certain most kids would decide to memorize sight words in Kindergarten, or later on, to memorize their multiplication tables.  Perhaps Unschooled parents lean on some subjects more than others?  Most Unschooling families I am exposed to do not purchase a set curriculum.  Is the idea to surround one&#8217;s children with more interest led subject matter that points to reading, writing and math?  If there is not a set structure I am curious what learning looks like, and how parents can be certain the foundation is laid.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is testing necessary at any point?</strong>  </p>
<p>Until we joined our local homeschool cooperative, I never formally tested my children or applied grades on anything they learned.  I was fully aware of their level of learning as we worked together.  If I felt a concept was dropped, we reviewed back over it until it was clear.</p>
<p>In the back of my head,  I figured I would be forced to grade once they reached their high school years in order to build an honest transcript, and I left it at that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that is relevant to Unschooling, but it certainly is a radical off-shoot from the Structured Homeschooling approach.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that testing scared me&#8211;I just didn&#8217;t find it necessary.  Some people say that <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2013/03/25/what-test-scores-really-measure/" title="testing is just a means to stroke parent egos" target="_blank">testing is just a means to stroke parent egos,</a> as opposed to accessing true knowledge and understanding.  I schooled my children at home, and there was not a need to compare my children to others.  I simply focused on teaching them, and as they grew in maturity, I showed them how to find the resources they needed to learn on their own.</p>
<p>Now that my older daughter is finishing up her Sophomore year, we have an established transcript with grades.  With all the research about testing, it becomes more and more obvious that test grades are not necessarily the <em>Holy Grail</em> of true understanding or intelligence.  So, why do we test and keep grades?</p>
<p>I keep them out of fear of somehow limiting her potential future.  The world is changing, and Emelie is not at all interested in pursuing academia through a 4-year university, but I still keep those high school grades just in case.  Maybe mine will be the last generation that frets over their children&#8217;s test scores and transcripts.  </p>
<p><strong>3. If parents don&#8217;t set expectations for learning, will kids grow to respect and meet the expectations of others?</strong></p>
<p>Who we become as adults is directly affected by the family culture we grew up in.  I realize that there are exceptions to every rule, but for the most part, there are many things that carry through from one generation to the next.  Though our very nature is ingrained, there are aspects of how we are nurtured in our childhood that play out in how we relate to others in our adult life, specifically others who are in a position of authority over us.</p>
<p>If as parents,  we do not set expectations for learning for our children, and if they get to decide what they want to learn and when they want to learn it, is there a valid argument that says they will have difficulty meeting the expectations of future bosses?</p>
<p>On one hand,  I want to say that the freedom to choose one&#8217;s own learning path is unrelated to whether or not we will be able to submit to another&#8217;s expectations in the future.  Perhaps the single act of a parent respecting a child&#8217;s right to their own learning leaves the child emotionally stable enough not to cultivate a spirit of rebellion that would cause them to rebuff the expectations of a supervisor later on in life.</p>
<p>Then again, if we never require our children to meet any standard that they don&#8217;t set for themselves, will they become overly egocentric, believing the world revolves around them?  Do we inadvertently set them up for failure by freeing them from failure in the early years?</p>
<p>At this point,  it might be readily obvious why Cindy is such a good friend for me.  She lends an ear to all my mind&#8217;s inner ramblings, quietly taking them in and processing them as I toss more and more her way.</p>
<p>I know one thing, if I had been Unschooled, I would need a strong visionary to guide me out of the murky bog because I get fixated with all the details.  I used to believe Unschooling was taking the easy way out &#8211; I was wrong.  It is much easier to follow the old school rules of engagement. We have to ask ourselves whether or not those rules are the most effective approach for today&#8217;s world.</p>
<h6>Now it&#8217;s your turn.  How, or do you, shape what you teach your children?</h6>

<p>So logic would probably tell you not not to make it. </p>
<p>But I think you should go ahead and chance it! It&#8217;s that good. Slightly citrusy, nice and sweet, with a little hint of vanilla lusciousness. So simple to make, and you can use any fruit you want&#8212;melon chunks, orange pieces, apples, pears&#8230;the works. And it&#8217;s perfect not just for Easter brunch, but for baby or wedding showers, special lunches&#8230;or just a weekday that calls for a beautiful bowl of color.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make it, Maynard!</p>
<p>Sorry I called you Maynard again. </p>
<p>Next year I&#8217;ll give it up for Lent. Promise.</p>

After that, put the pan in the fridge to cool the syrup completely (or transfer the syrup into a little pitcher or bowl.) You want the syrup to be cold when you pour it on the fruit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeandgarden/files/2013/03/skinnykick.png"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeandgarden/files/2013/03/skinnykick.png" alt="skinnykick" width="429" height="644" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6816 frame-img width_429" /></a>They&#8217;re <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp?productId=0434_7628_064&amp;catId=cat5710043&amp;bundleCatId=cat5730004" target="_blank">&#8220;Skinny Kick&#8221;</a> jeans from American Eagle, and I love them. They have a nice slim fit without being ridiculously tight and &#8220;skinny jean&#8221; skinny. (I burned out on skinny jeans months and months ago because they made me feel bad about myself. Ha.) These are more of a &#8220;real world&#8221; skinny jean with a little bit of an everyday style. (Please note: The model in this particular photo is probably six sizes smaller than me. But you can get a sense of the style of the jeans. The leg is slightly more flared at the bottom than this pic shows.)</p>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of Skinny Kicks.</p>
<h6>PROS</h6>
<p>* They have a nice stretch/give to them. </p>
<p>* They have a nice slightly flared leg without being crazy-flared or hippie looking. I can wear boots under the legs or I can wear flats. Both work. </p>
<p>* They&#8217;re somewhat slim through the hips and thighs but not tight.</p>
<p>* I love all three washes (the <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp?productId=0434_7629_968&amp;catId=cat5710043" target="_blank">antique</a> is my favorite, and it&#8217;s also the least expensive of the three.)</p>
<h6>CONS</h6>
<p>* They are just a leeeeeetle bit low-waisted. Definitely not in the crazy category of low-waisted&#8212;you know, the category that only .008% of the population can pull off. But if I&#8217;ve chowed down right before I wear them or haven&#8217;t done Pilates for a week, I always wish they had an extra inch or so. Still they&#8217;re not bad&#8212;I wear them all the time. I just have to stand up a little straighter when I wear them to keep the muffin top at bay.</p>
<p>* The dark blue wash (&#8220;Black Rock&#8221;) is so saturated, it does slightly rub off here and there. I only noticed it because when I first got a couple of pairs and wore them, I&#8217;d see a little bit of a dark blue hue to my fingertips. At first I thought I was dying. Then I realized it was the jeans. </p>
<p>Pros and cons weighed and analyzed, my verdict is that I love these jeans. I&#8217;ll keep wearing them for a long time!</p>

<p>Wait. That&#8217;s Christmas. </p>
<p>And Christmas isn&#8217;t coming. At least not for 272 more days. </p>
<p>Okay, now that I&#8217;ve both confused and depressed everyone: Here&#8217;s the recipe for the yummy glazed ham I made on my show last Saturday&#8212;the same ham I&#8217;ll be making this Sunday for Easter brunch. It&#8217;s totally easy, exceedingly delicious, and results in a purty and glossy ham that&#8217;ll make your guests say &#8220;Oooooooh!&#8221; with wide, expectant eyes and, hopefully, hearty appetites because this ham could feed an army.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I made it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591322923/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8591322923_55e699da9a_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Get a big honkin&#8217; bone-in ham. Fully cooked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592423714/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8592423714_6d9f9f9d4d_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Use a really sharp knife to score a diamond pattern all over the surface of the ham: First cut lines in one direction&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323111/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8591323111_545c94c5aa_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then cut in the other direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323233/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8591323233_a563643731_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Grab a handful of cloves and poke them into the center of each diamond&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592424058/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8592424058_76bc7076f6_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And keep going until the whole surface is dotted. I do this for looks more than flavor: I just think it looks lovely and traditional when it&#8217;s all done baking. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323473/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/8591323473_9ab98a4e30_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Cover the ham with foil, then put it into the oven to warm it up. I do 325 for at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours, but I&#8217;d say just look at the instructions on the package and follow those. Some hams say to go 3 to 4 hours, some at a lower temperature. The whole goal here is just to heat the ham slowly&#8230;and it takes awhile to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p><em>Note: On my Food Network episode last weekend, I only glazed it once because I had been at church and didn&#8217;t want to add too much more time before we ate. It was still totally delicious, but glazing the ham 2 or 3 (or 4) times really results in more of a masterpiece in terms of gorgeous surface. </em></p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Preheat the oven to 325 F.</p>
<p>Score the surface of the ham in a diamond pattern about 1/8-inch deep. Place cloves in the middle of each diamond. Place the ham in a large roasting pan with a rack, tent it with foil, and bake for 2 to 2/12 hours---or longer, depending on the package directions. (Some hams may require 3 to 3 1/2 hours at a lower temp; just check the package.)</p>
<p>Heat the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar and soda in a small saucepan until bubbly. Cook until reduced and a bit thicker, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>After about 2 hours of baking time, remove the foil and brush the glaze on the ham in 20 minutes intervals (put the ham back in the oven, uncovered, in between) until it's nice and glossy. Remove from the oven and allow to rest 15-20 minutes before carving.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m going to be happy not to wear a mic for awhile. I&#8217;d like to go to the bathroom without unplugging first.</p>

Typically, episodes take 1 1/2 to 2 days to shoot, but this one was basically shoot-as-it-happens. It was a freezer meal theme: I filled the freezer with lots of yummy food for busy days in my house, which is every day, and man, am I excited to have all this grub. </p>

<p>It was getting a little embarrassing.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is a great freezer casserole. Really great flavor&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;One thing I like to do is store grilled chicken breasts in airtight bags&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is one of my favorite freezer soups. To make it, you&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom. </p>
<p>This is just another behind-the-scenes wrinkle you never think about when you watch cooking shows on TV: Freezer doors hitting the person on the bottom every time they try to talk. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those things no one ever talks about. </p>

He makes my heart leap. I&#8217;ve been making him and his brother come hang out in my dressing room so I can listen to them talk about football and accuse them of eating all my snacks. </p>
<p>Man, can they polish off some snacks. Like, whole packages. Gone. Poof. As if the snacks ever existed.</p>

<p>Really keeps me going. </p>

<p>Have a happy Tuesday, everyone! </p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592431570/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8098/8592431570_e49261a218_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>These are the perfect little side dish for Easter Brunch: Tender-but-crispy potato nests with a luscious baked egg in the middle. They go perfectly with ham for a more substantial brunch, or they&#8217;re great for a casual breakfast with a piece of bacon. Or two. Or three. Or nineteen.</p>
<p>I will say, when I first decided to try these out, I was excited. I&#8217;d seen different iterations of the little cutie-pies and I figured they&#8217;d be a piece of cake to whip up. But in fact, I had to go through quite a bit of trial and error before I cracked the dang code. And by the time I figured it all out, I think I&#8217;d shaved a good seven months off of my life expectancy. </p>
<p>I started off trying frozen hash brown potatoes, which I initially assumed would work fine. But they wound up being way, way too dry: During the initial baking of the nest, they shriveled to almost nothing, and after the egg baked inside the nests, the hash browns turned a very strange consistency&#8212;and there was hardly any potato flavor at all. Super dry, super weird.</p>
<p>Frozen Hash Browns = A no-go for this recipe. Like, totally.</p>
<p>After giving up on the frozen potatoes, I wound up fiddling with fresh potatoes in a couple of different ways: First I tried grating them from a raw state, which didn&#8217;t work at all. Too mushy. Didn&#8217;t crisp up. Produced angst. Made me crazy. </p>
<p>Finally, the best result came from grating almost-fully-baked potatoes: The consistency was perfect and the potato flavor was fabulous. </p>
<p>Then I slept for a month because I was so exhausted. </p>
<p>It would be a long, long time before I&#8217;d be able to trust again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592430280/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8592430280_42e01fe766_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Here&#8217;s how to make them! Start by baking a few potatoes. I scrubbed the potatoes, then baked them until they were not quite tender enough to eat: Soft, but with the tiniest bit of bite left. This will make them easier to grate, and will also allow more room for baking later. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592430392/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8592430392_93a565259a_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>I let them cool almost completely (you could bake the potatoes Saturday night and keep them in the fridge), then peeled them with a paring knife. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591330297/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8591330297_d6d6b62e56_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Grate all the potatoes, using the largest grating size. As you grate them, if you hear just a tiny bit of &#8220;crunch&#8221; signifying that the potato isn&#8217;t fully cooked, that&#8217;s just fine, Maynard. </p>
<p>Sorry I called you Maynard. </p>
<p>Next, season the potatoes generously with salt and pepper: Just toss them around with your hands as you sprinkle. </p>

I still like to have a little softness to the yolks, and mine baked for probably 12 minutes or so. </p>
<p>* Note: Be assured that no matter what, all of your eggs will probably bake a little differently and won&#8217;t all look exactly the same on top. Some whites will look perfect, some might look a little funky. Some whites will cover the yolk, some will gloriously reveal the yolk. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the beauty of these things! They&#8217;re rustic.</p>
<p>Ha. </p>

If you feel like you need a little practice before Sunday, you can pare down the amounts and do a practice run with one potato and two or three eggs. The instructions are the same whether you make a big batch or a small one.</p>
<p>These are totally delicious. My family loves them. My brother-in-law Tim likes to douse them with hot sauce. (I have to admit, I do too.)</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Bake the potatoes until almost tender (potatoes should still have a little bite) 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow to cool, and then peel and grate them. Season well with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>INCREASE OVEN TEMP TO 425 DEGREES.</p>
<p>Spray two muffin pans generously with cooking spray. Scoop 3 to 4 tablespoons of grated potato into each muffin cup. Use your fingers to gently press the sides and bottom in each muffin hole to make a nest (don't press the potatoes firmly against the pan; they should sit lightly in the pan.) Spray again (very lightly!) with cooking spray. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Watch and make sure they do not burn. (If they seem like they're not browning, kick up the temp to 450.) Remove when the nests are golden brown.</p>
<p>Allow the nests to cool. Crack an egg into each one. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake until the whites are set, about 15 minutes. Don't be concerned if some whites bake differently; no two nests will look alike! </p>
<p>Remove from the muffin pan with a spoon or fork and serve.</p>

<em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer.">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>There are only 6 weeks left in our co-op&#8217;s school year, and Kenny has blazed through 19 of the 25 <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2012/08/american-history-middle-school-book-resources-compilation/" title="American History readers" target="_blank">readers</a> purchased or borrowed for his <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2012/11/american-history-up-to-1850-presentations-curriculum/" title="American History to 1850" target="_blank">American History course.</a></p>
<p>Now that he is studying the Westward Movement, he and I both realized we failed to collect a single reader about the Americans who felt it was their &#8220;Manifest Destiny&#8221; to <em>Go West</em>, settling the continent from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>Imagine my excitement at the timing when Chicago Review Press sent a copy of the newest release in their Women of Action series, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Frontier-Trailblazing-Entrepreneurs-Rabble-Rousers/dp/1883052971" title="Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers" target="_blank">Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers</a></em> by Brandon Marie Miller.</p>
<p>March is <a href="http://womenshistorymonth.gov" title="Women's History Month" target="_blank">Women&#8217;s History Month</a>, and I realize that means I’m a little late on the draw as we are steadfastly heading into April.  Still, when I find a good book I like to share it, and this book completely captures the courage of the pioneering women of the mid-1800s.</p>
<p>Kenny couldn’t help but be interested in it after seeing me take it to bed three nights in a row.  The first chapter about how Margret Reed survived starvation near Lake Truckee in the Sierra Nevada sucked him in immediately.  From missionaries and physicians to naturalists and suffragettes, the stories are taken directly from the “ordinary lives of daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers.”</p>
<p>Miller weaves this collection of abridged biographies, period photos, letters home, and even song lyrics so artfully that I finished wanting to know more about each of their personal lives.  Trekking 2,000 miles across a seemingly endless frontier, these 19th century women were hard core, leaving behind friends and family they would likely never see again, for the hope of a better life.</p>
<p>The sufferings endured on the wagon train often did not ease up after arriving at their destination; at that point, the pioneer women learned to meet their challenges, fears and setbacks with perseverance and determination as they worked side-by-side with their husbands to build log cabins or sod houses, work the land, mills, stores, or inns, all while caring for children, pregnancy, and bearing/raising babies.</p>
<p>While some of the women adapted more readily than others, most of their writing reveals their appreciation for the rugged beauty they came to see in the new landscape of their lives.</p>
<p>Targeted for middle school students ages 12 and up, Brandon Marie Miller’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Frontier-Trailblazing-Entrepreneurs-Rabble-Rousers/dp/1883052971" title="Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers" target="_blank">Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers</a></em> is a wonderful supplement to any study of American History and the Westward Movement.</p>
<h6>Are you a fan of stories from this period?  Any Westward Movement reader recommendations for middle school and up?</h6>

<p>Wait. Did you hear that? </p>
<p>Did you hear that noise?</p>
<p>That was my heart going pitter-pat. </p>
<p>Boys wearing bow ties will do that to a mama. </p>
<p>In other news: I just have a day or so of shooting left, which means I&#8217;m about 24 hours away from not showering, not wearing makeup, not drying or styling my hair, and not caring what my fingernails look like. </p>
<p>Get ready, Marlboro Man! You&#8217;re gonna love it. </p>
<p>Or not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>I would like to report, however, that I have been using brown eyeliner instead of black during this shoot. It&#8217;s been hard to step away from the Pat Benetar look, but my soul tells me brown makes more logical sense with my red hair and pigmentless skin. </p>
<p>But <em>man</em>, am I caking on that brown eyeliner. I won&#8217;t go down without a fight! </p>

Bruiser Pookie Sunshine Of My Life loves having the crew here, but he especially loves Matt. Matt has two terriers back in England and he loves on Bruiser every day because he misses his doggies. </p>
<p>Please look at how Bruiser is sitting. </p>
<p>And speaking of Matt: Matt, Luke, and Mike (the camera and lighting guys on the shoot) are friends on Instagram, and they often post photos and comment on one another&#8217;s shots. More than once, I have witnessed some ribbing (read: trash-talking) going on about whose Instagram photos are better. </p>
<p>So I asked each of them to send me one of their favorite Instagram photos of the ranch. Then I asked them if they&#8217;d mind if I posted them here.</p>
<p>Then I asked them if they&#8217;d mind if I turned it into a contest. </p>
<p>They all said fine.</p>
<p>So here they are!</p>

<p>Wait. That’s not anatomically possible. </p>
<p>And anyway, the Easter Bunny is a boy, right? It’s even more impossible than I thought!</p>
<p>Okay, let’s start this whole thing over. Imagine that the Easter Bunny’s wife is a chicken, and imagine her laying an egg. These sweet, crispy eggs with a fun candy surprise inside would be what came out!</p>
<p>Wait. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s possible either.</p>
<p>Sheesh. Leave it to me to take something as innocent as an Easter treat and turn it into something disturbing. Please don’t let me spoil this special time for you. </p>
<p>Haunting visuals aside, these adorable little ovoid (vocabulary word alert!) wonders are nothing more than Rice Kripie Treats that have been thrown into a wacky-looking Easter egg machine and, minutes later, come out the other end looking like Easter eggs. They&#8217;re super easy and fun to make with kids. The perfect Easter treat!</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add marshmallows and stir until melted. Remove from heat, then add rice cereal and stir until well coated.  </p>
<p>Lightly spray interior of the plastic eggs with non-stick cooking spray.  If mixture is too sticky, you can also spray your hands.  Fill both sides of the plastic egg with rice cereal mixture, slightly over-filling one side. Press chocolate egg in the center on one side of the egg, then close the plastic egg to shape it. (It should be full enough to meet with a little resistance as you close it.) Gently release the rice cereal egg from the mold, decorate with your choice of sprinkles and set aside in egg crate until set.</p>

Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7205105164_fb5e74a4bb_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="When have you felt most alive?" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer">Heather Sanders</a></em></p>
<p>We homeschool 30 weeks a year, which means we know when we will begin the school year, and most importantly, when it will end. Our school year ends in exactly 6 weeks. I mentioned that bit of trivia to the kids today and received comments like &#8220;Six weeks! Summer takes forever to get here!&#8221; I have to say I completely agree. Spring Break was not long enough, and Summer feels light years away. Surprisingly, it is this time of year that makes me the strongest advocate for a structured homeschooling approach; without the structure I am not sure I could find the energy to finish.</p>
<p>For the sake of complete transparency, I debate regularly with a softer, counterintuitive voice in my head that says, &#8220;Yes, but if you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling" title="unschooling" target="_blank">unschooled</a>, you and the kids would be more personally invested and intrinsically energized while pursuing knowledge in each of your personal areas of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, my louder voice says, &#8220;Riiiiiiight. If the kids were given the freedom to choose, they would still not know their <a href="http://www.omsh.com/homeschool-math-on-saturday-say-it-aint-so/" title="multiplication" target="_blank">multiplication</a> tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, back and forth this internal conversation plays out until I tire of the confusion and tune out. Am I the only one who deals with this sort of brain babble? It is apparently called &#8220;self talk&#8221; and if handled correctly, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/positive-thinking/SR00009.html" title="self talk can be a healthy habit" target="_blank">self talk can be a healthy habit.</a> My problem? My &#8220;self&#8221; won&#8217;t shut up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to relieve my inner ramblings by taking advantage of Jeff as a sounding board.  He&#8217;s a tremendous listener, but in the end I&#8217;m sure it is nothing short of torture for him.  He diligently asks questions that help focus my attention, I make a decision, and then a few hours later the battle rages in my head again.</p>
<p>That is why I stick with structure; for me, it is comfortable, safe, and sure.  As a person who <a href="https://type-coach.com/esfj" title="thrives on organization and detail" target="_blank">thrives on organization and detail,</a> I cannot imagine a school year that didn&#8217;t file neatly in a physical binder or digital archive, with each piece of paper or information neatly placed behind subject-specific, labeled dividers or within designated directories.</p>
<p>Thing is the kids&#8217; minds don&#8217;t work like mine, which means 1) either my structure is a gift that clears all the unnecessary clutter, ensuring them an unhindered path to their future, or 2) I&#8217;m an old school stumbling block that fails to recognize they need to clear their own path to approach their education in a way that best suits how their minds work.</p>
<p>It seems clear that homeschooling is the best, most natural, way for parents to recognize the inherent differences in how each of their children learn.  What is less clear is what exactly to do with this knowledge.</p>
<p>These are questions I ponder in this last six weeks of my 7th year of homeschooling, and as you can imagine, the battle rages on in my head.  I&#8217;m pretty certain I will need a healthy dose of sleeping in and poolside therapy to reach any logical conclusions.</p>
<h6>Where are you in this dichotomy of homeschooling styles?  What brought you to that place?</h6>

He&#8217;s often up on the counters getting closeups of the food as I cook, and he provides a steady stream of hilarious one-liners and plays on words, which I need to start writing down so that when I want to post about them, my mind won&#8217;t go blank as it is right now. </p>
<p>Matt is also married to Olivia, the director, whom I absolutely love. She is the calm and sweet yin to Matt&#8217;s mischievous and comedic yang, and I love being in the kitchen with the two English pookie lovebirds. </p>
<p>That said, I didn&#8217;t know they were married until the second time they came for a shoot. They keep it under wraps!</p>
<p>Get it? Wraps? </p>
<p>(I think all this TV terminology is getting to me.)</p>
<p>And speaking of wraps, doesn&#8217;t that word alone sum up all that is wrong with the English language?</p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To cover or enclose something. <em>I&#8217;m going to wrap my arms around Marlboro Man&#8217;s chiseled waist when I see him tonight.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To finish filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s it&#8212;time to wrap for the day! Time to go home and watch Real Housewives, Ree.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> The end of filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s a wrap! Time to go home and pick your toenails, Ree. </em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A loose outer garment.<br />
<em>Can I take your wrap to the coat room?</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A veil of secrecy.<br />
<em>Olivia and Matt keep their marriage under wraps while they&#8217;re working.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A sandwich rolled inside a tortilla or flatbread.<br />
<em>Have you tried my chicken marshmallow chili veggie chocolate wrap?</em></p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on <strong>rap</strong>.</p>
<p>Stop the madness!</p>

In the photo above, he&#8217;s showing me a photo of his niece and her baby, whom he clearly adores. He, along with my good friend Tiffany (who&#8217;s nearly seven months pregnant right now, which is making me have all sorts of gestational thoughts) make sure all the food is in place for every recipe I cook on the show. It&#8217;s a huge job and requires a lot of coordination, especially considering we live in the country and can&#8217;t just run out and pick up something we don&#8217;t have. </p>
<p><em>Um&#8230;welcome to my daily life?</em></p>
<p>And David lives in New York City, which makes the contrast all the more stark for him. </p>
<p>David, it turns out, actually loves our small town and appreciates the time he gets to spend here. Last year, probably because he&#8217;s there every single morning of the shoot, David won ten dollars from our local grocery store as part of a fun promotion they were having that involved daily drawings for different cash prizes. Because he won, they took his picture and put it on the wall of winners in the store. </p>
<p>This was a highlight of David&#8217;s experience here. He still talks about it like it was a complete honor. </p>
<p>I love that guy.</p>

The cameras walked all over the building and got to get a lot of &#8220;before&#8221; shots. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797067/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8573797067_b7ddd3aba8_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>There was lots of miscellaneous cooking going on yesterday, including this&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797279/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8573797279_5d95f73aac_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And this. </p>
<p>Oh, dear. </p>
<p>Just you wait, &#8216;enry &#8216;iggins!</p>
<p>Name that movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8574888726/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8523/8574888726_84ee9794b4_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then it was time to make brownies, so the director Olivia and I talked through the recipe beforehand and discussed the best way to proceed. </p>
<p>And this is something you might not know about cooking shows: It would be difficult to show up, tell the cameramen &#8220;I&#8217;m making brownies today, guys. Ready, set, go!&#8221; because they&#8217;d wind up with a lot of missed shots of the food and the process, and the end result wouldn&#8217;t be as visually appealing (or as complete). So we make sure to have the recipe broken up into logical pieces, and then we make sure the cameramen know which direction the ingredients are going to head, then Mike makes sure all the lights will bring out the natural beauty of the food, then I run powder my face for the four thousandth time because it&#8217;s already shiny again. </p>
<p>Then I grab a cracker and a Diet Dr Pepper. </p>
<p>Then I run to the ladies room. But I take my mic off first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573796019/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8573796019_2bb27563c0_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I go around to the other side of the counter and snap a photo. Doesn&#8217;t this kind of look like aliens kidnapped me? </p>
<p><em>Has anyone seen Ree for awhile?&#8230;</em></p>
<p>What you also can&#8217;t see in this photo is the inch-thick layer of powdered sugar on the floor underneath my work station. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s there because&#8212;well, because I&#8217;m messy, but also because when I&#8217;m addressing the camera and cooking or baking something, I can&#8217;t always hunker over and contort my body to get ingredients to go into vessels without also falling all over the floor. Pay attention next time you cook something by yourself: You might find yourself leaning over, wrapping your arm around your mixer so as to get the powdered sugar to drop in without going everywhere, making weird faces as you concentrate on chopping, etc. Now imagine a camera is there, and you need to somewhat clearly narrate every step you&#8217;re doing, and not look like a complete dodo bird while you do it. </p>
<p>Makes you want to stand up a little straighter and remember not to scratch your armpit, I&#8217;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

Thank you, David!</p>
<p>My shoes were starting to make sticky sounds when I walked. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m super neat that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

What David doesn&#8217;t whisk away, Charlie can always count as a mid-afternoon snack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

They&#8217;re a more powerful cleaning tool than any Swifter in the universe. </p>
<p>(Unless you count all the grass they bring in from outside. But that&#8217;s just a technicality.)</p>

<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="OMSH">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last summer a reader here pointed me toward Marie-Claire Camp&#8217;s Kickstarter campaign to develop a set of uniquely designed, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-abc-wallet-cards" title="Children's ABC Wallet Cards" target="_blank">wallet-size ABC cards</a> for children.  Though my own children are beyond the age for these cards, I backed the project anyway.  The project reached its goal with the help of 376 backers and I received the cards just in time to gift them to my cousin&#8217;s children for Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/001-alphabet-wallet-cards-off-the-ring.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/001-alphabet-wallet-cards-off-the-ring.jpg" alt="Alphabet Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12029 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>Vividly illustrated by Australian artist Marc Martin, the <a href="http://youguysaresoawesome.com" title="Children's Alphabet Cards" target="_blank">Children&#8217;s Alphabet cards</a> are as indestructible as they are educational.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/002-r-is-for-robot.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/002-r-is-for-robot.jpg" alt="R is for Robot" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12030 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/003-x-is-for-xray.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/003-x-is-for-xray.jpg" alt="X is for X-ray" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12031 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>It was exciting to watch the original project draw near its funding goal as each new backer placed their pledge.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg" alt="Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12032 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>And though I do not personally know Camp, I felt an attachment to the success of the campaign, which is why I wanted to let you know she has launched a second Kickstarter campaign with the hope of funding the development of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-wallet-cards-color-and-shape-numbers-go" title="Children's Wallet Cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet" target="_blank">four additional decks</a> of children&#8217;s cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &#038; Shape, and <em>My Wallet</em>.</p>
<p>Just as with the original Children&#8217;s ABC Deck, these cards will be extremely durable, <strong>BPA free, recyclable, and designed on FDA-approved, food-grade, non-toxic plastic.</strong> The ink will also be <strong>non-toxic, food-safe ink.</strong>  Each deck will be illustrated by a different artist.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/005-number-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/005-number-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="Number Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12033 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>My personal favorite is the <strong>Numbers</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/eugene-louise#image_354418" title="Eugene &amp; Louise" target="_blank">Eugene &#038; Louise</a>, a Belgium based creative studio founded by husband and wife, Glenn D&#8217;Hondt and Sylvia Meert.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/006-go-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/006-go-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="GO! Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12034 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>GO!</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://heflinreps.com/illustrators/artist/jared-andrew-schorr" title="Jared Andrew Schorr" target="_blank">Jared Andrew Schorr</a>, shows images of people moving in exciting ways, (e.g. skateboarding, hang-gliding, and skiing). </p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/007-color-and-shape-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/007-color-and-shape-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="Color &amp; Shape Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12035 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>London artist <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/nomoco/4582#image_458422" title="Nomoco" target="_blank">Nomoco</a> will create the artwork for the <strong>Color &#038; Shape</strong> cards.  Watercolor and ink illustrations will represent common colors and shapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/008-my-wallet-card-set.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/008-my-wallet-card-set.jpg" alt="My Wallet Card Set" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12036 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>The final <em>My Wallet</em> card set is a wallet that holds a license, a bank card, a children&#8217;s museum membership card and a library card.  Also included is play money printed on durable Tyvek.  A free iOS app, Digital Toys, will pair with each card&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Camp&#8217;s original inspiration came from her boys pulling apart her wallet and scoping out all her cards.  These four cards mimic what can be found in an adult wallet, but are durable and safe for child&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>If you participated in the original campaign, then you know how valuable these cards are for parents of young children.  They are available in 7 retail locations and are now <a href="http://youguysaresoawesome.com" title="Children's ABC Cards" target="_blank">available online</a> as well.  </p>
<p>When Camp raises the money she needs to Kickstart this ambitious campaign, there will be more than <strong>40 additional pieces of amazing original artwork</strong> from three separate artists to secure on the carabiner-style ring that houses the original collection.</p>
