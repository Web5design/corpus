<p><em>By <a href="http://heathersanders.com" title="Heather Sanders">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>This has been my year to yammer on and on about <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/?s=american+revolution&amp;submit=" title="The American Revolution" target="_blank">The American Revolution</a>, and as I know some of your kids have been moving through the same time frame of study, or will be in the years to come, I hope it has been helpful.  </p>
<p>With only weeks until the close of our homeschool year, I have added another item to my growing list of possible American Revolution resources, the <a href="http://safariltd.us/collection/globalsearch?keyword=american+revolutionary+war&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" title="American Revolutionary War Continental and British Army Historical Figurines" target="_blank">Continental and British Army Historical Figurines.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8654656374/" title="American Revolutionary War Historical Figurines, TOOBs by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8126/8654656374_faa80f0d0e_o.jpg" width="420" height="630" alt="American Revolutionary War Historical Figurines, TOOBs" class="width_420 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>Created and distributed by Safari, Ltd., these two figurine sets are packaged separately in a cylindrical plastic &#8220;Toob&#8221;.  While the website describes the &#8220;Toob&#8221; as being reusable and easy for storage and transportation, I have to say that the tubes themselves do not appear as though they would hold up to <a href="ttp://heathersanders.com/2013/04/15/how-boys-play-with-toys/" title="how boys play with toys" target="_blank">how boys play with toys</a>, especially the lid, which already only stays on if re-taped every time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8653554715/" title="American Revolutionary War Historical Figurines, TOOB close-up by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8653554715_a98018a662_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="American Revolutionary War Historical Figurines, TOOB close-up" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m not the least bit concerned about the plastic tube because the miniature plastic soldiers inside the tube are the main attraction.  Each figurine is hand painted (lead free and safety tested) with exceptional attention to detail, including the rich colors, the sculpting, and the historical accuracy of the uniforms.</p>
<p>I can see these figurines held in hand (or used to act out) during parent &#8220;Read Alouds&#8221; of certain American History books.  When he was young, Kenny needed something to occupy his hands while I read in order to maintain focus on the subject matter.  These historical figures would be ideal since they easily could serve to solidify the battles, and establish the differences in the armies, including their uniforms. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8654656730/" title="George Washington by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8103/8654656730_6438505747_o.jpg" width="420" height="630" alt="George Washington" class="width_420 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://safariltd.us/collection/collectionproductlist?collection_id=17&amp;group_id=5&amp;productid=650204" title="Continental Army Historical Figurines" target="_blank">Continental Army Set</a> includes six historical figurines, including George Washington, two musketeers, a flag-bearer, a drummer, and a fifer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8654656518/" title="British Army Figurines by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8654656518_a8cce9a5f7_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="British Army Figurines" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://safariltd.us/collection/collectionproductlist?collection_id=17&amp;group_id=5&amp;productid=650404" title="British Army Historical Figurines" target="_blank">British Army Set</a> also includes six historical figures, with General Cornwallis, two musketeers, a flag-bearer, a bugler, and a fifer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8654656576/" title="Britism Army Bugler by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8254/8654656576_cebac7e921_o.jpg" width="420" height="630" alt="Britism Army Bugler" class="width_420 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>My personal favorite of the British figurines is the bugler.  While Kenny imagined <a href="http://heathersanders.com/2013/04/15/how-boys-play-with-toys/" title="How boys play with toys." target="_blank">a bugler heartily playing into General Cornwallis&#8217; ear</a>, we actually learned that the British Army used trumpets and bugles to relay important commands and maneuvers to troops engaged in battle. Apparently, they were a highly effective way to communicate messages over long distances.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8653555089/" title="Continental Army Fifer by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8653555089_33ebf25f8c_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="Continental Army Fifer" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>As with the bugler, the fifer was used to broadcast the officers&#8217; signals, though more frequently the fifer and drummer were used to relay the daily routine to the soldiers.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8653554987/" title="Continental Army Drummer by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8116/8653554987_b4447d461d_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="Continental Army Drummer" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>Together with the drummer, the fifer also provided a cadence for when the army was on the march.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohmystinkinheck/8654656832/" title="Confederate Musketeer by Heather L. Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8119/8654656832_6c00624b2f_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="Confederate Musketeer" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p>Measuring 2&#8243; tall, these figurines are historically accurate and had we found them earlier this year, Kenny and I both agreed they would have been ideal for creating a diorama.  However, with that in mind, we did get a couple of the <a href="http://safariltd.us/collection/globalsearch?keyword=civil+war&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" title="Civil War Collection Toobs" target="_blank">Civil War Collection Toobs</a> for our History Studies next year.  </p>
<p>These American Revolutionary War Historical Figures are available online at the <a href="http://safariltd.us/collection/globalsearch?keyword=american+revolutionary+war&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" title="American Revolutionary War Continental and British Army Historical Figurines" target="_blank">Safari, Ltd. website</a> as well as other online stores, including Amazon. </p>

<h6>What are some ways you can think of to integrate these historical figurines into a study of American History?</h6>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h134/boomama205/545d8495-9411-4695-a60d-9c106a43ac57_zps3c651f6f.jpg" border="0" alt=" photo 545d8495-9411-4695-a60d-9c106a43ac57_zps3c651f6f.jpg" class="frame-img" /><strong><em>By <a href="http://boomama.net" target="_blank">BooMama</a>.</em> </strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that I’ve mentioned this before, but just in case I haven’t: I’m no stranger to the Bravo. It’s my go-to channel when I’ve had a hard day and want to focus on someone else’s drama (whether said drama is real or made up for the cameras is completely inconsequential to me). And while the Housewives, the Million Dollar Decorators, and Jeff Lewis all hold a special place in my TV heart, there is one particular Bravo-lebrity who is threatening to take over the #1 spot.</p>
<p>Rachel Zoe.</p>
<p>Now as best as I can tell, Rachel Zoe and I don’t have very much in common. I say that because I have never styled a celebrity client, I’ve never been to a professional fashion show, and I’ve never asked a driver to race me through the streets of Los Angeles so that I could attend to a fashion emergency with Anne Hathaway’s Oscar gown.</p>
<p>(I have, however, raced across town to get to Popeye’s Fried Chicken before it closed, but that’s not really the same thing, now is it?)</p>
<p>The fifth season of <i>The Rachel Zoe Project</i> premiered back in January, and since then we’ve have the privilege of witnessing some exciting developments in Rachel’s personal and professional lives. Granted, Rachel lives in a world where the most trivial details become life-altering events (and where the word “literally” is misused once every 6.8 seconds, it seems), but that’s part of her charm. Because while I might see a sequined skirt and say, “Wow – that is a really cute skirt,” Rachel would see a sequined skirt and say, “OHMYGAH. That. skirt. is. <i>everything</i>. I could LITERALLY die.” And then she would hold her hand over her heart, close her eyes, and bask in the skirt’s sequined glow. </p>
<p>So in the Zoe-esque spirit of making a big to-do about all manner of seemingly normal events, here are a few highlights from the first half of this season. </p>
<p>1.	Rachel gets bangs. It is, like, a totally spontaneous decision.</p>
<p>2.	Rachel rides a carousel, LITERALLY ALMOST DIES, then runs through a park in five-inch heels.</p>
<p>3.	Rachel weeps from all the beauty at Paris Fashion Week.</p>
<p>4.	Rachel refers to her little boy Skyler as “Sky Sky” approximately 16 times an episode, and surprisingly, it never fails to be endearing.</p>
<p>5.	Rachel can’t understand the resistance to the maxi-skirt.</p>
<p>6.	Rachel wants to move to New York City so she can wear more coats.</p>
<p>7.	Rachel thinks the Louis Vuitton show was “beyond.” It was also “everything.”</p>
<p>8.	Rachel holds a venti Starbucks like it’s a lifeline.</p>
<p>9.	Rachel sees a picture of herself on the side of a New York City bus and LITERALLY DIES.</p>
<p>10.	Interestingly, Rachel LITERALLY DIES several more times throughout the first several episodes, and yet miraculously, she lives.</p>
<p>Do any of y’all adore <i>The Rachel Zoe Project</i> like I do? Or if you’re not watching Rachel, is there a show that’s fun for you to watch because the lifestyles on the show are worlds removed from your own?</p>
<p>I will LITERALLY sit on pins and needles waiting on your responses.</p>
<p>It may be painful, but you’re worth it.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pioneerwoman-full-rss-feed/~4/2oYCpWSH194" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<p>They got stuck around the time of the Visigoths.</p>

My mom was visiting and was making a batch of her healthy muffins when I said &#8220;Since you&#8217;re making your healthy muffins, I&#8217;m going to make us a salad for lunch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sounds perfect,&#8221; my mom exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to put noodles in it,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Because we&#8217;re worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I got no argument from my mom, so I moved forward with this fun, really tasty salad that I had actually started thinking about during the sermon at church yesterday. It has crunchy lettuce and colorful tomatoes and the carby wonderfulness of pasta&#8230;with a delicious pesto flavor throughout. Not that the sermon had anything to do with lettuce, tomatoes, pasta, or pesto. And I promise I did listen to the message of the sermon. It&#8217;s just that I listened while also fantasizing about what I was going to eat later. </p>
<p>Happens every single Sunday.</p>

I like this stuff because it&#8217;s curly and delicious things get stuck in the crevices.</p>

The pasta will be eaten cold, so you want it to be nice and cooked through&#8230;but not mushy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8650264476/" title="Pesto Pasta Salad by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8401/8650264476_a1ed8bd05f_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Pesto Pasta Salad" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And some sour cream (or you could use greek yogurt.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

You want the dressing to be on the thin side, so splash in enough milk to get it to the consistency you want. It needs to be more of a pasta salad dressing that will pour and easily coat the pasta (rather than be thick and gloopy.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Cook the pasta in salted water according to package instructions. Then drain it and rinse in cold water. Allow pasta to dry slightly, then toss in a bowl with 4 tablespoons pesto. (Add more if you want the pasta to be more coated.) Add Parmesan and toss. Cover and refrigerate pasta until cold.</p>
<p>Make the dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, sour cream, and milk with the rest of the pesto. Add salt and pepper, then taste and adjust seasonings as needed. The dressing needs to be somewhat thin and pourable in order to coat the lettuce and pasta later. Set the dressing aside.</p>
<p>If you're using pine nuts, toast them over medium-low heat in a small skillet until they brown slightly. Set them aside. </p>
<p>To assemble the salads, make a bed of lettuce in a large bowl, then add a generous layer of pesto-coated pasta. Add tomatoes, olives, and chunks of cheese. Spoon a good amount of dressing all over the top; it should be thin enough to seep down into the salad, not so thick it will stay on top of everything.</p>
<p>Sprinkle salads with pine nuts and a little extra Parmesan and serve!</p>

-Roger Ebert</p>
<p>Those twenty-odd words say more about why I love movies, why I think they’re important, than any dozen posts or essays ever could. It’s the kind of straight-to-the-heart human logic Roger Ebert came to be known for.</p>
<p>Movies, Ebert showed us, “are hardly ever what they seem to be about.” Because the movies we love, the ones we talk about, the ones that become important, shared experiences with people close to us, aren’t just stories. They are reflections of our deepest dreams and fears.</p>
<p>As I write this, mourners are making their way through early-morning rain to Chicago’s Holy Name Cathedral to say goodbye to the writer, essayist and lover of film for whom the label “movie critic” seems small and inadequate. Ebert died April 4 at age 70, claimed by disease that devoured him piece by piece but never beat or conquered him.</p>
<p>He was no less than a personal hero of mine, and teaching me how to love movies wasn’t even the half of it.</p>
<p>Some 30 years ago, as he and his fellow critic Gene Siskel were beginning to gain an audience for their weekly TV show, we were all buying our first VCRs. (For the kids, that’s an acronym for videocassette recorder, the analog predecessor to DVRs, Netflix, iTunes, Vudu and the Cloud). Suddenly, there were “video stores,” and a growing library of films we could watch whenever we chose. What’s more, we could own them, collect them, watch as many times as we’d like. As unremarkable as that may now seem, at the time it was astonishing.</p>
<p>Through his books and others writings, he helped me navigate the frontier that came to be known as “video” – a half-century of great storytelling suddenly accessible to everyone.<br />
Even now, on a bookshelf in my living room, beneath the rows of DVDs, is an earmarked hardcover copy of his book “Awake in the Dark.”</p>
<p>I lived and worked in Chicago many years, consider it home, and was there during the height of the Siskel &#038; Ebert heyday. Despite their success and celebrity, they remained true Chicagoans. And in the case of Ebert, he never really lost the awkward movie-geek persona of the early days.</p>
<p>Though they were both newspapermen (Ebert for the Sun-Times, Siskel for the Tribune), Siskel was far more comfortable on television – confident, direct, self-assured. Ebert, by his own admission, was terrible on TV, at least at first. And he never ascended (or stooped, depending on your perspective) to the smooth purr and fawning of the Entertainment Tonight school of celebrity journalism as movie commentary.</p>
<p>The two men were said to not get along. The relationship was complex, or very pure, I’m not sure which. Even when they seemed to be sick of one another, there was something gentle and endearing  in the slow and deliberate way Siskel would say “Rrrraw-gerr…”</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Ebert wrote “No one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate, and how deep was the love.”</p>
<p>Siskel died of a brain tumor in 1999. Ebert continued, of course, writing all the time, about anything and everything related to the movies. He compiled a list of “Great Movies,” with fresh, thoughtful reviews for each that formed a unique primer on film.  He offered advice for anyone wanting to learn about nuances of moviemaking:</p>
<p>“If you’re really serious about movies, get together with two or three friends who care as much as you do. Watch the film all the way through on video. Then start again at the top… Talk about what you’re looking at – the story, the performances, the sets, the locations. The camera movement, the lighting…”</p>
<p>Ebert championed the Guilty Pleasure. It’s ok to love a movie you cannot defend. It’s fine to enjoy a summer blockbuster with no chance of nailing the Palme d’Or at Cannes. Not every movie aspires to be “Howard’s End” or “The Tree of Life.”</p>
<p>If he loved a movie, he was effusive and spared no enthusiasm. If a movie was just plain worthless, he’d say so. Two of his books are titled “Your Movies Sucks” and “I Hated Hated Hated this Movie”.</p>
<p>The man had no tolerance for film snobs who tossed around arcane language to describe the obvious. Jargon, he said, was the last refuge of the scoundrel.<br />
A recommendation from Ebert, for my money, was golden. And if he awarded Four Stars, expect something very special. I trusted him.</p>
<p>As the New York Times said in Ebert’s obituary, “The force and grace of his opinions propelled film criticism into the mainstream of American culture.”<br />
In other words, he was one of us.</p>
<p>That’s not to say he could not be wrong. Once in a blue moon, an opinion truly puzzled me. “Dark City” was best movie or 1998? Really? Did he not see “Saving Private Ryan,” “Shakespeare in Love,” “Affliction,” “Gods and Monsters” or “The Truman Show?”</p>
<p>“There are no right answers. The questions are the point. They make you an active movie watcher, not a passive one… The more you learn, the quicker you’ll know when the director is not doing his share of the job.”</p>
<p>Much has been written about his battles with cancer, his disfiguring surgeries, the devastating loss of speech, but he refused to let these events define him. In fact, the exile imposed by his condition unexpectedly led to a unique position in social media– on Twitter, on his blog and elsewhere– where he became a voice of reason and a force for social justice. He was interested in everything, and he shared his passion for knowledge in a way that was infectious. </p>
<p>Even if you’ve no interest in movies, you’ll find his autobiography compelling. “Life Itself: A Memoir,” doesn’t get into Ebert’s life as a critic until page 151. It is, quite simply, his life put to paper – the parts he decided are important.  And at the end of the day, writing about movies was just one aspect of Roger Ebert. There was so much more.<br />
Sometimes publishers hawk celebrity autobiographies as “unflinchingly honest.” That supposed candor is usually a thinly veiled attempt to paint the subject as, in some way, brave, insightful or exceptional. Ebert had as many challenges as the next guy – no more, no less – and they’re told matter-of-factly, alongside brave admissions about failings many would never even concede to themselves.</p>
<p>Like his paralyzing fear of his mother’s rage, so profound that well into middle age he hid much of his personal, romantic life from her. Introducing a girlfriend with whom he was serious was simply out of the question, and he remained single until after her death.</p>
<p>“I allowed my life choices to be limited by fear. Now that I look back from the end, I clearly see that I should have broken free from her as quickly as I could. It was not her fault that I didn’t. Nobody ever makes you do anything. What they want to do is their decision. What you do is yours.</p>
<p><em>“I could write the story differently, but I wouldn’t learn from it, and neither would you.”</em></p>
<p>Pick up his book, or better yet, listen to the audio version, read with aplomb by the actor Edward Herrmann. </p>
<p>A wicked-smart, unbelievably fast and prolific writer, he was always accessible, with 200 movie reviews a year, more than a dozen books, a couple of blog posts per week and dozens of Tweets per day (to his 800,000+ followers). I am highly selective about paid Internet content, but I happily signed up for premium access to his blog. Not because I read it every day, but much like being shamed into donating to public radio, I simply felt he’d earned it.</p>
<p>I went back this week and looked at Ebert’s Top Ten lists throughout the years. More often than not, he had a keen sense for the movies that mattered, the ones that would stand the test of time.</p>
<p>In 1979, Ebert listed “Apocalypse Now” as his number-one film. Siskel chose “Hair.”</p>
<p>I came across heartfelt review for the 1979 movie “Breaking Away” that seemed vintage Ebert.</p>
<p>“In a summer of big-budget movies that are insults to the intelligence, here&#8217;s a little film about coming of age in Bloomington, Indiana.</p>
<p>“It’s about people who are complicated but decent, who are optimists but see things realistically… It’s about a Middle America we rarely see in the movies, but not corny and it doesn’t condescend. Movies like this are hardly ever made at all; when they’re made this well, they are precious cinematic miracles.”<br />
Not unlike yourself, Mr. Ebert. </p>
<p>Important, original, insightful, irreverent, thought-provoking and thoroughly unforgettable.</p>
<p>Four Stars.</p>

I have an emotional attachment to the traditions of the church, and, thanks to my Episcopalian mom, I grew up observing many of them in various ways. But Jerusalem&#8217;s book makes the occasions seem more special, more individual, more worthy of celebrating. She explains how she eventually came to appreciate the rhythm of the liturgical calendar (she grew up in a Southern Baptist household, then her family moved to Alaska, where she was exposed to some of other church traditions) and her writing is beautiful and makes me sit and savor.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t just like the book. I love the book.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ll love it, too.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the link on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Homemade-Year-Blessings-Crafting-Together/dp/1612610676/ref=pd_sim_b_21" target="_blank">A Homemade Year: The Blessings of Cooking, Crafting, and Coming Together</a></p>
<h6>GIVEAWAY</h6>
<p>Today, because it&#8217;s Friday, because I love Jerusalem&#8217;s book, and because I love ya, I&#8217;m giving away ten (10) copies of A Homemade Year.</p>

My mom is here. </strong></p>
<p>Last night, just after she arrived, she made a dinner of homemade mac-and-cheese, a big chopped salad, and an enormous pan of lightly steamed broccoli, because my mom has never visited my house without making an enormous pan of lightly steamed broccoli at least once during her visit. </p>
<p>After dinner she made chocolate chip cookies. </p>
<p>I woke up this morning and the house still smelled like she&#8217;d just pulled them out of the oven.</p>
<p>I think I should have one for breakfast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>9. Today I&#8217;m hiding my mom&#8217;s keys.</strong></p>
<p>I think she&#8217;d be very happy here for the long term, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>4. Tonight my mom, younger daughter, and I are going to a fancy event together. </strong></p>
<p>My daughter is wearing her Easter dress. It&#8217;s red and sweet and cute. </p>
<p>My mom is wearing a pantsuit I haven&#8217;t worn for sixty years. It&#8217;s black and looks pretty on her. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m wearing Spanx. </p>
<p>The end. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>B. Do people say &#8220;pantsuit&#8221; anymore?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/carolbrady.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/carolbrady.jpg" alt="carolbrady" width="289" height="361" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20261 frame-img width_289" /></a></p>

<a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/sleepover2.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/sleepover2.jpg" alt="sleepover2" width="630" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20253 frame-img width_630" /></a><strong>6. On tomorrow&#8217;s Food Network episode, my four kids and their two cousins have a big sleepover at the Lodge. </strong></p>
<p>(What&#8217;s my youngest child doing in this photo?)</p>
<p>(Never mind.)</p>
<p>Anyway, in this episode, the children play.</p>
<p>They frolic. </p>
<p>They scamper! They cavort! (Name that movie.)</p>
<p>Then Josh gets wind of the fact they&#8217;re all there and puts them to work doing some odd jobs for him.</p>
<p>Then, late that night, they all decide to prank Josh. </p>
<p>I go along, but only because I am the mother and the aunt and didn&#8217;t want them walking around the ranch late at night by themselves. Coyotes and all. </p>
<p>But I had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the prank. </p>
<p>Nothing. </p>
<p>Nobody can prove it. Nobody saw a thing.</p>
<p>Except the cameras, I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/chickenstrips.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/files/2013/04/chickenstrips.jpg" alt="chickenstrips" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20262 frame-img width_500" /></a>Oh! And there&#8217;s cooking on this cooking show! I make the kids homemade chicken strips, sweet potato fries, and individual fruit pizzas to get them through their evening of fun. </p>
<p>*Burp*</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2. Tomorrow&#8217;s episode will be the second-to-the-last new episode before a small break through May.</strong></p>
<p>Then, in June, the brand new crop of shows will start airing. I&#8217;ll keep you posted about what and when, but just a little piece of trivia: The shows in June are the start of what I like to call The Brown Eyeliner Episodes. In them, I eschew my standard black/Pat Benetar in favor of a softer, more natural brown. What will happen is anyone&#8217;s guess!</p>
<p><em>Will her eyes conmpletely disappear without the drama and emphasis the dark black liner provided?</p>
<p>Will she blend into the warm browns of her kitchen and eventually be confused with her refrigerator?</p>
<p>Will she look like an redheaded alien with no eyes who landed on earth to show humans how to make sausage gravy? </em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no telling where this all will head.</p>
<p>Anything can happen!</p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>a. Marlboro Man and I have been watching old seasons of <em>24</em>.</strong> </p>
<p>We did not watch these when they originally aired, so we really knew nothing about the show except for bits and pieces in a small handful of scattered episodes we might have accidentally seen along the way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely loving the shows. They keep me on the edge of my seat. They&#8217;re exciting, surprising, thrilling, and entertaining.</p>
<p>Still&#8230;</p>
<p>I have the same questions millions of people have had since the series began. I&#8217;m just in Season 2. Are these ever addressed? </p>
<p>Here they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3. When does Jack Bauer go to the bathroom?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>7. When does Jack Bauer charge his phone? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>c. When does Jack Bauer eat? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>39. In closing, please don&#8217;t tell Jack Bauer I asked any of these questions. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<em>By <a href="http://heathersanders.com" title="Heather Sanders">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>For the last several years, more and more research suggests video games are an exceptional training and educational tool, both for the classroom and at home.  While video games continue to permeate our culture across all demographics, new research on gaming design begs the question, <a href="http://fluency21.com/blog/2012/01/06/can-gaming-change-education/" title="Can Gaming Change Education" target="_blank">&#8220;Can Gaming Change Education?&#8221;</a>  </p>
<p>As some educators convert to the use of video games in the home and classroom, and interest for the further development and use of video games for learning increases, my youngest two kids are adamant that <em>ne&#8217;er the two shall meet</em>, declaring that <a href="http://heathersanders.com/2013/04/10/xbox-is-for-fun-not-learning" title="Xbox is for fun, not learning" target="_blank">Xbox is for fun, not learning.</a> </p>
<p>Of course, my kids&#8217; opinions may be based on their exposure to less-than-stellar educational video games, which is exactly why organizations like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2008/oct08/10-07MSRNYUPR.aspx" title="The Games for Learning Institute" target="_blank">The Games for Learning Institute (G4LI)</a> are identifying &#8220;which qualities of computer games engage students&#8221;, and why The Joan Ganzy Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop <a href="http://www.joanganzcooneycenter.org/publication/policy-brief-game-changer-investing-in-digital-play-to-advance-childrens-learning-and-health/" title="Game Changer: Investing in Digital Play to Advance Children's Learning and Health" target="_blank">promotes research</a> that suggests increased investment in research-based, well-designed digital games will help improve children&#8217;s traditional skills such as reading and math, as well as more 21st-century skills, like critical thinking. </p>
<p>Most of us have children involved in some level of gaming, but as Ali Carr-Chellman said in her October 2010 <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ali_carr_chellman_gaming_to_re_engage_boys_in_learning.html" title="Bring Back the Boys: Gaming to re-engage boys in learning" target="_blank">TED talk</a>, most of the educational games out there are glorified drill and practice without the depth and rich narrative that our kids&#8217; truly engaging video games have.</p>
<p>This made me realize that the reason my kids don&#8217;t want to think about their Xbox as a learning tool is because the educational video and computer games they have been exposed to in the past do not engage them in the same way their &#8220;fun&#8221; massively multiplayer online (MMO) games do.  I know this because they only scoff at setting timers when it comes to playing Minecraft or Halo 4, but are not at all disgruntled if they are given a limit on their educational computer games or apps.</p>
<p>The level of interest and desire is not even in the same playing field.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a gamer, but a different <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2010/03/17/gaming_can_make/" titlte="Gaming Can Make a Better World" target="_blank">2010 TED talk from Jane Mcgonigal</a> (Can you tell TED videos are my newest addiction?), makes it clear that some video games tap into so much more in our kids than I ever realized as a simple bystander.  Mcgonigal&#8217;s assertion &#8220;we need to make the real world more like the game&#8221; is based on an understanding that our kids feel they can achieve more in the online world than they can in real life.  So, it only makes sense they would want to be where they are most engaged and successful.  </p>
<p>The games my kids play online allow them to collaborate with others in a specific mission or purpose.  They are compelled to focus and learn (while fumbling through numerous failed attempts) before reaching their objective, all while absorbing an enormous amount of knowledge each time they navigate the game.  In addition, the decisions they make and the actions they take directly affect other players, and subsequently, their virtual world &#8211; something that doesn&#8217;t truly happen a lot in their real world.</p>
<p>In other words, IN THE GAME they are fully invested because what they do truly matters.</p>
<p>There is a good deal of time, money and research currently dedicated to <a href="http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCECS2010/WCECS2010_pp272-275.pdf" title="Effectively Engaging Students in Educational Games by Deploying HCI Evaluation methods" target="_blank">evaluating methods</a> for improving the quality of educational games; even the <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-01-26/edcuational-video-games-white-house/52908052/1" title="White House office studies benefits of video games" target="_blank">White House</a> is studying its benefits.  Still, from what I see, games specifically focused on education need a good bit of work if they want to catch up with the games our kids truly like to play.</p>
<p>In the meantime, my son can continue thinking that <a href="http://heathersanders.com/2013/04/10/xbox-is-for-fun-not-learning" title="Xbox is for fun, not learning." target="_blank">playing Xbox is getting away from school</a>, and I can embrace my new understanding that he&#8217;s learning more than he thinks.</p>
<h6>How do you feel about educational games, or video games in general, as part of your child&#8217;s overall learning experience?</h6>

<p>I was ten years old when I first became familiar with the idea of a TV cliffhanger. Truth be told, I was watching the season finale of <i>Dallas</i> with my family, a fact that begs at least a couple of questions: 1) what in the world was I doing watching <i>Dallas</i> when I was ten? And 2) was media-related parenting <i>that</i> much more relaxed in 1980?</p>
<p>(The answers: 1) I have no idea. And 2) apparently, yes.)</p>
<p>(I’m glad we’ve settled these pressing matters.)</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>I was watching the season finale of <i>Dallas</i> with my family, and lo and behold, somebody shot J.R. We weren’t just surprised; we were incredulous. And by the time the final credits started to roll, a none-too-pleasant reality started to roll around in my brain:</p>
<p><i>I’m going to have to wait all summer to find out who did this. ALL SUMMER.</i></p>
<p>And then, in a fit of adolescent hysteria:</p>
<p><i>NOTHING ABOUT MY LIFE IS FAIR.</i></p>
<p>Ever since all the “Who Shot J.R.?” madness way back when, I have been a person who adores a TV episode with a good, suspenseful ending. I love knowing that there is some critical revelation just around the corner – but I’m going to have to wait a week or more to find out what it is, and the odds are strong that I’m going to drive myself a little cuckoo trying to figure it out in the interim.</p>
<p>That’s precisely why I’m so carried away with <i>Scandal</i>.</p>
<p>Like, say, <i>24</i>, <i>Scandal</i> doesn’t save its cliffhangers for a season finale. They’re scattered throughout the season – mini-cliffhangers, if you will – and the result is a show that’s a constant surprise. The most recent episode offered some unexpected twists and turns, especially in the storyline with Jake and Olivia, and at the end of the episode, when I saw that the next episode is three weeks away – well, I may have rended some garments.</p>
<p>Because oh, do I ever have some questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<center>*****</center></p>
<p><center>*****</center></p>
<p><strong>SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT – THERE ARE SO MANY SPOILERS AHEAD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO KIDDING. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED BECAUSE WE’RE TALKING ABOUT LOADS-O-SPOILERS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SERIOUSLY. LAST CHANCE TO TURN AWAY BEFORE ALL THE SPOILERS!</strong></p>
<p><center>*****</center></p>
<p><center>*****</center></p>
<p>All righty. My questions. Here are a few of them.</p>
<p><strong>    •	How will Olivia respond to Fitz? </strong></p>
<p>I mean, he showed up at the hospital, which was A Moment for sure. But I don’t think I can stand it if she welcomes him with open arms. And I don’t think it’s at all fair for him to ask anything of her – not a single thing – until he’s not married anymore. Ditto for her.</p>
<p><strong>	•	How low will Cyrus go? </strong></p>
<p>Cyrus has done some Not Nice (as well as Not Ethical and Not At All Legal) things in the interest of protecting the president and preserving his own job as Chief of Staff. Even still, I was a little shocked to see him on the other end of a phone call with Charlie, his favorite hit man – because that ties him directly to the attack on Huck. Does that mean that Cyrus is Albatross? That just can’t be, can it? </p>
<p><strong>	•	Is Jake a bad guy? Or a good guy?</strong></p>
<p>At first I was leaning toward bad. Then good. Then bad. Then good. And now I’m very confused. However, I do think Jake was surprised to see the president hug Olivia, and I also think that Jake knows way more about the murders than what we’ve seen so far. He fascinates me and also gives me the creeps, so it’s hard for me to believe that he’s a heroic character. Very curious to see how his part of the story plays out.</p>
<p><strong>	•	Why is Huck in a corner?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t really have a lot to add to this question, so I’ll just ask the question again: why is Huck in the corner? Why did the attack at the storage unit affect him so much more than, say, Chinese water torture?</p>
<p><strong>	•	What does Mellie have up her sleeve?</strong></p>
<p>Mellie’s smart, she’s ambitious, and she’s politically savvy. She’s also furious with her husband and reminded over and over again that she’s not enough for him. And I just think that if Mellie was willing to get involved with Defiance, she just might be involved behind-the-scenes with Other Stuff, too. I have a feeling that she’s pulling more puppet strings than Fitz – and maybe even Cyrus – would ever suspect.</p>
<p>Who else is watching <i>Scandal</i> this season? Anybody have any theories about how the rest of the season will play out?</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pioneerwoman-full-rss-feed/~4/BVMSCZYxcLo" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

<h6>How Walter Feels About Rain, a Study in Contrasts</h6>
<p></em></p>
<p>Walter hates rain.</p>
<p>He has a pathological fear of it.</p>
<p>He runs around the house and starts breathing heavily.</p>
<p>He jumps into the kids&#8217; beds and burrows under their covers when it rains in the middle of the night. Then they come downstairs, wake me up, and say, &#8220;Mom, Walter&#8217;s in my bed and he smells like rotten Fritos. Can I go sleep outside on the porch?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I wake up, smile, and say, &#8220;Listen! It&#8217;s raining! Do you hear that blessed, wonderful sound? Isn&#8217;t it beautiful, kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>And they go back to bed, mumbling, &#8220;Thanks for the help with Walter, Mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Point is, Walter does not share his parents&#8217; appreciation for the unparalleled beauty of a spring rain. </p>
<p>Here. I&#8217;ll let him tell you in his own words. </p>

<p><strong>***Spoiler Alert***</strong></p>
<p><strong>***Spoiler Alert:  Do not read this if you don’t want to know about Season 6 of <em>Mad Men</em>!</strong></p>
<p>I cannot tell a lie.  I wait for the season premiere of <em>Mad Men</em> every year like it’s Christmas morning.  Although, let’s be honest, it’s a very dark version of pretty much any Christmas you can envision.</p>
<p>But, still, I need to know what’s going on with these characters who fascinate me and frustrate me and make me sad a lot more than they make me happy.  I believe some people might call that co-dependency.</p>
<p>When we left off in April of 1967, Megan Draper had launched her acting career and Don was sitting in a bar where an attractive woman asked, “Are you alone?”  And after a season that seemed to find Don as happy as Don Draper ever really is (which isn’t very) we were left to wonder what his answer would be and if we are going to see a return to the Don Draper of yore.</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>The season opens on Christmas 1967.  Don and Megan are on vacation in Hawaii, but it’s an immediate clue that things might not be going well when we see Don reading Dante’s Inferno on the beach.  It’s not exactly the kind of light reading one might choose for a tropical vacation.</p>
<p>The whole episode seemed to focus on death.  The near death of the doorman who was saved by Dr. Rosen.  The death of Sandy’s mother.  The death of Roger’s mother and, ultimately, the death of the shoe shine man that finally caused Roger to break down in tears as he faced his own mortality.</p>
<p>In all, I thought it was a slow-moving, tedious, DARK episode, but that tends to be typical for Mad Men and then as the season goes on we’ll see Matthew Weiner weave it all together and realize the opener was setting up everything that will happen from here on out.</p>
<p>Here are a few thoughts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>1.  Megan Draper in a bikini.</strong>  </p>
<p>My stomach hasn’t been that flat in, well, ever.  Good night.  And that dress she had on at the luau?  LOVE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>2.  I couldn’t figure out why Don was so friendly with Dr. Rosen.</strong>  </p>
<p>It seems so unlike him to pursue a friendship with a man.  But it became clear when we realize he’s sleeping with Dr. Rosen’s wife.  It’s his guilt.  And, ultimately, I think he recognizes that Dr. Rosen is more of a man than he’ll ever be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>3.  The hair styles.</strong>  </p>
<p>How much did you love Harry’s hair?  And is that a receding hairline I see on Pete Campbell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>4.  Not enough Joan.</strong>  </p>
<p>I need to know what’s going on with Joan right now.  But she was stunning in her purple suit during the brief photoshoot scene.  And I loved the smile she got on her face when Roger said he didn&#8217;t want to &#8220;follow that act&#8221;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>5.  I’m so happy for Peggy.</strong>  </p>
<p>She is obviously thriving in her new office environment and has become a professional success.  Don taught her well.  She seems to embody all the best of him, while trying to fight off the worst.  I thought it was interesting that her boss had to remind her it was New Year’s Eve and she should let people go home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>6.  Roger Sterling.</strong>  </p>
<p>He was at his finest.  Whether it was his witty monologue at the therapist’s office or consoling his secretary over the death of his mother, he was brilliant.  </p>
<p>But the scene that broke my heart even more than when he cried over the death of the shoeshine man was when he tried to open up to his daughter and gave her that jar of water from the Jordan River, only to realize that all she wanted from him was money for her husband’s business venture.</p>

<strong>7.  I’m not sure why Betty was so obsessed with Sandy.</strong>  </p>
<p>Was it longing for a return to her own youth?  Was she really concerned about Sandy’s future?  Or is she just bored?</p>
<p>And dying her hair at the end?  It will be interesting to see where Betty goes this season.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>8.  Cotton Bowl Reference.</strong></p>
<p>As an Aggie, I loved the mention of the 1968 Cotton Bowl matchup between Texas A&#038;M and Alabama.  I didn&#8217;t think much of it until I read this fascinating analysis of it on the <a href="http://www.everydayshouldbesaturday.com/2013/4/8/4196512/the-deep-significance-of-a-reference-to-the-1968-cotton-bowl" target="_blank">Every Day Should Be Saturday blog</a>.  Very interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>9.  If I had to pick one scene that was my favorite last night, it was Roger’s mother’s funeral.</strong>  </p>
<p>Between the old women hitting on Roger to Don throwing up, it was the kind of <em>Mad Men</em> moment I live for.</p>
<p><em>So those are my thoughts.  </p>
<p>Did you watch it?  </p>
<p>Any thoughts or predictions on what will happen this season? </em></p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pioneerwoman-full-rss-feed/~4/WWJvmzPUGoE" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>
