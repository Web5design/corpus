<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, the guys will all be hightailing it back to England soon. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll miss the ol&#8217; chaps.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to be happy not to wear a mic for awhile. I&#8217;d like to go to the bathroom without unplugging first.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get stage fright.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to know any more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591490595/" title="DSC_1740 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8591490595_5b0c45c2cf_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="DSC_1740" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Yesterday I shot an entire show in one day, which is unusual. Typically, episodes take 1 1/2 to 2 days to shoot, but this one was basically shoot-as-it-happens. It was a freezer meal theme: I filled the freezer with lots of yummy food for busy days in my house, which is every day, and man, am I excited to have all this grub. </p>
<p>*Burp*</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591489763/" title="DSC_1730 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8591489763_58cf1e2f51_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC_1730" class="width_427 frame-img" /></a>Here, Mike is rigging the freezer door so it won&#8217;t keep hitting me on the bottom as I stand and describe some of the things I&#8217;d stocked the freezer with. </p>
<p>It was getting a little embarrassing.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is a great freezer casserole. Really great flavor&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;One thing I like to do is store grilled chicken breasts in airtight bags&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is one of my favorite freezer soups. To make it, you&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom. </p>
<p>This is just another behind-the-scenes wrinkle you never think about when you watch cooking shows on TV: Freezer doors hitting the person on the bottom every time they try to talk. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those things no one ever talks about. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

He makes my heart leap. I&#8217;ve been making him and his brother come hang out in my dressing room so I can listen to them talk about football and accuse them of eating all my snacks. </p>
<p>Man, can they polish off some snacks. Like, whole packages. Gone. Poof. As if the snacks ever existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>Really keeps me going. </p>
<p>Or&#8230;not.</p>
<p>Have a happy Tuesday, everyone! </p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592431570/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8098/8592431570_e49261a218_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>These are the perfect little side dish for Easter Brunch: Tender-but-crispy potato nests with a luscious baked egg in the middle. They go perfectly with ham for a more substantial brunch, or they&#8217;re great for a casual breakfast with a piece of bacon. Or two. Or three. Or nineteen.</p>
<p>I will say, when I first decided to try these out, I was excited. I&#8217;d seen different iterations of the little cutie-pies and I figured they&#8217;d be a piece of cake to whip up. But in fact, I had to go through quite a bit of trial and error before I cracked the dang code. And by the time I figured it all out, I think I&#8217;d shaved a good seven months off of my life expectancy. </p>
<p>I started off trying frozen hash brown potatoes, which I initially assumed would work fine. But they wound up being way, way too dry: During the initial baking of the nest, they shriveled to almost nothing, and after the egg baked inside the nests, the hash browns turned a very strange consistency&#8212;and there was hardly any potato flavor at all. Super dry, super weird.</p>
<p>Frozen Hash Browns = A no-go for this recipe. Like, totally.</p>
<p>After giving up on the frozen potatoes, I wound up fiddling with fresh potatoes in a couple of different ways: First I tried grating them from a raw state, which didn&#8217;t work at all. Too mushy. Didn&#8217;t crisp up. Produced angst. Made me crazy. </p>
<p>Finally, the best result came from grating almost-fully-baked potatoes: The consistency was perfect and the potato flavor was fabulous. </p>
<p>Then I slept for a month because I was so exhausted. </p>
<p>It would be a long, long time before I&#8217;d be able to trust again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592430280/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8592430280_42e01fe766_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Here&#8217;s how to make them! Start by baking a few potatoes. I scrubbed the potatoes, then baked them until they were not quite tender enough to eat: Soft, but with the tiniest bit of bite left. This will make them easier to grate, and will also allow more room for baking later. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591330297/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8591330297_d6d6b62e56_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Grate all the potatoes, using the largest grating size. As you grate them, if you hear just a tiny bit of &#8220;crunch&#8221; signifying that the potato isn&#8217;t fully cooked, that&#8217;s just fine, Maynard. </p>
<p>Sorry I called you Maynard. </p>
<p>Next, season the potatoes generously with salt and pepper: Just toss them around with your hands as you sprinkle. </p>

They&#8217;ll shrink when they bake, so don&#8217;t be afraid to really spill over the top. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591330421/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8591330421_fca3b18175_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Bake them for about 20-25 minutes (note the increased oven temp in printable recipe below) until they&#8217;re golden brown. Keep an eye on them so the ends of the potato shreds don&#8217;t burn. </p>
<p>You can see how much the potatoes shrink up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592431474/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8592431474_7b4538195b_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Now, I let the nests cool a bit (you can even bake them off an hour or two ahead of time and let them totally cool) before cracking in the eggs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591330765/" title="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8591330765_2006267941_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Eggs in Hash Brown Cups" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Let the eggs bake for 10-15 minutes, until they get to the level of doneness you&#8217;re looking for. I still like to have a little softness to the yolks, and mine baked for probably 12 minutes or so. </p>
<p>* Note: Be assured that no matter what, all of your eggs will probably bake a little differently and won&#8217;t all look exactly the same on top. Some whites will look perfect, some might look a little funky. Some whites will cover the yolk, some will gloriously reveal the yolk. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the beauty of these things! They&#8217;re rustic.</p>
<p>Ha. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

If you feel like you need a little practice before Sunday, you can pare down the amounts and do a practice run with one potato and two or three eggs. The instructions are the same whether you make a big batch or a small one.</p>
<p>These are totally delicious. My family loves them. My brother-in-law Tim likes to douse them with hot sauce. (I have to admit, I do too.)</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Bake the potatoes until almost tender (potatoes should still have a little bite) 45 minutes to 1 hour. Allow to cool, and then peel and grate them. Season well with salt and pepper.</p>
<p>INCREASE OVEN TEMP TO 425 DEGREES.</p>
<p>Spray two muffin pans generously with cooking spray. Scoop 3 to 4 tablespoons of grated potato into each muffin cup. Use your fingers to gently press the sides and bottom in each muffin hole to make a nest (don't press the potatoes firmly against the pan; they should sit lightly in the pan.) Spray again (very lightly!) with cooking spray. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Watch and make sure they do not burn. (If they seem like they're not browning, kick up the temp to 450.) Remove when the nests are golden brown.</p>
<p>Allow the nests to cool. Crack an egg into each one. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake until the whites are set, about 15 minutes. Don't be concerned if some whites bake differently; no two nests will look alike! </p>
<p>Remove from the muffin pan with a spoon or fork and serve.</p>

<p>There are only 6 weeks left in our co-op&#8217;s school year, and Kenny has blazed through 19 of the 25 <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2012/08/american-history-middle-school-book-resources-compilation/" title="American History readers" target="_blank">readers</a> purchased or borrowed for his <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2012/11/american-history-up-to-1850-presentations-curriculum/" title="American History to 1850" target="_blank">American History course.</a></p>
<p>Now that he is studying the Westward Movement, he and I both realized we failed to collect a single reader about the Americans who felt it was their &#8220;Manifest Destiny&#8221; to <em>Go West</em>, settling the continent from the Atlantic to Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>Imagine my excitement at the timing when Chicago Review Press sent a copy of the newest release in their Women of Action series, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Frontier-Trailblazing-Entrepreneurs-Rabble-Rousers/dp/1883052971" title="Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers" target="_blank">Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers</a></em> by Brandon Marie Miller.</p>
<p>March is <a href="http://womenshistorymonth.gov" title="Women's History Month" target="_blank">Women&#8217;s History Month</a>, and I realize that means I’m a little late on the draw as we are steadfastly heading into April.  Still, when I find a good book I like to share it, and this book completely captures the courage of the pioneering women of the mid-1800s.</p>
<p>Kenny couldn’t help but be interested in it after seeing me take it to bed three nights in a row.  The first chapter about how Margret Reed survived starvation near Lake Truckee in the Sierra Nevada sucked him in immediately.  From missionaries and physicians to naturalists and suffragettes, the stories are taken directly from the “ordinary lives of daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers.”</p>
<p>Miller weaves this collection of abridged biographies, period photos, letters home, and even song lyrics so artfully that I finished wanting to know more about each of their personal lives.  Trekking 2,000 miles across a seemingly endless frontier, these 19th century women were hard core, leaving behind friends and family they would likely never see again, for the hope of a better life.</p>
<p>The sufferings endured on the wagon train often did not ease up after arriving at their destination; at that point, the pioneer women learned to meet their challenges, fears and setbacks with perseverance and determination as they worked side-by-side with their husbands to build log cabins or sod houses, work the land, mills, stores, or inns, all while caring for children, pregnancy, and bearing/raising babies.</p>
<p>While some of the women adapted more readily than others, most of their writing reveals their appreciation for the rugged beauty they came to see in the new landscape of their lives.</p>
<p>Targeted for middle school students ages 12 and up, Brandon Marie Miller’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Women-Frontier-Trailblazing-Entrepreneurs-Rabble-Rousers/dp/1883052971" title="Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers" target="_blank">Women of the Frontier: 16 Tales of Trailblazing, Homesteaders, Entrepreneurs, and Rabble-Rousers</a></em> is a wonderful supplement to any study of American History and the Westward Movement.</p>
<h6>Are you a fan of stories from this period?  Any Westward Movement reader recommendations for middle school and up?</h6>

<p>Wait. Did you hear that? </p>
<p>Did you hear that noise?</p>
<p>That was my heart going pitter-pat. </p>
<p>Boys wearing bow ties will do that to a mama. </p>
<p>In other news: I just have a day or so of shooting left, which means I&#8217;m about 24 hours away from not showering, not wearing makeup, not drying or styling my hair, and not caring what my fingernails look like. </p>
<p>Get ready, Marlboro Man! You&#8217;re gonna love it. </p>
<p>Or not. </p>

<p>I would like to report, however, that I have been using brown eyeliner instead of black during this shoot. It&#8217;s been hard to step away from the Pat Benetar look, but my soul tells me brown makes more logical sense with my red hair and pigmentless skin. </p>
<p>But <em>man</em>, am I caking on that brown eyeliner. I won&#8217;t go down without a fight! </p>

Bruiser Pookie Sunshine Of My Life loves having the crew here, but he especially loves Matt. Matt has two terriers back in England and he loves on Bruiser every day because he misses his doggies. </p>
<p>Please look at how Bruiser is sitting. </p>
<p>And speaking of Matt: Matt, Luke, and Mike (the camera and lighting guys on the shoot) are friends on Instagram, and they often post photos and comment on one another&#8217;s shots. More than once, I have witnessed some ribbing (read: trash-talking) going on about whose Instagram photos are better. </p>
<p>So I asked each of them to send me one of their favorite Instagram photos of the ranch. Then I asked them if they&#8217;d mind if I posted them here.</p>
<p>Then I asked them if they&#8217;d mind if I turned it into a contest. </p>
<p>They all said fine.</p>
<p>So here they are!</p>

<p>And anyway, the Easter Bunny is a boy, right? It’s even more impossible than I thought!</p>
<p>Okay, let’s start this whole thing over. Imagine that the Easter Bunny’s wife is a chicken, and imagine her laying an egg. These sweet, crispy eggs with a fun candy surprise inside would be what came out!</p>
<p>Wait. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s possible either.</p>
<p>Sheesh. Leave it to me to take something as innocent as an Easter treat and turn it into something disturbing. Please don’t let me spoil this special time for you. </p>
<p>Haunting visuals aside, these adorable little ovoid (vocabulary word alert!) wonders are nothing more than Rice Kripie Treats that have been thrown into a wacky-looking Easter egg machine and, minutes later, come out the other end looking like Easter eggs. They&#8217;re super easy and fun to make with kids. The perfect Easter treat!</p>

<p>You know. Those plastic Easter eggs? The ones you think are taking over your house one minute, then the next minute, when you actually need them to photograph a recipe, you can&#8217;t find one to save your life so you drive over to your sister-in-law&#8217;s house and borrow hers? </p>
<p>Yes, those plastic Easter eggs. </p>

<p>While the brunch on the show wasn&#8217;t on Easter Sunday (it was filmed in the wintertime!) all the food is very Easter Brunch-friendly. I&#8217;ll try to post some of the individual recipes here on The Pioneer Woman Cooks in the coming days so you can prepare for next weekend. Meantime, I hope you enjoy the show tomorrow! </p>
<p>Happy Friday, friends.</p>

Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7205105164_fb5e74a4bb_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="When have you felt most alive?" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer">Heather Sanders</a></em></p>
<p>We homeschool 30 weeks a year, which means we know when we will begin the school year, and most importantly, when it will end. Our school year ends in exactly 6 weeks. I mentioned that bit of trivia to the kids today and received comments like &#8220;Six weeks! Summer takes forever to get here!&#8221; I have to say I completely agree. Spring Break was not long enough, and Summer feels light years away. Surprisingly, it is this time of year that makes me the strongest advocate for a structured homeschooling approach; without the structure I am not sure I could find the energy to finish.</p>
<p>For the sake of complete transparency, I debate regularly with a softer, counterintuitive voice in my head that says, &#8220;Yes, but if you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling" title="unschooling" target="_blank">unschooled</a>, you and the kids would be more personally invested and intrinsically energized while pursuing knowledge in each of your personal areas of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, my louder voice says, &#8220;Riiiiiiight. If the kids were given the freedom to choose, they would still not know their <a href="http://www.omsh.com/homeschool-math-on-saturday-say-it-aint-so/" title="multiplication" target="_blank">multiplication</a> tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, back and forth this internal conversation plays out until I tire of the confusion and tune out. Am I the only one who deals with this sort of brain babble? It is apparently called &#8220;self talk&#8221; and if handled correctly, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/positive-thinking/SR00009.html" title="self talk can be a healthy habit" target="_blank">self talk can be a healthy habit.</a> My problem? My &#8220;self&#8221; won&#8217;t shut up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to relieve my inner ramblings by taking advantage of Jeff as a sounding board.  He&#8217;s a tremendous listener, but in the end I&#8217;m sure it is nothing short of torture for him.  He diligently asks questions that help focus my attention, I make a decision, and then a few hours later the battle rages in my head again.</p>
<p>That is why I stick with structure; for me, it is comfortable, safe, and sure.  As a person who <a href="https://type-coach.com/esfj" title="thrives on organization and detail" target="_blank">thrives on organization and detail,</a> I cannot imagine a school year that didn&#8217;t file neatly in a physical binder or digital archive, with each piece of paper or information neatly placed behind subject-specific, labeled dividers or within designated directories.</p>
<p>Thing is the kids&#8217; minds don&#8217;t work like mine, which means 1) either my structure is a gift that clears all the unnecessary clutter, ensuring them an unhindered path to their future, or 2) I&#8217;m an old school stumbling block that fails to recognize they need to clear their own path to approach their education in a way that best suits how their minds work.</p>
<p>It seems clear that homeschooling is the best, most natural, way for parents to recognize the inherent differences in how each of their children learn.  What is less clear is what exactly to do with this knowledge.</p>
<p>These are questions I ponder in this last six weeks of my 7th year of homeschooling, and as you can imagine, the battle rages on in my head.  I&#8217;m pretty certain I will need a healthy dose of sleeping in and poolside therapy to reach any logical conclusions.</p>
<h6>Where are you in this dichotomy of homeschooling styles?  What brought you to that place?</h6>

He&#8217;s often up on the counters getting closeups of the food as I cook, and he provides a steady stream of hilarious one-liners and plays on words, which I need to start writing down so that when I want to post about them, my mind won&#8217;t go blank as it is right now. </p>
<p>Matt is also married to Olivia, the director, whom I absolutely love. She is the calm and sweet yin to Matt&#8217;s mischievous and comedic yang, and I love being in the kitchen with the two English pookie lovebirds. </p>
<p>That said, I didn&#8217;t know they were married until the second time they came for a shoot. They keep it under wraps!</p>
<p>Get it? Wraps? </p>
<p>(I think all this TV terminology is getting to me.)</p>
<p>And speaking of wraps, doesn&#8217;t that word alone sum up all that is wrong with the English language?</p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To cover or enclose something. <em>I&#8217;m going to wrap my arms around Marlboro Man&#8217;s chiseled waist when I see him tonight.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To finish filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s it&#8212;time to wrap for the day! Time to go home and watch Real Housewives, Ree.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> The end of filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s a wrap! Time to go home and pick your toenails, Ree. </em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A loose outer garment.<br />
<em>Can I take your wrap to the coat room?</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A veil of secrecy.<br />
<em>Olivia and Matt keep their marriage under wraps while they&#8217;re working.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A sandwich rolled inside a tortilla or flatbread.<br />
<em>Have you tried my chicken marshmallow chili veggie chocolate wrap?</em></p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on <strong>rap</strong>.</p>
<p>Stop the madness!</p>

<p>In other news, thank you for letting me take you along on my shooting experiences this week! It&#8217;s fun to continue to share what I&#8217;m doing with you, even if what I&#8217;m doing is a little wacky. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565932257/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8523/8565932257_447ae936c3_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is David, who has worked on the show almost since the beginning. In the photo above, he&#8217;s showing me a photo of his niece and her baby, whom he clearly adores. He, along with my good friend Tiffany (who&#8217;s nearly seven months pregnant right now, which is making me have all sorts of gestational thoughts) make sure all the food is in place for every recipe I cook on the show. It&#8217;s a huge job and requires a lot of coordination, especially considering we live in the country and can&#8217;t just run out and pick up something we don&#8217;t have. </p>
<p><em>Um&#8230;welcome to my daily life?</em></p>
<p>And David lives in New York City, which makes the contrast all the more stark for him. </p>
<p>David, it turns out, actually loves our small town and appreciates the time he gets to spend here. Last year, probably because he&#8217;s there every single morning of the shoot, David won ten dollars from our local grocery store as part of a fun promotion they were having that involved daily drawings for different cash prizes. Because he won, they took his picture and put it on the wall of winners in the store. </p>
<p>This was a highlight of David&#8217;s experience here. He still talks about it like it was a complete honor. </p>
<p>I love that guy.</p>

The cameras walked all over the building and got to get a lot of &#8220;before&#8221; shots. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797067/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8573797067_b7ddd3aba8_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>There was lots of miscellaneous cooking going on yesterday, including this&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797279/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8573797279_5d95f73aac_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And this. </p>
<p>Oh, dear. </p>
<p>Just you wait, &#8216;enry &#8216;iggins!</p>
<p>Name that movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8574888726/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8523/8574888726_84ee9794b4_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then it was time to make brownies, so the director Olivia and I talked through the recipe beforehand and discussed the best way to proceed. </p>
<p>And this is something you might not know about cooking shows: It would be difficult to show up, tell the cameramen &#8220;I&#8217;m making brownies today, guys. Ready, set, go!&#8221; because they&#8217;d wind up with a lot of missed shots of the food and the process, and the end result wouldn&#8217;t be as visually appealing (or as complete). So we make sure to have the recipe broken up into logical pieces, and then we make sure the cameramen know which direction the ingredients are going to head, then Mike makes sure all the lights will bring out the natural beauty of the food, then I run powder my face for the four thousandth time because it&#8217;s already shiny again. </p>
<p>Then I grab a cracker and a Diet Dr Pepper. </p>
<p>Then I run to the ladies room. But I take my mic off first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573796581/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8573796581_f4b59e6b79_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Day Five" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>I get them baked and iced, then I snap a photo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573796019/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8573796019_2bb27563c0_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I go around to the other side of the counter and snap a photo. Doesn&#8217;t this kind of look like aliens kidnapped me? </p>
<p><em>Has anyone seen Ree for awhile?&#8230;</em></p>
<p>What you also can&#8217;t see in this photo is the inch-thick layer of powdered sugar on the floor underneath my work station. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s there because&#8212;well, because I&#8217;m messy, but also because when I&#8217;m addressing the camera and cooking or baking something, I can&#8217;t always hunker over and contort my body to get ingredients to go into vessels without also falling all over the floor. Pay attention next time you cook something by yourself: You might find yourself leaning over, wrapping your arm around your mixer so as to get the powdered sugar to drop in without going everywhere, making weird faces as you concentrate on chopping, etc. Now imagine a camera is there, and you need to somewhat clearly narrate every step you&#8217;re doing, and not look like a complete dodo bird while you do it. </p>
<p>Makes you want to stand up a little straighter and remember not to scratch your armpit, I&#8217;ll tell you that.</p>

Thank you, David!</p>
<p>My shoes were starting to make sticky sounds when I walked. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m super neat that way.</p>

What David doesn&#8217;t whisk away, Charlie can always count as a mid-afternoon snack.</p>

They&#8217;re a more powerful cleaning tool than any Swifter in the universe. </p>
<p>(Unless you count all the grass they bring in from outside. But that&#8217;s just a technicality.)</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had friends over to The Lodge for dinner Saturday night: Hyacinth and her family (our friends for many years), Steve and Sheila (our friends for many years), and Steve&#8217;s brother Mike and his family, who just moved to our small town last year. Mike and Steve actually grew up here, and Steve has lived here since he finished college. Mike and his wife Bev recently decided to move back to Pawhuska after Mike and Steve&#8217;s dad passed away, and while Mike and Steve and their families go to our church, Marlboro Man and I have been wanting to have them all out for dinner for awhile. </p>
<p>Did that make any sense at all? I sure know how to give a thorough explanation, don&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>Or not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8570818267/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8570818267_a44042732a_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>It just so happened that we had them over for dinner while the TV crew was here. </p>
<p>Before I had the experience of being on a television show, I would have thought a scene like the one above&#8212;one that involves socializing and visiting with friends while cameras are watching&#8212;would feel strange and unnatural. But in fact, it becomes really easy to just forget they&#8217;re there. This is largely due to the crew itself; they&#8217;re quiet and pretty unobtrusive. But also, it helps when the events they&#8217;re chronicling are real life events, as Saturday evening&#8217;s dinner was. We were so excited to finally have Mike and Bev (and their son Marshall) over to the house, our conversation with them overrode any awareness of cameras being pointed up our nostrils.</p>
<p>At one point, our director Olivia quietly said, &#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re ready, you guys can head to the table and tuck in.&#8221; Tuck in, in England, means to dig in and start eating.</p>
<p>I noticed out of the corner of my eye that our guest Mike was looking down at his shirt and tucking it in a bit. </p>
<p>I got a chuckle out of that one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571912780/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8571912780_2e96315214_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And it&#8217;s not just me being used to cameras because I&#8217;ve been doing it for awhile. Our guests were there just five minutes before they were mingling and enjoying the conversation, hardly glancing in the direction of the cameras at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571909888/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8571909888_2cd3b00cec_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>On a slightly separate note, before the crew arrived for this block of shows, I looked at the range area here at the Lodge and realized I hadn&#8217;t changed anything there for probably nine hundred years. The same olive oil bottle, the same salt and pepper pots, the same lamp and utensil crock and weird almost-empty jar of peppercorns into which one of my boys had placed some peanuts (don&#8217;t ask) were there, staring at me and saying &#8220;Change me.&#8221; So I took everything off, put everything away, and we started over. I didn&#8217;t want it to look too &#8220;done&#8221; with big pots of fresh flowers and colorful vases. I just wanted it to look normal, and to have all the stuff there that I needed to cook so I wouldn&#8217;t have to walk two feet to the cabinets, because I&#8217;m lazy.</p>

Hyacinth loved getting to know Mike and Bev. </p>

Hi, Matthew! I knew you when you were nine.</p>

They were fine with it, until I remembered that I forgot to put food up there for them. </p>
<p>I remembered, because four teenagers were sitting at their seats, banging their forks on the counter. </p>

<p>He&#8217;s an old soul, that one. </p>
<p>No, really. I estimate his soul is about 82. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Okay, that&#8217;s all for now. We all had a really good time at the dinner&#8212;cameras and all&#8212;and everyone went home full and happy. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you more behind-the-scenes action tomorrow! I&#8217;m snapping pics all day today. </p>

<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="OMSH">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last summer a reader here pointed me toward Marie-Claire Camp&#8217;s Kickstarter campaign to develop a set of uniquely designed, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-abc-wallet-cards" title="Children's ABC Wallet Cards" target="_blank">wallet-size ABC cards</a> for children.  Though my own children are beyond the age for these cards, I backed the project anyway.  The project reached its goal with the help of 376 backers and I received the cards just in time to gift them to my cousin&#8217;s children for Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/001-alphabet-wallet-cards-off-the-ring.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/001-alphabet-wallet-cards-off-the-ring.jpg" alt="Alphabet Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12029 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>Vividly illustrated by Australian artist Marc Martin, the <a href="http://youguysaresoawesome.com" title="Children's Alphabet Cards" target="_blank">Children&#8217;s Alphabet cards</a> are as indestructible as they are educational.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/002-r-is-for-robot.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/002-r-is-for-robot.jpg" alt="R is for Robot" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12030 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/003-x-is-for-xray.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/003-x-is-for-xray.jpg" alt="X is for X-ray" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12031 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>It was exciting to watch the original project draw near its funding goal as each new backer placed their pledge.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg" alt="Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12032 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>And though I do not personally know Camp, I felt an attachment to the success of the campaign, which is why I wanted to let you know she has launched a second Kickstarter campaign with the hope of funding the development of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-wallet-cards-color-and-shape-numbers-go" title="Children's Wallet Cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet" target="_blank">four additional decks</a> of children&#8217;s cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &#038; Shape, and <em>My Wallet</em>.</p>
<p>Just as with the original Children&#8217;s ABC Deck, these cards will be extremely durable, <strong>BPA free, recyclable, and designed on FDA-approved, food-grade, non-toxic plastic.</strong> The ink will also be <strong>non-toxic, food-safe ink.</strong>  Each deck will be illustrated by a different artist.</p>

<p>My personal favorite is the <strong>Numbers</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/eugene-louise#image_354418" title="Eugene &amp; Louise" target="_blank">Eugene &#038; Louise</a>, a Belgium based creative studio founded by husband and wife, Glenn D&#8217;Hondt and Sylvia Meert.</p>

Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12034 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>GO!</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://heflinreps.com/illustrators/artist/jared-andrew-schorr" title="Jared Andrew Schorr" target="_blank">Jared Andrew Schorr</a>, shows images of people moving in exciting ways, (e.g. skateboarding, hang-gliding, and skiing). </p>

<p>London artist <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/nomoco/4582#image_458422" title="Nomoco" target="_blank">Nomoco</a> will create the artwork for the <strong>Color &#038; Shape</strong> cards.  Watercolor and ink illustrations will represent common colors and shapes.</p>

<p>The final <em>My Wallet</em> card set is a wallet that holds a license, a bank card, a children&#8217;s museum membership card and a library card.  Also included is play money printed on durable Tyvek.  A free iOS app, Digital Toys, will pair with each card&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Camp&#8217;s original inspiration came from her boys pulling apart her wallet and scoping out all her cards.  These four cards mimic what can be found in an adult wallet, but are durable and safe for child&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>If you participated in the original campaign, then you know how valuable these cards are for parents of young children.  They are available in 7 retail locations and are now <a href="http://youguysaresoawesome.com" title="Children's ABC Cards" target="_blank">available online</a> as well.  </p>
<p>When Camp raises the money she needs to Kickstart this ambitious campaign, there will be more than <strong>40 additional pieces of amazing original artwork</strong> from three separate artists to secure on the carabiner-style ring that houses the original collection.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/entertainment/files/2013/03/eagles.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/entertainment/files/2013/03/eagles.jpg" alt="eagles" width="1036" height="691" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2685 frame-img width_1036" /></a>I&#8217;m not sure what compelled him to do this, but Marlboro Man recently DVR&#8217;d a documentary about The Eagles that aired on Showtime. The other night, after we watched a couple of our regular TV shows, he turned it on and said &#8220;Let&#8217;s watch this.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t all that enthused, as it&#8217;s over three hours long and a documentary about a rock band didn&#8217;t hold much appeal to me that night. </p>
<p>It turned out to be one of the best things I&#8217;ve watched in a long, long time.</p>
<p>The documentary is &#8220;History of the Eagles,&#8221; and has been airing on Showtime. It takes you through the earliest days of Don Henley and Glenn Frey (did you know they played backup for Linda Ronstadt?) and chronicles, through home movies, concert footage, photos, and interviews, the evolution of The Eagles, from inception to fame to breakup to solo careers to reunion. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you everything that&#8217;s wonderful about it. It&#8217;s so rich in rock-and-roll history, and every song that began playing made me close my eyes and think &#8220;Ahhhh&#8230;&#8221; They gave me a peaceful, easy feeling. </p>
<p>(Sorry.)</p>
<p>Just a few things I learned:</p>
<p>* I can not choose between Don Henley and Glenn Frey. I love both their voices equally, and my favorite songs are a mix of Don and Glenn-led tunes.</p>
<p>* I love seventies rock. </p>
<p>* Honestly, when the documentary came to the point of the Eagles&#8217; breakup, I marveled that they lasted as long as they did. I don&#8217;t know how a band sustains that kind of pace and night-after-night energy. I think they should have just called it a break instead of a breakup, because that&#8217;s exactly what they deserved. They&#8217;d put in a lot of time.</p>
<p>* And no. None of it was wasted. (Get it?)</p>
<p>* I enjoyed and appreciated both Glenn Frey&#8217;s and Don Henley&#8217;s solo careers, but I prefer them as part of the group. Somehow they shine even brighter together.</p>
<p>* I love Joe Walsh. He&#8217;s so fun to watch. Whoa&#8230;the talent.</p>
<p>* I love Timothy B. Schmidt, who joined the Eagles in 1977. He has a great voice. And attitude. Such a kind spirit.</p>
<p>* I know his Eagles run didn&#8217;t end well, but Don Felder&#8217;s solos were amazing, and again&#8212;so fun to watch. d</p>
<p>* I hated watching the strife and arguments, but how could a band (containing so many creatively-driven people) be together that long without a couple of cracks forming? </p>
<p>* How many hit songs can one band have?</p>
<p>* Their songs take my back to my youth like few others.</p>
<p>* One of my favorite moments in the documentary was when Don Henley was remarking about all the speculation surrounding the &#8220;true meaning&#8221; of &#8220;Hotel California.&#8221; He said he&#8217;d always been confused about the wild theories because (I&#8217;m paraphrasing) Hotel California &#8220;&#8230;is about the transition from innocent to experience. Nothing more.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. I see that History of the Eagles is coming out on DVD April 30. I highly recommend it if you want to be taken back in time and experience the story of one of the greatest bands of all time. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more information:</p>

<p>And here are my favorite Eagles songs, in order. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>MY TOP NINE FAVORITE EAGLES SONGS OF ALL TIME</h6>
<p>1. <strong>Peaceful, Easy Feeling</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I like the way your sparkling earrings lay against your skin so brown&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Take it Easy</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford slowin&#8217; down to take a look at me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Tequila Sunrise</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He was just a hired hand, workin&#8217; on a dream he planned to try&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>4. <strong>Take it to the Limit</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;So put me on a highway, show me a sign&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Desperado</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It may be rainin&#8217;, but there&#8217;s a rainbow above you&#8230;you&#8217;d better let somebody love you before it&#8217;s too late&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Already Gone</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I heard some people talkin&#8217; just the other day&#8230;and they said you were gonna put me on a shelf&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>7. <strong>Lyin&#8217; Eyes</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;She drives on through the night anticipating&#8230;&#8217;cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>8.<strong> Wasted Time</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe someday we will find&#8230;that it wasn&#8217;t really wasted time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>9. <strong>Hotel California</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You can check out any time you&#8217;d like&#8230;but you can never leave&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Something had to give, so I found these large makeup organizers from The Container Store, and while I always thought lucite/acrylic was a thing of the eighties, I couldn&#8217;t pass up how handy all the different slots looked. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re turning out to be lifesavers, providing a place for everything from powder to hair clips. It cuts down on time because everything&#8217;s right in front of me, and it keeps me from saying &#8220;Ugh! Where is my beige iridescent LIPSTICK?!?&#8221; (Name that movie) every ten minutes.</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;ve actually added 1.3 years to my life. </p>

It holds all the pencils, brushes, and little tools&#8230;and holds quite a bit! </p>

<p>Here are the links for the two different organizers! The large one is a little pricey, but looks to be pretty darn durable and holds a ton of stuff. (Note: I have more than one in the photo above, but you really can cram a lot of items into one.)</p>

It&#8217;s a brand new week! The birds are chirping! The coffee&#8217;s brewing! Everything has such hope and promise! </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s why: <em>The utter horror&#8212;the abject hopelessness&#8212;of springing forward is finally behind us. </em></p>
<p>Man, was this year a toughie. I didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it there for a minute. The first part of last week, I felt like a combination of zombie, sloth, nitwit, dodo bird, and koala bear. I couldn&#8217;t think, move, think, function, or remember the Macarena. </p>
<p>But slowly, as the week went on, things slowly improved. By the weekend, it became clear to me that I was going to live. And to celebrate, yesterday I made a round of berry shortcakes for the everyone! It felt so good to be back.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love this shortcake recipe. I used a sweet version of the drop biscuits I made in last week&#8217;s <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/03/drop-biscuits-and-sausage-gravy/" target="_blank">Biscuit and Sausage Gravy</a> post, then I whipped up some syrupy berries and topped the whole thing with an unimaginably delectable sweet yogurt cream, which should come with a warning label, it&#8217;s so addictive. </p>
<p>Make this sometime this week, my friends! It&#8217;s a treat that&#8217;ll make you smile. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was going to add lemon zest to the biscuit dough, but I&#8217;ll have to do it next time. </p>

It won&#8217;t be stiff like regular whipped cream, but it&#8217;ll be thick and silky&#8230;and just wait till you taste it. </p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>BISCUITS</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Add flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt to the bowl of a food processor (or a large bowl.) Add butter pieces and pulse until butter is completely cut into the flour mixture (or use a pastry cutter if using a bowl.) Add almond extract to buttermilk. While pulsing (or stirring) drizzle in the buttermilk until dough just comes together and is no longer crumbly.</p>
<p>Drop in clumps on two baking sheets, then bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Set aside and allow to cool completely.</p>
<p>BERRIES</p>
<p>Wash berries (slice strawberries if using) and place into a bowl. Sprinkle on 1/3 cup sugar, then add orange zest and juice. Stir gently, then set aside for 15 to 20 minutes to allow syrup to develop. </p>
<p>CREAM</p>
<p>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip yogurt, cream, sugar, and brown sugar on high until stiff (note: It won't get quite as stiff as regular whipped cream.)</p>
<p>TO SERVE</p>
<p>To serve, lay one biscuit on a plate, top with syrupy fruit, then top with a good spoonful of cream.</p>

<h6>The following question is from Meriam B.</h6>
<p>&#8220;I recently purchased an iPad.  We have downloaded lots of educational apps, but I was wondering if there were any good productivity apps for homeschooling moms and teachers for grade recording, attendance records, lesson planning, etc.  I’d really like some ways to help me be a better, more organized teacher.</p>
