<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618424178/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8618424178_aa7e558ea0_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Building April 2" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>This is no small feat, as there&#8217;s a thick rock wall between them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618424466/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8124/8618424466_2bd145005d_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Building April 2" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>I spy the other side!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617316831/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8116/8617316831_eb3f80ffea_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Building April 2" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>Here&#8217;s a closer look.</p>
<p>Now. I&#8217;d better move before plaster falls on my head.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617317585/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8617317585_9f9f4de26c_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is the view from the other direction. In this space I&#8217;m standing, we&#8217;re going to do&#8230;well, the closest description I can give you is a deli. Not a restaurant, but a deli. A deli&#8230;<em>concept</em>. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s more than a deli! But it&#8217;s definitely not a restaurant! Makes perfect sense, right? </p>
<p>Ha. </p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ll explain it in more detail later. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;m excited about it because it involves food. It&#8217;s going to be a place where people can hang and eat food&#8230;or take food with them&#8230;or stay and play a round of laser tag. </p>
<p>(Just kidding on the laser tag part.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618426062/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8393/8618426062_8060111425_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then there&#8217;s the upstairs space, which is divided into two sides: The north side and the south side. This is the north side&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618426284/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8618426284_d1d6012206_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And it&#8217;ll be our office. Ranch office, P-Widdy Dub Diddy office, homeschool space for the kids, a place to meet in town that doesn&#8217;t involve someone having to travel five miles down a gravel road. Tim, Marlboro Man, my father-in-law, and I will share it. I&#8217;ll put fresh daisies in vases on their desks every day. </p>
<p>Or&#8230;not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617318365/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8385/8617318365_65dcec5c38_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is the wall directly above the wall they&#8217;re tearing down on the first floor. Originally, Marlboro Man and I had planned to open up this wall, too, so the two upstairs spaces would have the same opening. But now that we&#8217;ve thought about it, since the space on this side will be just an office, we don&#8217;t need a huge opening between the two spaces. So we&#8217;re leaving this wall as is. This makes me happy, because it&#8217;s the original exterior wall of the south building and still has an old advertising mural. </p>
<p>I had great angst about tearing it down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617319019/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8617319019_16dacd547c_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is the other side of the wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618426998/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8618426998_06162c645e_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>I love it up here&#8212;the south side, upstairs. We&#8217;re still deciding/refining how this space will be used, but I&#8217;ll keep you posted. </p>
<p>(Hint: It&#8217;s not a dance studio. I&#8217;d have to wear a leotard, which rules that out instantly.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618428010/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8255/8618428010_c4bb4fa80f_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Most of the floors in The Building are going to be able to be saved, but in this particular room, they&#8217;re warped and a little past the point of no return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618428224/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8618428224_f96b6dca90_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>I wonder what happened here? A bar fight? Rabid raccoons? Velociraptors? </p>
<p>Anytime I see a scratch on anything, I immediately think of Velociraptors. I saw Jurassic Park 93 times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618428414/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8618428414_0948a8ea57_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Speaking of not having a dance studio in the upstairs space: Name that ballet position!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617320649/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8113/8617320649_aecb2f3193_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Throughout the building, we&#8217;re having to decide where to strip away the old plaster and expose the original brick and where to patch and re-plaster. In most every room, there&#8217;s going to wind up being a mix of plaster and brick&#8230;depending, well, on the current condition of the plaster and the brick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617320469/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8381/8617320469_0edbb379df_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>We have most of the original trim: window trim, baseboards, etc. We&#8217;re taking good care of it and will put it back once everything else is done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618426782/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8618426782_ddf5be37da_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Building April 2" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>These window frames will go to Missouri soon, just after the next batch of windows comes back. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618429072/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8101/8618429072_86967d8899_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Meanwhile, back in the office space (Get it? Office Space? &#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t exactly say I&#8217;ve been missing it, Bob.&#8221;) This is where the bathrooms will go upstairs, and there&#8217;ll also be doors from the other side so they can be accessed from there. And the bathrooms downstairs will be directly below these&#8212;which, obviously, makes more sense from a plumbing perspective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617321079/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8617321079_01b202c62f_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>The floors in the office are, by and large, in great shape. We&#8217;ll just lightly sand and refinish these&#8212;gouges and all!</p>
<p>(This place was totally overrun with velociraptors before we got a hold of it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617321301/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8617321301_3c1028579b_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Downstairs, here are a bunch of the ceiling tiles from the north side. They&#8217;re all ready to be stripped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8617317407/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8617317407_ac33327c58_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Building April 2" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And downstairs in the south side, we&#8217;re hard at work on what will happen in there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8618429832/" title="Building April 2 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8618429832_0f5984a3cc_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Building April 2" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>Which takes us back to the wall at the end of that room: By the time we left yesterday, it was really starting to come down. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll drop by today and see how far they got. </p>

<p>Usually when I make potato skins, I go old school and top them with melted cheddar, diced bacon, sour cream, and chives. But there are so many variations on the theme. Pizza, for instance! Imagine the possibilities. I whipped up these very simple pepperoni pizza beauties, but you can take off running and do whatever pizza topping makes your skirt fly up. So many possiblities!</p>

When they&#8217;re dry, brush the whole surface of the potatoes with a little canola or olive oil.</p>

You want the potatoes to be nice and tender, and you want the skin to be a little on the crisp side. The baking time will be determined by the size of the &#8216;taters, so just give &#8216;em a squeeze after 30-35 minutes (with a towel in your hand, of course! ha.) and monitor them till they&#8217;re done.</p>

Nice and tender. Nice and (somewhat) crispy skin. So split them in half&#8230;</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll love these. So easy&#8230;so tasty. And considering the pizza topping possibilities that exist in this universe of ours, you could have a whole party based on pizza potato skin variations alone. Here are some other ideas:</p>
<p>Crumbled cooked Italian sausage<br />
Crumbled cooked hamburger<br />
Diced red, green, or yellow bell pepper<br />
Diced red onion<br />
Sliced black olives<br />
Sliced jalapenos<br />
Diced Canadian bacon<br />
Pineapple<br />
Sliced or diced mushrooms<br />
All different cheeses</p>
<p>Have fun with these!</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Scrub potatoes very clean.</p>
<p>Rub the surface of each potato with canola oil. Sprinkle with salt and bake until the potatoes are tender and the skins are crisp, about 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Cut the baked potatoes in half, then use a spoon to scoop out most of the insides, leaving a bit of a rim all around. Brush the inside and outside of each half with melted butter. Place the potatoes skin side up and return to the oven for 5 to 7 minutes. Turn them over (using tongs) and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes, or until the potatoes are crisp. Remove them from the oven and set them aside.</p>
<p>To assemble the skins, fill each skin with a spoonful of marinara or pizza sauce. Add a good amount of grated cheese and sprinkle on some diced pepperoni. Return them to the oven for just a couple of minutes, or until the cheese is melted. </p>
<p>Sprinkle with minced parsley and serve immediately!</p>

<p>You know what? I just had a revelation. Rather than do what I normally do when I&#8217;m faced with comparison photos such as these&#8212;which is cry, wail, weep, freak out, wig out, pass out, sob and stomp my feet over how quickly time is passing and how much my children have grown&#8212;I&#8217;m going to conduct a healthy exercise and instead smile, appreciate the fact that my children are older, wiser, and more learned now, and cherish the time I have left with them before they leave the house to move on with their adult lives. </p>
<p>Deep breath: In&#8230;out. </p>
<p>Ahhh. You know what? I actually feel better! </p>
<p>See, that wasn&#8217;t so bad. I&#8217;ve learned I don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to wail and cry when I look at old photos of my children. I&#8217;ve learned I don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to mourn the fact that they&#8217;re no longer babies. I&#8217;ve learned I don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to pitch a fit at the prospect of them growing up! </p>
<p>I feel so cleansed. I feel so healthy. I feel so whole!</p>

My younger daughter&#8217;s short little haircut. My little blond boy&#8217;s cherubic cheeks. And just look how teeny tiny my baby was. And my older daughter&#8230;just look at what a sweet little pookie love she was&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay. I&#8217;m now officially in a spiral. </p>
<p>So much for conducting healthy exercises!</p>

<em>By <a href="http://heathersanders.com" title="Heather Sanders">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Homeschooling conventions are a tremendous source of inspiration and encouragement, but if families are not prepared, they can also be an equal source of stress. As Henry Ford said, “Before everything else, getting ready is the secret to success.” The following 5 suggestions will help you successfully navigate your next homeschool convention.  </p>
<p><strong>1. Pre-Register to Save Money and Time</strong></p>
<p>Most homeschool conventions offer pre-registration. The convention we attend offers the best discounts for early-bird registration, but even after that deadline, pre-registration is available until about 6 weeks prior to the event.</p>
<p>Pre-registering is especially advantageous if the entire family wants to take part in all the activities offered. Because of the planning and staffing required to run the children’s and teen’s programs, conventions do not usually allow on-site registration for these programs on the date of the event.</p>
<p>Since the workshops are geared toward parents, and not all conventions allow children to be present in the adult workshops, the children’s and teen’s programs offer an entertaining, age-appropriate alternative.</p>
<p>An additional perk to early registration is avoiding long lines on the day of the event. Pre-registering gives you a fast pass into the event. Event coordinators and volunteers work diligently for days prior to the event to pull registration bags together, print name tags, string lanyards, sort t-shirts, and whatever else is required for those families they know will attend.  </p>
<p><strong>2. Reserve Hotel Rooms or Make Arrangements to Stay with Friends or Family</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the size of the homeschool convention that you attend, there may be significant discounts for convention attendees in nearby hotels. Even without convention discounts, hotels in the surrounding area will likely fill up fast. The earlier rooms are reserved, the better the rate. As the event nears the likelihood of finding a room in a nearby hotel, or one at a reasonable rate, will become few and far between.</p>
<p>If staying with friends or family, it is crucial to get the convention dates blocked-out on both family’s calendars, so no one is unpleasantly surprised when the date of the event arrives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Study the Event Schedule, Speakers, and Workshops</strong></p>
<p>The convention we attend is always the first weekend in August, and the basic schedule has been consistent every year we’ve attended.</p>
<p>As the date of the event draws nearer, the convention will release an extended schedule with details about every workshop and speaker, including the day, room and time they will speak. Once this is available, I print it out, and Jeff and I review it together, making decisions how we will tackle the convention.</p>
<p>There are many times we go to workshops or speakers together (especially the Keynote Speakers&#8217; break-out sessions), but other times we are interested in two different workshops going on at the same time, so we split up, taking notes for each other.</p>
<p>Though there have been times we changed our mind at the last minute, we like to go into the convention with a plan. Homeschooling conventions are crowded and hectic, having a tentative plan in hand brings a bit of order to the chaos.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don&#8217;t Enter the Exhibit Hall Without a Plan</strong>  </p>
<p>The exhibit hall is usually the most exciting and simultaneously daunting place in the entire convention. Our convention hosts literally hundreds of vendors with elaborate booths set up to display homeschool curricula and services.</p>
<p>I always recommend parents not to enter the exhibit hall without a plan, especially if this is their first year to homeschool.</p>
<p>Following the last week of each school year, the kids and I review what worked and what did not work for us in our homeschool. With their feedback, I make decisions about the upcoming year. I make a list of the things I will need, compare it against what I have boxed up in the attic, or what I can borrow from friends, and then I make a list of what needs to be purchased.</p>
<p>If I can purchase these items at a reasonable rate, free of shipping, before the convention, I do. However, I know that vendors at the convention offer discounts, as well as free shipping, so if I think I can get a better rate there, I will wait.</p>
<p>I enter the exhibit hall with a list of what I need, along with the comparable pricing. This makes it easy to decide whether or not I will purchase while at the convention.</p>
<p>In addition, if I have a wish list or I want to “see” something I have heard about, I’ll seek out that booth.</p>
<p>And finally, I bring a bit of extra cash if I believe I may be interested in any of the offerings from the workshops I plan to attend.</p>
<p>Last year I spent $98 at the convention; I purchased from only one vendor. However, I saw many things I was interested in purchasing, but knew I didn’t need.</p>
<p><strong>5. Look Up, Smile, Meet People, and Share!</strong> </p>
<p>Homeschooling conventions range in size. We attend the <a href="http://thsc.org/events/convention/" title="THSC Southwest Convention &amp; Family Conference" target="_blank">THSC Southwest Convention &#038; Family Conference</a>, and it is enormous. I make it a point to look up, smile, talk with people when I’m in line, meet people to the left and right of me when I’m sitting in a session, or ask people questions. This is one of the most fun parts of attending a homeschooling convention – being surrounded by tons and tons of like-minded parents. It is a tremendous experience!</p>
<p>I have never been snubbed at a homeschooling convention. No one has ever looked the other way and ignored me. Not surprisingly to most women who will read this, but some of the best conversations I’ve had have been in line for the bathroom.</p>
<p>Not sure how to start a conversation? Ask a parent about their kids. “How many children do you have?”, “What are their ages?”, “How long have you been homeschooling?” These are all engaging conversation starters, and who knows, you may find a new friend.</p>
<p>I like to take cards to pass out with my name, email and blog URL. If you are a homeschooling blogger, homeschooling conferences are ideal places to get to know someone online and off.</p>
<p><strong>One Last Thing&#8230;</strong><br />
I always take a clipboard with looseleaf notebook paper and a pen.  I know some people prefer spiral bound notebooks, but I&#8217;m a gal who loves a clipboard.  Whatever you do, make sure you have a hard surface for taking notes because most of the rooms provide row after row of chairs, but no tables, desks, or other hard surfaces to write on.</p>
<p>For those who are planning to traverse their very first convention, I’m extremely excited for you! For those who have attended for years, or are actively involved in planning their local convention, please feel free to offer your own sage advice in the comments.</p>

They love getting dressed up; have I ever told you this? They willingly go shopping for clothes when the need arises and nothing makes them happier than putting on a pair of pants and a nice shirt and looking all dapper.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 100% convinced this is the direct result of the fact that they live on a cattle ranch and have been coated in mud and manure for approximately 87% of their lives. </p>
<p>I put together Easter baskets for the kids because it&#8217;s a tradition, and if I suspend any of these traditions it means my kids are too old for those traditions, and from there it&#8217;s just a slippery slope until they&#8217;re grown and gone and cobwebs form in my hair. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I put in each basket:</p>
<p>* 1 small stuffed animal.<br />
* 1 pair of sunglasses, which I propped on the face of each small stuffed animal.<br />
* 1 OKC Thunder t-shirt. Because Thunder Up. That&#8217;s why.<br />
* 1 Cadbury Creme Egg<br />
* Minus 1 Cadbury Creme Egg, because I ate one of the eggs Saturday night and decided to be fair, I needed to remove the rest of the eggs. And hide them in my bedside table.<br />
* 1 pair of flip flops. Perfect for our gravel roads!<br />
* Lots of miscellaneous candy.<br />
* Minus some of the miscellaneous candy.</p>
<p>It was a Walmart kinda Easter!</p>
<p>Then we went to church and it was beautiful. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much I love about Easter.</p>

<p>Okay, just checking/</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8606899161/" title="Easter 2013 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8606899161_995b77b18f_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter 2013" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>So then, Missy, my mother-in-law, and Edna Mae (Marlboro Man&#8217;s grandmother) and I found ourselves sitting in the dining room and visiting about the old days. Edna Mae talked about the days when she used to have a wood burning stove, and she&#8217;d cook a huge breakfast and lunch every day for her husband and ranch workers, and after lunch was over she&#8217;d do the dishes with her two daughters, then she&#8217;d pass out from exhaustion while they went swimming in the water hole. </p>
<p>She also talked about the time before she was married when she and her best friend would saddle their horses and ride seven miles to town to the drugstore, where they&#8217;d spend all their money (probably twenty cents between them) on sodas because the soda jerk (that&#8217;s what they used to call people who made the soda drinks) was a really cute and nice fella. </p>
<p>Then they&#8217;d ride home seven miles, giggling and recounting all the conversation they&#8217;d just had with the cute and nice soda jerk. </p>
<p>Oh, how I love Edna Mae. This Saturday&#8217;s Food Network episode is all about her. It&#8217;s one of my favorites so far. </p>
<p>My mother-in-law talked about the old days, too&#8212;about her childhood in the country, about her propensity for finding quiet plots of pasture and lying down with her Border Collie and gazing at the sky, and about the early days of her marriage, when she hardly saw Marlboro Man&#8217;s dad because they didn&#8217;t have horse trailers back then and he&#8217;d have to sometimes leave at three in the morning to ride his horse to the place he needed to go, and he sometimes wouldn&#8217;t get home till nine at night. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>But it was about things like how Walmart was just Walmart back when we were kids. </p>
<p>Not Walmart Supercenter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Fortunately for her, she laughs all the time!</p>

<p>***********************************************</p>
<h6>The following question is from Holly J.</h6>
<p>&#8220;Hello!  My husband and I decided to start homeschooling our oldest son who is about to be 6.  He is currently attending a private Christian school that uses A Beka.  While we like the school, and have no problem with them per se, we feel that he is not challenged enough.  I should also add that my son is advanced, learning to read in just 2 months at age 4, and is a self-motivated learner.  Up until this point we have really only introduced subjects to him (math, science, the dinosaurs, etc…), and then let him loose with a book.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;m unsure how to know what level to start homeschooling him.  His teacher sends home reading assignments for a 2nd or 3rd grader, and his math is at a 1st grade level.  </p>
<h6>Do you have any suggestions for Holly regarding what grade/level to start homeschooling her son?</h6><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pioneerwoman-full-rss-feed/~4/rCXUu4GtNVQ" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

Once they make it back here, Terry&#8217;s crew is wrapping the woodwork in metal to make them ultra-durable. </p>

Most of the frame is wrapped in metal; the only thing they&#8217;re having to paint is the sash around the glass. </p>

There&#8217;ll be lots to do here: Windows, of course, but then we&#8217;ll remove the huge awning (it&#8217;s on its last leg), blast the green paint off the brick, and redo the fronts of the two spaces.</p>
<p>And take a nap every now and then.</p>

<em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer.">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent an entire morning and early afternoon catching up with my closest friend and confidante, Cindy. Together we serve on the board of our local homeschool cooperative, plan and attend field trips, scrutinize and select curriculum and discuss our daily homeschooling challenges. She is a certified teacher and a phenomenal listener, and I am certifiably annoying, and an avid talker, so we balance beautifully.</p>
<p>Outside of my family, she is probably my biggest fan, but recently confessed she does not actually read my posts, <em>&#8220;But I always look at the pictures&#8221;</em>, she emphatically proclaimed.  I quickly forgave her because I know that by the time I muster the words to post she has heard them at least a half-dozen times, tossed out in far too many theoretical arguments for her to have to read them again.  God bless her because yesterday&#8217;s conversation was no different. </p>
<p>After reading all the <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2013/03/how-do-you-handle-the-inherent-differences-in-the-way-your-children-learn/#comments" title="comments about homeschooling styles" target="_blank">comments</a> about homeschooling styles in <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2013/03/how-do-you-handle-the-inherent-differences-in-the-way-your-children-learn" title="How do you handle the inherent differences in the way your children learn?" target="_blank">last week&#8217;s post</a>, I want to talk about my favorite new brain drain, Unschooling, or rather, how, or if, parents should play a role in shaping what they teach, and their children learn.</p>
<p>I am in the process of working through my own thoughts regarding the whole Structured Homeschooling versus Unschooling conundrum.  I don&#8217;t think it is a black and white issue; it appears that, just as with homeschooling, there are all different shades of grey between the two.  </p>
<p>Here are the questions I&#8217;m knocking around in my head this week.  Feel free to respond to any one of them, or all of them, in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>1. Is structure necessary for the early elementary years?</strong></p>
<p>It was my experience that all three of my children loved having books read to them from an early age.  Jeff and I took turns reading their favorite stories over and over until they could recite them from memory while running their pudgy little fingers under the words across the page.</p>
<p>While I remember pointing out letter names and sounds, the basic 3-letter words seemed to progress naturally; however, when the kids advanced to sight words there was considerably more work involved for all of us.  I made up games and activities to help memorize the words, and soon we began stringing words together in sentences.  At times,  they were frustrated or bored, but then they would have what I call &#8220;break through moments&#8221;, when they would shine with pride at what they just achieved or understood.</p>
<p>The same thing was true with Math.  In the beginning, it was easy to show them that when they had one block, and added one more, then they had two blocks.  As the concepts built on each other, so have the challenges.</p>
<p>While I understand that the philosophy behind Unschooling is to set the stage for natural learning to thrive, I am not certain most kids would decide to memorize sight words in Kindergarten, or later on, to memorize their multiplication tables.  Perhaps Unschooled parents lean on some subjects more than others?  Most Unschooling families I am exposed to do not purchase a set curriculum.  Is the idea to surround one&#8217;s children with more interest led subject matter that points to reading, writing and math?  If there is not a set structure I am curious what learning looks like, and how parents can be certain the foundation is laid.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is testing necessary at any point?</strong>  </p>
<p>Until we joined our local homeschool cooperative, I never formally tested my children or applied grades on anything they learned.  I was fully aware of their level of learning as we worked together.  If I felt a concept was dropped, we reviewed back over it until it was clear.</p>
<p>In the back of my head,  I figured I would be forced to grade once they reached their high school years in order to build an honest transcript, and I left it at that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that is relevant to Unschooling, but it certainly is a radical off-shoot from the Structured Homeschooling approach.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that testing scared me&#8211;I just didn&#8217;t find it necessary.  Some people say that <a href="http://homeschooling.penelopetrunk.com/2013/03/25/what-test-scores-really-measure/" title="testing is just a means to stroke parent egos" target="_blank">testing is just a means to stroke parent egos,</a> as opposed to accessing true knowledge and understanding.  I schooled my children at home, and there was not a need to compare my children to others.  I simply focused on teaching them, and as they grew in maturity, I showed them how to find the resources they needed to learn on their own.</p>
<p>Now that my older daughter is finishing up her Sophomore year, we have an established transcript with grades.  With all the research about testing, it becomes more and more obvious that test grades are not necessarily the <em>Holy Grail</em> of true understanding or intelligence.  So, why do we test and keep grades?</p>
<p>I keep them out of fear of somehow limiting her potential future.  The world is changing, and Emelie is not at all interested in pursuing academia through a 4-year university, but I still keep those high school grades just in case.  Maybe mine will be the last generation that frets over their children&#8217;s test scores and transcripts.  </p>
<p><strong>3. If parents don&#8217;t set expectations for learning, will kids grow to respect and meet the expectations of others?</strong></p>
<p>Who we become as adults is directly affected by the family culture we grew up in.  I realize that there are exceptions to every rule, but for the most part, there are many things that carry through from one generation to the next.  Though our very nature is ingrained, there are aspects of how we are nurtured in our childhood that play out in how we relate to others in our adult life, specifically others who are in a position of authority over us.</p>
<p>If as parents,  we do not set expectations for learning for our children, and if they get to decide what they want to learn and when they want to learn it, is there a valid argument that says they will have difficulty meeting the expectations of future bosses?</p>
<p>On one hand,  I want to say that the freedom to choose one&#8217;s own learning path is unrelated to whether or not we will be able to submit to another&#8217;s expectations in the future.  Perhaps the single act of a parent respecting a child&#8217;s right to their own learning leaves the child emotionally stable enough not to cultivate a spirit of rebellion that would cause them to rebuff the expectations of a supervisor later on in life.</p>
<p>Then again, if we never require our children to meet any standard that they don&#8217;t set for themselves, will they become overly egocentric, believing the world revolves around them?  Do we inadvertently set them up for failure by freeing them from failure in the early years?</p>
<p>At this point,  it might be readily obvious why Cindy is such a good friend for me.  She lends an ear to all my mind&#8217;s inner ramblings, quietly taking them in and processing them as I toss more and more her way.</p>
<p>I know one thing, if I had been Unschooled, I would need a strong visionary to guide me out of the murky bog because I get fixated with all the details.  I used to believe Unschooling was taking the easy way out &#8211; I was wrong.  It is much easier to follow the old school rules of engagement. We have to ask ourselves whether or not those rules are the most effective approach for today&#8217;s world.</p>
<h6>Now it&#8217;s your turn.  How, or do you, shape what you teach your children?</h6>

<p>So logic would probably tell you not not to make it. </p>
<p>But I think you should go ahead and chance it! It&#8217;s that good. Slightly citrusy, nice and sweet, with a little hint of vanilla lusciousness. So simple to make, and you can use any fruit you want&#8212;melon chunks, orange pieces, apples, pears&#8230;the works. And it&#8217;s perfect not just for Easter brunch, but for baby or wedding showers, special lunches&#8230;or just a weekday that calls for a beautiful bowl of color.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make it, Maynard!</p>
<p>Sorry I called you Maynard again. </p>
<p>Next year I&#8217;ll give it up for Lent. Promise.</p>

<p>(Note: You can just add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract if you don&#8217;t have vanilla beans. Still delicious!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeandgarden/files/2013/03/skinnykick.png"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeandgarden/files/2013/03/skinnykick.png" alt="skinnykick" width="429" height="644" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6816 frame-img width_429" /></a>They&#8217;re <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp?productId=0434_7628_064&amp;catId=cat5710043&amp;bundleCatId=cat5730004" target="_blank">&#8220;Skinny Kick&#8221;</a> jeans from American Eagle, and I love them. They have a nice slim fit without being ridiculously tight and &#8220;skinny jean&#8221; skinny. (I burned out on skinny jeans months and months ago because they made me feel bad about myself. Ha.) These are more of a &#8220;real world&#8221; skinny jean with a little bit of an everyday style. (Please note: The model in this particular photo is probably six sizes smaller than me. But you can get a sense of the style of the jeans. The leg is slightly more flared at the bottom than this pic shows.)</p>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of Skinny Kicks.</p>
<h6>PROS</h6>
<p>* They have a nice stretch/give to them. </p>
<p>* They have a nice slightly flared leg without being crazy-flared or hippie looking. I can wear boots under the legs or I can wear flats. Both work. </p>
<p>* They&#8217;re somewhat slim through the hips and thighs but not tight.</p>
<p>* I love all three washes (the <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp?productId=0434_7629_968&amp;catId=cat5710043" target="_blank">antique</a> is my favorite, and it&#8217;s also the least expensive of the three.)</p>
<h6>CONS</h6>
<p>* They are just a leeeeeetle bit low-waisted. Definitely not in the crazy category of low-waisted&#8212;you know, the category that only .008% of the population can pull off. But if I&#8217;ve chowed down right before I wear them or haven&#8217;t done Pilates for a week, I always wish they had an extra inch or so. Still they&#8217;re not bad&#8212;I wear them all the time. I just have to stand up a little straighter when I wear them to keep the muffin top at bay.</p>
<p>* The dark blue wash (&#8220;Black Rock&#8221;) is so saturated, it does slightly rub off here and there. I only noticed it because when I first got a couple of pairs and wore them, I&#8217;d see a little bit of a dark blue hue to my fingertips. At first I thought I was dying. Then I realized it was the jeans. </p>
<p>Pros and cons weighed and analyzed, my verdict is that I love these jeans. I&#8217;ll keep wearing them for a long time!</p>

<p>Wait. That&#8217;s Christmas. </p>
<p>And Christmas isn&#8217;t coming. At least not for 272 more days. </p>
<p>Okay, now that I&#8217;ve both confused and depressed everyone: Here&#8217;s the recipe for the yummy glazed ham I made on my show last Saturday&#8212;the same ham I&#8217;ll be making this Sunday for Easter brunch. It&#8217;s totally easy, exceedingly delicious, and results in a purty and glossy ham that&#8217;ll make your guests say &#8220;Oooooooh!&#8221; with wide, expectant eyes and, hopefully, hearty appetites because this ham could feed an army.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I made it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591322923/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8105/8591322923_55e699da9a_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Get a big honkin&#8217; bone-in ham. Fully cooked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592423714/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8592423714_6d9f9f9d4d_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Use a really sharp knife to score a diamond pattern all over the surface of the ham: First cut lines in one direction&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323111/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8591323111_545c94c5aa_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then cut in the other direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323233/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8591323233_a563643731_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Grab a handful of cloves and poke them into the center of each diamond&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592424058/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8592424058_76bc7076f6_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And keep going until the whole surface is dotted. I do this for looks more than flavor: I just think it looks lovely and traditional when it&#8217;s all done baking. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591323473/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/8591323473_9ab98a4e30_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Cover the ham with foil, then put it into the oven to warm it up. I do 325 for at least 2 to 2 1/2 hours, but I&#8217;d say just look at the instructions on the package and follow those. Some hams say to go 3 to 4 hours, some at a lower temperature. The whole goal here is just to heat the ham slowly&#8230;and it takes awhile to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592424298/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8391/8592424298_bcabf9ea86_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>While the ham is in the oven, you can make the glaze: Throw 3 cups of brown sugar into a saucepan&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>You can use Coke. Heck, you could probably even use root beer. But please, for the love of all things good and caramelized, do not use diet pop. </p>
<p>(It&#8217;s the sugar we&#8217;re after here.)</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592425030/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8592425030_caa5579ab8_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>After the ham has cooked for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, brush the surface with some of the glaze. Then pop it back into the oven, uncovered, for another 20 minutes or so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592425240/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8372/8592425240_5101643d00_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Pull it out and brush on more glaze, then pop it back in the oven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592425364/" title="Easter Ham by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8592425364_8c887e220c_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Easter Ham" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then pull it out and brush on more glaze! Keep doing this until the ham is fully heated and the glaze is really gorgeous and glossy.</p>
<p><em>Note: On my Food Network episode last weekend, I only glazed it once because I had been at church and didn&#8217;t want to add too much more time before we ate. It was still totally delicious, but glazing the ham 2 or 3 (or 4) times really results in more of a masterpiece in terms of gorgeous surface. </em></p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>Preheat the oven to 325 F.</p>
<p>Score the surface of the ham in a diamond pattern about 1/8-inch deep. Place cloves in the middle of each diamond. Place the ham in a large roasting pan with a rack, tent it with foil, and bake for 2 to 2/12 hours---or longer, depending on the package directions. (Some hams may require 3 to 3 1/2 hours at a lower temp; just check the package.)</p>
<p>Heat the brown sugar, mustard, vinegar and soda in a small saucepan until bubbly. Cook until reduced and a bit thicker, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>After about 2 hours of baking time, remove the foil and brush the glaze on the ham in 20 minutes intervals (put the ham back in the oven, uncovered, in between) until it's nice and glossy. Remove from the oven and allow to rest 15-20 minutes before carving.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll stop shouting now!</p>
<p>Sheesh, Ree!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>Anyway, the guys will all be hightailing it back to England soon. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll miss the ol&#8217; chaps.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m going to be happy not to wear a mic for awhile. I&#8217;d like to go to the bathroom without unplugging first.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get stage fright.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to know any more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591490595/" title="DSC_1740 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8591490595_5b0c45c2cf_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="DSC_1740" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Yesterday I shot an entire show in one day, which is unusual. Typically, episodes take 1 1/2 to 2 days to shoot, but this one was basically shoot-as-it-happens. It was a freezer meal theme: I filled the freezer with lots of yummy food for busy days in my house, which is every day, and man, am I excited to have all this grub. </p>
<p>*Burp*</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591489763/" title="DSC_1730 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8591489763_58cf1e2f51_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="DSC_1730" class="width_427 frame-img" /></a>Here, Mike is rigging the freezer door so it won&#8217;t keep hitting me on the bottom as I stand and describe some of the things I&#8217;d stocked the freezer with. </p>
<p>It was getting a little embarrassing.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is a great freezer casserole. Really great flavor&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;One thing I like to do is store grilled chicken breasts in airtight bags&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This is one of my favorite freezer soups. To make it, you&#8230;&#8221;</em> <strong>WHAP!</strong> The door hit me on the bottom. </p>
<p>This is just another behind-the-scenes wrinkle you never think about when you watch cooking shows on TV: Freezer doors hitting the person on the bottom every time they try to talk. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those things no one ever talks about. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591490917/" title="DSC_1744 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8519/8591490917_f33c710eb7_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="DSC_1744" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>This is my precious firstborn son. He makes my heart leap. I&#8217;ve been making him and his brother come hang out in my dressing room so I can listen to them talk about football and accuse them of eating all my snacks. </p>
<p>Man, can they polish off some snacks. Like, whole packages. Gone. Poof. As if the snacks ever existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8592588600/" title="DSC_1648 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8592588600_b5b0983f9c_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="DSC_1648" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>I make Charlie come hang out in my dressing room, too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8591488379/" title="DSC_1646 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8525/8591488379_8074ca4102_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="DSC_1646" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>It&#8217;s nice to walk in there and get a nice whiff of hound funk anytime I need a little pick-me-up.</p>
<p>Really keeps me going. </p>
<p>Or&#8230;not.</p>
<p>Have a happy Tuesday, everyone! </p>
