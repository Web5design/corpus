<p>While the brunch on the show wasn&#8217;t on Easter Sunday (it was filmed in the wintertime!) all the food is very Easter Brunch-friendly.

<p>Happy Friday, friends.</p>

Sanders, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8153/7205105164_fb5e74a4bb_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="When have you felt most alive?" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a></p>
<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="Heather Sanders, Homeschooling blogger and writer">Heather Sanders</a></em></p>
<p>We homeschool 30 weeks a year, which means we know when we will begin the school year, and most importantly, when it will end. Our school year ends in exactly 6 weeks. I mentioned that bit of trivia to the kids today and received comments like &#8220;Six weeks! Summer takes forever to get here!&#8221; I have to say I completely agree. Spring Break was not long enough, and Summer feels light years away. Surprisingly, it is this time of year that makes me the strongest advocate for a structured homeschooling approach; without the structure I am not sure I could find the energy to finish.</p>
<p>For the sake of complete transparency, I debate regularly with a softer, counterintuitive voice in my head that says, &#8220;Yes, but if you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling" title="unschooling" target="_blank">unschooled</a>, you and the kids would be more personally invested and intrinsically energized while pursuing knowledge in each of your personal areas of interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, my louder voice says, &#8220;Riiiiiiight. If the kids were given the freedom to choose, they would still not know their <a href="http://www.omsh.com/homeschool-math-on-saturday-say-it-aint-so/" title="multiplication" target="_blank">multiplication</a> tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, back and forth this internal conversation plays out until I tire of the confusion and tune out. Am I the only one who deals with this sort of brain babble? It is apparently called &#8220;self talk&#8221; and if handled correctly, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/library/positive-thinking/SR00009.html" title="self talk can be a healthy habit" target="_blank">self talk can be a healthy habit.</a> My problem? My &#8220;self&#8221; won&#8217;t shut up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I try to relieve my inner ramblings by taking advantage of Jeff as a sounding board.  He&#8217;s a tremendous listener, but in the end I&#8217;m sure it is nothing short of torture for him.  He diligently asks questions that help focus my attention, I make a decision, and then a few hours later the battle rages in my head again.</p>
<p>That is why I stick with structure; for me, it is comfortable, safe, and sure.  As a person who <a href="https://type-coach.com/esfj" title="thrives on organization and detail" target="_blank">thrives on organization and detail,</a> I cannot imagine a school year that didn&#8217;t file neatly in a physical binder or digital archive, with each piece of paper or information neatly placed behind subject-specific, labeled dividers or within designated directories.</p>
<p>Thing is the kids&#8217; minds don&#8217;t work like mine, which means 1) either my structure is a gift that clears all the unnecessary clutter, ensuring them an unhindered path to their future, or 2) I&#8217;m an old school stumbling block that fails to recognize they need to clear their own path to approach their education in a way that best suits how their minds work.</p>
<p>It seems clear that homeschooling is the best, most natural, way for parents to recognize the inherent differences in how each of their children learn.  What is less clear is what exactly to do with this knowledge.</p>
<p>These are questions I ponder in this last six weeks of my 7th year of homeschooling, and as you can imagine, the battle rages on in my head.  I&#8217;m pretty certain I will need a healthy dose of sleeping in and poolside therapy to reach any logical conclusions.</p>
<h6>Where are you in this dichotomy of homeschooling styles?  What brought you to that place?</h6>

He&#8217;s often up on the counters getting closeups of the food as I cook, and he provides a steady stream of hilarious one-liners and plays on words, which I need to start writing down so that when I want to post about them, my mind won&#8217;t go blank as it is right now. </p>
<p>Matt is also married to Olivia, the director, whom I absolutely love. She is the calm and sweet yin to Matt&#8217;s mischievous and comedic yang, and I love being in the kitchen with the two English pookie lovebirds. </p>
<p>That said, I didn&#8217;t know they were married until the second time they came for a shoot. They keep it under wraps!</p>
<p>Get it? Wraps? </p>
<p>(I think all this TV terminology is getting to me.)</p>
<p>And speaking of wraps, doesn&#8217;t that word alone sum up all that is wrong with the English language?</p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To cover or enclose something. <em>I&#8217;m going to wrap my arms around Marlboro Man&#8217;s chiseled waist when I see him tonight.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; verb.</strong> To finish filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s it&#8212;time to wrap for the day! Time to go home and watch Real Housewives, Ree.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> The end of filming.<br />
<em>Okay, that&#8217;s a wrap! Time to go home and pick your toenails, Ree. </em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A loose outer garment.<br />
<em>Can I take your wrap to the coat room?</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A veil of secrecy.<br />
<em>Olivia and Matt keep their marriage under wraps while they&#8217;re working.</em></p>
<p><strong>Wrap &#8211; noun.</strong> A sandwich rolled inside a tortilla or flatbread.<br />
<em>Have you tried my chicken marshmallow chili veggie chocolate wrap?</em></p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started on <strong>rap</strong>.</p>
<p>Stop the madness!</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Housekeeping Matter: Monday I launched a couple of tweaks to my website, which turned out to have some incompatibilities with Internet Explorer. It should be fixed in just a bit; let me know later today if you&#8217;re still seeing wonky behavior. (From my website. Not from me.

<p>In other news, thank you for letting me take you along on my shooting experiences this week! It&#8217;s fun to continue to share what I&#8217;m doing with you, even if what I&#8217;m doing is a little wacky. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565932257/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8523/8565932257_447ae936c3_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is David, who has worked on the show almost since the beginning. In the photo above, he&#8217;s showing me a photo of his niece and her baby, whom he clearly adores. He, along with my good friend Tiffany (who&#8217;s nearly seven months pregnant right now, which is making me have all sorts of gestational thoughts) make sure all the food is in place for every recipe I cook on the show. It&#8217;s a huge job and requires a lot of coordination, especially considering we live in the country and can&#8217;t just run out and pick up something we don&#8217;t have. </p>
<p><em>Um&#8230;welcome to my daily life?</em></p>
<p>And David lives in New York City, which makes the contrast all the more stark for him. </p>
<p>David, it turns out, actually loves our small town and appreciates the time he gets to spend here. Last year, probably because he&#8217;s there every single morning of the shoot, David won ten dollars from our local grocery store as part of a fun promotion they were having that involved daily drawings for different cash prizes. Because he won, they took his picture and put it on the wall of winners in the store. </p>
<p>This was a highlight of David&#8217;s experience here. He still talks about it like it was a complete honor. </p>
<p>I love that guy.</p>

He&#8217;s snapping stills of some of the food I made yesterday. </p>

The cameras walked all over the building and got to get a lot of &#8220;before&#8221; shots. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797067/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8573797067_b7ddd3aba8_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>There was lots of miscellaneous cooking going on yesterday, including this&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573797279/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8573797279_5d95f73aac_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And this. </p>
<p>Oh, dear. </p>
<p>Just you wait, &#8216;enry &#8216;iggins!</p>
<p>Name that movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8574888726/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8523/8574888726_84ee9794b4_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then it was time to make brownies, so the director Olivia and I talked through the recipe beforehand and discussed the best way to proceed. </p>
<p>And this is something you might not know about cooking shows: It would be difficult to show up, tell the cameramen &#8220;I&#8217;m making brownies today, guys. Ready, set, go!&#8221; because they&#8217;d wind up with a lot of missed shots of the food and the process, and the end result wouldn&#8217;t be as visually appealing (or as complete). So we make sure to have the recipe broken up into logical pieces, and then we make sure the cameramen know which direction the ingredients are going to head, then Mike makes sure all the lights will bring out the natural beauty of the food, then I run powder my face for the four thousandth time because it&#8217;s already shiny again. </p>
<p>Then I grab a cracker and a Diet Dr Pepper. </p>
<p>Then I run to the ladies room. But I take my mic off first. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573795549/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8234/8573795549_b73e130656_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then it&#8217;s brownie time!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573796581/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8515/8573796581_f4b59e6b79_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Day Five" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>I get them baked and iced, then I snap a photo. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573796019/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8367/8573796019_2bb27563c0_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I go around to the other side of the counter and snap a photo. Doesn&#8217;t this kind of look like aliens kidnapped me? </p>
<p><em>Has anyone seen Ree for awhile?&#8230;</em></p>
<p>What you also can&#8217;t see in this photo is the inch-thick layer of powdered sugar on the floor underneath my work station. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s there because&#8212;well, because I&#8217;m messy, but also because when I&#8217;m addressing the camera and cooking or baking something, I can&#8217;t always hunker over and contort my body to get ingredients to go into vessels without also falling all over the floor. Pay attention next time you cook something by yourself: You might find yourself leaning over, wrapping your arm around your mixer so as to get the powdered sugar to drop in without going everywhere, making weird faces as you concentrate on chopping, etc. Now imagine a camera is there, and you need to somewhat clearly narrate every step you&#8217;re doing, and not look like a complete dodo bird while you do it. </p>
<p>Makes you want to stand up a little straighter and remember not to scratch your armpit, I&#8217;ll tell you that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8574889828/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8377/8574889828_5aac0d9a1b_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="Day Five" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>Before I could get a chance, David came along and de-powdered sugared the floor. Thank you, David!</p>
<p>My shoes were starting to make sticky sounds when I walked. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m super neat that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573794107/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8573794107_cbbd4fb78f_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Not that this guy minds. What David doesn&#8217;t whisk away, Charlie can always count as a mid-afternoon snack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8573794463/" title="Day Five by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8573794463_e75fb8dde7_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Day Five" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>It goes without saying that I highly recommend having a Basset Hound nearby if you ever find yourself shooting a cooking show. They&#8217;re a more powerful cleaning tool than any Swifter in the universe. </p>
<p>(Unless you count all the grass they bring in from outside. But that&#8217;s just a technicality.)</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had friends over to The Lodge for dinner Saturday night: Hyacinth and her family (our friends for many years), Steve and Sheila (our friends for many years), and Steve&#8217;s brother Mike and his family, who just moved to our small town last year. Mike and Steve actually grew up here, and Steve has lived here since he finished college. Mike and his wife Bev recently decided to move back to Pawhuska after Mike and Steve&#8217;s dad passed away, and while Mike and Steve and their families go to our church, Marlboro Man and I have been wanting to have them all out for dinner for awhile. </p>
<p>Did that make any sense at all? I sure know how to give a thorough explanation, don&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>Or not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8570818267/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8368/8570818267_a44042732a_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>It just so happened that we had them over for dinner while the TV crew was here. </p>
<p>Before I had the experience of being on a television show, I would have thought a scene like the one above&#8212;one that involves socializing and visiting with friends while cameras are watching&#8212;would feel strange and unnatural. But in fact, it becomes really easy to just forget they&#8217;re there. This is largely due to the crew itself; they&#8217;re quiet and pretty unobtrusive. But also, it helps when the events they&#8217;re chronicling are real life events, as Saturday evening&#8217;s dinner was. We were so excited to finally have Mike and Bev (and their son Marshall) over to the house, our conversation with them overrode any awareness of cameras being pointed up our nostrils.</p>
<p>At one point, our director Olivia quietly said, &#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re ready, you guys can head to the table and tuck in.&#8221; Tuck in, in England, means to dig in and start eating.</p>
<p>I noticed out of the corner of my eye that our guest Mike was looking down at his shirt and tucking it in a bit. </p>
<p>I got a chuckle out of that one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571912780/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8571912780_2e96315214_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And it&#8217;s not just me being used to cameras because I&#8217;ve been doing it for awhile. Our guests were there just five minutes before they were mingling and enjoying the conversation, hardly glancing in the direction of the cameras at all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571909888/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8388/8571909888_2cd3b00cec_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>On a slightly separate note, before the crew arrived for this block of shows, I looked at the range area here at the Lodge and realized I hadn&#8217;t changed anything there for probably nine hundred years. The same olive oil bottle, the same salt and pepper pots, the same lamp and utensil crock and weird almost-empty jar of peppercorns into which one of my boys had placed some peanuts (don&#8217;t ask) were there, staring at me and saying &#8220;Change me.&#8221; So I took everything off, put everything away, and we started over. I didn&#8217;t want it to look too &#8220;done&#8221; with big pots of fresh flowers and colorful vases. I just wanted it to look normal, and to have all the stuff there that I needed to cook so I wouldn&#8217;t have to walk two feet to the cabinets, because I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8570817761/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8239/8570817761_82e7dc5d88_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Dinner was nice. Hyacinth loved getting to know Mike and Bev. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571912268/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8571912268_96abb62942_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Hy&#8217;s almost-college-graduate was home from school, so he came along too. Hi, Matthew! I knew you when you were nine.</p>

They were fine with it, until I remembered that I forgot to put food up there for them. </p>
<p>I remembered, because four teenagers were sitting at their seats, banging their forks on the counter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8571910402/" title="Friends by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8571910402_f5a7fff713_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Friends" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>My baby was excited to get to sit with the adults. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s an old soul, that one. </p>
<p>No, really. I estimate his soul is about 82. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Okay, that&#8217;s all for now. We all had a really good time at the dinner&#8212;cameras and all&#8212;and everyone went home full and happy. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you more behind-the-scenes action tomorrow! I&#8217;m snapping pics all day today. </p>

<p><em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="OMSH">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Last summer a reader here pointed me toward Marie-Claire Camp&#8217;s Kickstarter campaign to develop a set of uniquely designed, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-abc-wallet-cards" title="Children's ABC Wallet Cards" target="_blank">wallet-size ABC cards</a> for children.  Though my own children are beyond the age for these cards, I backed the project anyway.  The project reached its goal with the help of 376 backers and I received the cards just in time to gift them to my cousin&#8217;s children for Christmas.</p>

<p>It was exciting to watch the original project draw near its funding goal as each new backer placed their pledge.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/004-numbers-go-colorshape.jpg" alt="Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12032 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>And though I do not personally know Camp, I felt an attachment to the success of the campaign, which is why I wanted to let you know she has launched a second Kickstarter campaign with the hope of funding the development of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/482898835/childrens-wallet-cards-color-and-shape-numbers-go" title="Children's Wallet Cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &amp; Shape, My Wallet" target="_blank">four additional decks</a> of children&#8217;s cards: Numbers, GO!, Color &#038; Shape, and <em>My Wallet</em>.</p>
<p>Just as with the original Children&#8217;s ABC Deck, these cards will be extremely durable, <strong>BPA free, recyclable, and designed on FDA-approved, food-grade, non-toxic plastic.</strong> The ink will also be <strong>non-toxic, food-safe ink.</strong>  Each deck will be illustrated by a different artist.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/005-number-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/005-number-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="Number Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12033 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>My personal favorite is the <strong>Numbers</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/eugene-louise#image_354418" title="Eugene &amp; Louise" target="_blank">Eugene &#038; Louise</a>, a Belgium based creative studio founded by husband and wife, Glenn D&#8217;Hondt and Sylvia Meert.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/006-go-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/006-go-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="GO! Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12034 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>GO!</strong> deck, illustrated by <a href="http://heflinreps.com/illustrators/artist/jared-andrew-schorr" title="Jared Andrew Schorr" target="_blank">Jared Andrew Schorr</a>, shows images of people moving in exciting ways, (e.g. skateboarding, hang-gliding, and skiing). </p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/007-color-and-shape-wallet-cards.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/007-color-and-shape-wallet-cards.jpg" alt="Color &amp; Shape Wallet Cards" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12035 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>London artist <a href="http://www.ba-reps.com/artists/nomoco/4582#image_458422" title="Nomoco" target="_blank">Nomoco</a> will create the artwork for the <strong>Color &#038; Shape</strong> cards.  Watercolor and ink illustrations will represent common colors and shapes.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/008-my-wallet-card-set.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/files/2013/03/008-my-wallet-card-set.jpg" alt="My Wallet Card Set" width="630" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12036 frame-img width_630" /></a></p>
<p>The final <em>My Wallet</em> card set is a wallet that holds a license, a bank card, a children&#8217;s museum membership card and a library card.  Also included is play money printed on durable Tyvek.  A free iOS app, Digital Toys, will pair with each card&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Camp&#8217;s original inspiration came from her boys pulling apart her wallet and scoping out all her cards.  These four cards mimic what can be found in an adult wallet, but are durable and safe for child&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>If you participated in the original campaign, then you know how valuable these cards are for parents of young children.  They are available in 7 retail locations and are now <a href="http://youguysaresoawesome.com" title="Children's ABC Cards" target="_blank">available online</a> as well.  </p>
<p>When Camp raises the money she needs to Kickstart this ambitious campaign, there will be more than <strong>40 additional pieces of amazing original artwork</strong> from three separate artists to secure on the carabiner-style ring that houses the original collection.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/entertainment/files/2013/03/eagles.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/entertainment/files/2013/03/eagles.jpg" alt="eagles" width="1036" height="691" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2685 frame-img width_1036" /></a>I&#8217;m not sure what compelled him to do this, but Marlboro Man recently DVR&#8217;d a documentary about The Eagles that aired on Showtime. The other night, after we watched a couple of our regular TV shows, he turned it on and said &#8220;Let&#8217;s watch this.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t all that enthused, as it&#8217;s over three hours long and a documentary about a rock band didn&#8217;t hold much appeal to me that night. </p>
<p>It turned out to be one of the best things I&#8217;ve watched in a long, long time.</p>
<p>The documentary is &#8220;History of the Eagles,&#8221; and has been airing on Showtime. It takes you through the earliest days of Don Henley and Glenn Frey (did you know they played backup for Linda Ronstadt?) and chronicles, through home movies, concert footage, photos, and interviews, the evolution of The Eagles, from inception to fame to breakup to solo careers to reunion. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even begin to tell you everything that&#8217;s wonderful about it. It&#8217;s so rich in rock-and-roll history, and every song that began playing made me close my eyes and think &#8220;Ahhhh&#8230;&#8221; They gave me a peaceful, easy feeling. </p>
<p>(Sorry.)</p>
<p>Just a few things I learned:</p>
<p>* I can not choose between Don Henley and Glenn Frey. I love both their voices equally, and my favorite songs are a mix of Don and Glenn-led tunes.</p>
<p>* I love seventies rock. </p>
<p>* Honestly, when the documentary came to the point of the Eagles&#8217; breakup, I marveled that they lasted as long as they did. I don&#8217;t know how a band sustains that kind of pace and night-after-night energy. I think they should have just called it a break instead of a breakup, because that&#8217;s exactly what they deserved. They&#8217;d put in a lot of time.</p>
<p>* And no. None of it was wasted. (Get it?)</p>
<p>* I enjoyed and appreciated both Glenn Frey&#8217;s and Don Henley&#8217;s solo careers, but I prefer them as part of the group. Somehow they shine even brighter together.</p>
<p>* I love Joe Walsh. He&#8217;s so fun to watch. Whoa&#8230;the talent.</p>
<p>* I love Timothy B. Schmidt, who joined the Eagles in 1977. He has a great voice. And attitude. Such a kind spirit.</p>
<p>* I know his Eagles run didn&#8217;t end well, but Don Felder&#8217;s solos were amazing, and again&#8212;so fun to watch. d</p>
<p>* I hated watching the strife and arguments, but how could a band (containing so many creatively-driven people) be together that long without a couple of cracks forming? </p>
<p>* How many hit songs can one band have?</p>
<p>* Their songs take my back to my youth like few others.</p>
<p>* One of my favorite moments in the documentary was when Don Henley was remarking about all the speculation surrounding the &#8220;true meaning&#8221; of &#8220;Hotel California.&#8221; He said he&#8217;d always been confused about the wild theories because (I&#8217;m paraphrasing) Hotel California &#8220;&#8230;is about the transition from innocent to experience. Nothing more.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now. I see that History of the Eagles is coming out on DVD April 30. I highly recommend it if you want to be taken back in time and experience the story of one of the greatest bands of all time. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more information:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sho.com/sho/reality-docs/titles/3374103/history-of-the-eagles---part-one" target="_blank">History of the Eagles</a></p>
<p>And here are my favorite Eagles songs, in order. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>MY TOP NINE FAVORITE EAGLES SONGS OF ALL TIME</h6>
<p>1. <strong>Peaceful, Easy Feeling</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I like the way your sparkling earrings lay against your skin so brown&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>2. <strong>Take it Easy</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford slowin&#8217; down to take a look at me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Tequila Sunrise</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He was just a hired hand, workin&#8217; on a dream he planned to try&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>4. <strong>Take it to the Limit</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;So put me on a highway, show me a sign&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Desperado</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It may be rainin&#8217;, but there&#8217;s a rainbow above you&#8230;you&#8217;d better let somebody love you before it&#8217;s too late&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Already Gone</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I heard some people talkin&#8217; just the other day&#8230;and they said you were gonna put me on a shelf&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>7. <strong>Lyin&#8217; Eyes</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;She drives on through the night anticipating&#8230;&#8217;cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>8.<strong> Wasted Time</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe someday we will find&#8230;that it wasn&#8217;t really wasted time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>9. <strong>Hotel California</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;You can check out any time you&#8217;d like&#8230;but you can never leave&#8230;&#8221;</p>

Something had to give, so I found these large makeup organizers from The Container Store, and while I always thought lucite/acrylic was a thing of the eighties, I couldn&#8217;t pass up how handy all the different slots looked. </p>
<p>They&#8217;re turning out to be lifesavers, providing a place for everything from powder to hair clips. It cuts down on time because everything&#8217;s right in front of me, and it keeps me from saying &#8220;Ugh! Where is my beige iridescent LIPSTICK?!?&#8221; (Name that movie) every ten minutes.</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;ve actually added 1.3 years to my life. </p>

It holds all the pencils, brushes, and little tools&#8230;and holds quite a bit! </p>

<p>Here are the links for the two different organizers! The large one is a little pricey, but looks to be pretty darn durable and holds a ton of stuff. (Note: I have more than one in the photo above, but you really can cram a lot of items into one.)</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re shooting more episodes of our Food Network show right now, and we&#8217;re taking the cameras along on everything from bottle feeding the calves (slurp!) to walking through <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeandgarden/category/the-building/" target="_blank">The Building</a> project to a dinner with our friends from church to a picnic on the back of a pickup after the guys work calves. This block of shooting is less than two weeks long, but just happened to fall during Lent, Daylight Savings Time, and the busiest soccer schedule mankind has ever seen. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad my Lenten sacrifice was not coffee. </p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m going to be shooting the rest of this week, I decided that it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense for me not to blog about my experiences during the time the TV crew is here. I&#8217;m a blogger, after all. I must blog. Blog I must! </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8567023832/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8567023832_c2215dbf57_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_532 frame-img" /></a>This is Matt, one of the two cameramen in the kitchen. (There&#8217;s a separate cameraman that captures all the scenes out on the ranch and beyond.) Here, Matt&#8217;s shooting from above so he can capture action in the flour container, mixing bowl, etc.</p>

Both Matt and Luke are capable and professional, and are really nice to be around, which is convenient considering we&#8217;re together in the kitchen many hours a day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

This means my voice is in his ear for hours at a time, and I have to make sure not to belch or clear my throat in any offensive way or accidentally start humming or singing Rihanna songs, which don&#8217;t really sound very much like Rihanna songs when I hum or sing them. </p>
<p>That would be embarrassing. </p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s really nice. Very polite and considerate. His mama raised him right. </p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565933389/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8565933389_cda34a5d30_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>This is Mike, and he handles the lighting, which is a living breathing thing depending on where I am in the kitchen, what time of day it is, what the Oklahoma weather is doing outside at that particular moment, and whether it&#8217;s Daylight Savings Time or not. He even adjusts the light inside the oven so the food I&#8217;m putting in there can be clearly seen and won&#8217;t be tinged a strange color by the oven light. </p>
<p>Matt, Luke, Martin, and Mike are all from England. They&#8217;ve been here for several of the shoots we&#8217;ve done, and it&#8217;s nice to have familiar faces behind the cameras/equipment each time. It helps my nerves not flair up as violently and makes for a smoother shoot. And because they&#8217;re British, I&#8217;m forever picking their brains about British words and phrases that are different from American words and phrases, and what British people think of all the British movies I&#8217;ve known and loved throughout my life, and whether they&#8217;ve ever heard of Hee Haw. </p>
<p>I miss Hee Haw. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a British word for you: <em>Waistcoat</em>. Do you know what a waistcoat is? It&#8217;s a vest. </p>
<p>And do you know what a vest is to a person from England? An undershirt. </p>
<p>And another one: <em>Boot.</em> Do you know what a boot is to a person from England? A trunk. A trunk of a car. I don&#8217;t need to tell you the confusion that ensued when I&#8217;d hear them people say their camera was in the boot.</p>
<p>A <em>jumper</em>, to a person from England, is a sweater. </p>
<p>And guess what a <em>diner</em> is to someone from England? One who dines. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a world gone mad!</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565935131/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8565935131_c23821824b_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And now I&#8217;ll tell you about the marmalade contest. Late Friday afternoon, I was getting ready to head home and watch Life of Pi with Marlboro Man and the kids (Wow. Have you seen it?) when our producer Rachel asked me if I&#8217;d do a quick blind taste test before I left. </p>
<p>Luke and Mike, you see, are serious marmalade craftsmen and they both brought batches of their own stash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565934733/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8514/8565934733_188b8c620e_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>So I said yes, of course, I&#8217;ll take any opportunity to eat another bite of anything. Except bananas. I was immediately blindfolded and given two spoons, each with a tiny dollop of marmalade on the end.</p>
<p>So took the first bite of marmalade. And I smacked my chops and thought long and hard about what I was tasting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565933715/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8565933715_4ff45bbc70_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then Matt the cameraman began blasting &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221; from across the room and I began singing along. As you can see, in this photo my mouth is in the shape of the word <strong>&#8220;EYE!!!!!!&#8221;</strong> It was at this point that most of the people in the room backed away slowly and left. Fortunately, I didn&#8217;t have my mic on and Martin didn&#8217;t have his earphones on. It might have put him in the hospital. </p>
<p>After more smacking of my chops and consideration, I was forced to announce a preference, which I did not want to do because I&#8217;m a mother and I felt like I was choosing between two of my children&#8217;s art projects. So I spent thirty minutes qualifying my decision and explaining that it was all really difficult, and I really didn&#8217;t want to make a choice, and it was all really difficult, and both marmalades were delicious in their own way, and it was all very difficult, and it could have gone either way. </p>
<p>And it could have!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

Both men were very gracious, and this was only the first round. The contest will continue all this week, with different judges giving their impressions from the blind testing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep you posted on Marmalade Madness 2013!</p>

This was a trial run, and it turned out beautifully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8567026412/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8567026412_8ea62beb3d_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I made it again the next day when our friends from church were coming over for dinner. Only this time I made it with feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565931941/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8513/8565931941_5249d7b837_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_532 frame-img" /></a>In hindsight, one layer really would have been sufficient. </p>
<p>Heck, two layers would have been sufficient. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8567029096/" title="Marmalade Contest by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8567029096_108704360d_c.jpg" width="532" height="800" alt="Marmalade Contest" class="width_532 frame-img" /></a>Even three layers would have been enough! But I was bound and determined to keep going. The four-layer version had worked and the crew had devoured it right away, so when I made this one on camera&#8230;at a much slower pace&#8230;<em>under the hot lights Mike had expertly rigged around the kitchen</em>&#8230;I assumed it would turn out the same. So I kept going&#8230;</p>
<p>And it turned out great! So I stuck it in the fridge to keep it safe and sound until we needed to shoot it again later in the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>Ha. </p>
<p>Ha ha. </p>
<p>Ha ha ha. </p>
<p>Har.</p>
<p>One has to laugh.</p>

<p>More scenes from the shoot to come! </p>
<p>Happy Monday, friends. I hope you&#8217;ve recovered from the whole Daylight Savings Time craziness!</p>

It&#8217;s a brand new week! The birds are chirping! The coffee&#8217;s brewing! Everything has such hope and promise! </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s why: <em>The utter horror&#8212;the abject hopelessness&#8212;of springing forward is finally behind us. </em></p>
<p>Man, was this year a toughie. I didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it there for a minute. The first part of last week, I felt like a combination of zombie, sloth, nitwit, dodo bird, and koala bear. I couldn&#8217;t think, move, think, function, or remember the Macarena. </p>
<p>But slowly, as the week went on, things slowly improved. By the weekend, it became clear to me that I was going to live. And to celebrate, yesterday I made a round of berry shortcakes for the everyone! It felt so good to be back.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll love this shortcake recipe. I used a sweet version of the drop biscuits I made in last week&#8217;s <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/03/drop-biscuits-and-sausage-gravy/" target="_blank">Biscuit and Sausage Gravy</a> post, then I whipped up some syrupy berries and topped the whole thing with an unimaginably delectable sweet yogurt cream, which should come with a warning label, it&#8217;s so addictive. </p>
<p>Make this sometime this week, my friends! It&#8217;s a treat that&#8217;ll make you smile. </p>

<h6>BISCUITS</h6>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566939222/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8566939222_aa3b5102e6_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>To make the biscuits, add flour to the bowl of a food processor (or just throw it violently into a bowl if you want to make the biscuits by hand.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566939540/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8097/8566939540_ebf0406460_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Add some baking powder&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565843297/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8532/8565843297_9f1ef7f4d6_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Sugar, because I want the biscuits to be a little on the sweet side. </p>
<p>But just a little.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566940042/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8566940042_47a65f5cca_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>And a leetle bit of salt. </p>
<p>But just a leetle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566941196/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8372/8566941196_8fa5243df6_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then just pulse the dry ingredients a couple of times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566941480/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8566941480_1407286aba_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Add a stick-and-a-half of really cold butter cut into pieces&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566941782/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8371/8566941782_4a36743545_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then do 25 to 30 really short pulses to work the butter into the dry ingredients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566940908/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8235/8566940908_48925a5d32_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Measure the buttermilk, then stir in a little bit of almond extract. This is entirely optional and does give the biscuits a hint of almond flavor, which I love. But you could leave it out (or substitute vanilla) if you prefer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565845533/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8513/8565845533_7cb7847da6_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Slowly drizzle the mixture into the food processor, pulsing the whole time&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8565845843/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8386/8565845843_d851c1fe5f_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Until it all comes together in a clump.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566942864/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8507/8566942864_c68476c7f0_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Use two spoons to drop small piles of dough onto a baking sheet, then bake &#8216;em for 15 minutes or so, until they&#8217;re just light and golden brown.</p>
<p>Then take &#8216;em out of the oven and let &#8216;em cool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>BERRIES</h6>

I used blackberries&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8566945200/" title="Berry Shortcake by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8243/8566945200_2fdcda7efc_o.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Berry Shortcake" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I zested a Cute/clementine, because I didn&#8217;t have any oranges or lemons! And there&#8217;s nothing worse! Than needing a lemon! And not having one! </p>
<p>I was going to add lemon zest to the biscuit dough, but I&#8217;ll have to do it next time. </p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>BISCUITS</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Add flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt to the bowl of a food processor (or a large bowl.) Add butter pieces and pulse until butter is completely cut into the flour mixture (or use a pastry cutter if using a bowl.) Add almond extract to buttermilk. While pulsing (or stirring) drizzle in the buttermilk until dough just comes together and is no longer crumbly.</p>
<p>Drop in clumps on two baking sheets, then bake for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Set aside and allow to cool completely.</p>
<p>BERRIES</p>
<p>Wash berries (slice strawberries if using) and place into a bowl. Sprinkle on 1/3 cup sugar, then add orange zest and juice. Stir gently, then set aside for 15 to 20 minutes to allow syrup to develop. </p>
<p>CREAM</p>
<p>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip yogurt, cream, sugar, and brown sugar on high until stiff (note: It won't get quite as stiff as regular whipped cream.)</p>
<p>TO SERVE</p>
<p>To serve, lay one biscuit on a plate, top with syrupy fruit, then top with a good spoonful of cream.</p>

<h6>The following question is from Meriam B.</h6>
<p>&#8220;I recently purchased an iPad.  We have downloaded lots of educational apps, but I was wondering if there were any good productivity apps for homeschooling moms and teachers for grade recording, attendance records, lesson planning, etc.  I’d really like some ways to help me be a better, more organized teacher.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1. <strong>Good morning!</strong> </p>
<p>I love you. Here&#8217;s a cake. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8558544839/" title="DSC_1081 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8558544839_2e205d52e1_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="DSC_1081" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>It&#8217;s low-calorie. </p>
<p>On Opposite Day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. <strong>I began shooting more Food Network shows here on the ranch yesterday.</strong> </p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be finished in two weeks. </p>
<p>That I scheduled the shoot to begin the week of Daylight Savings Time is going to turn out to be one of the most puzzling decisions of my life. </p>
<p>Springing Forward is of the devil. </p>
<p>Springing Forward is dead to me.</p>
<p>Springing Forward does not bring me inner peace.</p>
<p>Have you been as much of a zombie as I have this week? </p>
<p>(The sleepy kind. Not the brain-eating kind.)</p>
<p>(Sorry.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. <strong>The crew that films the show is very nice. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8558544999/" title="DSC_1084 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8110/8558544999_7619c0b3a8_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="DSC_1084" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>They&#8217;re from London, so it&#8217;s an interesting mix of cultures. </p>
<p>And accents. </p>
<p>And marmalade!</p>
<p>They take their marmalade very seriously. I&#8217;ll tell you about it later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8558545143/" title="DSC_1088 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8390/8558545143_0b12649a15_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="DSC_1088" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>They sometimes organize little pools for football (soccer) games in the UK. We did it last time, too, and I think I came in dead last. I&#8217;m not familiar with the rules of football and I was guessing scores like &#8220;50&#8243; and &#8220;94&#8243; and &#8220;71&#8243; when usually, the scores don&#8217;t go higher than 4 or 5. </p>
<p>I felt not cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
9. B<strong>e sure to make these sandwiches this weekend.</strong> I made them after our homeschool co-op on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8553813628/" title="Mini Hot Ham Sandwiches by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8553813628_048bbd547b_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Mini Hot Ham Sandwiches" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Then I posted them on <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2013/03/hot-roast-beef-sandwiches/" target="_blank">The Pioneer Woman Cooks</a> on Wednesday morning. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s how my cooking posts work. In the history of my website, I&#8217;ve never had a stockpile of cooking posts ready to go. I&#8217;ve never had a stash. I&#8217;ve never had a bunch of drafts ready to publish. I cook it, then I post it, usually within twelve hours.</p>
<p>But I suppose that&#8217;s the nature of blogging. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
76. <strong>I hate Daylight Savings Time.</strong></p>
<p>Sorry I said hate. </p>
<p>Next time I&#8217;ll say &#8220;don&#8217;t care for,&#8221; which is what Ga-Ga always taught me to say instead of saying &#8220;hate.&#8221; </p>
<p>I miss you, Ga-Ga. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5.<strong> On tomorrow&#8217;s Food Network episode, I make a big (read: gigantic) spread for the crew. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/3982455382/" title="TPW_2263 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2485/3982455382_9513ecdea0_o.jpg" width="630" height="420" alt="TPW_2263" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Pork chops are involved. </p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ll like the show. There&#8217;s lots of footage of the cattle/calf working, and it&#8217;s filmed in a little bit more of a documentary style, with Marlboro Man (and my two girls) narrating what they&#8217;re doing from time to time. </p>
<p>When I watched it last week, I fast forwarded (fasted forward? ha) through those pesky parts of me cooking. I wanted to see the humans I gave birth to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mom thing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A. <strong>When the British TV crew is here, I try so hard not to adopt British phrases, particularly while I&#8217;m cooking on camera.</strong> And a couple of times, in an effort to be hip and with it, I&#8217;ve used British words or phrases that I thought I had a grasp on, only to find out they aren&#8217;t things you&#8217;re supposed to say in public. </p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into detail, for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>On another note, did you know people from England refer to a stove as a &#8220;hob?&#8221;</p>
<p>And instead of &#8220;throw it into the pan,&#8221; they say &#8220;bung it into the pan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the British crew isn&#8217;t familiar at all with the word &#8220;mainstay.&#8221; I had to explain to them what it meant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>How do they live?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8558544503/" title="DSC_1072 by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8558544503_b17a01e153_z.jpg" width="426" height="640" alt="DSC_1072" class="width_426 frame-img" /></a>They do have cake in London, though. No cultural barrier there. </p>
<p>Cake is the language that unites us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
19. <strong>Spring is arriving, and I&#8217;m experiencing all sorts of seasonal angst,</strong> such as do I plant a big garden this year and bet on good rains coming? Or do I apply what I&#8217;ve learned from the terrible drought and heat of the past two years and scale back considerably? </p>
<p>Marlboro Man and I have four children on four different soccer teams. How is that going to work? Can two humans be divided into four?</p>
<p>Whom can I write to request a refund on the hour of sleep I lost this week? </p>
<p>I smell punitive damages. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c. <strong>Springing Forward is stup&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Um, not my cup of tea. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
14. <strong>Springing Forward is dum&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Um, not something I particularly enjoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
8. <strong>Tell me what you guys are up to these days.</strong></p>
<p>And if you could please tell me you&#8217;re facing some of the same spring-related dilemmas as I am, I&#8217;d be most appreciative.</p>
<p>And most of all: have a wonderful weekend!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
P-Dub</p>

<em>By <a href="http://omsh.com" title="OMSH">Heather Sanders</a></em>.</p>
<p>Back in December, readers responded to the Community Question, <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/homeschooling/2011/12/community-question-is-sleeping-in-all-that-bad/" title="Is sleeping-in all that bad?" target="_blank">&#8220;Is sleeping-in all that bad?&#8221;</a>  Compelling <a href="http://www.nationaljewish.org/about/mediacenter/pressreleases/2013/homeschool-sleep/" title="Homeschool Students Sleep Better" target="_blank">new research from National Jewish Health</a> in Denver, Colorado asserts that sleeping in is actually the &#8220;logical solution&#8221; for nocturnal teens to get the nine hours of sleep a night their bodies need.</p>
<p>Researchers <em>&#8220;concluded that more than half (55%) of teens who were homeschooled got the optimal amount of sleep per week, compared to just 24.5% of those who attend public and private schools.&#8221;</em>  According to the <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/sleep-topics/teens-and-sleep" title="Teens and Sleep" target="_blank">National Sleep Foundation</a>, not getting enough sleep limits the ability for teens to learn, listen, concentrate and solve problems.  It can also increase the propensity for aggressive or inappropriate behavior and contribute to illness.</p>
<p>Though increased sleep was not at the top of my list of reasons to homeschool, according to this study, the freedom to begin schoolwork when their bodies can focus offers a positive academic advantage for homeschool teens.  </p>
<p>Sleep psychologist <a href="http://www.nationaljewish.org/about/people-search/detail/?id=662" title="Lisa Meltzer, PhD" target="_blank">Lisa Meltzer, PhD,</a> and her colleagues charted 2612 students&#8217; sleep patterns, 500 of which homeschool.  Meltzer and her colleagues discovered that traditionally schooled students are in class about 18 minutes before homeschooled teens even wake up, which means on average they sleep 90 minutes fewer a night than homeschooled adolescents.  Those who can get an average of 7 hours of sleep per night have lost a full ten hours by the end of the week.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;That cumulative sleep deprivation adds up.  The ability to learn, concentrate and pay attention is all diminished when you haven&#8217;t had enough sleep.&#8221;</em> said Meltzer.</p>
<p>When I manage to drag myself out of bed to exercise at 6:45 AM I pass a handful of sleepy-eyed teens waiting for the school bus (1st Period begins at 7:45 AM in our local high school).  Those same buses drop them off around 4:00 or 4:30 PM.  With chores, family dinners, and homework, getting a full nine hours of rest may be a challenge.  According to Meltzer, even if teens managed to climb into bed at 9:00 PM it most likely would not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t an earlier bedtime fix the problem? <em>&#8220;Melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate our sleep shifts by about two hours during puberty.  So, even if they wanted to get to sleep earlier, teenagers are battling biological changes in their bodies that are nearly impossible to overcome.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While Meltzer hopes this research encourages change in high school morning schedules, I appreciate not having a school administrator to wait upon to initiate any necessary changes.  After all, sleep is <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/sleep-topics/teens-and-sleep" title="Sleep is food for the brain" target="_blank">food for the brain,</a> and I prefer to feed, not starve my kids&#8217; brains.</p>
<h6>Are you homeschooling a teen?  Have you noticed any changes in sleep patterns?  When does he/she begin school each day?</h6>

<p>1. See how many marshmallows we could shove into our mouths (I&#8217;m not sure how one of us didn&#8217;t choke).</p>
<p>2. Play the &#8220;Ha&#8221; game: You lie on your back with your head resting on the stomach of the person next to you, then their head rests on the stomach of the person next to them, etc. Then you alternate saying &#8220;Ha,&#8221; except with each person&#8217;s turn they add an additional &#8220;Ha.&#8221; So the first person says &#8220;Ha.&#8221; Then the second person says &#8220;Ha ha.&#8221; Then the third person says &#8220;Ha ha ha&#8221; and so on. You keep going, and the object of the game is to be the last one that doesn&#8217;t crack up, and this is very difficult.</p>
<p>3. Learn about the love of God. Youth groups are good like that!</p>
<p>Another thing I remember about my youth group days is eating. A lot. Everything from pizza to Cheetos and everything in between. But one of my favorite food memories are the hot ham sandwiches the youth group moms used to make. I remember seeing them working in the kitchen, assembling what seemed to be millions (and that was just my share) of individual foil-wrapped sandwiches that eventually made their way into the oven&#8230;and then into our mouths. They were delicious then and are delicious now, and are a great thing to make ahead of time and keep in the fridge (or freezer, in the case of the youth group moms, if I remember correctly) until you need to pop them in the oven.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to make them! I used mostly roast beef this time (the original uses ham) and slightly messed with the dressing, but the basic components are the same as the original.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8552694451/" title="Mini Hot Ham Sandwiches by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8085/8552694451_9e358588c4_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Mini Hot Ham Sandwiches" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>You need some shaved roast beef. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

The youth group moms used regular hamburger buns, but I went for the smaller dinner rolls size. These are whole wheat&#8230;</p>

You can use straight-up prepared horseradish, or you can go the horseradish mayo route. Either way, you want that feel-it-in-your-sinus quality.</p>

So much easier than tearing off the roll.</p>

The small size is nice, because then it can be either a snack or a meal.</p>

<p>Do Lock-Ins still take place, by the way? </p>
<p>I&#8217;m just&#8230;curious. </p>

Loved this one!</p>
<p>Note: There are lots of different versions of this same sandwich, but my friend Kristen at <a href="http://dineanddish.net" target="_blank">Dine and Dish</a> posted <a href="http://dineanddish.net/2009/08/impressing-the-in-laws-recipe-oven-ham-sammies/" target="_blank"><strong>this version</strong></a>, which calls for spooning the dressing <em>over</em> the sandwich (rather than spreading it inside) before wrapping them in foil. I might try that next time. Sounds yummy!</p>
<p>Have fun with these sandwiches, guys. They&#8217;ve stood the test of time because they&#8217;re easy to throw together and are great for a crowd. </p>
<p>And most importantly: Play the &#8220;Ha&#8221; game. At the earliest possible convenience. Your life will never be the same. </p>

<p>To assemble, spread dressing on top and bottom buns. Lay on roast beef or ham, then one or two slices of cheese (I cut them to fit the small buns.) If you're using Cheez Whiz, spread a layer on the top bun. </p>
<p>Wrap each sandwich in a foil square, and either keep in the fridge or bake right away. To bake the sandwiches, put them on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes. The buns should be slightly crusty and the cheese should be melted. </p>
<p>Great for a crowd!</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/files/2013/03/biscuitsgravy.jpg"><img src="http://static.thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/files/2013/03/biscuitsgravy.jpg" alt="biscuitsgravy" width="630" height="419" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13478 frame-img width_630" /></a>Late Saturday afternoon, after Marlboro Man had returned home with the soccer-playing girls, and I had returned home with the soccer-playing boys, and after our three bottle calves were given their bottles and I washed the last dirty dish in the mountain of dishes I&#8217;d left piled in the sink when I left the house Saturday morning, I decided to make biscuits and sausage gravy. </p>
<p>It turned out to be a good decision.</p>
<p>I posted a biscuits and gravy recipe in the very, very early days of this website&#8212;back when I thought it was advisable to get so close to the food with my camera that sometimes you couldn&#8217;t tell what the food was. In that tutorial, I fried sausage patties and removed them from the skillet before making the gravy and serving the two components separately. That&#8217;s how I frequently make biscuits and gravy around here.</p>
<p>The gravy I made Saturday, however, was true sausage gravy, which I prefer to the regular kind. I like it partly because it&#8217;s easy: You just crumble and cook the sausage, then make the gravy right on top of it. But I also prefer it because the gravy is just dang darn ding dadgum good: Chock full of sausage wonderfulness and an amazing texture and heartiness. </p>
<p>Either way you make it, just keep in mind that biscuits and gravy should be eaten only once every nineteen years or so. It&#8217;s delightfully filling!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

Unless you&#8217;re feeling lazy, which I was Saturday when I made these drop biscuits. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />

<p>&#8220;Square on the middle of the top?&#8221;</p>
<p>Good one, Ree. Clear and eloquent as ever.</p>
<p>So then I went looking for symbolism and meaning in the fact that the baking powder had landed in a perfect dome shape. Surely it had to be a sign. Maybe I should take my kids to Washington D.C. to see the Capitol? But I wasn&#8217;t sure. So I told myself that if the second tablespoon of baking powder landed and stayed on the top of the first perfectly rounded tablespoon, it would be even more of sign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>No Washington D.C. trip for my kids! And it&#8217;s all the baking powder&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>You have these inner dialogs with yourself while you bake biscuits too, right? </p>
<p>Oh, whew! Good. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

At this time, I will choose not to show you the photo of the butter all worked into the flour, because such a photo does not exist, because I am an airhead and was thinking about something I can&#8217;t remember because&#8230;well, the airhead thing.</p>
<p>But basically, the flour should look a little like cornmeal once the butter&#8217;s worked in.</p>

I just watch, and when the dough comes together and starts moving around the bowl in a big mass, I stop. I don&#8217;t want it to be crumbly, but I also don&#8217;t want it to be too wet. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8542520907/" title="Drop Biscuits and Sausage Gravy by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8542520907_e80d9289a5_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Drop Biscuits and Sausage Gravy" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Brown the sausage until it&#8217;s just cooked, and at this point, there are two ways to go about this. You could remove the sausage from the skillet, then make the gravy, then throw the sausage back into the gravy&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pioneerwoman/8543619982/" title="Drop Biscuits and Sausage Gravy by Ree Drummond / The Pioneer Woman, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8543619982_1944062a8b_z.jpg" width="630" height="419" alt="Drop Biscuits and Sausage Gravy" class="width_630 frame-img" /></a>Or you can just start making the gravy right away! I&#8217;m going to do that, because the sausage didn&#8217;t product a whole lot of grease&#8212;not really enough to make a good roux&#8212;and if I remove the sausage from the pan I&#8217;ll be taking a whole lot of much-needed grease with me. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

I wanted to add as much as I could without the sausage getting overly clumpy and dry. </p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />

With the amount of flour I added, I knew it needed this amount of milk.</p>
<p>Gravy intuition, I like to call it.</p>

It&#8217;s getting thick. Nice and thick and gravyish. If it gets too thick before you&#8217;re ready to serve it, just splash in a little milk. Gravy is very forgiving that way.</p>

<p>However you serve it, enjoy. This is a good one.</p>

				<div itemprop="instructions">
				<p>BISCUITS</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</p>
<p>Add flour, baking powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor (or a large bowl.) Add butter pieces and pulse until butter is completely cut into the flour mixture (or use a pastry cutter if using a bowl.) While pulsing (or stirring) drizzle in the buttermilk until dough just comes together and is no longer crumbly.</p>
<p>Drop in clumps on two baking sheets, then bake for 15-17 minutes, or until golden brown. (Optional: Brush with melted butter when biscuits first come out of the oven.)</p>
<p>SAUSAGE GRAVY</p>
<p>With your finger, tear small pieces of sausage and add them in a single layer to a large heavy skillet. Brown the sausage over medium-high heat until no longer pink. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Sprinkle on half the flour and stir so that the sausage soaks it all up, then add a little more until just before the sausage looks too dry. Stir it around and cook it for another minute or so, then pour in the milk, stirring constantly. </p>
<p>Cook the gravy, stirring frequently, until it thickens. (This may take a good 10-12 minutes.) Sprinkle in the seasoned salt and pepper and continue cooking until very thick and luscious. If it gets too thick too soon, just splash in 1/2 cup of milk or more if needed. Taste and adjust seasonings.</p>
<p>Spoon sausage gravy over warm biscuits and serve immediately!</p>
