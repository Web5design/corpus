      <title>Rolling Stones To Return To Hyde Park After 44 Years</title>
      <description>The Rolling Stones confirmed this week that they will perform in London's Hyde Park in July, 44 years after their last appearance there. The 1969 concert drew a 250,000 people and was tinged with sorrow, coming just two days after the death of the band's guitarist and founding member Brian Jones. Just before performing, Mick Jagger silenced the crowd and, in memory of Jones, read a stanza from Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem on Keats's death, "Adonais." This was a time when drugs and alcohol were beginning to take a heavy toll on rock stars and the concert has been called a defining moment in rock and roll.</description>
