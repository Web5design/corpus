      <title>First Listen: Brass Bed, 'The Secret Will Keep You'</title>
      <description>A sad parade of loneliness, death, fear and madness comes to life on an oddly buoyant album. Brass Bed's dark themes are wrapped in sunny melodies and mysterious synth sounds that ultimately dissolve into glorious chaos. It's part sonic exploration, part infectious pop and part noise rock.</description>

      <title>First Listen: Mother Falcon, 'You Knew'</title>
      <description>Formed as a free-wheeling, 15- to 20-piece side project for a group of orchestra students, Mother Falcon crafts a sound that soars with the grandiosity of Arcade Fire at its most anthemic. Its second album, &lt;em&gt;You Knew&lt;/em&gt;, captures the hugeness of a band that can't fit on many of the stages it plays.</description>
