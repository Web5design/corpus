The valley is extremely remote and not known to many people, since the one road leading to the dale is fairly poor and usually impassible in the winter except with large vehicles. There are two cottages in the valley owned by friends of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When I was teenager, I started wondering about the history of this place and was particularly interested in its name. The valley is not mentioned in any sagas or historical records, but it was said by people through the centuries that this place had a hof (heathen temple) and many kinds of vættir (wights) and other spirits or gods. Legends say that Bishop Guðmundur tried to exorcise the spirits of the dale in the 13th century, but he failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Db-jStoBSg/UWeBnihGApI/AAAAAAAACdI/9qH56EbgNmI/s1600/Ruins+house+avalanche++Go%C3%B0dalur+dale+of+the+gods+Bjarnarfjo%CC%88r%C3%B0urKa%CC%81ri+Pa%CC%81lsson+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Valley+of+the+Gods+in+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3Db-jStoBSg/UWeBnihGApI/AAAAAAAACdI/9qH56EbgNmI/s320/Ruins+house+avalanche++Go%C3%B0dalur+dale+of+the+gods+Bjarnarfjo%CC%88r%C3%B0urKa%CC%81ri+Pa%CC%81lsson+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Valley+of+the+Gods+in+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;In the foreground are the ruins of the old farm in&amp;nbsp;Goðdalur&lt;br /&gt;Photograph by&amp;nbsp;Kári Pálsson&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The valley was inhabited until December 1948, when a 130-meter wide avalanche destroyed the town and killed six people. A farmer named Jóhann Kristmundsson and his young daughter survived. The girl died soon after; Jóhann lived couple of years longer, but never recovered. Today, the dale still holds ruins of the old farm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingibjörg Sigvaldadóttir, a housewife born in 1912 in Svanshóll, remembered that her father Sigvaldi Guðmundsson had told the farmer then living in Goðdalur that he shouldn’t have removed the remains of the old hof that stood in the valley. The farmer later denied having done so and claimed he only covered it with soil and built over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1952 yearbook of Ferðafélag Íslands (Icelandic Touring Association), Jón Hjaltason wrote, “Goðdalur has been a place of tragic events and accidents. It is clear that this place is filled with the wrath of the gods, and that only land-wights want to live there.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b9rbqkOSWaY/UWeDzgoAAdI/AAAAAAAACdY/rMJ55tg9aXo/s1600/Hei%C3%B0inn+si%C3%B0ur+a%CC%81+I%CC%81slandi+O%CC%81lafur+Briem+heathen+sidu+custom+in+iceland+asatru+pagan+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b9rbqkOSWaY/UWeDzgoAAdI/AAAAAAAACdY/rMJ55tg9aXo/s320/Hei%C3%B0inn+si%C3%B0ur+a%CC%81+I%CC%81slandi+O%CC%81lafur+Briem+heathen+sidu+custom+in+iceland+asatru+pagan+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" width="207" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heiðinn Siður á Íslandi&lt;/i&gt; by Ólafur Briem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It is interesting how many places around Goðdalur have heathen names. In his 1945 book&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Heiðinn Siður á Íslandi&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;i&gt;Heathen Practice in Iceland&lt;/i&gt;), Ólafur Briem names four waterfalls that have the name Goðafoss (“waterfall of the gods”). There are actually five – including two in Bjarnardalur and one in Goðdalur – but Ólafur forgets to mentions one of them.&amp;nbsp;There are also several place-names in Goðdalur that relate to hörgur (heathen stone altars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remains from different eras have been found throughout the valley, and the dale is a popular location for archeologists. Once, when I was playing in valley’s little stream as a boy, I found a small square iron plate that looked like ashtray with a picture of bearded man done in an interesting style. I’m not sure how old this iron tray was; I gave it to an adult and learned nothing more. It was likely from before the time of the avalanche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In 1960, as excavations were being done to build a small summer house on the spot, an ancient blót (sacrifice) stone was found. Scientists examined black marks on the inside of the stone and found that they were residue of ancient animal blood. The stone was lost, but it resurfaced in 2002 and is now stored in &lt;a href="http://www.galdrasyning.is/"&gt;Galdrasafnið á Ströndum&lt;/a&gt; (Museum of Icelandic Sorcery &amp;amp; Witchcraft).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dDeRmuMH9o8/UWeEnlTLoqI/AAAAAAAACdk/9rmCY5vtvM0/s1600/blo%25CC%2581t+stone+hlaut+bowl+Iceland+asatru+heathen+Go%25C3%25B0dalur+norse+mythology+blog+mythg+religion.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dDeRmuMH9o8/UWeEnlTLoqI/AAAAAAAACdk/9rmCY5vtvM0/s320/blo%25CC%2581t+stone+hlaut+bowl+Iceland+asatru+heathen+Go%25C3%25B0dalur+norse+mythology+blog+mythg+religion.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Blót stone found in&amp;nbsp;Goðdalur, Iceland&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It is clear that blóts were held in this location in ancient times. Scholars think that heathens gathered here and held blóts in secret, even two centuries after the conversion to Christianity had outlawed public sacrifices. The discovery of the stone gives clear evidence for stories that this area had a hörg or hof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://sagadb.org/eyrbyggja_saga.en"&gt;Eyrbyggja Saga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;tells of a hof raised by Þórólfur Mostraskegg:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There he let build a temple, and a mighty house it was. There was a door in the side-wall and nearer to one end thereof. Within the door stood the pillars of the high-seat, and nails were therein; they were called the gods’ nails. Therewithin was there a great frith-place [peace-place, sanctuary]. But off the inmost house was there another house, of that fashion whereof now is the choir of a church, and there stood a stall in the midst of the floor in the fashion of an altar, and thereon lay a ring without a join that weighed twenty ounces, and on that must men swear all oaths; and that ring must the chief have on his arm at all man-motes [moots, meetings].&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;On the stall should also stand the blood-bowl, and therein the blood-rod was, like unto a sprinkler, and therewith should be sprinkled from the bowl that blood which is called &lt;i&gt;hlaut&lt;/i&gt;, which was that kind of blood which flowed when those beasts were smitten who were sacrificed to the gods. But round about the stall were the gods arrayed in the holy place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The blót stone from the valley was likely used as a hlaut-bowl like the one described in the saga.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aXhYiKJvjSo/UWeAqwlM2gI/AAAAAAAACdA/X2lB2LUFbCs/s1600/+Go%25C3%25B0dalur+dale+of+the+gods+Bjarnarfjo%25CC%2588r%25C3%25B0urKa%25CC%2581ri+Pa%25CC%2581lsson+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Valley+of+the+Gods+in+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aXhYiKJvjSo/UWeAqwlM2gI/AAAAAAAACdA/X2lB2LUFbCs/s320/+Go%25C3%25B0dalur+dale+of+the+gods+Bjarnarfjo%25CC%2588r%25C3%25B0urKa%25CC%2581ri+Pa%25CC%2581lsson+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Valley+of+the+Gods+in+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Photograph of Goðdalur&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;Kári Pálsson&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It is said that an ancient goði (heathen priest) was buried near the site of the hof in Goðdalur and that around him was a some sort of hex place on which animals were never allowed and which was never mowed. It is also said that the hofgoði (temple priest) threw his gods’ statues in Goðafoss after the conversion to Christianity, although this tale has been probably confused with that of Þorgeir Ljósvetningargoði. Of course, people suspect that this story is pretty one-sided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks to&amp;nbsp;Kári &amp;amp; the&amp;nbsp;Ásatrúarfélagið for sharing this piece.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Þakka þér kærlega fyrir!&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/1459645614043195505/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=1459645614043195505&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/1459645614043195505'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/1459645614043195505'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/04/valley-of-gods-in-iceland.html' title='VALLEY OF THE GODS IN ICELAND'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

The total sum required by the Icelandic Directorate of Immigration in order to study in Iceland for one year is $12,000. A hefty chunk of change, I know. The upside is that this sum is actually the total amount they anticipate a student from the US will spend on &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; things (tuition, board, living expenses) for a year. I can't even live for under that without school, here in NY. The problem is that I need the money up front, and I need it before I go in August.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F1W4dVL8lmQ/UV7sm1Q3CxI/AAAAAAAACck/Vr9gDrGvOwc/s1600/Josh+Rood+Old+Nordic+Religion+Masters+Program+University+of+Iceland+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Myth+Fenrismaw+Kubb+Donation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F1W4dVL8lmQ/UV7sm1Q3CxI/AAAAAAAACck/Vr9gDrGvOwc/s200/Josh+Rood+Old+Nordic+Religion+Masters+Program+University+of+Iceland+Norse+Mythology+Blog+Myth+Fenrismaw+Kubb+Donation.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Josh Rood, Kubb Champion&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color: white; color: #333333; display: inline; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left;"&gt;Josh is someone we should all be supporting.

The German version presents the tale in an overtly Christian setting; pivotal scenes occur at church, and Odin is notably absent. As part of the downgrading and removal of heathen religious elements, the Valkyrie is recast as a purely human warrior-woman:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;There was a queen throned across the sea, that had not her like, beyond fair and of mickle strength, and her love was for that knight only that could pass her at the spear. She hurled the stone and leapt after it to the mark. Any that desired the noble damsel’s love must first win boldly in these three games. If he failed in but one, he lost his head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is no sense in this version that she is supernatural. Instead, like Éowyn, she is a noble woman who has chosen to live the warrior’s life as a shieldmaiden – a choice that is seen, in this Christian worldview, as wholly negative. Both Brynhild and Brünhilde are tricked into marrying unworthy men by the deceit of the hero (Sigurd in Iceland, Siegfried in Germany). However, the Christianized German version adds a disturbing extra scene in which Siegfried violently rapes the shieldmaiden in her own bedroom to teach her the virtue of wifely obedience (on behalf of her new husband, who secretly watches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_hanycio4z4/UTbUtWY9FFI/AAAAAAAACWA/107uuMuvsww/s1600/brunhilde+brunnhild+brynhild+shieldmaiden+nibelungen+nibelungenliend+norse+mythology+blog+myth+valkyrie.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_hanycio4z4/UTbUtWY9FFI/AAAAAAAACWA/107uuMuvsww/s320/brunhilde+brunnhild+brynhild+shieldmaiden+nibelungen+nibelungenliend+norse+mythology+blog+myth+valkyrie.gif" width="237" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Brünhilde the Shieldmaiden&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The strife endured long atwixt them. Then Siegfried got hold of Brünhilde. Albeit she fought valiantly, her defence was grown weak. It seemed long to the king, that stood there, till Siegfried had won. She squeezed his hands till, by her strength, the blood spurted out from his nails. Then he brake the strong will that she had shown at the first. The king heard it all, but he spake no word. Siegfried pressed her down till she cried aloud, for his might hurt her greatly. She clutched at her side, where she found her girdle, and sought to tie his hands. But he gripped her till the joints of her body cracked. So the strife was ended.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You may choose to read this as a wrestling match rather than a rape, but the sexual element really is clear in the text. The “strife” occurs in bed, with the husband hiding behind the bed curtains, and begins with Siegfried tearing Brünhilde’s nightgown. Where the heathen version of the tale presents us with a hero who begs a wise Valkyrie to share her knowledge, the Christian version gives us a rapist who violently puts a headstrong shieldmaiden in her (domestic) place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Szw4t7vuhis/UTbVYykAHLI/AAAAAAAACWI/dSqVYR0KKTk/s1600/brothers+hildebrandt+eowyn+dernhelm+nazgul+witch+king+angmar+black+rider+ringwraith+lord+of+the+rings+return+of+the+king+tollkien+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+asatru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="233" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Szw4t7vuhis/UTbVYykAHLI/AAAAAAAACWI/dSqVYR0KKTk/s320/brothers+hildebrandt+eowyn+dernhelm+nazgul+witch+king+angmar+black+rider+ringwraith+lord+of+the+rings+return+of+the+king+tollkien+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+asatru.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Awesomest Painting in the History of the World&lt;br /&gt;or, Éowyn versus the Witch-King of Angmar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The dispute between Aragorn and Éowyn, of course, pales next to the horror of the &lt;i&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/i&gt; scene. However, the underlying theme is the same, even if Tolkien makes it implicit rather than explicit; the mighty hero wants the shieldmaiden to give up her willful heathenish ways and become a subservient Christian woman. In Tolkien’s version, however, the shieldmaiden not only has the better lines, but she goes on to [&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;SPOILER ALERT!&lt;/span&gt;] vanquish the greatest warrior of the Dark Lord on the battlefield when she fearlessly faces and defeats the Lord of the Nazgûl – a figure so terrifying that the novel’s male characters literally fall to the ground in terror when he appears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: Heathen Feminist 1, Christian Patriarch 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jJLmdlMVX-I/UTbXiK0ruhI/AAAAAAAACWc/8jYaCfq_6rQ/s1600/Eowyn+Dernhelm+shield+maiden+Return+of+the+King+cartoon+1980+Tolkien+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jJLmdlMVX-I/UTbXiK0ruhI/AAAAAAAACWc/8jYaCfq_6rQ/s320/Eowyn+Dernhelm+shield+maiden+Return+of+the+King+cartoon+1980+Tolkien+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Éowyn in the 1980 &lt;i&gt;Return of the King&lt;/i&gt; cartoon&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A possible objection to this reading of Éowyn as heroic heathen shieldmaiden may be made by pointing to the negative attributes of Valkyries in Germanic literature. These mystical figures can be bloody and terrifying, violent and untrustworthy. Leslie A. Donovan addresses this issue in her excellent essay, “The valkyrie reflex in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings”:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;By eliminating from his primary women figures the concept common in valkyrie typology of the female inciter and her accompanying vengeance for kin or personal insult, Tolkien constructs them as reflective of moral good, heroic ideals, noble behavior, and responsible leadership by means of a female identity concordant with contemporary perceptions of women as significant forces within society and the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She goes on to say that “Tolkien’s modern benevolent valkyries… are preservers of tradition, defenders of their culture, bearers of the future, and forces for moral good.” In Éowyn, Tolkien has created a model version of heathen womanly power that embodies the highest ideals of the Old Way. Every ancient religion has positive and negative characterizations of women in its received texts. Surprisingly for a Catholic author, Tolkien chooses to gather together the positive aspects of heathen womanhood into a powerful and sympathetic character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kJIZrVo9-To/UTbZ8GExWJI/AAAAAAAACWo/MXFRRdR1s_A/s1600/michael+kaluta+eowyn+tolkien+calendar+lord+of+the+rings+norse+mythology+blog+myth+heathen+feminist+painting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="284" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kJIZrVo9-To/UTbZ8GExWJI/AAAAAAAACWo/MXFRRdR1s_A/s320/michael+kaluta+eowyn+tolkien+calendar+lord+of+the+rings+norse+mythology+blog+myth+heathen+feminist+painting.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Éowyn stands alone - art by Michael Kaluta&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Éowyn also expresses a pre-Christian worldview when she asks, “may I not now spend my life as I will?” At least in terms of marriage, the Icelandic sagas show that women had a surprising independence before the conversion to the new religion. Perhaps most interesting is the fact that a woman could declare herself divorced and immediately force her husband to leave while taking possession of her own property. Laws covered division of common possessions, child custody and child support. In the sagas, physical abuse is the most common reason given by women who declare themselves divorced; these women would not be pushed around by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare this strikingly modern arrangement with, for instance, the Catholic Church’s continuing and complicated policy on divorce and annulment. In post-conversion Iceland, Catholic bishops held the power to decide whether a divorce would be granted; patriarchal authority pushed aside female self-determination. Éowyn’s indignant desire to determine the course of her own life aligns her against the new patriarchy and with the powerful and independent women of Tolkien’s beloved Icelandic sagas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the conversation continues, Aragorn again insists that Éowyn remain with the non-combatants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;‘A time may come soon,’ said he, ‘when none will return. Then there will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m34FJ1j73xs/UTbdKqwIgFI/AAAAAAAACW4/bA1YI8A0pUE/s1600/Eowyn+Lady+of+Rohan+collectible+trading+card+game.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m34FJ1j73xs/UTbdKqwIgFI/AAAAAAAACW4/bA1YI8A0pUE/s320/Eowyn+Lady+of+Rohan+collectible+trading+card+game.jpg" width="228" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;"She is fearless and high-hearted. All love her."&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This again denies Éowyn the right to pursue one of the fundamental tenets of the heathen religion: the pursuit of glory on earth and reputation among men (and women). Her response is fierce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;‘All your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;What disqualifies Éowyn from making her mark on her era and being immortalized in song? Only her gender. This ties in with the post-conversion change in women’s rights within marriage. Éowyn wants to be an equal partner, like the heathen women who could divorce abusive husbands with a word. Instead, she is being forced into a traditional Christian position of subservience. Paul the Apostle makes a clear link between wifely submission and Christian theology, underscoring the patriarchal nature of the new religion’s mythology and religious practice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so [let] the wives [be] to their own husbands in every thing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EzjDEimg6Ko/UTbeYdJryII/AAAAAAAACXE/mCVL_EsekgI/s1600/aragorn+ranger+frodo+sam+pippin+merry+bree+lord+of+the+rings+fellowship+of+the+ring+norse+mythology+myth+blog+tolkien+calendar+brothers+hildebrandt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EzjDEimg6Ko/UTbeYdJryII/AAAAAAAACXE/mCVL_EsekgI/s320/aragorn+ranger+frodo+sam+pippin+merry+bree+lord+of+the+rings+fellowship+of+the+ring+norse+mythology+myth+blog+tolkien+calendar+brothers+hildebrandt.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Aragorn preaches to the congregation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;If &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; is “a fundamentally religious and Catholic work,” is Aragorn – the king of &lt;i&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/i&gt; – a fundamentally religious and Catholic hero? It does seem that he is arguing a Christian position for the role of women in society, and Éowyn is presenting a dissenting view that is based in heathen thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the conversation draws to a close, Aragorn – perhaps taken aback that this young woman has no fear of battle and death – asks her what she does fear. Her answer is the great feminist line of the Tolkien mythos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;‘A cage,’ she said. ‘To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;For all the (mostly fair) criticism of Tolkien’s weak writing of female characters, this is a line worthy of Charlotte Perkins Gilman or Virginia Woolf. It powerfully expresses the soul-crushing frustration of being denied the right to live a full and independent life because of one’s gender. This is a shockingly modern sentiment in a work by a male Catholic medievalist in his sixties, published only two years after the English translation of Simone de Beauvoir’s &lt;i&gt;The Second Sex&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lCbdNa3HJl8/UTbfiCZaznI/AAAAAAAACXY/qPWSJVRkQW8/s1600/JRR+Tolkien+smoking+pipe+back+cover+photo+The+Hobbit+norse+mythology+myth+heathen+feminist+blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="309" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lCbdNa3HJl8/UTbfiCZaznI/AAAAAAAACXY/qPWSJVRkQW8/s320/JRR+Tolkien+smoking+pipe+back+cover+photo+The+Hobbit+norse+mythology+myth+heathen+feminist+blog.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Tolkien having a pipe and a laugh&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Éowyn’s words also encapsulate the wanderlust and restlessness of the pre-Christian North, from the Indo-Europeans arrival through the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the world-spanning travels of the Vikings – a raw energy that Tolkien loved and admired, even though he lived in a Christian era and took the New Way’s teachings to heart. Éowyn likewise speaks with the fierce and determined voice of “that noble northern spirit” when she later tells Merry, “Where will wants not, a way opens.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Tolkien’s work focuses on Great Men doing Great Deeds and on patriarchy and kingship, in this short scene he presents us with a young woman giving voice to the energy at the heart of the heathen era. It says something about Tolkien as a human being that he was able to write so eloquently from the perspective of a woman espousing heathen ideals, if only for this one moment. He really was a man of (lower-case) catholic interests.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/8342711715708474056/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=8342711715708474056&amp;isPopup=true' title='11 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/8342711715708474056'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/8342711715708474056'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/03/tolkiens-heathen-feminist-part-two.html' title='TOLKIEN&apos;S HEATHEN FEMINIST, Part Two'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Tolkien wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; is of course a fundamentally religious and Catholic work; unconsciously so at first, but consciously in the revision. That is why I have not put in, or have cut out, practically all references to anything like 'religion', to cults or practices, in the imaginary world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although Tolkien had a deep personal commitment to Catholicism, he also had an abiding love for what he called “that noble northern spirit” – the historical, literary and philosophical heritage of pre-Christian northern Europe. He lamented that &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/06/clash-with-christianity-part-one.html"&gt;the coming of Christianity&lt;/a&gt; had obliterated any detailed record of the ancient mythology of his own country, as opposed to Iceland’s preservation of its literary heritage in the &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt;. His decades-long creation of the Middle-earth corpus was, in part, an effort to create a “mythology for England.” This mythology is not a Christian one; Tolkien referred to Gandalf as an “Odinic wanderer,” not a Christ figure (despite what today’s movie reviewers may tell you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QF6mM4-KjoU/US44wgP_OOI/AAAAAAAACNo/_fyOwk5ulgI/s1600/egill+skallagrimsson+brewery+iceland+icelandic+egils+strong+beer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QF6mM4-KjoU/US44wgP_OOI/AAAAAAAACNo/_fyOwk5ulgI/s320/egill+skallagrimsson+brewery+iceland+icelandic+egils+strong+beer.jpg" width="122" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Iceland actually has beer&lt;br /&gt;named for saga heroes.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In 1926, Tolkien founded the Kolbítar [“coalbiter”] Society, named for an Old Norse term referring to those who would tell tales while sitting close enough to the fire to bite the coals. The members of the club (including C.S. Lewis) would meet regularly to translate the Icelandic &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; and sagas while drinking beer. Given that these texts are foundational sources of information for Norse mythology and religion – and that beer plays a major role in both the myth and ritual of the ancient North – I wouldn’t call this club “fundamentally Catholic” in outlook, unless we use the lower-case &lt;i&gt;catholic&lt;/i&gt; to mean “broad in sympathies, tastes or interests.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tolkien’s deep love for the literary heritage of northern Europe can be felt throughout his works. I teach a semester-long course teasing out the many elements of Norse myth that permeate &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; alone. In this article, I will focus on a close reading of a single bit of dialogue in &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; to show how powerfully the pre-Christian philosophy resonates in Tolkien’s fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In “The Passing of the Grey Company,” the second chapter of &lt;i&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/i&gt;, Aragorn tells Éowyn that she may not ride with him to battle, but must remain behind as the men go off to war. Her response immediately shows her allegiance to heathen ideals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;‘You are a stern lord and resolute,’ she said; ‘and thus do men win renown.’ She paused. ‘Lord.’ she said, ‘if you must go, then let me ride in your following. For I am weary of skulking in the hills, and wish to face peril and battle.’&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Aap1ZZyh7Xo/US47F9Nqr5I/AAAAAAAACN4/N3xaK5EZWWo/s1600/elder+edda+book+of+viking+lore+poetic+translated+andy+orchard+penguin+classics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Aap1ZZyh7Xo/US47F9Nqr5I/AAAAAAAACN4/N3xaK5EZWWo/s320/elder+edda+book+of+viking+lore+poetic+translated+andy+orchard+penguin+classics.jpg" width="208" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Odin's words still fascinate, as evidenced by&lt;br /&gt;release of yet another &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; translation.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Éowyn’s words echo those of the god &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; in the Old Norse poem &lt;i&gt;Hávamál&lt;/i&gt; (“Sayings of the High One”):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Cattle die, kinsmen die,&lt;br /&gt;the self must also die;&lt;br /&gt;but glory never dies,&lt;br /&gt;for the man who is able to achieve it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Norse religion, it was brave actions of the individual in this life that mattered – not quiet piety and prayer aimed at a future afterlife. By forbidding that Éowyn participate in the great conflicts of her era, Aragorn acts with the patriarchal authority of a Biblical king as he denies a heathen woman the right to live a full and fulfilling life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Aragorn then tells Éowyn of her &lt;i&gt;duty&lt;/i&gt; (a word long used to bind women to the home), she gives a fiercely proud reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;‘Too often have I heard of duty,’ she cried. ‘But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet long enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my life as I will?’&lt;/blockquote&gt;Her words specifically associate her with the ancient Germanic peoples. In Old English, before it meant “earl,” &lt;i&gt;eorl&lt;/i&gt; (which Tolkien here uses as a proper name) simply meant “warrior.” With much of the language associated with Éowyn’s people, Tolkien ties the Riders of Rohan to the old Anglo-Saxons. For example, Éowyn is the niece of Théoden, whose own name is a modernized spelling of the Old English &lt;i&gt;þēoden&lt;/i&gt; (“ruler,” “lord”).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ZHBZxhlYU0/US4-mRmpvYI/AAAAAAAACPM/rm_nkctANRw/s1600/thror+thorin+oakenshield+map+hobbit+tolkien+anglo+saxon+runes+rune+runic+norse+mythology+myth+eowyn+aragorn+lord+of+the+rings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="256" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4ZHBZxhlYU0/US4-mRmpvYI/AAAAAAAACPM/rm_nkctANRw/s320/thror+thorin+oakenshield+map+hobbit+tolkien+anglo+saxon+runes+rune+runic+norse+mythology+myth+eowyn+aragorn+lord+of+the+rings.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Anglo-Saxon runes on Thror's Map from &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Éowyn’s name is formed from ancient elements. Dating from approximately the 9th century, the Anglo-Saxon &lt;i&gt;Runic Poem&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of verses that each illuminate (not always clearly) the meaning of a specific rune. These are the same runes that Tolkien used in his texts and illustrations, such as the cover art and maps of &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt;. Like Tolkien’s work, the poem itself contains both heathen and Christian elements. &lt;i&gt;Éowyn&lt;/i&gt; is formed from two runic names: &lt;i&gt;eoh&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;wynn&lt;/i&gt;. In Anglo-Saxon, the former means “war-horse, charger” (not to be confused with a similarly-named rune meaning “yew-tree”) and the latter means “joy, rapture.” Éowyn’s name can be interpreted as “the one who rides joyfully into battle.” In this light, Aragorn is denying her very nature by forbidding her to ride to war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L496LhhD4Gk/US5AKiAdSAI/AAAAAAAACPY/u67rFdXwn3g/s1600/jrr+tolkien+finn+and+hengest+fragment+and+episode+norse+mythology+blog+myth.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L496LhhD4Gk/US5AKiAdSAI/AAAAAAAACPY/u67rFdXwn3g/s200/jrr+tolkien+finn+and+hengest+fragment+and+episode+norse+mythology+blog+myth.gif" width="129" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Tolkien's &lt;i&gt;Finn and Hengest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The horse-prefix of Éowyn’s name and her insistence on her lineage also connect her to Hengest and Horsa, the legendary brothers of Anglo-Saxon legend who led the Germanic tribes to conquer what later became England. As the names of Éowyn and her brother Éomer (interpretable as “the one famous for deeds on war-horse”) both contain “horse” elements, the names of this legendary pair both simply mean “horse.” Rudolf Simek connects the Anglo-Saxon figures to ancient “horse-shaped (Indo-)Germanic twin deities” and to “the horse heads on the gables of farmhouses in Holstein [Germany] which were known as Hengist and Hors even as late as around 1875 and can still be seen there today.” This correspondence of horse-siblings is no accidental congruence. Tolkien was intimately familiar with the story of Hengest and Horsa; his lectures on these ancient heroes are collected in the posthumously published &lt;i&gt;Finn and Hengest&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZKh9N0YUCQ/US4103zofhI/AAAAAAAACNY/cVTsr_MW4BE/s1600/Cimbric+Women+Defending+the+Fortification+of+Wagons+Ward+Lock+The+Illustrated+History+of+the+World+1880+Cimbri+Norse+Mythology+Blog+myth+tolkien+heathen+feminist+celts+celtic+aragorn+eowyn+return+of+the+king+lord+of+the+rings.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="260" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2ZKh9N0YUCQ/US4103zofhI/AAAAAAAACNY/cVTsr_MW4BE/s320/Cimbric+Women+Defending+the+Fortification+of+Wagons+Ward+Lock+The+Illustrated+History+of+the+World+1880+Cimbri+Norse+Mythology+Blog+myth+tolkien+heathen+feminist+celts+celtic+aragorn+eowyn+return+of+the+king+lord+of+the+rings.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;"Cimbric Women Defending the Fortification of Wagons"&lt;br /&gt;from Ward Lock's &lt;i&gt;The Illustrated History of the World&lt;/i&gt; (c1880)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Éowyn referring to herself as a “shieldmaiden” connects her to historical heathen women who armed themselves and fought in battle. The Greek writer Plutarch describes the fierce women of the Cimbri, a tribe located in what is now Denmark. When Roman soldiers pursued the fleeing men of the tribe back to their wagons, both groups got a nasty surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Here the women met them, holding swords and axes in their hands. With hideous shrieks of rage they tried to drive back the hunted and the hunters, the fugitive as deserters, the pursuers as foes. With bare hands the women tore away the shields of the Romans or grasped their swords, enduring mutilating wounds. Their fierce spirit unvanquished to the end.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4cLVnnBf6OE/US5B2rsXsFI/AAAAAAAACQo/ycqYXpINlwE/s1600/Velle%CC%81da+jardin+luxembourg+Veleda+statue+Paris+Hippolyte+Maindron.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4cLVnnBf6OE/US5B2rsXsFI/AAAAAAAACQo/ycqYXpINlwE/s320/Velle%CC%81da+jardin+luxembourg+Veleda+statue+Paris+Hippolyte+Maindron.jpg" width="132" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Statue of Veleda (1844)&lt;br /&gt;by Hippolyte Maindron&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Like Éowyn, some historical women were great captains of their people in times of war. In the 1st century, Veleda was a leader of the Rhineland tribe of the Bructeri. She led in both the political and spiritual arenas, serving as an arbiter during negotiations between Rome and Cologne and acting as a prophetess for her tribe. The Roman writer Tacitus underscored the connection between her roles in military and religious life when he described her as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;a maiden of the tribe of the Bructeri, who possessed extensive dominion; for by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity. The authority of Veleda was then at its height, because she had foretold the success of the Germans and the destruction of the legions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The historical role of heathen women in military and religious spheres is reflected in mythological and literary sources. The shieldmaidens of Norse mythology and saga are striking figures (in both senses of the word). Carolyne Larrington’s description of the shieldmaidens of mythic poetry reads like a thumbnail portrait of Éowyn, stating that they are “human girls who, scorning domesticity and female tasks, take up the warrior life; as such they can overlap with valkyries.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gi6ThXXy3qM/US5IXMInSTI/AAAAAAAACR8/M-H_t2XeXSw/s1600/eowyn+dernhelm+shieldmaiden+valkyrie+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="135" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gi6ThXXy3qM/US5IXMInSTI/AAAAAAAACR8/M-H_t2XeXSw/s200/eowyn+dernhelm+shieldmaiden+valkyrie+heathen+feminist+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Éowyn ready for battle as a shieldmaiden&lt;br /&gt;in Peter Jackson's &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the Icelandic &lt;i&gt;Saga of the Volsungs&lt;/i&gt;, Brynhild is a mystic Valkyrie who serves Odin. Compare the words and appearance of Éowyn with Bryhild’s description of herself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I am a shield-maiden. I wear a helmet and ride with the warrior kings. I must support them, and I am not averse to fighting.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Later in &lt;i&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/i&gt;, Éowyn literally puts Brynhild’s words into action by wearing a helmet to disguise herself and riding into battle with the warrior-king Théoden. Throughout the novel, she makes abundantly clear that she is “not averse to fighting.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mystic Valkyrie, Brynhild determines the outcome of human battles and possesses great wisdom and magical knowledge. The hero Sigurd asks her to teach him the ways of the world and says, “Never can there be found a wiser woman in the world than you. Give me more wise counsel.” Although written down after the conversion of Iceland to Christianity, the saga is based on older poetry and mythology (Odin is a recurring character) and has a thoroughly heathen worldview. Notably, it portrays Brynhild as a warlike wise woman – a role that women actually played in pre-Christian society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oaMQFWYNQ00/US5LR4NLLBI/AAAAAAAACSg/D5lKTQ9s_1I/s1600/tjangvide+image+picture+stone+valkyrie+sleipnir+valhalla+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="253" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oaMQFWYNQ00/US5LR4NLLBI/AAAAAAAACSg/D5lKTQ9s_1I/s320/tjangvide+image+picture+stone+valkyrie+sleipnir+valhalla+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A Valkyrie welcomes a warrior to Valhalla with a drinking horn&lt;br /&gt;on a Swedish memorial stone from the Viking Age&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;When Brynhild teaches wisdom to Sigurd, she brings him a ritual drink. Likewise, one function of the Valkryies in the &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; is that they welcome dead heroes to Valhalla with horns of mead. In &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, Éowyn several times presents a symbolic drink to the heroes in a ritualized manner. In the scene immediately following her conversation with Aragorn, she brings a drink to the departing warriors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;She was clad as a Rider and girt with a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Here and elsewhere in the novel, Tolkien’s description of Éowyn recalls the description of Brynhild in the &lt;i&gt;Saga of the Volsungs&lt;/i&gt; as “in a mail coat, with her sword in her hand and a helmet on her head.” In this scene, Éowyn is dressed as a shieldmaiden while she replicates the ritual cup-bearing actions of the Valkyries, further tying herself to heathen tradition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To be continued in &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/03/tolkiens-heathen-feminist-part-two.html"&gt;Part Two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/2281973683246806078/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=2281973683246806078&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/2281973683246806078'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/2281973683246806078'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/02/tolkiens-heathen-feminist-part-one.html' title='TOLKIEN&apos;S HEATHEN FEMINIST, Part One'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Journalists, politicians and scholars rely on figures provided by the military – but they’re being given falsified data. How have you been involved in trying to change this situation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – I’m unsure if it’s a refusal to recognize heathenry as a real religion. It’s also not totally falsified data, because they do have data that presents how many choose Other as an option. It’s ignorance about our faith, for sure, but many chaplains are supportive of the religious pluralism mandated by regulation and law. Some are not, and Cat and I have both had our dealings with chaplains that weren’t. Education is key in changing their behavior and attitudes, in general, regarding our religious rights. Beyond adding options to the religious preference list, we’ve also both pushed to try and educate chaplains, chaplain assistants and others about our faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – Either way, this is an area that is going to become all the more difficult to work on as Josh makes his final transition out of the military. We have some good people that we can work with that are still “on the inside,” so to speak, so it’s not insurmountable&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;but I don’t know. I would have loved to have seen Josh’s last day in the military being one in which he was officially “heathen” in the records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EMj65_ctSSg/UQ1SWo43hNI/AAAAAAAACGQ/HtXr6bfVysU/s1600/us+army+chaplains+corps+regimental+insignia+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EMj65_ctSSg/UQ1SWo43hNI/AAAAAAAACGQ/HtXr6bfVysU/s320/us+army+chaplains+corps+regimental+insignia+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+.png" width="253" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;US Army Chaplains Corps Regimental Insignia&lt;br /&gt;Latin Text: "For God and Country"&lt;br /&gt;According to the Pentagon, "The pages of the open&lt;br /&gt;Bible represent the primacy of God's Word."&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – How does this situation relate to the lack of a single heathen chaplain in the US military?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – That’s a whole other bottle of fish. Seriously. There are about 3,000 chaplains, I think, just in the Army – though that might be the entire US military. Even in the Army, that’s 3,000 spiritual advisors for over half a million people. If it’s for the whole military, that’s 3,000 for about 1.5 million – based on 2009 numbers, at least. For the 2,000 Buddhists, they have one chaplain, and he only recently became a chaplain. There are seven Jewish chaplains for nearly 2,000 Jewish soldiers. The Wiccans – who have a much larger number than we do – haven’t been able to endorse a chaplain yet. Getting the first chaplain of any faith in the military is hard. You have to be the “perfect candidate,” and you really have to work your butt off with both your endorsing organization and the military Chaplains Corps you want to be a part of to make it happen. I’ve seen a lot of folks try and fail to make it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Have you been working towards the inclusion of a heathen chaplain in the military system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Without wanting to let any cats out of any bags, we are working with an individual that might make it to being the first heathen chaplain. I absolutely cannot say any more on the issue as of now. We will see how things work out. I’m hopeful right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – So, yes, please cross your fingers for us that this works out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-07c7zB4nNmo/UQ1UmNrfqmI/AAAAAAAACGg/EZYHZ8oHwIQ/s1600/stephen+mcnallen+asatru+folk+assembly+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+heathens+in+the+military+interview.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-07c7zB4nNmo/UQ1UmNrfqmI/AAAAAAAACGg/EZYHZ8oHwIQ/s1600/stephen+mcnallen+asatru+folk+assembly+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+heathens+in+the+military+interview.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Stephen McNallen in &lt;a href="http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/current/ken_ny_timesmag.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; portrait&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Although the Department of Veterans Affairs allows a very wide range of religious symbols on military grave markers (including symbols of minority faiths like Wicca, Sufism and Seicho-no-ie), they don’t allow heathens to have &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;’s hammer on their gravestone. For those who may not know, will you explain who Stephen McNallen is and how he was involved with the effort to have Thor’s hammer accepted as a religious symbol by the VA?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Stephen McNallen is the head of an organization called the Asatru Folk Assembly. He is a former Special Operations soldier himself and was a major force in the early modern Ásatrú movement here in the US. McNallen is also a bit of a controversial figure in the heathen community today, especially because of his concept of metagenetics – the belief that the desire to become a heathen is somehow attached to one’s ancestors through a blood connection. Personally, biology, history, science and the things we know about how heathens really viewed the world make me think this is a bunch of drivel. There are a lot of folks that agree with me, and there are some that agree with Mr. McNallen. I mention this simply to say that, because he is the leader of one group of heathens does not make him the leader – or even the spokesman – of us all. Heck, no one can claim to be the leader of us all and we rather like it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, he did begin the process that helped to drive the VA to change their regulation. He made a speech on the Mall in DC about adding it and began the Quest for the Hammer to have a hammer added to the list. Thor’s hammer is a common heathen religious symbol both from antiquity and from the modern day. It would probably be the most requested symbol for any heathen to have on their headstone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n0dhCF7uW1I/UQ1Y8AEOdrI/AAAAAAAACGo/51fALJXTk5I/s1600/arlington+national+cemetary+grave+gravestones+markers+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+religion.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="215" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n0dhCF7uW1I/UQ1Y8AEOdrI/AAAAAAAACGo/51fALJXTk5I/s320/arlington+national+cemetary+grave+gravestones+markers+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+religion.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/06/arlington-cemetery/arlington-cemetery-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;National Geographic&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; photo of gravestones at Arlington National Cemetery&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – How did you get involved in this effort? What was your interaction with military administration like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Near the end of our tenure with the Troth, the Quest for the Hammer begun by the Asatru Folk Assembly became a big thing. We were already working on a load of heathen military ideas, because we were working towards becoming the military stewards for the Troth. We got involved because we were told about the speech that McNallen made, and we wanted to really make a positive change. We had added a religious preference to the Army’s official list, and we really thought we could use a lot of the contacts we had made around the heathen world to make a difference. We reached out to both organizations and told them we really wanted to help, and we wanted to facilitate some cooperation between the two, so that we both could get something really good done for heathens – regardless of political issues that had happened between them in the past. We really thought that we could all work together for the common good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Did McNallen and his group support your work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Yes and no. We worked extensively with their military outreach person when this all began. We called our Facebook group “AFA’s Quest for The Hammer,” and we made sure to add their folks as administrators to that group and to keep them involved as much as possible. We got a lot of push back against working with us as time went on. McNallen and his group seem to have their own agenda that we didn’t fit into particularly well. We think it’s pretty sad, too, because we really had no political desire to do this, and getting embroiled in heathen politics was not something we thought needed to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uf6nud1iGIM/UQ1axQz8mUI/AAAAAAAACGw/3xd0cKyIIvQ/s1600/department+of+veterans+affairs+washington+dc+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+asatru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Uf6nud1iGIM/UQ1axQz8mUI/AAAAAAAACGw/3xd0cKyIIvQ/s320/department+of+veterans+affairs+washington+dc+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+religion+asatru.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington DC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Our Facebook group amassed over 600 members in a matter of days. We helped to start a letter-writing campaign to the VA to get a hammer added to the list of symbols for headstones. We had friends in the AFA’s military outreach program that we were talking to about all of this stuff that we could get done together. Then the AFA came back and said they didn’t want to work with the Troth at all. We replied, “Ok, we’ll continue to work with both groups and you don’t have to work with them.” They didn’t want to work with anyone affiliated with the Troth, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for directly working with the military administration, we didn’t do a lot of that for this project. Instead we acted as rabble-rousers, getting all kinds of people on board and writing to the VA and to their congresspeople. In the end, we might have ended up being more involved if the VA hadn’t changed their rules. We were on track to really getting into the administration's face if we had to, but they changed the rules just in time to avoid us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – The whole thing was really a shame, and there were quite a few of us around at that time&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;in both orgs&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;working on this that found the whole thing frustrating. Most of those people were military or ex-military, and it was expressed more than once that people were just letting petty rubbish get in the way of working on what we saw as being the bigger picture. There was also, sadly, lots of talk that went along the lines of, “We can only back this person as a potential distinctive faith group leader [a term used by the Army Chaplains Corp] if they’re a member of &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; org, and if they’ve been one for long enough.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C7fJ6jHp0PY/UQ1bm16tIDI/AAAAAAAACG4/P_Ul1HSxDvc/s1600/Siegfried+Welding+the+Sword+Richard+Wagner+opera+Siegfried+from+the+Ring+series+Stephen+de+Hospodar+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+religion+heathens+in+the+military.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-C7fJ6jHp0PY/UQ1bm16tIDI/AAAAAAAACG4/P_Ul1HSxDvc/s320/Siegfried+Welding+the+Sword+Richard+Wagner+opera+Siegfried+from+the+Ring+series+Stephen+de+Hospodar+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+religion+heathens+in+the+military.jpg" width="256" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;There's a long tradition of striking while&lt;br /&gt;the iron is hot in Germanic myth &amp;amp; legend&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;As members of the military community – and more than aware of the constant cycles of PCS [“permanent change of station,” or moving posts] and deployment – we know that, if we are to get a heathen distinctive faith group up and running, it’s probably going to be a case of having to “strike while the iron is hot.” This was, and still is, all the more frustrating for us because orgs don’t seem to have any issues with getting comprehensive prison outreach programs up and running, but, when it comes to those that take oaths to fight on our behalf, there’s not much out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – What’s the current status of the policy regarding Thor’s hammers on grave markers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Around May of 2009, we got a message from our contacts letting us know that the VA was going to come out with a change that would make the Quest rather moot. The VA changed their rules on how the system for headstones works. The VA now has a rule that any symbol added to the list can only be done for a military member posthumously. Once a service member passes away, the next of kin can process paperwork to request exactly what image they would like on their headstone. This image will then be added to the official list of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, we highly suggest that all heathens – hell, all military members – add a specific image they want on their headstone to their wills. A legal document will be the best way to prove that a deceased serviceman or woman really wanted a particular image on their headstone. Sadly, someone will have to die before we can have the symbol added to the list. The &lt;a href="http://www.irminsul.org/arc/200906a.html"&gt;Irminsul&lt;/a&gt; website – which was incidentally my first Ásatrú website, ever – has a &lt;a href="http://www.irminsul.org/arc/200906a.html"&gt;good suggestion&lt;/a&gt; to go along with the Open Halls Projects suggestion of adding a picture and information to ones will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This change came about because of all the concerted effort on a multitude of fronts to make it happen. I am damn sure our efforts had a major part in the change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ekMUAhKXntk/UQ1curjuzXI/AAAAAAAACHA/OsTddfolhME/s1600/bodies+fallen+soldiers+afghanistan+return+to+united+states.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ekMUAhKXntk/UQ1curjuzXI/AAAAAAAACHA/OsTddfolhME/s320/bodies+fallen+soldiers+afghanistan+return+to+united+states.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Fallen soldiers return to the United States from Afghanistan&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;CH – Sadly, I’ve heard of at least one heathen service member who died and whose wishes weren’t honored by his family. I cannot confirm this personally. The gentleman was a member of a group that I had contact with a while ago, and they had a memorial for him, but – officially – he was given a Christian burial. We really can’t emphasize the need for military heathens to get their wishes in their wills enough. Do it today. Don’t wait for deployment warnos [warnings] or for your unit to tell you; get your butts down to Legal and get this squared away, ASAP. Have those conversations with those you want to represent your interests should you not come home, and&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;if you have concerns about how your loved ones might act on your behalf&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;look into (if it’s possible) legally empowering someone you trust to do so in their stead. Do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is huge. If you are the person that doesn’t come home, and your will proves that you wanted the hammer on your gravemarker – not meaning to sound like a &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt; Klingon – but your death could bring about a real game changer for military heathens and how the military views heathenry. Now, we’re not saying here that we want anyone to die – quite the opposite. On another note, we have several military heathens in our database that we haven’t heard from in quite a while and who haven’t replied to our emails that we’re worried about. So, yes, get your wills sorted and reply to our emails. Let us know you’re okay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Thank you both for taking the time to answer my questions. I’ve been wondering about heathens in the military for quite a while, and it’s great to finally get some straight answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – No problem. Thanks for interviewing us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Thanks for the interview, Karl.

I’d joined the Army with the expectation that I’d never really meet a lot of other heathens. Funny enough, that turned out to be the exact opposite of the truth. I met more heathens once I’d left home and joined the military than I had before that. Even back home, I was getting messages, and – on leave at one point – I got to meet a whole ton of folks that I didn’t have a chance to before that. It was crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Open Halls Project is a way for heathens to get in touch with other heathens when they move from one duty station to another. That’s its core purpose. The other purposes are running care-package drives for service members that are deployed, advocating for more religious understanding and rights with the Chaplains Corps and making sure that heathen service members are taken care of,&amp;nbsp;in any way we can help them with. We have a &lt;a href="http://www.openhalls.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-Halls-Project/172313002825870"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://www.openhalls.org/registration"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, it’s Cat and I doing our best with our crazy schedules to make things happen for folks. Sometimes that's easier than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – I think my husband pretty much covered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr1jpc76Mec/UQQdrK6AhHI/AAAAAAAAB7I/LWNP-btWCCI/s1600/open+halls+project+serving+military+heathens+josh+heath+cat+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+us+army+armed+forces.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="67" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr1jpc76Mec/UQQdrK6AhHI/AAAAAAAAB7I/LWNP-btWCCI/s320/open+halls+project+serving+military+heathens+josh+heath+cat+interview+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+us+army+armed+forces.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The doors of the hall are open to all&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Why did you decide to start the project?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Cat and I were introduced in South Korea by a person we both sort of knew from the internet. She introduced us, and we also got to meet her. We were three heathens in a country with… three heathens. Our friend was a member of the Troth [a large American heathen organization], a very long-standing member at the time. Over the years of knowing her, she suggested a few times we look into it as an option to join. Honestly, I’ve never been one for joining any groups. I just never saw it as a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got talked into joining the Troth because they wanted to have military stewards – folks that do outreach to particular groups. Since we were both keen on the idea of outreach, we decided it was a good idea. We wanted pretty much one thing out of the Troth. At that time, no religious preference was on the books [in the military] for heathens to choose. So, we joined, with the hope that by joining we could build up a program to help military heathens, get Ásatrú and Heathen added as religious preferences and see where that went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wZoqg1_5muU/UQQf7DE_7QI/AAAAAAAAB8k/6BcNKotYS0w/s1600/treebeard+ent+lord+of+the+rings+the+two+towers+brothers+hildebrandt+illustration+painting+hobbits+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wZoqg1_5muU/UQQf7DE_7QI/AAAAAAAAB8k/6BcNKotYS0w/s320/treebeard+ent+lord+of+the+rings+the+two+towers+brothers+hildebrandt+illustration+painting+hobbits+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Josh &amp;amp; Cat (on table) attempting to move the process along&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;To say we were kinda disappointed is a bit of an understatement. The Troth moves a bit slower than Ents do during a ten-year-long Westerosi winter. It took almost ten months to get the paperwork we needed from the folks in charge of the Troth to make the request to add a religious preference. I have to say that we don’t really agree with the Troth when it comes to how they do what they do, but to each their own. I wish many of my friends in the Troth well, but I’m glad we aren’t members anymore – even though I don’t really have hard feelings towards any of them. We are working with the Troth regarding a few projects here and there, and there is a big project coming up that they might be working with us on. Cross your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;Without getting into it too much, another main reason why we set up the Open Halls Project is that from an early stage in our interactions with the Troth and AFA [Asatru Folk Assembly, another large American heathen organization], we realized that some of the inter-org politics and style of working really didn’t fit the ethos that we’d decided to operate by when we came up with the OHP. Our aim was to create something that was grassroots, inclusive and that would be ruled by the principle of “just getting shit done.” For all the good intentions in an org, there is still baggage, history and by-laws to contend with, and we simply didn’t want to be constrained by any of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being grassroots, we don’t sound as impressive as a 501(c)(3)-status org, but we are certainly freer in how we operate and who we work with. On occasion, we’ve considered looking into becoming a 501(c)(3) org, because&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;as a grassroots movement&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;we’re very careful not to take any donations directly, instead facilitating the process between the donor and the service member. However, were we to become a 501(c)(3), we’d end up losing our mobility as a project. Sooner or later, we’d probably also become entrenched in politics, and that would be a pity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-McT-RYir4uo/UQQgY06KH2I/AAAAAAAAB90/aq8ZuL2_UbI/s1600/josh+heath+interview+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+myth+us+army+armed+forces+asatru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="233" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-McT-RYir4uo/UQQgY06KH2I/AAAAAAAAB90/aq8ZuL2_UbI/s320/josh+heath+interview+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+myth+us+army+armed+forces+asatru.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Josh Heath in his work clothes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – How many members of the military have registered with Open Halls, and from which service branches?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – We have approximately 300 people registered in our official database, 120 in our Facebook group, plus who-knows-how-many website visitors, because we don’t have a tracker. 110 people in the database are active military or veterans. A majority of those are in the Army. We have a decent amount of folks in the Navy and the Air Force – and a very small amount of Marines and no Coast Guard, to my knowledge. These are official registrations, though; the amount of heathens I think would be much higher. Folks might not think these are large amounts of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Have you been able to gather any hard data on the total number of practicing heathens serving in the US military?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VRmOtU53tQ4/UQQiP4soFdI/AAAAAAAAB_I/kmx0EJDVW7A/s1600/barad+dur+mount+doom+amon+amarth+mordor+sauron+lord+of+the+rings+tolkien+art+painting+illustration+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VRmOtU53tQ4/UQQiP4soFdI/AAAAAAAAB_I/kmx0EJDVW7A/s320/barad+dur+mount+doom+amon+amarth+mordor+sauron+lord+of+the+rings+tolkien+art+painting+illustration+norse+mythology+blog+myth.jpg" width="253" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The stone wall set up by the US Army Chaplains Corps&lt;br /&gt;(Illustration by J.R.R. Tolkien)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – My hypothesis is that there are at least 300 practicing heathens, Ásatrú, or Norse Wiccans on active duty in the total military. Though this number might be slightly inflated, it's based on my estimates of folks that are on a multitude of groups on Facebook and around the internet that I’m either directly affiliated with or that I’m aware of. Hard data is very hard to get when the US Army Chaplains Corp has stonewalled you in regards to getting more information about the request you put in almost two years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;In other words, it’s not easy to get information on a group that officially doesn’t exist yet, especially when attempts to gain recognition for the existence of that group seem to be going ignored or messed up (seemingly willfully) by the chaplaincy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – How does the number of heathens compare to members of other minority faiths in the military?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – I’m doing some &lt;a href="http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2009/11/12/raw-data-religious-preference-in-the-military/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and will put this into perspective. There are 1,456,862 people in the active US Army. As of 2009, 367 have chosen Wicca as their religious preference. From personal experience, I bet thirty to forty of these folks are really heathens of some sort showing solidarity because they didn’t have their own option. 280 Hindus, 40 Salvation Army, 85 Orthodox churches, 41 Quakers (I thought they were pacifists, but anyway…), 2 Magick and Spiritualists – and 46,890 Unknown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did get the US Army to add a heathen religious preference: the Troth. It isn’t what we wanted, and our second request to have Ásatrú and Heathen added has been largely stonewalled. Until we added the Troth [as an option], I was one of those folks that was Unknown. The point is this: there are a ton of random religious preferences, and we would not be the smallest of them by a long shot&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;if we were really counted the way we should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O5ShTn9yg-I/UQRjOfBGDLI/AAAAAAAACAc/GGdUdOwfqE0/s1600/winfred+saint+boniface+donars+eiche+donnereiche+thors+oak+chops+down+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+christianity+conversion.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-O5ShTn9yg-I/UQRjOfBGDLI/AAAAAAAACAc/GGdUdOwfqE0/s320/winfred+saint+boniface+donars+eiche+donnereiche+thors+oak+chops+down+norse+mythology+blog+myth+asatru+christianity+conversion.gif" width="206" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Historically, Christian leaders have had a complicated&lt;br /&gt;relationship with interfaith outreach. In 742, the man&lt;br /&gt;who became Saint Boniface reached out to heathens&lt;br /&gt;by chopping down Thor's holy oak with an axe.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;CH – To be honest though, the addition of the Troth as a religious preference really didn’t shock me. When Josh was deployed, I decided to go to the chaplaincy to ask if any others with similar beliefs had made themselves known to the chaplains there. The first thing I was told was that the post we were on was one of the most fundamentalist [Christian] posts that that particular chaplain had ever been on and that he’d never come across anyone else professing Ásatrú. He discouraged me from posting flyers because of the reactions from the community and then proceeded to tell me about a man he knew with tattoos that originally didn’t want to come to church but now really enjoys it. He also asked me multiple questions about how I was coping with my husband being away and recommended some Byron Katie and church stuff, even though I’d told him that I was working two teaching jobs on the German economy and was doing fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I left my number behind and asked him to please direct anyone that came asking about heathenism to me, but I got the distinct feeling that Post-it was just going to end up in the trash by the end of the day. Through a lot of that meeting, it was almost as though he couldn’t believe that I could really cope without Jesus, and that&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;in spite of my work and smart casual attire&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;I was just deluded that I was. I think this interaction and the way that that chaplain tried to work on me was pretty representative of how many in the chaplaincy function when confronted with another belief system. If nothing else, it soured our view of the chaplains on-post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds like I’ve just allowed one bad experience with the chaplains to affect my view of the whole chaplaincy. However, I’ve heard far more bad about them from other heathens than good, including one tale of how a suicidal soldier went for help and was told by the chaplain that he couldn’t help him unless he converted to Christianity. Which is a pity, because it’s definitely not in the remit of the chaplaincy to propagate one religious belief over another. They’re supposed to support and facilitate the expression of religious beliefs for all in the military community, regardless of what those beliefs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GTYG-Qk7m_o/UQRlikg76VI/AAAAAAAACBw/DF5t4DmxLcQ/s1600/uncle+sam+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+norse+myth+asatru+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GTYG-Qk7m_o/UQRlikg76VI/AAAAAAAACBw/DF5t4DmxLcQ/s320/uncle+sam+heathens+in+the+military+norse+mythology+blog+norse+myth+asatru+.jpg" width="238" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;I want YOU to properly fill out religious preference forms&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Multiple soldiers have told me that, when they were asked their religion for official military records at induction and answered Heathen, their answer was changed to Other or No Religious Preference. Have you had experience with this or been contacted by others who have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Yes. I’ve heard of the second one happening, but the first is more common. The US military, until recently, did not have an official religious preference for heathens. The Troth is still the only one that they actually have. Honestly, the option of Other provides a lot of leeway for the military. The system of having specific religious preferences is important and is mandated by regulation. In a lot of ways, it seems like a useless system designed to cause problems. However, what it does is require the Chaplains Corps to have some level of understanding of each faith and to legally provide for the religious requirements of those faiths that are within their system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kY9B9ykz8Pg/UQRt6kFPgCI/AAAAAAAACDE/n0aJaAOXREE/s1600/the+poetic+edda+the+mythological+poems+translated+and+with+an+introdcution+by+henry+adams+bellows+norse+mythology+blog+myth+heathen+asatru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kY9B9ykz8Pg/UQRt6kFPgCI/AAAAAAAACDE/n0aJaAOXREE/s320/the+poetic+edda+the+mythological+poems+translated+and+with+an+introdcution+by+henry+adams+bellows+norse+mythology+blog+myth+heathen+asatru.jpg" width="205" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Josh's companion for his world travels&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It’s tiresome and often difficult to get additions to said list. However, in a lot of ways, it protects real religions from folks that would put random things they don’t truly believe in place. Any person is allowed to have whatever they want in the religion space on their dog tags. I had Ásatrú put on mine before I deployed, and before the Troth was added. This meant that anyone finding my dog tags would have at least something to research. Having a religion added to one’s other paperwork is helpful for requesting holidays, specific requests for religious exemptions (having a period of time off to give offerings, for example) and allowances for books and religious items that might not be authorized normally in places like basic training. I had my copy of the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; with me during basic, and having a religious preference would mean that any heathen would, de facto, be allowed to have such a thing and could bring a lawsuit if they were restricted from having it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The option of Other was designed to show that a person had a religious preference, not that they didn’t have any. Other as an option means that those members of smaller faiths can show that they have a religious preference and that they deserve to have some allowances made for their religious needs. None or No Religious Preference is different, but still valuable for those atheists and others that choose it. I don’t really know how frequently it’s a problem that heathens have their religious preference changed to None.

When I say &lt;i&gt;heathens&lt;/i&gt;, I mean those who follow the contemporary iteration of Norse religion that is sometimes known as Ásatrú. For instance, I’ve had questions about the accuracy of data regarding adherents of various minority faiths within the military. I’ve come across small bits of information about the Department of Veterans Affairs forbidding the appearance on grave markers of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;’s hammer (probably the most popular religious symbol for historical and modern heathens), but I discovered nothing definitive. I wasn’t able to find detailed answers to my questions – until I met Josh and Cat Heath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vm3NsP6fYhg/UPnUG2ZzODI/AAAAAAAABvs/D-obc42VQmA/s1600/josh+heath+cat+heathen+wedding+asatru+denmark+norse+mythology+myth+blog+drinking+horn+military.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Vm3NsP6fYhg/UPnUG2ZzODI/AAAAAAAABvs/D-obc42VQmA/s1600/josh+heath+cat+heathen+wedding+asatru+denmark+norse+mythology+myth+blog+drinking+horn+military.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Josh &amp;amp; Cat's heathen wedding in Denmark (2009)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Born in Laconia, New Hampshire and raised in nearby Holderness, Josh was on active duty in the US Army from 2006 to 2011. He served as a Quartermaster and Chemical Equipment Repairer / General Mechanic and was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2008-2009. He’s currently serving his last few months with the US Army Reserve while studying Political Science and French as a full-time student at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he is also working to develop the school’s Veterans Liaison Office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cat was born in Chorley, Lancashire, England; the US is her seventh country of residence. She earned a BA with Honors in Modern Languages (French, Spanish and Portuguese) at the University of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and met Josh while he was stationed in South Korea, where she was teaching kindergarten. The couple moved to Germany and had a civil wedding before Josh was deployed to Iraq. After his return a year later, the couple had a heathen wedding ceremony in Denmark. Cat currently works “as a corporate slave” but is also planning an escape via her translation business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Josh and Cat have been deeply involved in American heathenry and have played important roles in the struggle for its recognition as a religion in the US military. In 2010, they founded the &lt;a href="http://www.openhalls.org/"&gt;Open Halls Project&lt;/a&gt;, an organization&amp;nbsp;“set up to connect military heathens with civilian and military heathens throughout the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – What is reconstructionist heathenry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – It’s a process of breaking down all the information we have about historic heathen worldview and then trying to make that worldview work in the modern day. In some ways, it’s easier to say what it &lt;i&gt;isn’t&lt;/i&gt;. Reconstructing heathenry is not reenactment. Reconstructing heathenry is not doing the same things that our ancestors did. Reconstruction in heathenry is about understanding why the ancient heathen peoples did what they did and applying that thought process to the building of religious ceremonies and customs (also known as &lt;i&gt;sidu&lt;/i&gt;), today. There isn’t really such a thing as reconstructionist heathenry; different heathens have done differing levels of reconstruction. The movement to do more reconstruction has gotten stronger in the last ten years or so, and this movement has erroneously been called reconstructionist heathenry, when really it’s just heathenry with a focus on understanding and implementing a traditional worldview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--z3KJh9k5KM/UPnWSMMUivI/AAAAAAAAByA/BrPd2RaWhq4/s1600/Carl+Larsson+Midvinterblot+sketch+1915+midwinter+blot+sacrifice+norse+religion+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="177" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--z3KJh9k5KM/UPnWSMMUivI/AAAAAAAAByA/BrPd2RaWhq4/s320/Carl+Larsson+Midvinterblot+sketch+1915+midwinter+blot+sacrifice+norse+religion+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Swedish artist Carl Larsson's&amp;nbsp;(highly imaginative) vision of ancient&amp;nbsp;blót&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;For example, we don’t know exactly how a blót [Old Norse “sacrifice”] was done in heathen times. We have a lot of archaeological information and we have a load of textual information about what became outlawed during Christian times, and we can extrapolate a lot of great information from all the research that has been done. The key, at least how I understand it, is that blót (and really any sacrificial ceremony in heathenry) is about creating a cyclic gifting relationship between the gods and ourselves. These same relationships can be built with the landvættir [Old Norse “land spirits”] and our ancestors, and I think it’s been a key part of recent advances in heathenry to focus on the fact that those relationships are, in a lot of ways, more important than the one with the gods. Our ancestors care about us, because we are more closely connected to them – the same with the landvaettir. They live with us; that relationship is like having a good connection with your neighbors. I like having a good relationship with the mayor, too, but if I don’t get along with the dude next door, that would impact my life a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others might have a different view of Ásatrú or heathenry and how reconstruction fits into that. I know for a fact that some of my close friends don’t always agree with me, but I think that’s important. We don’t agree, but we can discuss all of the concepts together and really get into quality debates and help each other work out some thoughts and concepts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – Reconstructionist heathenry is very misunderstood, and – as someone that’s often associated with it – I tend to find myself having certain “accusations” leveled at me. Most of the time, these center around how we’re all apparently “soulless” and just slavishly following what them there dusty old books say, that we apparently don’t have any of that UPG [Unverified Personal Gnosis, or mystical experience] stuff, and that we’re all mean and intolerant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-plVygj_yMmc/UPo20VU8AhI/AAAAAAAAB4o/2CcfHbTwPw4/s1600/cat+heath+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+myth+asatru.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-plVygj_yMmc/UPo20VU8AhI/AAAAAAAAB4o/2CcfHbTwPw4/s320/cat+heath+heathens+in+the+military+interview+norse+mythology+myth+asatru.jpg" width="206" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Self-portrait of Cat Heath&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I did used to get quite annoyed by these accusations, but now I see them more as being indicative of the misunderstandings that exist out there about reconstructionism. As my husband said, sometimes it’s better to try and explain reconstructionist heathenry by what it is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;, and, for some reason, some of what it is perceived to be &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; is often offensive to others, too. My husband has talked a little about the process that reconstructionists engage in, and I believe that reconstructionism is something that &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; heathens engage in; it’s just that some engage in it to a greater degree than others. However, having said that, heathenry suffers just as much from the curse of labeling as any other group on earth does. The reasons why we humans label each other are mostly just for identification purposes, but sometimes we label as a way of devaluing a group so that we don’t have to listen to anything they have to say. This is what I believe has happened in both the “anti-recon” and “recon” camps that seem to have sprung up. Trying to figure out what came first here is probably one of those “chicken and the egg” type scenarios – i.e., did the labeling create and reinforce group identities, or did already extant group identities lead to the labeling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, groups that are more reconstructionist in nature do have some differences. We tend to be more locally and community based (as opposed to playing on the national stage) and tend to focus on building up traditions over the years that can be handed down to our children. In terms of internet interactions, we also tend to stick to discussing subjects that can be backed up by sources, which admittedly can lead to the impression that we’re somehow “anti-UPG,” but we’re really not. Some of my most treasured UPG conversations have been with “recons” at the end of a night of revelry and with a drink in hand. We just tend to keep it to ourselves or among trusted friends and, in the age of Facebook, Tumblr and whatever else that encourages us to share every single detail of our lives for public consumption, is there really anything wrong in keeping some things – moreover things we consider &lt;i&gt;sacred&lt;/i&gt; – more private?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – How is reconstructionist heathenry different from other iterations of Norse religion in the last half-century?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – Reconstruction is a technique, it isn’t really a type of religious practice. From that perspective, it’s just another way of getting at information to help forge a modern Norse religion. Having said that, I think the biggest difference is we are trying to get away from the universal ideas that most modern heathens started with. &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/01/interview-with-johanna-g-harardottir-of.html"&gt;Heathenry in Iceland&lt;/a&gt; is different from heathenry in the UK, is different from heathenry in the Northeast of the US, and is likely different from heathenry in Australia. There isn’t anything wrong with that! That’s a good thing. The regional differences of practice are important. Regional religious expression was different throughout the [historical] heathen world. However, we are all working from the same base information set, so even if what we do is different, why we do it should generally be the same. It’s the worldview that is important, not the structure of blót or worship event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YuolrFpDLDg/UPnaaTVYtxI/AAAAAAAAB0o/jVmGhhc-exc/s1600/thor+cologne+worthy+perfume+viking.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YuolrFpDLDg/UPnaaTVYtxI/AAAAAAAAB0o/jVmGhhc-exc/s320/thor+cologne+worthy+perfume+viking.jpg" width="262" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Even thunder gods need help with the ladies, sometimes.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This is the biggest issue I’ve had with books written by heathens. They often write out “this is how you do a ritual blót,” instead of writing “this is the worldview surrounding &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;you do&amp;nbsp;blót.” Then, instead of explaining why we think our ancestors are directly important to us, some folks&amp;nbsp;simply say a particular ancestry is important. No, it doesn’t matter where your ancestors came from. If you lived in a heathen tribe in the old days, and you grew up there, you knew their way of life. You were a heathen. Period. Honoring our ancestors is thanking them for the actions that they took that have led us to where we are today. Old Spice has a tagline on their products: if your grandfather didn’t wear it, you wouldn’t be alive today. Cheeky and a bit odd, but totally true in this context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CH – The biggest difference I can think of here is that non-Norse-focused groups (like Germanic or Anglo-Saxon heathens) tend to be more of a reconstructionist nature. Well, other than those “Seax Wicca” people, but we don’t talk about those. They’re like &lt;i&gt;Fight Club;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;we just don’t talk about them. Other than that, though, I agree with my husband – it’s just a method that happens to have led to the creation of some really cool groups and interesting customs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – How did you two come to the form of heathenry you practice today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PVWD4uK-peg/UPnbDrZEgQI/AAAAAAAAB0w/IDpI99wRF-Q/s1600/the+hammer+and+the+cross+harry+harrison+john+holm+norse+mythology+blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PVWD4uK-peg/UPnbDrZEgQI/AAAAAAAAB0w/IDpI99wRF-Q/s1600/the+hammer+and+the+cross+harry+harrison+john+holm+norse+mythology+blog.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hammer and the Cross&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Harry Harrison &amp;amp; John Holm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – It was the year 1994 or 1995. I had just read a great book called &lt;i&gt;The Hammer and the Cross&lt;/i&gt; by Harry Harrison (may he never be forgotten). I seriously liked it, and I wondered why there weren’t people still worshipping the Norse gods. I kinda left it at that, as well as a 5th grade “research” paper on the Vikings and their religion and travels. That summer, I worked as a volunteer at the local library and came across a term in a book that I couldn’t pronounce, but I was totally sure it was my new religion. That word was &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/06/interview-with-hilmar-orn-hilmarsson-of.html"&gt;Ásatrúarfélagið&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [“Æsir Faith Fellowship”], and – really truly at the time – I had no idea what it meant or said, except the definition was belief in the Norse gods in Iceland. Simple as that, I was hooked and, with internet acces, I learned about another easier to pronounce word: &lt;i&gt;Ásatrú&lt;/i&gt;. I read the websites at the time, learned about the Nine Noble Virtues [a list of moral guidelines created by English heathens in the 1970s] and called it a day. From then till 2004, I met only two other heathens, and I was not impressed by them. So, I wasn’t really much of a heathen. I said I was Ásatrú, but I didn’t really make offerings regularly, and I didn’t even really know all that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleeping in your car changes your life. I sat down and made a ten-year plan while I was living in San Diego in my car. Part of that ten-year plan was to really make Ásatrú/heathenry a part of my life. Not just to believe in it, but to truly live it. I popped back on the internet and began doing some searching again, and I came across several very bad websites – all of them racist garbage. At that point, I almost gave up looking for heathens that were worthwhile, again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-by1ElS1DhKI/UPnblxj506I/AAAAAAAAB04/9CbXV3pDqpU/s1600/asatru+lore+logo+forum+heathen.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="98" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-by1ElS1DhKI/UPnblxj506I/AAAAAAAAB04/9CbXV3pDqpU/s320/asatru+lore+logo+forum+heathen.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The battle-cry of Asatru Lore: "Cite your source!"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Then I stumbled across [the online forum] &lt;a href="http://www.asatrulore.org/"&gt;Asatru Lore&lt;/a&gt;. This site was a major impact on my heathenry. This is where I first learned about recon. This is the site that drove me to really start reading the different versions of the &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt;. This is where I discovered Hilda Ellis Davidson and a multitude of wonderful resources regarding heathen worldviews. This is also where I discovered the Nine Noble Virtues were a pile of crap written down in a vain attempt to collate all of the different cultural norms from the Lore (the collected writing and archaeological evidence we have from the heathen age). Practically every assumption I had regarding heathen religious belief was called into question. The concept of Valhalla was thrown out and replaced with a non-dualist concept of afterlife in the grave mound. Rituals were done for a reason: to create a gifting relationship with the gods based on the concepts of luck and action. I learned a lot there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also learned that a lot of heathens were a**holes. Ha! Asatru Lore has a reputation for having a culture that smacks down people that don’t know anything, hands their hats back and says, “Shut up until you have an idea what you're talking about.” This was not always an easy environment, but I learned a lot in the years I’ve been a member of the site. I look back at my first post and cringe at some of what I suggested.   From there I joined the Army, met my wife – who had been a heathen nearly as long as I had, at that point – met other good heathens and became a part of the Northeast heathen community, even while I was living in South Korea and then Germany. It’s been a long, crazy trip. That’s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR0ck3uV5jo/UPnm_A57hfI/AAAAAAAAB3Y/QhF-40bgHr8/s1600/jesus+christ+baby+dinosaur.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wR0ck3uV5jo/UPnm_A57hfI/AAAAAAAAB3Y/QhF-40bgHr8/s320/jesus+christ+baby+dinosaur.png" width="222" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This picture totally proves that Jesus loves dinosaurs.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;CH – My first “draw” to the Norse gods was when I was eleven and encountered a book of myths during “silent reading” at school. “Silent reading” was basically a half-hour period in which we had to get a book and read silently, and I loved it – well, as long as I had a good book! For some reason, though, this book was different, because I’d read lots of books by that point and had never prayed to the “characters” when I got home from school before! Right here, I’d &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; to say that I’d continued on the path of heathenry, that I had grown good and true and different from my Christian whelp classmates, but that’s not what happened. Especially not when other kids were getting confirmed and getting to drink free wine underage. So, that’s what I did. I got confirmed and lasted as a Christian for less than a year. I remember asking the vicar a lot of uncomfortable questions about Jesus and dinosaurs and not actually liking the wine much, after going out of my way to get confirmed so I could have it. So, I just decided to go back to doing what I was doing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I grew up in a place that might be classified as “the sphincter of the universe,” and the only books that were remotely on the subject in the local library in the mid-1990s were all Wicca-type books. I read a lot of books that talked about things like “magic yonis” and pretty much decided to ignore them and continue just doing what I was doing. When I was younger, I used to spend lots of time on the moors, hanging around the old burial mound or the remains of the chambered cairn and the Viking barns. Over the years, I built up a series of places and my own traditions of things that I did there. Growing up on that land, I was more than aware of the folktales, too, and it was almost instinct to make offerings to the “spirits” at certain places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As 1997 dawned, so did a brave new world: the internet had finally reached the town in which I was attending junior college, and that’s when I abused the college printer, printing out sagas and &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; for free. Not only that, but I found all manner of websites that caused me to have “Oh, shit! That’s like me!” kind of moments (as well as some really neat ones about shrunken heads). That’s when I decided I was a heathen. In all honesty, I thought it sounded stupid saying the word &lt;i&gt;Ásatrú&lt;/i&gt;. It sounded too much like &lt;i&gt;ass&lt;/i&gt; for someone from a town like the one I came from, so &lt;i&gt;heathen&lt;/i&gt; has always been my preferred term. I travelled around a few countries, had a few adventures, got a degree, found a group of other heathens, partied with lots of pagans, moved to Korea, met my husband and ended up on the US heathen radar (for better or for worse). The rest of the story after that is just boring though – something about moving to Germany, getting married, moving to the States and winding up around the good people we are now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-etEqU8dAD3I/UPncusVrJ2I/AAAAAAAAB1E/bhVh_K-_Qlo/s1600/krampus+children+crying+basket+gruss+von+germany.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-etEqU8dAD3I/UPncusVrJ2I/AAAAAAAAB1E/bhVh_K-_Qlo/s320/krampus+children+crying+basket+gruss+von+germany.jpg" width="199" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Krampus says, "Don't cry, little children!&lt;br /&gt;Researching historical religion is fun!"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;As for how I became a reconstructionist, I’ll tell you the secret. There’s a magical being called Recon Krampus that actually scoops up unsuspecting heathens in a big net, puts you in a big room where you are held &lt;i&gt;Clockwork Orange&lt;/i&gt; style, and forces you to listen to sources and academic arguments. It’s really quite traumatic, and I’d appreciate it if you just left this one alone now, Karl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, for real, I just always liked reading and getting to the bottom of mysteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Part Two of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/"&gt;The Norse Mythology Blog&lt;/a&gt; interview with Josh &amp;amp; Cat Heath, the couple will discuss their international work with heathen soldiers.

Do you think he deserved his punishment?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that it depends on whether you decide to read the mythology as a whole or decide to throw out the uncomfortable bits. Personally, I think we have to take everything we know about Loki as a totality and make our judgement accordingly. Let’s look at the evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loki's children turn out evil. Since Darwin won out over Lamarck, we haven’t subscribed to the idea that acquired characteristics can be transmitted to our offspring. Given that there’s no mention of Loki raising his monstrous kids in his household and passing on his values to them, let’s not blame him for the nasty things they do. On the other hand, you should read what I wrote to Cameron (in &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/01/questioning-loki-part-one.html"&gt;Part One&lt;/a&gt;) about our modern sympathy for monsters&amp;nbsp;– a sympathy that would have been completely alien to the worldview from which the Norse myths originate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XsfQPYXSKSY/UPG59dThMeI/AAAAAAAABnk/2x9g7JX7IIU/s1600/loki+children+jormungand+world+serpent+fenrir+fenris+wolf+hel+norse+mythology+norse+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="203" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XsfQPYXSKSY/UPG59dThMeI/AAAAAAAABnk/2x9g7JX7IIU/s320/loki+children+jormungand+world+serpent+fenrir+fenris+wolf+hel+norse+mythology+norse+myth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki's children actually do seem a bit rough, though, don't they?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;SCORE: Evil 0, Cheeky 0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loki has a bunch of adventures in which he gets the gods out of sticky widgets. Admittedly, he usually gets the gods &lt;i&gt;into&lt;/i&gt; these awkward situations in the first place. He really does seem more naughty than evil in these stories, so let’s give him a point on the mischievous side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: Evil 0, Cheeky 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we run into problems. Loki brings about the murder of Balder, the fellow that Snorri Sturluson calls “the wisest of the Æsir [the Norse gods] and most beautifully spoken and most merciful.” You could even call him Christlike. What did Balder ever do to hurt anyone? Nothing. He’s the great innocent of Asgard. With no motivation given in the myths (other than, perhaps, base jealousy), Loki causes Balder’s death. He simply kills the nicest of all the gods. You really can’t read this action as anything other than evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: Evil 1, Cheeky 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PMg-8emac0U/UPG78FboojI/AAAAAAAABo8/o7iHeIxoNGA/s1600/emil+doepler+loki+lokasenna+odin+frigg+ravens.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="215" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PMg-8emac0U/UPG78FboojI/AAAAAAAABo8/o7iHeIxoNGA/s320/emil+doepler+loki+lokasenna+odin+frigg+ravens.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki isn't the greatest guy to have over to the house for a party.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the poem &lt;i&gt;Lokasenna&lt;/i&gt; (“Loki’s Quarrel”), Loki murders a servant named Fimafeng simply because he’s mad that folks were praising the excellence of the waitstaff. He's jealous of waiters, now? Fimafeng is the second innocent killed by Loki. Yikes! Loki then goes on to say nasty, nasty things about each one of the gods and goddesses – until &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; shows up and shuts him up. Although some of the things he says may actually be true, airing people’s private business in public in the nastiest possible way isn’t much better than outright slander, is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SCORE: Evil 2, Cheeky 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here’s the big&amp;nbsp;’un. At the end of mythic time, Loki attacks the gods in the ship Naglfar, which is made from the fingernails and toenails of dead people. Eww, right? Here’s how the scene is described in the poem &lt;i&gt;Völuspá&lt;/i&gt; (“Prophecy of the Seeress”):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A ship journeys from the east, Muspell’s sons [the giants] are coming&lt;br /&gt;over the waves, and Loki steers.&lt;br /&gt;There are the monstrous brood with all the raveners,&lt;br /&gt;The brother of Byleist [Loki] is in company with them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Loki actually drives the gang of giants to come kill the gods in the final battle of Ragnarök. During the ensuing carnage, almost all of the gods are killed, every human being (except two) are killed, and the world is destroyed. Mass murder on a worldwide scale and destruction of the earth itself – could it get any worse? By the end of mythic time, Loki makes Hitler, Stalin and Mao look like amateurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL SCORE: Evil 3, Cheeky 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ad3jvdrbatY/UPG9EFLUMcI/AAAAAAAABqM/h0E9WJ1URhY/s1600/charles+e+brock+thjazi+loki+eagle+norse+myth+mythology.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ad3jvdrbatY/UPG9EFLUMcI/AAAAAAAABqM/h0E9WJ1URhY/s320/charles+e+brock+thjazi+loki+eagle+norse+myth+mythology.jpg" width="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;What happened to you, Loki? You used to be cool.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the end, Loki really is an evil so-and-so. He may have some good times with &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; and Thor in the middle-period stories, but that can’t really balance out the truly evil things he does. I know that a lot of people today want to see Loki as a gothy emo cutie, but that’s really going directly against the source mythology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Loki’s punishment, the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; tells us that Loki is captured after his second murder. He is “bound with the guts of his son Nari,” but the poem doesn’t tell us how those guts were got. While the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; simply says that Loki’s other son “changed into a wolf,” Snorri Sturluson writes in his &lt;i&gt;Prose&amp;nbsp;Edda&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;that this wolf-boy ripped his brother apart (but does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;say that the gods forced him to do so). Given the fact than, in Norse mythology and saga, “changing into a wolf” can mean (1) going into a berserker rage or (2) being branded an outlaw and kicked out of the community, I'm not so sure that we can take the original quote to mean a literal change into an animal. Snorri is notorious for taking poetic images literally, then spinning them out into long-winded explanations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the implication (i.e., not a direct statement) in the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;that the gods kill one of Loki's sons, this is actually not an alien concept to the moral worldview of ancient times. There are many instances in many sources concerning the murder of an enemy's children. This awful act appears in not just in Norse myth and saga, but in the Old Testament, the New Testament, the Koran, Jewish scripture, Greek myth &amp;amp; etc. Although this idea is rightly abhorrent to us today, we should be careful about projecting modern morality onto ancient texts. Seeing Loki as a victim of outrageous cruelty by the gods is a simple misunderstanding of historical cultural realities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sazR8pwiIN4/UPG9uRV6mBI/AAAAAAAABqU/rXenQ0RBFTs/s1600/charles+e+brock+loki+bound+punishment+serpent+snake+sigyn+poison+bowl+earthquake+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sazR8pwiIN4/UPG9uRV6mBI/AAAAAAAABqU/rXenQ0RBFTs/s320/charles+e+brock+loki+bound+punishment+serpent+snake+sigyn+poison+bowl+earthquake+norse+mythology+myth.jpg" width="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Sigyn's favorite song: "Stand by Your Man"&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This complicated business aside, Loki’s subsequent punishment is described by Snorri like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Skadi [the giant maiden in my &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/"&gt;Norse Mythology Blog&lt;/a&gt; logo] took a poisonous snake and fastened it over Loki’s face; poison dripped down from it. Sigyn, Loki’s wife, sat there and held a basin under the poison. But when the basin was full, she carried the poison out; and meanwhile the poison fell on Loki. Then he writhed so violently that all the earth shook from it; these are now called earthquakes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You have to decide whether this is a just punishment for a purely malicious pair of murders, both against completely innocent victims with no real motivation. Binding for (nearly) eternity and snake poison (sometimes) in the face are both pretty nasty things, but the punishment for murder in real life has been pretty nasty, too. I think you need to weigh all the above evidence and information for yourself and make your own judgement&amp;nbsp;– while&amp;nbsp;always keeping in mind the danger of reading today's morality and psychology into yesterday's mythology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Bullard (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) writes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Recently my nephew and I were watching an animated version of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Marvel's Thor&lt;/a&gt; on television that featured the frost giants as the villains. Somewhere in the story, it's mentioned that Loki is actually a jotun [an Old Norse term usually translated as&amp;nbsp;“giant”]&amp;nbsp;like the frost giants and not one of the gods. My nephew picked up on this and asked how Loki could look the same as Thor and the gods, but actually be born a jotun – which were giant icy monsters in the film.&amp;nbsp;It may seem like a silly question, but it was one I remember asking myself as a child when reading Norse stories. Not just about Loki, but about the giants themselves. I guess what I'm asking is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just how giant were the giants? Could they change size? Could the gods change size? Does it even matter? How did so many gods and giants intermarry and have children if the giants were, well, giant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jVxV18qa_1k/UPG-9miaSDI/AAAAAAAABrk/kSzkDb7C6ts/s1600/thor+crying+animated.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jVxV18qa_1k/UPG-9miaSDI/AAAAAAAABrk/kSzkDb7C6ts/s1600/thor+crying+animated.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;What happened to you, Thor? You used to be cool.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Anyone who follows this blog knows that I’ve read a lot of Marvel Comics (and was a bit heartbroken by Kenneth Branagh’s &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/04/almost-interview-with-kenneth-branagh.html"&gt;Thor movie&lt;/a&gt;). I really do love the comic books, and I’m always happy when they lead young people (like your nephew) to the original Norse myths. I’ll address your questions in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giants could definitely change their physical form or, at least, how we see them. The story of Thor’s visit to the hall of Útgarða-Loki shows this; the giant of the tale has the ability to change his outward appearance, and he is a master of illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gods can certainly change size. In the story of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/10/myth-science-thors-fishing-trip.html"&gt;Thor’s fishing trip&lt;/a&gt;, the god of thunder swells to gigantic proportions. The angrier he gets, the larger he gets (like the Hulk), until his feet go through the floor of the boat and rest on the bottom of the ocean as he throws his hammer from on high. That’s pretty big!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As for whether this matters, I’m not sure that it does. I stress to my college students that we shouldn’t try to apply too much of the logic of modern realist literature to ancient tales of gods and giants. Here’s what the Roman writer Tacitus had to say about the Germanic tribes in 98 CE: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They conceive it unworthy the grandeur of celestial beings to confine their deities within walls, or to represent them under a human similitude: woods and groves are their temples; and they affix names of divinity to that secret power, which they behold with the eye of adoration alone.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AoOTR9J04dw/UPG_z1mKYnI/AAAAAAAABrw/V2wMVwZY65Y/s1600/semnonen+hain+semnones+grove+of+fetters+tacitus+germania+emil+doepler.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="198" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AoOTR9J04dw/UPG_z1mKYnI/AAAAAAAABrw/V2wMVwZY65Y/s320/semnonen+hain+semnones+grove+of+fetters+tacitus+germania+emil+doepler.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Note the absence of physically-manifested gods (of any size) hanging about&lt;br /&gt;in&amp;nbsp;Emil Doepler's 1905 illustration of a sacred grove described by Tacitus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This was written over 1,000 years before the &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt;, but it’s interesting to note that the ancient tribes (at least in this reported instance) did not think of their gods in discrete physical terms as walking and talking characters. Gods and giants are mystical beings with fluid characteristics. To get too hung up on physical details is like asking what color God’s beard was before it turned white, or who cuts his hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your question about intermarriage between gods and giants gets right to the heart of the matter. Both Odin and Thor had giantesses for mothers. Njord (god) marries Skadi (giantess) and Frey (god) marries Gerd (giantess). In no instance is there any suggestion that the giantesses are physically larger than the gods. Loki, who is definitely a giant, seems to be smaller than Thor; he even hangs on to Thor’s belt for safety while crossing a raging river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9oAn93DVZhE/UPHBMjugIHI/AAAAAAAABuE/1EHO645ayF0/s1600/dictionary+of+northern+mythology+rudolf+simek.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9oAn93DVZhE/UPHBMjugIHI/AAAAAAAABuE/1EHO645ayF0/s320/dictionary+of+northern+mythology+rudolf+simek.jpg" width="212" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Books are awesome (even ones without pictures)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the end, we should avoid thinking of the giants in terms set by later folklore and popular culture, but try to read the Norse sources with Rudolf Simek’s words in mind: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of giants probably originated in the observation of various natural phenomena, in particular wintery phenomena (hence: frost giants) which overwhelmed human understanding and lay outside the close area of experience of men. Thus giants are natural spirits and among the original inhabitants of the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Think about winter storms. You can have a tiny little snowfall that barely coats the ground or a huge raging blizzard that shuts down schools and causes multiple car accidents. In other words, you can have a tiny giant or a huge giant.

Loki’s three monstrous children (the giant snake, the giant wolf, the half-corpse Hel) were all born of a giantess. Loki seems to have also had two sons with his wife Sigyn, who is a goddess. So, no – Loki doesn’t have half-human children like, for instance, Zeus does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irem Ayar (Turkey) writes: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm a high schooler who is very interested in Norse mythology but, unfortunately, there aren't so many books about it in my country. So I've read some tales on the net (seems like they're from the book &lt;i&gt;The Jotunbok: Working with the Giants of the Northern Tradition&lt;/i&gt;) and loved them very much, but I'm not sure if they're real myths or some talented writers who are inspired by the real myths just wrote them, because I've never heard of these tales before.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;For an example, is there really a myth about the birth of Loki?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I’m very glad to hear from you, and I’m saddened by the lack of access you have to good information. I would steer clear of books like the one you mention, which really have more to do with modern neopaganism than with any actual Norse mythology or historical Norse religion. No, there is no myth about the birth of Loki. That’s the danger of some of these new books – the authors tend to make up information to fill in the gaps in the mythology, but they don’t make it clear what is original and what is modern. J.R.R. Tolkien was also very interested in exploring what could have existed in these blank spots in the Norse myths, but he would never have dared to suggest that his works of fantasy were anything other than modern creations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvUfnwlIaag/UPHCr-nANQI/AAAAAAAABuc/INWV2kG-Nck/s1600/the+children+of+odin+padraic+colum+willy+pogany+first+edition+original+title+page+norse+mythology+myth.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvUfnwlIaag/UPHCr-nANQI/AAAAAAAABuc/INWV2kG-Nck/s320/the+children+of+odin+padraic+colum+willy+pogany+first+edition+original+title+page+norse+mythology+myth.gif" width="256" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/"&gt;The Norse Mythology Blog&lt;/a&gt; recommends&lt;i&gt;The Children of Odin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;If you want to explore the major tales of Norse mythology, I strongly recommend Padraic Colum’s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24737/24737-h/24737-h.htm"&gt;Children of Odin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.

Loki is not referred to by either of these titles in the source texts of Norse mythology. Rudolf Simek calls him “a god without a function,” and all the major scholars of Norse mythology and religion agree that Loki was never actually worshiped in ancient times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that he was a “god of mischief” seems to be connected with modern scholarship that attempts to connect him to Tricksters in other cultures (African, Native American, etc). The portrayal of Loki in &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/a&gt; has strengthened this connection in the popular imagination. The “god of fire” idea is a famous mistake that is due to the similarity between the names Loki and Logi, the latter being a personification of fire in the well-known story of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;’s visit to the giant Útgarða-Loki. The connection to fire was popularized by the composer Richard Wagner in his Ring operas, in which he portrayed Loki as a sort of fire-sprite named Loge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cameron Schick (Erie, Pennsylvania, USA) asks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Why does Loki want to end the gods?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wvebLMgP7bI/UOhngwur9jI/AAAAAAAABbM/K1J0YsJf1UA/s1600/Loki+Edda+manuscript+1760.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wvebLMgP7bI/UOhngwur9jI/AAAAAAAABbM/K1J0YsJf1UA/s320/Loki+Edda+manuscript+1760.jpg" width="250" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;An 18th-century illustration of Loki &amp;amp; his fishing net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;When you get right down to it, nobody knows. There is no motivation provided in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the 13th-century Icelandic books that are the source of much of what we know about Norse mythology.&amp;nbsp;The idea that literary characters have an inner psychological life is a modern concept that can’t actually be found in medieval literature.  The &lt;i&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; provide no interior monologues in which the characters reflect on why they act they way they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it’s very difficult for modern people like you and me to keep from wondering about this issue. From a contemporary perspective, you can view Loki through the lens of the nature versus nurture debate. His behavior can be explained from either end of the spectrum; just remember that we’re projecting a modern way of thinking onto ancient stories. The results say more about how &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; think than about how the people who created these stories may have thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you believe that people are born with an intrinsic predisposition to good or evil, you can read the tales of Loki from that perspective. At the beginning of mythic time, Loki is a giant. The giants are the destructive opponents of the gods, so you could say that Loki is a natural born killer. Loki fathers the most monstrous enemies of the gods: the Midgard serpent, the wolf Fenrir and the death-goddess Hel. He brings the killers of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; and Thor into being.&amp;nbsp;In the mythological present, Loki lives with the gods and is the traveling companion of Odin and Thor who continually gets them both into and out of trouble. In the future of the mythic timeline, Loki will bring about the death of the god Balder and lead the forces of darkness to destroy the world at the final battle of Ragnarök. So, you can interpret this as Loki starting out evil, striving to do good (as best he can) and finally reverting to his evil ways. According to this reading, he can’t escape his nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rTqZ2bcTUOc/UOhor-K8l6I/AAAAAAAABcY/s8RInbdwPWs/s1600/Children+of+Loki+Willy+Pogany+Children+of+Odin+1920+Padraic+Colum+Fenris+Fenrir+Midgard+Serpent+Jormungand+Hel+Hela.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="176" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rTqZ2bcTUOc/UOhor-K8l6I/AAAAAAAABcY/s8RInbdwPWs/s320/Children+of+Loki+Willy+Pogany+Children+of+Odin+1920+Padraic+Colum+Fenris+Fenrir+Midgard+Serpent+Jormungand+Hel+Hela.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki's monstrous children in an illustration by Willy Pogany&lt;br /&gt;from Padraic Colum's &lt;i&gt;Children of Odin&lt;/i&gt; (1920)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;On the other hand, if you believe that it is an individual’s environment and experience that determine character, you can also read the stories about Loki in that light. Some of my students have great sympathy for Loki’s monstrous children. While they are still young, the gods throw the serpent into the depths of the ocean, cruelly bind the wolf and banish Hel to the world of the dead – before any of them have actually done anything to harm the gods. To modern sensibilities, it seems like this mistreatment could have driven Loki to seek revenge. In the world of the myths, however, the gods are acting to protect themselves from a prophecy that declares these three will bring about the Doom of the Gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also ask if the actions of the gods actually turn Loki’s children to evil and therefore make the prophecy come true. Do the gods bring their doom upon themselves? Again, it all depends how you read the myths, but you should always be aware that we are overlaying modern concepts onto ancient tales. In order to put your mind into an ancient worldview (as much as that is actually possible), you have to realize that physical deformity was taken as a sign of evil. This led to horrible mistreatment (in real life) of people who were born with physical challenges. Even in modern times, we are often guilty of judging the character of individuals by their physical appearance. It makes no sense to suggest that long-ago gods would love and cherish children born to a giant in the form of a serpent, a wolf and a half-corpse woman. Although the monsters may seem sympathetic to modern sensibilities, that sympathy would have been completely alien to the culture that invented these stories. Myths reflect the values of the cultures that create them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miguel La Porte (Texas, USA) writes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“I wanted to know if there was any documented story that tells us why Loki was so against the gods, who in reality were his very family.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s a very interesting question. Please check out what I wrote above to Cameron, regarding motivation. I would like to make clear that the gods are not really Loki’s family – at least not his birth family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Snorri Sturluson’s &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;, it says that Loki is “numbered among the Æsir [the gods].” The language is important; Loki may hang out with the gods in several myths, but he is not one of them. He is the son of a giant, and – in the world of the myths – kinship is reckoned through your line of fathers. As a giant, Loki actually belongs to the family of the gods’ greatest enemies. In the end, he sides with his birth family against his adopted family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NdUxahXKl2I/UOhtHr5OOmI/AAAAAAAABdk/P-noCHJ2mwo/s1600/loki+thor+marvel+comics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="305" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NdUxahXKl2I/UOhtHr5OOmI/AAAAAAAABdk/P-noCHJ2mwo/s320/loki+thor+marvel+comics.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor &amp;amp; Loki being adoptive brothers is an idea from comics, not myth&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I’d also like to point out that Loki is not the adopted son of Odin; that’s an idea from Marvel Comics, not Norse mythology. We’re not talking about an adopted son attacking the man who raised and nurtured him. The myths tell us that Loki is the blood-brother of Odin. They swore allegiance, which implies that they are at least somewhat on equal terms and that they may have started as enemies on either side of the god/giant divide. Loki’s attack on the gods violates the oath of brotherhood that he took with Odin&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;as does his causing the murder of Balder, who actually &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; one of Odin’s sons. Oath-breaking and murder were (and are) very serious crimes. In Norse culture, Loki would have been seen as an outlaw; he was someone who committed crimes that meant he could no longer be part of society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hovland (Canada) writes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;“What I want to know is if Loki is just a character who was added to the stories later on, or he was just a minor player, or he was just poorly documented.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loki plays a major part in the Norse myths that have survived. These myths mainly come from two collections – the &lt;i&gt;Prose Edda&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;, both written down in 13th-century Iceland. The oldest written source for Loki is the 9th-century Norwegian poem &lt;i&gt;Haustlöng&lt;/i&gt; (“Autumn-long”), which includes Loki’s adventure with the giant Thjazi. There is no mention of Loki in earlier sources from continental Europe or the British Isles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scholars have been arguing about Loki’s age and origin for very long time. Since his stories come from a time when heathens and Christians interacted, some have argued that he is a late invention (based on Christian demonology) that was inserted into the mythology – or that Christian ideas about devils were incorporated into his character. Others have suggested that the original conception of Loki was a heathen one of a bound giant or of a master thief. As Hilda Ellis Davidson writes, “Other theories which try to establish Loki as an early god in the Germanic world have not been very successful.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b1IoNJ7hi1I/UOhuN32f9lI/AAAAAAAABdw/ZjGA36gfrj0/s1600/snaptun+stone+furnace+fire+loki+closeup+stitches+teeth.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-b1IoNJ7hi1I/UOhuN32f9lI/AAAAAAAABdw/ZjGA36gfrj0/s320/snaptun+stone+furnace+fire+loki+closeup+stitches+teeth.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;When I was a kid, this is exactly how I drew the Hulk's teeth when&lt;br /&gt;he was angry. Since he's &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; angry, I had a lot of practice.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Some people have seen an image of Loki on an ancient furnace stone found on a Danish beach. Interpreting the carving this way is based on a basic misunderstanding of Loki’s nature that considers him a god of fire. Read my answer to Richard (above) for an explanation of this linguistic mistake. We’re left with a circular argument that (wrongly) posits Loki as a god of fire, then defines a random face on a furnace stone as Loki because he’s a god of fire. See how the logic fails? The other argument for this being Loki is that the image supposedly shows stitches on the face’s lips, as in the myth in which an angry dwarf sews Loki’s mouth shut. I think it’s pretty clear from the close-up photo that the vertical lines are simply meant to represent the face's lower teeth. Archeologists have a distressing tendency to associate with a god any representational figure that they can’t immediately explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Yykubrbv-0/UOhv5mqtadI/AAAAAAAABf8/7IeRho64rFo/s1600/kirkby+stephen+stone+loki+bound+giant+devil+satan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3Yykubrbv-0/UOhv5mqtadI/AAAAAAAABf8/7IeRho64rFo/s200/kirkby+stephen+stone+loki+bound+giant+devil+satan.jpg" width="133" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A bound Loki or a bound Satan?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;There is a carving from England that has also been interpreted as representing Loki in the form of a bound giant, waiting for Ragnarök. However, the image is actually found on a fragment of a Christian cross from the late 10th century; England’s conversion to Christianity began way back in the 6th century. Given the late date of the carving, its location and its Christian setting, it can arguably portray a devil or demon from Christian lore. The problem with interpreting this as Loki is that we’re reading backwards from Icelandic mythology and projecting it on an English artifact. Without the Icelandic myth of Loki’s binding, there would be no reason to identify this Christian image as Loki. It’s a flawed argument, like the one for the furnace stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IR_RCiNqGOM/UOhwRt3k3lI/AAAAAAAABgE/vG6RciJGuCY/s1600/gosforth+cross+loki+bound+sif+snake+norse+mythology+norse+myth+christian+crucifix+cross.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IR_RCiNqGOM/UOhwRt3k3lI/AAAAAAAABgE/vG6RciJGuCY/s320/gosforth+cross+loki+bound+sif+snake+norse+mythology+norse+myth+christian+crucifix+cross.jpg" width="154" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki, Sigyn &amp;amp; the snake&lt;br /&gt;on the Gosforth Cross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A different 10th-century cross from England has a figure that may be more convincingly argued as representing Loki. The Gosforth Cross includes an image of a bound figure lying on his back, with a woman holding a bowl above him and what may be a snake hovering above his head. This lines up well with the myth describing Loki being bound by the gods, with his wife Sigyn holding a bowl above his face to catch the venom dripping from the snake hanging above. Although we’re again dealing with a Christian crucifix, elsewhere on the object are images that seem to portray the Norse gods Balder, Heimdall and Vidar. Altogether, the cross has been interpreted as using imagery from Norse mythology to help converted heathens grasp the teachings of their new Christian faith. Again, the late date and the Christian setting of the crucifix mean that it doesn’t tell us anything about Loki that we don’t know from the Icelandic sources. As with the other English cross, we only interpret this figure as Loki because of what we know from the Icelandic manuscripts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting source that may shed some light on all this is&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;History of the Danes&lt;/i&gt;, composed in the 13th century by the Danish writer Saxo Grammaticus. In this massive work, the Norse gods appear in very different forms from those we're used to (which come from Icelandic literature), and the stories themselves are very different. Saxo tells us of a human hero named Thorkil who finds a bound giant when he travels to “a land that knew neither stars nor the light of day but was shrouded in everlasting night.” The story has been connected by scholars to the &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt; tale of Thor’s visit to the giant Útgarða-Loki. In Snorri’s version, Loki travels with Thor, and we interpret the name of the giant as “Loki of the Outer Regions.” In other words, this deceitful fellow is to the giants as Loki is to the gods; he's &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; Loki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The giant in Saxo is also called Útgarða-Loki, but he's a very different figure. Here’s the part of the story describing how Thorkil finds the giant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;After this, with others in front acting as torch-bearers, [Thorkil] squeezed his body in the narrow jaws of the cave and gazed on every side at rows of iron seats festooned with slithering serpents. Next a quiet stretch of water flowing gently over a sandy bed met his eyes. When he had crossed it, he reached a place where the floor sloped downwards rather more steeply. From here the visitors could see a murky, repulsive chamber, inside which they descried Útgarða-Loki, his hands and feet laden with a huge weight of fetters. His rank-smelling hairs were as long and tough as spears of cornel-wood. Thorkil kept one of these as a more visible proof of his labours by heaving at it with his friends till it was plucked from the chin of the unresisting figure; immediately such a powerful stench rolled over the bystanders that they had to smother their nostrils in their cloaks and could scarcely breathe. They had hardly gained the open air when the snakes flew at them from every direction and spat on them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;You’ll have to read the book to find out what happens next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hasq-My0es/UOh-kHfwSRI/AAAAAAAABhQ/Q4tcPF8AHfM/s1600/The+Punishment+of+Loki+Louis+Huard+1900+snake+giant.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_hasq-My0es/UOh-kHfwSRI/AAAAAAAABhQ/Q4tcPF8AHfM/s320/The+Punishment+of+Loki+Louis+Huard+1900+snake+giant.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Louis Huard's illustration of Loki bound&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In this version of the myth, Útgarða-Loki seems to be Loki himself. The scholar E.O.G. Turville-Petre writes that this giant “appears to be Loki, expelled from Asgard [land of the gods] into Utgard [land of the giants], in the form which he took after he had caused the murder of Baldr. He was bound with fetters, and thus he will remain until the Ragnarök.” Note that this giant is bound underground and guarded by poison-spitting snakes, which agrees with the punishment of Loki that we’re familiar with. It also lines up with the image of the bound giant on the cross discussed above, if we decide to interpret that image as a bound giant. As I wrote earlier, some scholars have argued that this idea of Loki as a bound giant is the older version of the character.&amp;nbsp;I hope you now see how difficult it is to move between physical artifacts and literary sources and argue the meaning of one based on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the answer to your question is really that the only definitive things we know about Loki come from late literary sources, either from the time of northern Christian conversion or long after that conversion was completed. There is a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;of scholarship on this issue, and I've merely addressed some of the basic issues here.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/6485402727354863609/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=6485402727354863609&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/6485402727354863609'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/6485402727354863609'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2013/01/questioning-loki-part-one.html' title='QUESTIONING LOKI, Part One'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Your &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; describes Order and Chaos as “the twin forces that even gods cannot hope to understand,” and he spills “the last few drops [of wine] onto the earth as an offering to any old gods that might be around.” Your &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, when in a real bind, prays to any gods that may be listening. How would you describe the nature of the Norse gods – especially as opposed to gods of monotheistic traditions? Has your conception of their nature changed over the many years you’ve thought about this material?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – Of course, and my fiction in no way pretends to cast any light on their nature. Rather, what I’m trying to do is ask questions about the changing nature of belief, the way our perception of the Divine changes to suit our changing society, and to ask the question &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; we need those gods in the first place.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – Your characterization of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-three.html"&gt;Sleipnir&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. He’s the carving on Red Horse Hill come to life, and you explain his eight legs by saying that he “has a foot in each World except in Pan-daemonium.” You describe him like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;It looked like some madman’s dream of a horse. The body’s proportions were almost right; but the legs – all eight of them, no less – were grotesquely long and thin, like the legs on a midsummer crane fly, digging so far into the ground that they might have been the roots of trees and reaching so far above her that Maddy had to tilt her head back to see the creature standing over her, its colours like St. Sepulchre’s Fire, obliterating half the sky.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9ph5G7hpOuc/UHhSQrllu8I/AAAAAAAABLw/Ax_RaZ18PF8/s1600/Tja%CC%88ngvide+Rundata+Gotland+Runic+Inscription+110+G+110+Viking+Age+image+stone+picture+Swedish+Ljugarn+Gotland+Sweden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9ph5G7hpOuc/UHhSQrllu8I/AAAAAAAABLw/Ax_RaZ18PF8/s320/Tja%CC%88ngvide+Rundata+Gotland+Runic+Inscription+110+G+110+Viking+Age+image+stone+picture+Swedish+Ljugarn+Gotland+Sweden.jpg" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Valkyrie &amp;amp; Sleipnir on the&amp;nbsp;Tjängvide image stone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;This seems a spot-on description of the &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-four.html"&gt;Valkyrie&lt;/a&gt; welcoming Sleipnir on the Tjängvide stone, down to the red color. Elsewhere in &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;, Sleipnir appears as “a regular horse – a strawberry roan with a long black mane.”&amp;nbsp;Throughout the books, you make a distinction between the physical appearance of the gods (and associated characters) and their true Aspects – how they manifest in more purely spiritual forms. This ties in with a discussion in modern heathenry that asks whether the gods are physical beings or disembodied Powers, whether they are actual or metaphorical. Would you explain your concept of Aspect? Aside from its use as it a plot device, how do you think this idea relates to modes of religious belief, both ancient and contemporary?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I think it relates to both. In &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, the gods have mostly lost their divinity as new beliefs took over. Of course, this is the way the &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt; depicts the gods – as warlords &lt;i&gt;pretending&lt;/i&gt;they were gods in a world where Christianity was gaining popularity. But in &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;, the gods rebuild Asgard and re-acquire their godlike Aspects. This could be seen as a metaphor, if you like, of the way paganism has grown over the last few decades.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The idea of Aspect gives room to believe in either the physical &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; the metaphorical, as we choose. It suggests that – although our perceptions of the Divine may differ radically from one another – we all see some version of the truth and take from it whatever we can.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--wI8YCcMhtA/UHhVr8DrOKI/AAAAAAAABME/A_Koq4cVu0Y/s1600/Odin+der+Go%CC%88ttervater+enthroned+weapons+wolves+and+ravens+hugin+munin+geri+freki+1880+Wa%CC%88gner+Wilhelm+1882+Nordisch-germanische+Go%CC%88tter+und+Helden+Otto+Spamer+Carl+Emil+Doepler.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--wI8YCcMhtA/UHhVr8DrOKI/AAAAAAAABME/A_Koq4cVu0Y/s320/Odin+der+Go%CC%88ttervater+enthroned+weapons+wolves+and+ravens+hugin+munin+geri+freki+1880+Wa%CC%88gner+Wilhelm+1882+Nordisch-germanische+Go%CC%88tter+und+Helden+Otto+Spamer+Carl+Emil+Doepler.jpg" width="272" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;1882 Carl Emil Doepler illustration of Odin enthroned with&lt;br /&gt;spear (Gungnir),&amp;nbsp;ravens (Hugin &amp;amp; Munin) &amp;amp; wolves (Geri &amp;amp; Freki)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Both novels are full of very subtle yet very deep use of Norse mythology. Concepts from Norse myth are put into action, such as Odin using rune magic to free himself from chains – which is &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/odin-runes-part-five.html"&gt;one of the powers he brags about&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Hávamál&lt;/i&gt;. There is a real attention paid to mythic detail, such as Odin only drinking “a little wine” when sitting down to a meal, echoing &lt;i&gt;Grímnismál&lt;/i&gt;’s “on wine alone the weapon-magnificent Odin always lives.” You’ve studied Medieval Languages and Old Norse, but you’ve written that you “don’t do very much research, and if can get away without doing any, I will. I use reference books and the internet when I need specific details on something, but most of the time I write about topics where I already have some knowledge, or where I have access to someone who can give me first-hand information.” How has your formal study of language affected your writing on these mythological subjects? How does your intellectual study of the subject interact with creative inspiration in your writing process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – I’ve always been interested in mythology and religion. You might see it as a lifetime’s study, which is what I mean when I say I don’t do much research. I’ve been reading about the Norse myths since I was seven years old, and I guess it was inevitable that a lot of what I’d read would find its way into the story on some level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, while I was writing &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, I started to teach myself Old Icelandic, which I found unexpectedly rewarding, both in terms of reading texts in the original – and arguing about translation! – and in terms of the insight that learning a language gives you about the priorities and preoccupations of a culture. Some of this also found its way into the books; I’m not sure how much. I allow the ideas that interest me to enter the story through intellectual osmosis rather than any kind of formal planning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzeeNBcVcqQ/UHhUMkvrzMI/AAAAAAAABL4/-dy4mFDpSmY/s1600/Loki+Appear+flickering+fire+Encircle+the+rock+with+thy+flame+Loge+Appear+Arthur+Rackham+painting+illustration+1910+The+Rhinegold+and+the+Valkyrie+Richard+Wagner+cycle+ring+of+the+nibelung+nibelungen+rheingold+walkure.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EzeeNBcVcqQ/UHhUMkvrzMI/AAAAAAAABL4/-dy4mFDpSmY/s320/Loki+Appear+flickering+fire+Encircle+the+rock+with+thy+flame+Loge+Appear+Arthur+Rackham+painting+illustration+1910+The+Rhinegold+and+the+Valkyrie+Richard+Wagner+cycle+ring+of+the+nibelung+nibelungen+rheingold+walkure.jpg" width="210" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Wotan (Odin) &amp;amp; Loge (Loki) in a 1910 Arthur Rackham&lt;br /&gt;painting&amp;nbsp;illustrating Wagner's&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ring of the Nibelungen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Your version of Loki is reminiscent of Richard Wagner’s Loge. In &lt;i&gt;Der Ring des Nibelungen&lt;/i&gt;, the German composer conflates Loki with the &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;’s Logi, who is wildfire personified. You give “Wildfire” as one of Loki’s many names (as well as the meaning of his runemark) and associate the Trickster with fire throughout both novels. Your description of him as “a slim red-haired person” – coupled with his link to flame – reminded me of one of Arthur Rackham’s classic illustrations for the &lt;i&gt;Ring&lt;/i&gt;. Was the version created by Wagner and Rackham a source for your character, or does he come from some other creative place entirely?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – No, this is always how I’ve envisaged Loki. As a child, I wrote a great deal about him and did a great number of drawings. Looking back at some of them now, it’s clear that my early pictures and descriptions of Loki are very similar to the way I describe him in &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;. I only discovered Rackham later, when I developed a passion for the Pre-Raphaelites and their artistic descendants. For a long time, my only visual point of reference for Loki and the Norse gods was a book by H.A. Guerber called &lt;i&gt;The Myths of the Norsemen&lt;/i&gt;, which contains a number of illustrations. Like a child watching a bad movie based on a favorite story, I felt that the gods were not portrayed at all as I imagined them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWY8y-e50y4/UHhW23fA_rI/AAAAAAAABMM/0F8uFwllNts/s1600/thor+hammer+Mjo%CC%88lnir+legends+of+valhalla+cartoon+animated+movie+film+norse+myth+norse+mythology+blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oWY8y-e50y4/UHhW23fA_rI/AAAAAAAABMM/0F8uFwllNts/s320/thor+hammer+Mjo%CC%88lnir+legends+of+valhalla+cartoon+animated+movie+film+norse+myth+norse+mythology+blog.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor &amp;amp; his talking hammer in &lt;i&gt;Legends of Valhalla: Thor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horror! The horror!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – In &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, Loki gives Sugar a common pebble marked with runes that “make a sigil that was unmistakably Loki’s” – a plot device similar to one M.D. Lachlan’s Loki uses in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/08/interview-with-m-d-lachlan-wolfsangel.html"&gt;Wolfsangel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;’s hammer appears as a sort of wisecracking midget, a bit like the talking hammer in Iceland’s &lt;i&gt;Legends of Valhalla&lt;/i&gt; animated film. Your works predate both of these others, and I’m not saying there’s any cross-pollination here; similar source material often leads to independent arrival at similar ends. I’m just curious about your relationship to contemporary fantasy, whether in literature or film. Do you keep up with the latest releases? Do you follow modern fantasy or steer clear of it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pqojl3J1AaU/UHhX50fW42I/AAAAAAAABMU/tBrlDaRbytk/s1600/thor+deities+and+demigods+dungeons+and+dragons+tsr.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pqojl3J1AaU/UHhX50fW42I/AAAAAAAABMU/tBrlDaRbytk/s320/thor+deities+and+demigods+dungeons+and+dragons+tsr.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor's actually pretty awesome in the Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deities &amp;amp; Demigods&lt;/i&gt; manual. Check out his hit points!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I’m not familiar any of the works you mention, but there are so many Norse-related stories out there that it’s not surprising if there’s cross-pollination. So many of these stories and characters are archetypal – it’s what makes them so familiar. I don’t avoid modern fantasy at all – or if I do it’s because of the pressures of time rather than indifference. On the other hand, there is an awful lot of it, and nowadays I find it hard to know what to choose. I loved George R.R. Martin’s &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; books – I was into the series long before it became fashionable – but there’s a lot of indifferent material out there, and I’m tired of reading fantasy books that read like a game of D&amp;amp;D.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ePsz8lEHbho/UHhQadwbwXI/AAAAAAAABLg/HSTkqatctfg/s1600/runelight+cover+joanne+harris+thor+thors+hammer+mjolnir+norse+myth+mythology+blog+interview+runemarks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ePsz8lEHbho/UHhQadwbwXI/AAAAAAAABLg/HSTkqatctfg/s320/runelight+cover+joanne+harris+thor+thors+hammer+mjolnir+norse+myth+mythology+blog+interview+runemarks.jpg" width="208" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor's hammer&amp;nbsp;Mjölnir on the &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; cover&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – The &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Marvel Comics version of Thor&lt;/a&gt; has been around for over fifty years, and the series has built up a deep mythology of its own. It pervades popular culture, and it’s sometimes hard for the iconic imagery and characterization of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and other contributors &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to seep into our own imaginings. I see a similar impetus in Lee and Kirby moving Thor’s adventures to contemporary New York and your own desire “to explore the humour of the legends and to make them accessible to a different readership.” Have you ever been a reader of the comic? Did the successes and failures of the series affect the design of your own mythological world in any way?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;JH – I’m not familiar with the Marvel comics – I wasn’t allowed comics as a child – though I have seen and enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/04/almost-interview-with-kenneth-branagh.html"&gt;the movie &lt;i&gt;Thor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As for the design of the world, it wasn’t really a conscious thing. My version of Inland and its inhabitants has evolved over a very long time – and, I suspect, will continue to do so for as long as I write these stories.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GMp7BkgoUzs/UHhcayC3hAI/AAAAAAAABNw/BWHEnNgDRKM/s1600/loki+figure+figurine+statue+runemarks+runelight+joanne+harris+wendy+froud+yoda+norse+myth+norse+mythology+blog+interview.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GMp7BkgoUzs/UHhcayC3hAI/AAAAAAAABNw/BWHEnNgDRKM/s320/loki+figure+figurine+statue+runemarks+runelight+joanne+harris+wendy+froud+yoda+norse+myth+norse+mythology+blog+interview.jpg" width="220" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki figure by Wendy Froud&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – These two books have already manifested themselves in various media. Random House filmed a moody “book trailer” for &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, and you’ve held a contest for fan-made &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; videos. I first discovered your books by stumbling across the &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; audiobook. Our mutual friend Becca Maravolo has created a line of &lt;a href="http://www.thesilverbough.com/runemarks-pendants.shtml"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;-inspired jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, and Yoda designer Wendy Froud has created a Loki figurine modeled on your version of the Trickster. Leaving aside purely financial considerations, how would you most like to see Maddy’s adventures translated – audio drama, graphic novel, TV series, feature film, puppet show or prog rock concept album? Would you rather see the book remain a book, or do you look forward to collaborating with artists in other media to create a new version of your work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="267.1875" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eUd8M-e61Zc?" width="475"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXM9CoesL8/UHhhcCNzQII/AAAAAAAABPE/z7YBlIp4hFA/s1600/Joanne+Harris+portrait+picture+photo+photograph+runemarks+runelight+norse+myth+mythology+blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXM9CoesL8/UHhhcCNzQII/AAAAAAAABPE/z7YBlIp4hFA/s320/Joanne+Harris+portrait+picture+photo+photograph+runemarks+runelight+norse+myth+mythology+blog.jpg" width="201" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Joanne Harris wanders on ancient paths&lt;br /&gt;Photograph by Jennifer Robertson&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JH – I’d love to see what people make of my books, regardless of the medium. I’ve seen a great deal of fan art and fan fiction, much of it very imaginative. It just goes to show what affection there is for these characters. Of course I would like to see a film, as long as I could choose the director. I’d love to work with Guillermo del Toro, for instance, and if anyone ever felt like developing &lt;i&gt;Asgard! The Musical&lt;/i&gt;, I’d be their friend for life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Many, many months (and sixteen single-spaced pages of notes) after I first asked you for an interview, that’s finally the end of my questions! There’s definitely a depth of concept in your work, and I feel we’ve only scratched the surface here. Thank you for your patience and willingness to dig into these matters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – Well, thank &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;for your very interesting questions. I don’t think I’ve spoken as much to anyone on the subject of my personal beliefs, or spent quite so long on a single interview. But I really enjoyed it.

While runologists agree that historical rune usage made no distinctions regarding the direction a runic text was written in – or even the orientation of any given rune in relation to its neighbors – some pagans today have worked up a complex system of rune-orientation based more on tarot divination and the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;I Ching&lt;/i&gt; than on what little is known of northern pre-Christian divinatory practice. You have written, “I don’t belong to any gang, political, religious or otherwise. And I’m allergic to words that end in –&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;ist&lt;/i&gt;.” Understood. I’m just curious about your relationship to historical and modern paganism as a creative artist. Are your ideas about rune magic inspired more by ancient or modern conceptions?&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Are you more interested in how the runes were used in pre-conversion Europe or how they’re used in the modern world?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CqYxUcFSi1A/UGMxwu7uOMI/AAAAAAAABJI/H4oPikTPLFA/s1600/fava+bean+runes+crystals.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="227" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CqYxUcFSi1A/UGMxwu7uOMI/AAAAAAAABJI/H4oPikTPLFA/s320/fava+bean+runes+crystals.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;"Fava Bean Elder Futhar Rune Set"&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. "Futhar" runes made from fava beans.&lt;br /&gt;Sold as "perfect for those practicing Italian witchcraft."&lt;br /&gt;What.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I don’t think we can truly know how the runes were originally used. We can try to guess – and there are clues to be found, both in ancient texts and in the original languages – but my view is that belief in magic, like belief in religion, is a very personal thing. Blind adherence to rules set out a thousand or two thousand years ago is as pointless as trying to pretend that scientific advancement has not changed our perception of the Divine. My attitude is this: if it works for you, then that’s the way to do it for you. It may not work for anyone else, but that isn’t your problem. To paraphrase &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Siddharta&lt;/i&gt;, everyone follows his own path. If you’re following anyone else – even me – you’re going the wrong way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;My interest in runes spans both the ancient and modern beliefs. I included rune-casting in the “modern pagan” sense because, regardless of its usage (or not) in earlier times, it has been assimilated into modern practice to fit changing times and attitudes. This I think is perfectly acceptable; we should not feel constrained to think backward in terms of spirituality, but to build on whatever wisdom we have inherited.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_oc37zyfkI/UGMzaBo6TRI/AAAAAAAABJQ/xg7i7JwvFtA/s1600/journey+into+mystery+97+marvel+comics+mighty+thor+lava+man+tales+of+asgard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z_oc37zyfkI/UGMzaBo6TRI/AAAAAAAABJQ/xg7i7JwvFtA/s320/journey+into+mystery+97+marvel+comics+mighty+thor+lava+man+tales+of+asgard.jpg" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Earthquakes are actually caused by the&lt;br /&gt;Amazing Lava Man. Everybody knows &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – At one point in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, Maddy thinks through the various explanations of earthquakes she’s been given. One ties them to the writhing of the World Serpent at the root of the World Tree; one connects them to a semi-Christian idea of the struggles of wicked souls in the underworld as they wait for the End of Days. Odin provides a third explanation, telling Maddy about “rivers of fire under the earth and avalanches of hot mud and mountains boiling over like kettles; but this seemed to Maddy to be the least likely explanation of all, and she was inclined to believe that he had exaggerated the tale, as he did so many things.” This can be read as fairly accurate representation of the struggle between religious belief and scientific understanding here in the United States, unfortunately! Religion offers simple answers and eternal truths; science asks for complex thought and constant questioning. How would you describe the relationship between religion and science in the United Kingdom today?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I guess we have the same conflicts as in the US. We in the UK tend to inherit the US’s social problems somewhere along the line, including some of the more extreme manifestations of religious mania. We have not yet gone so far as to teach creationism in our schools, but it’s only a matter of time. Already a number of Catholic schools have refused to allow their female pupils to take a vaccine that protects them against cervical cancer on the grounds that it would “encourage immorality.” The heart sinks at such stupidity. But . . .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAGjDLISBfY/UGM1pn2Y4cI/AAAAAAAABJY/CQ_BqIT4AuA/s1600/the+tragicall+history+of+the+life+and+death+of+doctor+fautus+christopher+marlowe+devil.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="248" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DAGjDLISBfY/UGM1pn2Y4cI/AAAAAAAABJY/CQ_BqIT4AuA/s320/the+tragicall+history+of+the+life+and+death+of+doctor+fautus+christopher+marlowe+devil.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Doctor Faustus making a deal with the Devil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I don’t believe the role of religion should be to offer “simple answers.” Like Goethe’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Faust&lt;/i&gt;– as opposed to Marlowe’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Doctor Faustus&lt;/i&gt;– I think that the human condition is to strive, and that as soon as we stop striving (to explore, to understand, to create, to live in harmony with each other), then we have lost our way. In ancient times, our perception of the divine was limited by our limited knowledge of the world around us. At that time, it was perfectly acceptable to believe in such things as a flat earth or a physical Hell, to see perfectly natural phenomena as part of a supernatural universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The God of the Old Testament (and elsewhere) is a very primitive depiction of the divine – as represented by some very primitive people living in a primitive time, who see him as a kind of vengeful warlord with a mentality as barbaric as their own. The God of the New Testament is very different. Two thousand years later, even aspects of the New Testament (the Immaculate Conception, etc.) are being disputed by the church, and many parts of the Old Testament (e.g., stoning your son for drunkenness, not wearing mixed fibers, human sacrifice, etc.) have been dismissed by most as no longer valid in a modern context.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;What I’m saying is that, as our knowledge of the universe has expanded, so should our appreciation of the divine. I don’t see science and religion as mutually exclusive. The world is changing constantly. So must our assumptions. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZBPQoRi068/UGM3vlDrNZI/AAAAAAAABJg/a49tUXJNV8A/s1600/Vo%CC%88luspa%CC%81+words+of+the+seeress+prophetess+anker+eli+petersen+faroe+islands+postage+stamp.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZBPQoRi068/UGM3vlDrNZI/AAAAAAAABJg/a49tUXJNV8A/s320/Vo%CC%88luspa%CC%81+words+of+the+seeress+prophetess+anker+eli+petersen+faroe+islands+postage+stamp.jpg" width="216" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;How much can we trust the &lt;i&gt;Völuspá&lt;/i&gt; prophetess?&lt;br /&gt;Faroe Islands postage stamp by Anker Eli Petersen&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Your novels contain several clever examples of folk etymology. &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Æsir&lt;/i&gt; is linked to &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Seer-Folk&lt;/i&gt;, which is reminiscent of Snorri Sturluson’s idea that the Æsir came from Asia. This is an interesting take on oral transmission and transmutation. You’ve written that “no-one had written [the Norse myths] down at the time, and the fullest accounts came from Christian chroniclers centuries later, and were at best, incomplete, and at worst, badly distorted.” In &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, Loki says that “there’s rather a lot the Oracle didn’t foretell, and old tales have a habit of getting twisted.” The tagline for &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; is “Never trust an Oracle,” and there’s a suggestion that &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Völuspá&lt;/i&gt; simply contains the untrustworthy words of a prophetess, not a statement of fact or religious dogma. I really like your idea that the myths may not tell the whole truth, which ties in with the debate (among both scholars and heathens) about the trustworthiness of the surviving mythology as an actual record of pre-Christian belief. Many of your characters were worshiped as living gods in the ancient North (and in modern pagan revivals), and we know that at least &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; actual religious belief is recorded in the myths. How do you personally see the relationship of religion, myth and literature? How does it affect you as an author to know that some readers literally worship the characters your write about?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4S6dOGmUsRE/UGM5NML0vFI/AAAAAAAABJo/9_rG0K8P58U/s1600/runemarks+joanne+harris+cover+thor+maddy+modi+sugar+loki+odin+norse+mythology+myth+blog+interview.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4S6dOGmUsRE/UGM5NML0vFI/AAAAAAAABJo/9_rG0K8P58U/s320/runemarks+joanne+harris+cover+thor+maddy+modi+sugar+loki+odin+norse+mythology+myth+blog+interview.jpg" width="211" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Some selected Norse gods on the &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; cover&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I don’t see the gods of&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt; Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; as my characters or my property, and I hope I’ve left enough leeway in my fiction for my Ásatrú readers to understand that I am not in any way trying to make fun of the gods they worship. What I’m trying to do in my way is to demonstrate how stories evolve and how heroes – be they religious figures, historical figures or both – cast long shadows in their wake. These shadows become part of the oral and written tradition and, as centuries pass, are embellished, rewritten and re-interpreted by successive generations. Thus a hero can become a god or a god dwindle into legend. I hope I haven’t offended anyone who truly believes; that was never my intention.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – Your portrayal of the Order – the new religion that basically takes over after Ragnarök – is pretty grim. You write that the Order’s “temples were built on the ruins of springs and barrows and standing stones that once were sacred to an older faith” and that its members kill animals born with runemarks, take babies born with runemarks away from their parents, empty pagan barrows and reconsecrate them, and hang and burn pagans as people “who were in fact the servants of the enemy, and therefore had no souls to save.” You have written that you don’t hate Christians or “the Catholic Church, organized religion or any other kind of religious group. What I do hate is intolerance, repression, moral superiority, the concepts of original sin, holy war and eternal damnation, plus the various acts that certain individuals are willing to perpetrate in the name of their religion, certain that God is on their side.” Without ever mentioning Christianity in your novels, it’s pretty clear that the Order is a mythologized version of the Church, since so many of your examples parallel the actual (and often violent) history of northern conversion. There are a vast number of ways to turn Norse mythology into modern fiction (cf. J.R.R. Tolkien’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;, M.D. Lachlan’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Wolfsangel&lt;/i&gt;, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Thor&lt;/i&gt;, etc.), but you chose to focus on the (literarily transformed) clash between paganism and Christianity. Why did you choose this particular aspect?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGbyUiTZCxc/UGM6ML982BI/AAAAAAAABJw/JShbAzj4oj0/s1600/pendle+witches+hanged+at+the+gallows.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGbyUiTZCxc/UGM6ML982BI/AAAAAAAABJw/JShbAzj4oj0/s320/pendle+witches+hanged+at+the+gallows.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Today, there's a lot of talk about a war on religion and a war on women.&lt;br /&gt;Way back in 1612, the ladies of Pendle &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; had it rough.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – Because it is the closest thing to what really happened to our indigenous beliefs. In Pendle, not far from where I live, there are still gibbets where witches were hanged. In Europe, the early Christian church was responsible for centuries of gruesome persecution – as well as the destruction of many precious ancient texts – in the attempt to stamp out all previous beliefs. There’s a reason they’re called the Dark Ages. And to think that certain people are trying to take us back there . . .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, I still dispute that the Order is a mythologized version of Christianity. For a start, no mention of Christ, or any Christ-figure is ever made. In parenthesis, can I say that I do believe in the historical figure of Jesus, though not in his divinity? To me, he is a marvelous example of a truly wise man whose excellent advice – to be good to each other – has been shanghaied throughout history by people who have twisted his words to fit their twisted agenda. Christianity is not the only patriarchal religion in the world, and – as far as I’m concerned – they are all equally to blame for the spread of intolerance, hypocrisy, religious hatred and holy war. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Rant over. Moving on . . .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-js-WO0XieBo/UGM7KEb8MbI/AAAAAAAABJ4/3eBmJlNImP8/s1600/the+new+yorker+cover+between+burqa+and+nun.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-js-WO0XieBo/UGM7KEb8MbI/AAAAAAAABJ4/3eBmJlNImP8/s320/the+new+yorker+cover+between+burqa+and+nun.jpg" width="232" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Stuck in the middle with you . . .&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – In &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;, Maggie (at least at the beginning) is a dedicated believer in the Order. She wears “a white headscarf of the type World’s Enders called the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;bergha&lt;/i&gt;,” which seems clearly connected to the burqa worn by traditional Muslim women. She has been trained to be unimaginative, to be obedient – and she responds emotionally to language “of sacrifice, and power, and mysteries.” You also mention “wealthy Outlanders with their strings of wives, veiled from head to foot in black, dark eyes modestly lowered.” Given your statements about religious intolerance and repression, was this meant to point out commonalities in the treatment of women in Christian and Muslim societies?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – Absolutely. And remember, traditional Muslim dress is not so different to the way in which women in Europe traditionally dressed,or the way modern nuns still veil their heads and shoulders. Remember too that – during the first part of the Middle Ages – a woman wearing men’s clothing was punishable by death; the charge was, officially, heresy. It’s one of the reasons they burnt Joan of Arc, who also casts a long shadow. Throughout history, there have been religious taboos over male and female clothing; the Koran and the Sunnah are filled with rules about what men and women can and can’t wear. I have simply transferred some of this to my story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/3250054252835107253/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=3250054252835107253&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/3250054252835107253'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/3250054252835107253'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/09/interview-with-joanne-harris-runemarks_26.html' title='INTERVIEW WITH JOANNE HARRIS (&lt;i&gt;RUNEMARKS&lt;/i&gt; &amp; &lt;i&gt;RUNELIGHT&lt;/i&gt;), Part Four'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Two of them have a swastika tattoo, “not a runemark, exactly, but a sign of allegiance to Chaos in one of its darkest, most sinister forms.” The teenage boys in the novels (including Adam Scattergood) are all delightfully disgusting, which got me wondering about the target audience for these books. I remember reading &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Tiger Eyes&lt;/i&gt; by Judy Blume as a teen and thinking, “Whoot! I don’t think boys are meant to be reading this!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; seem aimed at smart tomboys – Maggie is “too tall; too boyish; too clever; too pert; unwilling to play the seduction games played by other girls of her age.” This is totally understandable (and welcome), given the adolescent male fantasy of so much genre fiction (I’m looking at you, DC Comics editors and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; producers). Aside from your daughter, were you writing with a specific audience in mind? What sort of response have you gotten from young women? From young men? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I rarely think about my target audience. In this case I did – but my audience was an audience of one [my daughter], and I wasn’t thinking further than that. Later I began to receive fan mail, and realized that my audience is too diverse to be easily categorized.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i9qG3ST3jUA/UFNpW3PfnqI/AAAAAAAABHI/8PzKTnPVV7k/s1600/joanne+harris+runemarks+runelight+interview+picture+pic+photograph+photo+portrait+norse+mythology+myth+blog.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="307" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i9qG3ST3jUA/UFNpW3PfnqI/AAAAAAAABHI/8PzKTnPVV7k/s320/joanne+harris+runemarks+runelight+interview+picture+pic+photograph+photo+portrait+norse+mythology+myth+blog.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; author Joanne Harris&lt;br /&gt;Photograph by Jennifer Robertson&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I get a lot of letters from young people, of course, although some of my most persistent fans are women in their fifties. Boys write to me, as well as girls, and I’m glad to see that my publishers haven’t tried to direct the readership by suggesting that this is a “girl book” rather than a “boy book.” I don’t like the book apartheid that has sprung up over the past few decades or the ridiculous marketing of books with glittery pink covers – sometimes with a little free necklace or bracelet, as if a book needed to come with some kind of jewelry to appeal to girls – designed to indoctrinate little girls into conforming early.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;My young readers, male or female, are &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; fans to a man (or woman). I think that, in many ways, Loki is the true hero of the books – even more so than Maddy. I’ve already spoken a little about Loki’s appeal, but I sense that my young readers see him as a reflection of themselves; they understand his feelings of alienation, so common in adolescence, and they enjoy his sense of humor and his irreverence towards authority. They like Maddy, too; but most of the time, it is Loki who has their heart.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l-jHRx0cN-o/UFNrapsXttI/AAAAAAAABHQ/v4opxRVxMqc/s1600/runemarks+runelight+maddy+fingering+rune+runes+thor+fan+art+les+kanturek.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="263" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l-jHRx0cN-o/UFNrapsXttI/AAAAAAAABHQ/v4opxRVxMqc/s320/runemarks+runelight+maddy+fingering+rune+runes+thor+fan+art+les+kanturek.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Maddy practices rune fingerings as red-bearded Thor looms behind&lt;br /&gt;Art by Les Kanturek&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Early on, Maddy works rune magic by drawing runes on the ground with a stick. The rune-shapes are not magical in themselves; they need to be activated with a spark: “&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;That&lt;/i&gt;was the only true magic involved. Anyone familiar with the runes – which were only letters, after all, taken from an ancient language – could learn to write them. The trick, Maddy knew, was to set them to work.” This usage of runes echoes the practice attested in Norse mythology, like &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; carving and staining the runes in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Hávamál&lt;/i&gt;. The more striking rune-magic in the novels, though, is the casting with finger-shapes. You have a great &lt;a href="http://joanne-harris.co.uk/v3site/books/runemarks/fingerings.html"&gt;demonstration of runic fingerings&lt;/a&gt; on your website. What were the influences on your development of the fingering system?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Jan Fries and his book, &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Helrunar&lt;/i&gt;. It was my main starting-point for developing the runes, interpreting their meanings and developing the “fingering” system that Maddy uses. The original source material of the Norse legends never explains all the methods in which runes are used, although study of Old Icelandic tells me that there are many, many different uses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xNmVV9Jvtwc/UFNscEp3BWI/AAAAAAAABHY/xIWmtkQ05sU/s1600/rune+might+history+and+practices+of+the+early+20th+century+german+rune+magicians+runic+yoga+postures+stances.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xNmVV9Jvtwc/UFNscEp3BWI/AAAAAAAABHY/xIWmtkQ05sU/s320/rune+might+history+and+practices+of+the+early+20th+century+german+rune+magicians+runic+yoga+postures+stances.jpg" width="216" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;You can find a lot of weird stuff on the internet&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, I needed something simple and graphic enough to be easily visualized. Jan Fries puts heavy emphasis on “rune stances” – almost like yogic postures – to recreate the rune-shapes, but although a physical expression of the rune-shape seemed like a good idea to me, I found whole-body rune-shapes impractical.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;And so I decided on finger-shapes, a shorthand form of the rune stance, partly because as a child I remember my great-grandmother making the sign against the evil eye with her fingers – the same sign I’ve used for the rune Yr in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;– and explaining that it was for protection against bad spirits. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – I’m curious about your use of the Bjarkan rune. The source poems all agree that the rune simply means “birch” or “birch twig,” and their verses are clearly about the tree or shrub. In the world of your novels, however, the fingering of this particular rune is peered through to gain “truesight” – to see the hidden trails of magic that light up the world when seen through the rune-shape, to see the “true colors” of the beings that surround you. It’s one of the most distinctive runes in your books, and many characters use it to gain insight. Why did you choose this particular rune to invest with this ability?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RIh-9muS_fI/UFNtSDL_w_I/AAAAAAAABHg/_tYPLWCnRcI/s1600/birch+trees+moonlight+moon+forest+night.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="254" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RIh-9muS_fI/UFNtSDL_w_I/AAAAAAAABHg/_tYPLWCnRcI/s320/birch+trees+moonlight+moon+forest+night.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Mystic moonlight, bright birch&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I’m going with the connection between Beorc/Bjarkan and the Old High German word &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;bar&lt;/i&gt; (Old Icelandic &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;berr&lt;/i&gt;) meaning naked, open, bare – as well as the fact that birch trees are so immediately visible among the trees in the forest. It’s a tenuous link, I know, but it’s a possible interpretation. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – Each section of the novels has a bind-rune frontispiece. Did you design these yourself? Do they have specific meanings related to the events they precede?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH - I designed them with my editor, who has become a very enthusiastic participant. They can be deconstructed to make a kind of shorthand accompaniment to the chapter. Some of my young readers are also very enthusiastic in decoding these bind-runes and send me their various interpretations of what they mean, which makes me very happy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K05vxmBNqOM/UFNt6m_MTgI/AAAAAAAABHo/Y-eUy-gcDZ4/s1600/frank+herbert+dune+viking+beard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="262" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-K05vxmBNqOM/UFNt6m_MTgI/AAAAAAAABHo/Y-eUy-gcDZ4/s320/frank+herbert+dune+viking+beard.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Frank Herbert and his awesome Viking beard&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – The bind-runes preceding each section of the novels are accompanied by quotes from &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Lokabrenna, Invocations, Prophecy of the Seer, Proverbs, Apocalypse, Book of Mimir, Fabrications&lt;/i&gt; – imaginary lost poems of the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; and sections of the Order’s Good Book. The quoting of works from within the world of the novel reminded me of Frank Herbert’s use of imaginary quotations (like passages from “The Collected Sayings of Muad’Dib” in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Dune&lt;/i&gt;). I didn’t see Herbert in your lists of influences, but he seems a simpatico persona, given his creation of worlds built on complicated internal logic and investigation of the meanings of religion to those involved in their mystical heart (his Paul Atreides, your Maddy Smith). Herbert left Catholicism for Buddhism, and questions of religious belief play a major role in his works. Does Maddy’s journey reflect your own spiritual experiences in any way?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I don’t subscribe to any organized religion. I never have, although all belief systems interest me and I’ve spent most of my life studying aspects of belief. I didn’t want the Good Book to be the Christian Bible – although a number of people have assumed that it was – which is partly why I included the quotes. But patriarchal ideologies in general have overlapping areas of belief. My intention was not to portray one existing religion, but to draw on the concept of the evolution of religions in general and how they shape society.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YkYanntYTYM/UFNupWKq7-I/AAAAAAAABHw/XBj7ccDDdAA/s1600/gosforth+cross+ragnarok+end+of+days+apocalypse+last+judgement.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YkYanntYTYM/UFNupWKq7-I/AAAAAAAABHw/XBj7ccDDdAA/s320/gosforth+cross+ragnarok+end+of+days+apocalypse+last+judgement.jpg" width="164" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Norse Ragnarök meets&amp;nbsp;Christian Apocalypse&lt;br /&gt;on England's 10th century&amp;nbsp;Gosforth Cross&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – The books freely mix Norse myth and Christian myth in a very interesting fashion. Ragnarökkian imagery intersects with Christian Apocalyptic visions, and the power of rune magic overlaps the power of the Word. The two traditions even join together physically in the final scenes as Maggie – daughter of Thor and follower of the Order – names her unborn son Adam, of all things. This both highlights differences between the two religious traditions and underscores how much Christianity took from the Old Way as it developed in the North. Your knowledge of the source texts of Norse myth rings through throughout your work, but I’m curious about your background in regards to Christian tradition. Were you raised in a believing family?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – No, but I was raised in a family with a strong Catholic background. I never intended the Order to be seen as Christianity, although it has some things in common with the early Christian church – most of all its ability to naturalize and assimilate native beliefs.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;The &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Elder Edda&lt;/i&gt;itself shows how this works, retelling the myths from a different point-of-view [that is] biased towards Christianity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, I do believe that this is the nature of religion. No belief system stands alone. All are part of a long process of evolution and re-invention, and however much believers may reject this idea, all are ultimately related to one another.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/1359340758379666414/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=1359340758379666414&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/1359340758379666414'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/1359340758379666414'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/09/interview-with-joanne-harris-runemarks_14.html' title='INTERVIEW WITH JOANNE HARRIS (&lt;i&gt;RUNEMARKS&lt;/i&gt; &amp; &lt;i&gt;RUNELIGHT&lt;/i&gt;), Part Three'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Traders bring “glass and metalware from the Ridings; persimmons from the Southlands; fish from the Islands; spices from the Outlands; skins and furs from the frozen North.” You mention Wilderlanders, “all painted in blue woad,” and write that “[b]eyond the One Sea . . . there were men and women as brown as peat, with hair curled tight as bramble-crisp; and these people had never known Tribulation or the Good Book, but instead worshipped gods of their own – wild brown gods with animal heads.” Clearly, the action of the book only takes place in one small corner of the world you’ve created, with its reimaginings of real lands and peoples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always wondered about the localization of Big Important Mystical Events. Gods with the power to shape existence and travel throughout the universe only seem to appear to very small groups of people in very specific locales. Yahweh never holidays in Alaska; Njord doesn’t seem to notice that there are some really nice beaches in California. How do you imagine the inhabitants of your world reacting to the fact that the disagreements of a bunch of Anglo-Saxon godly types bring all of existence to the edge of destruction? In the world of &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, do other lands have gods as physically real as &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;? If so, are these other gods secretly observing the battles between the Northerners?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bcWrtT-PWqc/UEVccgRG19I/AAAAAAAABDE/RJhwQkGhQvc/s1600/tlaloc+aztec+thunder+god+thor.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bcWrtT-PWqc/UEVccgRG19I/AAAAAAAABDE/RJhwQkGhQvc/s200/tlaloc+aztec+thunder+god+thor.gif" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Tlaloc, Aztec god of thunder (&amp;amp; etc)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I’ve often wondered that myself. It’s one of those non-linear folkloric suspensions of disbelief I was talking about earlier. In fact, I’ve been thinking about trying to write a &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Rune&lt;/i&gt; book in which world belief systems interact, just to see if my gods would survive, say, in South America, amongst all those bloodthirsty Aztec gods.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Of course, in the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Rune&lt;/i&gt;books, the concept of “world” is limited to the world we know. This has been true throughout history, and religions – which tend to adapt to local conditions – reflect this pattern too. That’s why Jesus is traditionally shown as very Anglo-Saxon-looking in Europe and America, and the Nativity is most often depicted under snow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2rKHF8a3_pY/UEVdthD68EI/AAAAAAAABDM/ytoIxa9ANgc/s1600/nativity+snow+globe+little+blond+baby+jesus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2rKHF8a3_pY/UEVdthD68EI/AAAAAAAABDM/ytoIxa9ANgc/s200/nativity+snow+globe+little+blond+baby+jesus.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Little blond baby Jesus in the snow&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I’ve touched on a tentative explanation of this, both in my &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Rune&lt;/i&gt; books and in some of my short stories, by suggesting that gods are &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;all-powerful, and that the word “god” – like the concept of “world” – is open to massive historical and regional interpretation. Loki – whose voice I often use to voice these subversive theories – says as much in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;: &amp;nbsp;“In my time I’ve seen theatre gods, gladiator gods, even storyteller gods – Maddy, you people see gods everywhere. Gives you an excuse for not thinking for yourselves.”&amp;nbsp;And again:&amp;nbsp;“&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;God&lt;/i&gt; is just a word . . . Reverse it and you get &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;dog&lt;/i&gt;. It’s just as appropriate.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I’ve also touched on the idea that gods might appear in different aspects to suit the time and place. Therefore the god of thunder, for instance, might have multiple personae – appearing as &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; in one place, or Tlaloc in another, or Jupiter – to suit the current perception of what a thunder god should be. Even the figure of Jesus, I would argue, has borrowed a number of aspects from previous religions, from Osiris to Mithras – all of them aspects of the same archetypical figure sacrificed at &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/04/obama-ostara-president-ponders-easters.html"&gt;Easter&lt;/a&gt; and later reborn into godhood.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mqqKpuo1gL0/UEVe9BiwYyI/AAAAAAAABDU/1ihM7PBEN1c/s1600/wielding+surtrs+fire+by+colin+mlp+rainbow+dash+my+little+pony.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="160" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mqqKpuo1gL0/UEVe9BiwYyI/AAAAAAAABDU/1ihM7PBEN1c/s200/wielding+surtrs+fire+by+colin+mlp+rainbow+dash+my+little+pony.png" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;My Little Pony wielding the flaming sword of Surt&lt;br /&gt;Awesome painting of Rainbow Dash by ColinMLP&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – Given the large role of giants in both Norse myth and British folklore, I was surprised they didn’t appear in your books. When Surt shows up, he’s “a black bird shadow with a corona of fire,” not the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;’s sword-wielding giant. Your imagery reminded me of some lines from the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Kalevala&lt;/i&gt;, the epic poem from Finland:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The sky’s bird struck fire&lt;br /&gt;made a flame flare up.&lt;br /&gt;The north wind burnt the clearing&lt;br /&gt;the north-east quite consumed it:&lt;br /&gt;it burnt all the trees to ash&lt;br /&gt;reduced them to dust.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Skadi is listed as “of the Ice People” in your character list, not specifically as a giant. Why did you choose to leave the big fellas out of the story?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – The word most often translated as “giant” in Old Icelandic is open to a number of other interpretations, including “demon.”&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;That started me thinking about the relationships between gods and giants/demons, and how little we hear about the actual physical size of these “giants.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pulFv_0VPYc/UEVhBXNA8xI/AAAAAAAABDc/Cfgw82nbJwU/s1600/the+giant+skrymir+and+his+glove+thor+loki+thjalfi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="241" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pulFv_0VPYc/UEVhBXNA8xI/AAAAAAAABDc/Cfgw82nbJwU/s320/the+giant+skrymir+and+his+glove+thor+loki+thjalfi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor, Loki &amp;amp; Thjalfi emerge from the glove of the giant Skrymir&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In some stories they are indeed of giant size. The giant Skrymir, for instance, is large enough to house four people inside his glove, but Loki, supposedly half-giant, is of normal size – perhaps even a little shorter than average. Many others – Skadi, Gerd – are of similar size to the gods, able to intermarry without difficulty. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I came to the conclusion, then, that the word “giant,” like the word “god,” might be metaphorical – closer to the concept of “hero” or “superhuman.” We do, after all, refer to “literary giants” and “gods and goddesses of the screen.” Because of that, I wanted to use a word that didn’t necessarily convey monstrous size in every case, reserving the word “giant” for the actual “big fellas.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – When in Aspect (her mystical appearance), Maddy’s hair is “loose instead of being sensibly braided, and in the place of her usual clothes she now wore a belted chain mail tunic of what she judged to be immodest length.” This reads like a description of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century artistic depictions of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-four.html"&gt;Valkyries&lt;/a&gt;. For novels that center around some very powerful female characters (and butt-kicking teenage girls), the Valkyries are notable by their absence. Why did you choose not to use these mystic warrior-women in your books?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7yaj8HByDIY/UEViUVmtp3I/AAAAAAAABDk/oJQ5silORKI/s1600/valkyries+valkyrie+valkyrien+Peter+Nicolai+Arbo+Norway+1831-1892+1869+painting+National+Gallery+Nasjonalgalleriet+Oslo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7yaj8HByDIY/UEViUVmtp3I/AAAAAAAABDk/oJQ5silORKI/s320/valkyries+valkyrie+valkyrien+Peter+Nicolai+Arbo+Norway+1831-1892+1869+painting+National+Gallery+Nasjonalgalleriet+Oslo.jpg" width="261" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Norwegian painter Peter Nicolai Arbo's 1869&lt;br /&gt;Valkyrie shows a bit of leg for the lads&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I was never entirely taken by the image of the Valkyries. They always seemed to me tainted by those 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century depictions – more the manifestations of some teenager’s wet-dream than actual symbols of female empowerment.&amp;nbsp;They exist &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt;, with no characterization or real means of telling them apart – like the chorus of &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;We Will Rock You,&lt;/i&gt; rewritten by Wagner after a particularly dissolute Oktoberfest. I didn’t know what to do with them or how they would contribute to my story. And so I chose to leave them out altogether, concentrating instead on re-inventing the (somewhat male-dominated) Norse pantheon to include some kickass female characters. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – At the beginning of &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, Maddy is fourteen years old – the age you were when you first began imagining new tales of the Norse gods and the age your daughter was when you finished the novel. You’ve described Maddy as “a mixture of myself at fourteen and of my daughter as she is now. In fact, we’re pretty similar personalities.” How do you think things have changed for strong-minded young women from your generation to hers? Is there a difference in the way today’s real-life Pippi Longstockings interact with peers and adults?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5LvC_C0PA20/UEVlMyTyp5I/AAAAAAAABEA/FIE7HxZumUM/s1600/pippi+longstocking+langkous+veronica+magazine+1972.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5LvC_C0PA20/UEVlMyTyp5I/AAAAAAAABEA/FIE7HxZumUM/s320/pippi+longstocking+langkous+veronica+magazine+1972.jpg" width="228" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Pippi Longstocking, matinee idol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – I think, if anything, that things have changed for the worse for imaginative teenagers since then. When I was fourteen, there was far less pressure to conform, and our role models were actresses, sportswomen, musicians and writers instead of TV “celebrities.” There was much less pressure on teenage girls to focus on clothes and makeup; most of us lived in t-shirts and jeans, and although we were interested in boys (of course we were – who isn’t?), we were far more interested in fictional heroes and stars of the screen. Contrast that with my daughter being bullied at school at the age of twelve because didn’t shave her legs or because she didn’t like the same music as her peers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;In the Seventies, we felt that feminism was on the rise. We felt that women were coming of age; we were optimistic. Now, I think that feminism has lost its way. So many girls nowadays seem to think that laddishness is “empowering,” rather than just childish. So many of them seem to think that marrying a footballer, or becoming a reality TV star, or getting a boob job and becoming a pole dancer, or just winning the Lottery counts as “living the dream.” I remember when dreams were better than this. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;KS – I once took an art history course with a girl who would make completely original observations on the material, yet always begin her statements with “I think I read somewhere in the textbook that . . .” There was a boy in the class who would repeat passages from the book almost verbatim, but always present the concepts as his own ideas. The idea of a creative young woman feeling that she has to hide her gifts appears near the beginning of &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;: “For Maddy’s deepest secret . . . was that she &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;enjoyed&lt;/i&gt; working magic, however shameful that might be. More than that, she thought she might be good at it too and, like anyone with a talent, longed to make use of it and show it off to other people.” Did you intend a connection between Maddy’s relationship to her magical knowledge and talents and the continuing external and internal struggles of today’s “wise women” – whether students, professionals or creative artists?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HTCbIT9XJFQ/UEVmrGrBtAI/AAAAAAAABEI/5OcSPmEqF9k/s1600/runemarks+joanne+harris+italian+italy+edition+le+parole+segrete.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HTCbIT9XJFQ/UEVmrGrBtAI/AAAAAAAABEI/5OcSPmEqF9k/s320/runemarks+joanne+harris+italian+italy+edition+le+parole+segrete.jpg" width="280" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Maddy on the cover of "The Secret Words,"&lt;br /&gt;the Italian edition of &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;JH – Yes. Maddy’s magic is something of a metaphor for the imagination of women generally.&amp;nbsp;For too long, women have been judged primarily on their looks rather than their abilities, and, even now – in a world in which we can hardly move for political correctness – men and women are still viewed slightly differently in the world of music, literature and the creative arts. There is a patronizing smirk from the world of literature when a woman writes a romantic novel; but when a man does the same thing, he is being sensitive and insightful, making a valuable statement on the nature of relationships. In&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt; Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;, the same thing happens; a boy who reads is intelligent and will go a long way; a girl who reads is “clever,” which is useless in a girl – even potentially dangerous.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/9046784329566297344/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=9046784329566297344&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/9046784329566297344'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/9046784329566297344'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/09/interview-with-joanne-harris-runemarks.html' title='INTERVIEW WITH JOANNE HARRIS (&lt;i&gt;RUNEMARKS&lt;/i&gt; &amp; &lt;i&gt;RUNELIGHT&lt;/i&gt;), Part Two'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Her debut as a novelist was &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The Evil Seed&lt;/i&gt; (1989), but it was her third novel that propelled her to international stardom; &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Chocolat&lt;/i&gt; earned the number one spot on the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller list, and the film adaption (with Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche) was a commercial and critical success. Since that first breakthrough, Harris has written a series of bestselling novels including &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Holy Fools&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The Lollipop Shoes&lt;/i&gt;. Two of her sixteen published books are French cookbooks, and her short stories have been featured in numerous collections.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;In &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;(2007), Harris imagines the aftermath of Ragnarök, “five hundred years after the End of the World.” It’s a world quite different from the one suggested in the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt;, but it has deep roots in Norse mythology. The old gods have fallen and a new religion has risen. A young girl named Maddy is born with a “runemark” – a rune on her skin that marks her as a relation of the Norse gods and invests her with mystic power. Over the course of the novel, she befriends &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; (as much as one can be a friend with the Furious One), travels with &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, and becomes embroiled in a struggle involving the resurgent Æsir and Vanir and the minions of the new religion known as the Order.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UMe-aHTO5I0/UD0IEyDv39I/AAAAAAAABBA/U6VL9gnI6ks/s1600/joanne+harris+runemarks+cover+maddy+smith+sugar+runes.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UMe-aHTO5I0/UD0IEyDv39I/AAAAAAAABBA/U6VL9gnI6ks/s320/joanne+harris+runemarks+cover+maddy+smith+sugar+runes.jpg" width="208" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Maddy &amp;amp; Sugar on the cover of &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Harris followed up with &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;(2011), which takes place three years after the first novel. Maddy discovers her twin sister Maggie, and the two young women find themselves on opposite sides of Odin’s fight to rebuild fallen Asgard. This second book greatly enlarges the mythical cast of the first novel with the addition of several other characters from Norse myth, most notably Angrboda (here known familiarly as Angie) and the wolves Fenris, Skól and Haiti (the spelling is Harris’s).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Full disclosure: I absolutely love these books. Someday, I’ll have a daughter, and I want her to be just like Maddy (but I’ll call her &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-one.html"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;if I can convince my wife about the name). The novels are absolutely brilliant in their transformative use of Norse mythology. Rather than using the myths as background inspiration (as &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/p/norse-myth-classes.html"&gt;Tolkien&lt;/a&gt; did, for example), Harris makes the daring choice of having the Norse gods appear as characters. She pulls it off. &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; are wonderfully written and unpredictable page-turners.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;For readers who may be unfamiliar with &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt; – or with the intricacies of Norse mythology and Norse religion – I’ve included explanatory information in my interview questions. In some instances, my preambles are longer than Ms. Harris’ answers. I hope the gentle reader will forgive this, as my only goal was to lay out a welcome mat for readers who are new to these subjects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OSiKR-k45zY/UD0JRHEHHTI/AAAAAAAABBI/2mmHZA7y6Yc/s1600/uffington+white+horse+joanne+harris+red+horse+hill+runemarks+runelight.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OSiKR-k45zY/UD0JRHEHHTI/AAAAAAAABBI/2mmHZA7y6Yc/s1600/uffington+white+horse+joanne+harris+red+horse+hill+runemarks+runelight.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Aerial view of the Uffington White Horse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – What we call Norse mythology is sometimes thought ­­­to be purely Scandinavian property, but the old gods are documented in various forms in Europe and the British Isles. Your books have a distinctly British feel. The Old English runes represent the “New Script” in your novels; the Old English rune poem provides lines for the cantrips spoken by your characters – &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;cantrip&lt;/i&gt; itself being an archaic English and Scottish word for &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;spell&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;incantation&lt;/i&gt;. In the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; world, Red Horse Hill is rumored to have been a place of heathen sacrifice or a burial mound, and it has an ancient carving of a horse that “never grassed over in spring, nor did the winter snow ever hide its shape” – which is reminiscent of the Uffington White Horse and other English chalk horses. &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;’ map shows that the Middle Worlds look like the British Isles, with World’s End in the general area of London. Why did you decide to use an English setting, rather than a Nordic one? Did the choice enable you tell a different type of story than if, for instance, the events took place in &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/05/elf-kerfuffle-in-iceland.html"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – I don’t think I made a conscious choice to set the books in a neo-British setting. To me it simply came naturally. I’m more familiar with my Yorkshire home than I am with, say, Iceland or Scandinavia, and there are already so many links here to Viking culture. There are Viking remains all around Yorkshire, from runic stones to burial mounds. I worked as a volunteer on the Coppergate dig in York when I was a teenager – the site that was to become Jorvik. Scratch the soil almost anywhere here, and you’ll find that our back gardens are all filled with Viking leavings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uoQhe3lM9Yw/UD0LI6AsvMI/AAAAAAAABBY/zYM9ljEUQGA/s1600/viking+re-enactment+re-enactors+jorvik+viking+centre+york+england.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="170" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uoQhe3lM9Yw/UD0LI6AsvMI/AAAAAAAABBY/zYM9ljEUQGA/s320/viking+re-enactment+re-enactors+jorvik+viking+centre+york+england.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Viking re-enactors at the Jorvik Viking Centre in York, England&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Just outside my home village of Almondbury – which was to become Malbry in the Rune books – there are the foundations of an Iron Age fort on a hill. Castle Hill became Red Horse Hill without much alteration, and I’ve used some other local names, such as Farnley Tyas, mostly for my own amusement and that of my daughter, for whom I wrote the books in the first place. I wanted to try and recreate the way in which belief systems migrate and are recreated locally to suit the needs of each location in which they are adopted; in this case, my own region, which has harbored the remnants of Viking culture for centuries, even to adopting Danish words into our local dialect. For instance, the word &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;laik&lt;/i&gt; (“to play”) was very common when I was a child, e.g., “&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;A’ tha’ laikin’?&lt;/i&gt;” (“Are you coming out to play?”).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;All this makes Malbry and the world of Inland very, very familiar to me. I think that, if I’d chosen a more obviously Icelandic – and therefore “foreign” – setting, the story would have been different; less intimate, less familiar. I wanted to tell a story that most of us here already half-knew, if only on a subconscious level – not introduce a new culture that people wouldn’t recognize.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – You give very nice logical explanations for the mysteries of Norse mythology. For instance, the ability to mystically bind a goblin or god by knowing its true name (“a named thing is a tamed thing”) is explained like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;At the beginning of the First Age, it was given to every creature, tree, rock and plant a secret name that would bind that creature to the will of anyone who knew it.&lt;br /&gt;Mother Frigg knew the true names, and used them to make all of creation weep for the return of her dead son. But Loki, who had many names, would not be bound to such a promise, and so Balder the Fair, god of springtime, was forced to remain in Underworld, Hel’s kingdom, until the end of all things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cPTqYrAUtmY/UD0MkDMj4GI/AAAAAAAABBg/m4X-CsVW0tA/s1600/balder+nanna+road+to+hel+louis+moe+norwegian+artist+1929.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cPTqYrAUtmY/UD0MkDMj4GI/AAAAAAAABBg/m4X-CsVW0tA/s320/balder+nanna+road+to+hel+louis+moe+norwegian+artist+1929.jpg" width="302" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Balder &amp;amp; Nanna on the road to Hel (1929)&lt;br /&gt;by Norwegian artist Louis Moe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;You recontextualize ideas from Norse myth (like the world weeping for Balder) and connect them to other Germanic concepts (like the Rumpelstiltskinian name-control) to provide an overarching logic to the material. From Snorri Sturluson to Viktor Rydberg to Kevin Crossley-Holland, writers have tried to fit the contradictory surviving remnants of Norse myth into a coherent whole. As an author who has so often created her own fictional worlds, what drew you to design a logical narrative from this ancient jumble of myth?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – Folklore rarely follows rules, especially not those of linear narrative. On the other hand, with folklore based on the oral tradition, the audience knows to suspend disbelief and to ignore inconsistencies. That doesn’t happen so much in books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I tried to do was sift through all kinds of aspects of folklore, myth and fairytale, bringing together what I could and adding variants of my own.&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt; Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; is basically a story about the power of stories – a power that has fuelled the world since long before the Vikings. The result is a kind of webwork in which myth, religious belief, fairytales, nursery rhymes and spells are all intimately interconnected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SCmHx3gHm8E/UD0RNdnEXKI/AAAAAAAABB4/PkhZKI1UZcM/s1600/gosforth+cross+bound+loki+sigyn+snake+Finnur+Jo%CC%81nsson+1913+Go%C3%B0afr%C3%A6%C3%B0i+Nor%C3%B0manna+og+I%CC%81slendinga+eftir+heimildum+Hi%CC%81%C3%B0+i%CC%81slenska+bo%CC%81kmentafjelag+Reproduction+Julius+Magnus+Petersen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SCmHx3gHm8E/UD0RNdnEXKI/AAAAAAAABB4/PkhZKI1UZcM/s320/gosforth+cross+bound+loki+sigyn+snake+Finnur+Jo%CC%81nsson+1913+Go%C3%B0afr%C3%A6%C3%B0i+Nor%C3%B0manna+og+I%CC%81slendinga+eftir+heimildum+Hi%CC%81%C3%B0+i%CC%81slenska+bo%CC%81kmentafjelag+Reproduction+Julius+Magnus+Petersen.jpg" width="154" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki, Sigyn &amp;amp; the snake&amp;nbsp;on the&lt;br /&gt;10th-century&amp;nbsp;Gosforth Cross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – In &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt;’ character list, all the gods and goddesses are defined by their (antagonistic) relationships with Loki. He appears more in both novels than any of the Æsir or Vanir. John Lindow writes that “[e]veryone agrees that there was never any cult of Loki,” yet he is a favorite fictional character today. &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/a&gt; has given &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Journey into Mystery&lt;/i&gt; over to his adventures, Joss Whedon calls him “the kind of character that turns the wheels” and M.D. Lachlan made him the only Norse god with a real speaking part in &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/08/interview-with-m-d-lachlan-wolfsangel.html"&gt;Wolfsangel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Why do you think Loki has become such a sympathetic figure in recent years?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;JH – During the course of the last century, the concept of heroes and villains has become increasingly ambivalent. We have come to enjoy anti-heroes – those complicated, flawed characters who often exist on the fringes of normal society. We are no longer entirely satisfied by the archetypes of story, the whiter-than-white heroes and the villains with no redeeming features.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Thus Loki satisfies our need to identify on a more human level; his flaws are very believable, and – of all the Norse gods – he seems to me the most modern. His moral and sexual ambivalence, his inability (or refusal) to integrate into Asgard’s society, his outcast status, his subversive temperament, his changes of mood and his almost existentialist sense of humor make him very accessible to a modern audience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcrWWj_cOyA/UD0PLZ1x48I/AAAAAAAABBo/vEVSKpUT4nk/s1600/angry+teenage+loki+marvel+comics+Journey+Into+Mystery+%2523641+richard+elson.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="96" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcrWWj_cOyA/UD0PLZ1x48I/AAAAAAAABBo/vEVSKpUT4nk/s320/angry+teenage+loki+marvel+comics+Journey+Into+Mystery+%2523641+richard+elson.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Angry teenage Loki in Marvel Comics' &lt;i&gt;Journey into Mystery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art by Richard Elson&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;He portrays the insecurities of modern adolescence – the sense of not belonging; the need to make an impact, even a negative one, onto the world of adulthood (represented by Odin and the other gods). And, of course, he is very funny – lifting what would have been a very stolid and serious pantheon into something much livelier and more human.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/2138592010764196463/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=2138592010764196463&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/2138592010764196463'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/2138592010764196463'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/08/interview-with-joanne-harris-runemarks.html' title='INTERVIEW WITH JOANNE HARRIS (&lt;i&gt;RUNEMARKS&lt;/i&gt; &amp; &lt;i&gt;RUNELIGHT&lt;/i&gt;), Part One'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

In January 2010, he was in a car accident in which his SUV rolled over five times before stopping next to a large stone that was 40 meters from the highway. Although his vehicle was totaled, Árni was unharmed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;He came to the completely logical conclusion that the 24-ton boulder was a home to elves - and that it was their intervention that had kept him safe. Last July, when the stone was scheduled to be buried during widening of the Ring Road (Iceland's national highway), Árni contacted Ragnhildur Jónsdóttir for advice.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WYEDC480htI/T75swXD9EEI/AAAAAAAAA6U/9laDWDNfueI/s1600/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+specialist+elf+walk+walks+A%CC%81lfagar%C3%B0urinn+elf+garden+Hafnarfjo%CC%88r%C3%B0ur+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="166" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WYEDC480htI/T75swXD9EEI/AAAAAAAAA6U/9laDWDNfueI/s200/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+specialist+elf+walk+walks+A%CC%81lfagar%C3%B0urinn+elf+garden+Hafnarfjo%CC%88r%C3%B0ur+Iceland.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ragnhildur Jónsdóttir leads an elf walk&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;I met Ragnhildur during my 2010 visit to Iceland, and I can personally attest that this beautiful and brilliant woman is exactly the person you should call when you have an elf issue. As Iceland's leading elf specialist, she leads &lt;a href="http://www.elfgarden.is/elf-walks.html"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0016e7;"&gt;elf walks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href="http://www.alfagardurinn.is/"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0016e7;"&gt;Álfagarðurinn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ("elf garden") in Hafnarfjörður and creates &lt;a href="http://www.ragjo.is/"&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0016e7;"&gt;original art&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; based on her contact with the elusive creatures.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;The Icelandic belief in elves goes back well over 1,000 years. Elves (&lt;i&gt;álfar&lt;/i&gt;) are referenced many times in the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;, but there is a tantalizing lack of descriptive information about these mysterious beings. Medieval sources record the practice known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;álfablót&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;("sacrifice to the elves"), but again there is little detail to be found.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-07sBd7H6hHE/T75tlNW9LkI/AAAAAAAAA6c/RTM-m9Bll9M/s1600/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elf+stone+home+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-07sBd7H6hHE/T75tlNW9LkI/AAAAAAAAA6c/RTM-m9Bll9M/s200/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elf+stone+home+.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ragnhildur with the elf home&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Thankfully, we now have someone like&amp;nbsp;Ragnhildur who can go straight to the source. She&amp;nbsp;has the rare gift of being able to see and communicate with elves, so&amp;nbsp;Árni asked her to examine the boulder and find out if the elves would mind if he moved the stone to his home in the&amp;nbsp;Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;She examined the rock and was surprised that three generations of elves were living within it - a situation that she had never before come across. The grandparents lived upstairs and the younger family (with three children) lived downstairs. They told her that&amp;nbsp;Árni's car accident had caused mass confusion in the elf settlement on the heath. Elves from all the neighboring areas had been called out; they had been quite upset until a larger being took charge and calmed them down.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rvCr-Mz0904/T75wpp0u7uI/AAAAAAAAA68/cnAD3zHu1-0/s1600/A%CC%81rni+Johnsen+Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elves+elf+stone.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="173" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rvCr-Mz0904/T75wpp0u7uI/AAAAAAAAA68/cnAD3zHu1-0/s200/A%CC%81rni+Johnsen+Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elves+elf+stone.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ragnhildur shows Árni the size of the elves&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Árni told &lt;a href="http://www.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=29314&amp;amp;ew_0_a_id=390052"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #0016e7;"&gt;Iceland Review Online&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that "Ragnhildur said it was my protecting spirit, because my time hadn’t come." The ancient Icelandic sagas attest to belief in &lt;i&gt;fylgjur&lt;/i&gt;, guardian spirits attached to individuals that follow their chosen person throughout his or her life. &lt;i&gt;Fylgjur&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;usually take the form of women or animals. Typically, they only appear visible at moments of great crisis - most often immediately before the individual's death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;A notable appearance of a &lt;i&gt;fylgja&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Icelandic literature occurs in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hallfreðar saga vandræðaskálds&lt;/i&gt; ("Saga of Hallfred the Troublesome Poet"), which takes place in the 10th century. Hallfred and his two sons have a strange experience while at sea: "They saw a woman walking behind the ship: she was tall, and wearing a mail-coat; she walked over the waves as if she was on dry land. Hallfred looked at her and saw that she was his &lt;i&gt;fylgja&lt;/i&gt;-woman."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t795qsME_t4/T774uwIrIuI/AAAAAAAAA70/INKImU7fLiE/s1600/moving+elf+home+stone+iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-t795qsME_t4/T774uwIrIuI/AAAAAAAAA70/INKImU7fLiE/s200/moving+elf+home+stone+iceland.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Moving the elf stone home&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Personally, I find it somehow comforting to know that &lt;i&gt;fylgjur&lt;/i&gt; are alive and well and living in Iceland - even if they now follow SUVs instead of Viking ships.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;Ragnhildur, the multi-generational family in the stone welcomed the relocation offer. The grandfather was unhappy that the boulder was tilting at its current location, as his bed was almost vertical.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Last week, Ragnhildur explained the situation to me via email. She wrote:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The main thing for me was to help the elves. They were about to lose their home under a big road. Árni wanted to thank them for saving his life, so he went through all this trouble to move their home to safety. Árni asked me to ask the elves what they wanted to do - if they wanted to move the rock to another location nearby, to move out of the stone or to move to Vestmannaeyjar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;The elves took their time to discuss the matter with each other and get information about Vestmannaeyjar. They decided they wanted to move with their old home to the island, but they had a few demands. They wanted to travel in a separate travelling unit - a basket warm and cozy in a safe distance from all the big trucks needed to move their house. They wanted the big window wall on their home to face a good view over the ocean, and they wanted their house on grass so they could keep sheep. Árni could promise all this, and I promised to move the elves myself in a basket all the way to Vestmannaeyjar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A stone with a view? In Iceland, this isn't such a strange thing. According to the sagas, inhabited stones even have doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0GB0s4VSfJQ/T76AVhaLB2I/AAAAAAAAA7o/ByXbhBxBSIk/s1600/King+Svafrlame+Secures+the+Sword+Tyrfing+Sigrlami+dwaves+Rydberg+Viktor+Rydberg+1906+Teutonic+Mythology+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="135" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0GB0s4VSfJQ/T76AVhaLB2I/AAAAAAAAA7o/ByXbhBxBSIk/s200/King+Svafrlame+Secures+the+Sword+Tyrfing+Sigrlami+dwaves+Rydberg+Viktor+Rydberg+1906+Teutonic+Mythology+.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Sigrlami threatens the dwarves&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In the 13th-century&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&lt;/i&gt; ("Saga of&amp;nbsp;Hervör and&amp;nbsp;Heiðrek"), a king named Sigrlami meets the dwarves Dvalinn and Durin while lost in the forest. After Sigrlami forces them to forge the mystic sword Tyrfing, they place a nasty curse on the weapon. The saga describes the flight of the little guys as Sigrlami threatens them: "Then the king swung his sword at the dwarves. They sprang into the rock. The sword stuck right into the stone so that both edges were lost from sight, for the door closed behind them in the stone."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MH_-dvtom60/T75yj3eCUMI/AAAAAAAAA7U/iqWhhcvI6qU/s1600/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+moving+the+elf+stone+home.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="146" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MH_-dvtom60/T75yj3eCUMI/AAAAAAAAA7U/iqWhhcvI6qU/s200/Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+moving+the+elf+stone+home.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;In transit: Ragnhildur and the elf stone&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;Árni moved the boulder and the elf-family on the ferry&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Herjólfur&lt;/i&gt;. True to his role as a government official, he dutifully bought tickets for the elves. The ferry's employees were very reasonable about the whole affair and only charged him for the young couple; the grandparents and children rode for free. The ferry personnel also waived the restriction on the maximum number of passengers per vehicle so that the family of nine could ride together.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TdEkraZWge4/T75x4byiM8I/AAAAAAAAA7E/sDgFoKNmBHA/s1600/A%CC%81rni+Johnsen+Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elves+honey+stone+home+ferry.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TdEkraZWge4/T75x4byiM8I/AAAAAAAAA7E/sDgFoKNmBHA/s200/A%CC%81rni+Johnsen+Ragnhildur+Jo%CC%81nsdo%CC%81ttir+elves+honey+stone+home+ferry.jpg" width="139" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Árni looks on as Ragnhildur&lt;br /&gt;offers the elves some honey&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Ragnhildur brought along a basket lined with sheep skin for the elves to travel in, so that they could be comfortable during the journey.

The grass was there, and I saw - in the slope behind us - an elf farmer and a few elf sheep waiting. Everyone involved is happy, all went well and the new location for the old elf home is amazingly beautiful.”&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;After the move, the principal of the Icelandic Elf School (yes, there is one) spoke out about his concerns for&amp;nbsp;Árni's well-being.&amp;nbsp;Magnús Skarphéðinsson questioned whether the elves actually gave their informed consent to the relocation of their home. He cited past instances where dangerous accidents happened after known elf-homes were moved.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;I asked Ragnhildur if she had anything to say in reply. She was, as always, gracious and kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;When [Magnus] was asked about the elf home moving, I think he didn't know the whole story. It is absolutely true that we should never move elf homes without the elves asking us to do so or with a permission from the elves. We need to talk with them as friends and remember - when we think of damaging something in Nature - that there could be a whole family living in this rock or that tree. So always talk, ask and then don't forget to listen. In this case, we were helping the elves to save their home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NNNOhr6hjvM" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video of the move by&amp;nbsp;Halldór B. Halldórsson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever you start to think Iceland couldn’t be any more magical, something else happens that makes you blink at the wonder of it all. Ragnhildur told me about the latest development in the story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;As a message from the Elf World, there was a foal being born yesterday, right next to the elf home in its new place. The mare's name is Gæfa ("good fortune"). The name of the owner of the horses is Hestaleigan ("horse rental") Lukka.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Lukka&lt;/i&gt; means &lt;i&gt;luck&lt;/i&gt;. The foal was given the name Álfur in honor of its new neighbors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;She concluded, “I am happy to get the story right, out there. It was all about the elves, not politics.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;‘Nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/7391593193995986490/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=7391593193995986490&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/7391593193995986490'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/7391593193995986490'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/05/elf-kerfuffle-in-iceland.html' title='ELF KERFUFFLE IN ICELAND'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Anyone with a question about Norse mythology and Norse religion is welcome to contact me via the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/p/ask-norse-mythologist.html"&gt;online form&lt;/a&gt;, and I'll do my best to answer here on the website. It may take me a while to get to your question, however. Even Odin needed nine nights to learn the secrets of the runes. These things take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost as soon as the new feature was rolled out, I received this very nice message from Braden Almquist of Alberta, Canada:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kms75NM3O3c/T4JFhtWp9UI/AAAAAAAAA2s/M4oRwheinv0/s1600/alberta+canada+vintage+postcard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="135" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Kms75NM3O3c/T4JFhtWp9UI/AAAAAAAAA2s/M4oRwheinv0/s200/alberta+canada+vintage+postcard.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;This is a postcard from Alberta. Postcards were&lt;br /&gt;an analog version of texting, back in the 1900s.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;I've been fascinated with everything Norse since I was twelve, but (as I'm sure you know) the tales are scattered and not always coherent. Recently, I came across something that I could use some help on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;While reading and watching several videos, I came across a reference to one of the gods that I had near to no info about. This god was said to be making the "greatest boot." I have yet to find any info on this god outside that one reference. Today, I stumbled across your blog, and I believe you may be able to help me on this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Any information regarding this character would be appreciated. Thank you for your time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is actually a very easy question to answer. I don't recall coming across that particular phrase, but it clearly refers to the god known as Víðarr&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;usually spelled Vidar in English texts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the thirteenth-century book called the &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;, Snorri Sturluson introduces the god like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Vidar is the name of one, the silent As. He has a thick shoe. He is almost equal in strength to Thor. He is a source of great support to the gods in all dangers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In another section of the &lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;, Snorri writes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;How shall Vidar be referred to? He may be called the silent As, possessor of the iron shoe, enemy and slayer of Fenriswolf, the gods' avenging As, father's homestead-inhabiting As and son of Odin, brother of the&amp;nbsp;Æsir.&lt;/blockquote&gt;These passages raise a lot of questions. They are more understandable if you know that&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;As&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ás&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the singular form of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Æsir&lt;/i&gt;, the Old Norse term for the gods&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;specifically, the tribe of gods that includes &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;. Also, Fenriswolf (or simply Fenris) is the giant wolf that will kill Odin at&amp;nbsp;Ragnarök ("Doom of the Powers"), the future battle between the gods and the forces of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Je1dKj9N8hI/T4Ix_uWwWvI/AAAAAAAAA2E/2zGJ2fV-46s/s1600/Vidar+Norse+god+Vi%CC%81%C3%B0arr+straps+his+shoe+on+Fabricius+Adam+Kristoffer+1854+Illustreret+Danmarkshistorie+for+Folket+Hans+Christian+Henneberg+Constantin+Hansen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Je1dKj9N8hI/T4Ix_uWwWvI/AAAAAAAAA2E/2zGJ2fV-46s/s200/Vidar+Norse+god+Vi%CC%81%C3%B0arr+straps+his+shoe+on+Fabricius+Adam+Kristoffer+1854+Illustreret+Danmarkshistorie+for+Folket+Hans+Christian+Henneberg+Constantin+Hansen.jpg" width="143" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Vidar tying his shoelaces in&lt;br /&gt;a 19th-century illustration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Why is Vidar silent? Why does he have a thick shoe? Thor is the protector of the gods (and humans), so wouldn't "almost equal in strength to Thor" mean &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;strong? Who is this guy? The answers to all these questions can be found elsewhere in the &lt;i&gt;Edda&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;and in the collection of Old Norse mythological and legendary poems known as the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the defining characteristics of Odin is his endless quest for knowledge about all things&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;but especially about his fate (and that of the other gods) at&amp;nbsp;Ragnarök. He knows that he will be killed by the monstrous Fenris, and it seems that his son Vidar's sole purpose (get it? &lt;i&gt;sole&lt;/i&gt; purpose?) in life is to prepare to avenge his father's future death. They really planned ahead in the old days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bcog3xTXYI0/T4I1bKKbD7I/AAAAAAAAA2M/hMkola1agcE/s1600/Paul+Dano+Dwayne+Hoover+Little+Miss+Sunshine+vow+of+silence+thus+spoke+zarathustra+friedrich+nietzsche.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bcog3xTXYI0/T4I1bKKbD7I/AAAAAAAAA2M/hMkola1agcE/s200/Paul+Dano+Dwayne+Hoover+Little+Miss+Sunshine+vow+of+silence+thus+spoke+zarathustra+friedrich+nietzsche.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Vows of silence are totally hip&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Vidar's silence is usually interpreted as a ritual one. The young god vows to stay silent until he manages to accomplish his goal, like the teenage son in &lt;i&gt;Little Miss Sunshine&lt;/i&gt;. This same sense of single-minded dedication is also present in the poem&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Grímnismál&lt;/i&gt; ("Sayings of the Masked One"), when Odin says, in the midst of a mystic vision:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Brushwood grows and tall grass&lt;br /&gt;widely in Vidar's land;&lt;br /&gt;there the son gets off the back of a horse,&lt;br /&gt;the brave one, to avenge his father.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Vidar is clearly too busy preparing for future battle to mow his lawn. Note to teenagers: this excuse for avoiding chores might not work so well in the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elsewhere in the Norse myths, Odin has a son named Váli specifically to avenge the killing of Balder,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;another&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;one of his sons (it's all very complicated). The poem&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Baldrs draumar&lt;/i&gt; (“Balder's Dreams”) tells us that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;[Váli] won't wash his hands nor comb his hair,&lt;br /&gt;Until he's brought to the pyre Baldr's enemy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This ritual of non-grooming is similar to the "playoff beard" of today's hockey players, who vow not to shave during the Stanley Cup playoffs. You're Canadian; I'm sure you understand. It also lines up with Vidar's vow of silence. These are both very public signs showing the dedication of the two young gods to their respective vengeance-bringing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-tfGjJD3RI/T4JErlz2UiI/AAAAAAAAA2k/-GTxIFMLBIM/s1600/ODIN+TELLS+TO+VIDAR+HIS+SILENT+SON+THE+SECRET+OF+HIS+DOINGS+Padraic+Colum+Willy+Pogany+Children+of+Odin+Nordic+Gods+and+Heroes.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="168" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-tfGjJD3RI/T4JErlz2UiI/AAAAAAAAA2k/-GTxIFMLBIM/s320/ODIN+TELLS+TO+VIDAR+HIS+SILENT+SON+THE+SECRET+OF+HIS+DOINGS+Padraic+Colum+Willy+Pogany+Children+of+Odin+Nordic+Gods+and+Heroes.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Vidar contemplates vengeance, no doubt silently&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The parallels between the two gods are underscored by the fact that they will both survive the final battle at Ragnarök. The wise old giant of the poem &lt;i&gt;Vafþrúðnismál&lt;/i&gt; (“Vafthrudnir's Sayings”) tells Odin that "Vidar and Vali will live in the temples of the gods" when&amp;nbsp;Ragnarök is over. So we probably wouldn't be going too far if we guess that Odin had Vidar &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;like&amp;nbsp;Váli)&amp;nbsp;specifically so he could raise him as a god of vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about this whole shoe thing, though? In &lt;i&gt;Vafþrúðnismál&lt;/i&gt;, the giant tells Odin about the final battle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The wolf will swallow the Father of Men,&lt;br /&gt;Vidar will avenge this;&lt;br /&gt;the cold jaws of the beast he will sunder in battle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Snorri elaborates on exactly &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Vidar will sunder the "cold jaws" of the wolf:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The wolf will swallow Odin. That will be the cause of his death. And immediately after Vidar will come forward and step with one foot on the lower jaw of the wolf. On this foot he will have a shoe for which the material has been being collected throughout all time: it is the waste pieces that people cut from their shoes at the toe and heel. Therefore anyone that is concerned to give assistance to the&amp;nbsp;Æsir must throw these pieces away. With one hand he will grasp the wolf's upper jaw and tear apart its mouth and this will cause the wolf's death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P6X0dVU8Q9E/T4I6m8hVL4I/AAAAAAAAA2c/umZUjZH1QBM/s1600/Gosforth+Cross+Vi%CC%81%C3%B0arr+Vidar+Fenris+Wolf.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="126" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-P6X0dVU8Q9E/T4I6m8hVL4I/AAAAAAAAA2c/umZUjZH1QBM/s200/Gosforth+Cross+Vi%CC%81%C3%B0arr+Vidar+Fenris+Wolf.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Vidar fighting the wolf on the Gosforth Cross&lt;br /&gt;(you thought your dentist made &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; open wide)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Talk about sundering! The 10th-century Gosforth Cross in England is thought to include a portrayal of Vidar fighting the wolf. Unfortunately, the foot with the great boot isn't visible (it's inside the wolf's mouth). It makes sense that you would need an especially thickly-soled shoe if you were planning to stick your foot inside the mouth of a giant wolf, doesn't it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing we haven't addressed is Snorri's assertion that Vidar is "almost equal in strength to Thor." If he really is, shouldn't we see him in more of the Norse myths? Shouldn't he have some epic battles with Thor to see who's the most awesome of the&amp;nbsp;Æsir?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6DNXyUoqpkk/T4JMHWPVMuI/AAAAAAAAA20/aP_l2NFWH1s/s1600/Thor+versus+Vidar+annual+12+1984+Marvel+Comicws+Bob+Budiansky.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6DNXyUoqpkk/T4JMHWPVMuI/AAAAAAAAA20/aP_l2NFWH1s/s200/Thor+versus+Vidar+annual+12+1984+Marvel+Comicws+Bob+Budiansky.jpg" width="130" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Marvel Comics actually did try to&lt;br /&gt;imagine a battle between Thor and&lt;br /&gt;Vidar. They forgot the giant boot.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The answer is actually quite simple. Thor's mortal enemy is the World Serpent, a snake so huge that it circles the entire planet as it lurks at the bottom of the ocean and waits for&amp;nbsp;Ragnarök. The snake is the greatest and most terrifying of all the monsters of Norse mythology, and Thor is so evenly matched with it that they [&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;SPOILER ALERT!&lt;/span&gt;] kill each other in the final battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vidar's enemy is Fenris, the &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;most terrifying monster in all of Norse myth. Fenris is a giant wolf powerful enough to kill Odin, the chief of the&amp;nbsp;Æsir&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;and Odin's no pushover! Vidar kills Fenris (and survives), so he must be the second strongest of the gods. Sometimes these things aren't so complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this avalanche of information tells you everything you ever wanted to know about the god with the "greatest boot."

In the 8th century, heathen Anglo-Saxon celebrations in her honor were recorded by the Venerable Bede. Other written records show similar worship of her German counterpart Ostarâ on the continent. These pagan celebrations were deliberately overwritten with Christian ritual by Church authorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also discussed how the story of the Norse god Balder's death and resurrection provided a space for interfaith dialogue between pagans, Christians and those who were &lt;i&gt;blandinn í trú&lt;/i&gt; (“mixed in faith”) in the northern world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of the article, however, was an examination of the role of religion in contemporary American political life. In this follow-up article, I revisit these issues to see what has changed in the last twelve months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The president has insisted that his “public service is part of that effort to express [his] Christian faith.” Mr. Obama’s private faith is his own business; my question is whether he has done anything to protect the rights of those who follow minority religions. Is democracy another word for mob rule, or do Americans have a responsibility to make sure that members of minorities don’t have their rights trampled by those in the majority?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, President Obama has now taken an even stronger stand on his private religion guiding his public policy. His insistence that Christian belief permeates his political life is understandable, given the bizarre attacks on his faith by right-wing politicians and pundits. However, his &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/02/remarks-president-national-prayer-breakfast"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at this year's National Prayer Breakfast&amp;nbsp;is striking for its preacherly tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of what the president says is simply not believable, but appears purely aimed at mollifying Evangelical voters – “I wake up each morning and I say a brief prayer, and I spend a little time in scripture and devotion.” Mr. Obama has room in his schedule to engage in daily Bible study before his morning briefing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other statements were interesting in light of recent actions taken by the president. He&amp;nbsp;said, “I know the version of that Golden Rule is found in every major religion and every set of beliefs – from Hinduism to Islam to Judaism to the writings of Plato.” As we saw last year, Mr. Obama chooses to ignore religious ideas that don’t line up with his own faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kQ_OykvKrv4/T3oaM6iq92I/AAAAAAAAAz4/m9rivPj5lPc/s1600/odin's+self+sacrifice+on+the+world+tree+by+w.g.+collingwood+sayings+of+the+high+one.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kQ_OykvKrv4/T3oaM6iq92I/AAAAAAAAAz4/m9rivPj5lPc/s200/odin's+self+sacrifice+on+the+world+tree+by+w.g.+collingwood+sayings+of+the+high+one.jpg" width="153" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Odin wouldn't take all this bunk&lt;br /&gt;from congressional Republicans&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hávamál&lt;/i&gt; ("Sayings of the High One"), the Norse god Odin says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I advise you, Loddfáfnir, to take this advice,&lt;br /&gt;it will be useful if you learn it,&lt;br /&gt;do you good, if you have it:&lt;br /&gt;where you recognize evil, speak out against it,&lt;br /&gt;and give no truces to your enemies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are several passages in the Old Norse texts emphasizing this idea that dishonest dealers must be strongly dealt with. Many American progressives truly wish that the president would “give no truces” to congressional Republicans. Senator Mitch McConnell famously said, “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” Mr. Obama reacts to such unbending opposition with repeated invitations to the White House to discuss compromise. It would be nice if he was willing to temper his love of the Golden Rule with other words of Odin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Again, concerning the one whom you don’t trust,&lt;br /&gt;and whose mind you suspect:&lt;br /&gt;you should laugh with him and disguise your thoughts,&lt;br /&gt;a gift should be repaid with a like one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other comments by the president show that he simply does not put his own faith into practice. When discussing his economic policies, Mr. Obama says, “But for me as a Christian, [giving up tax breaks] also coincides with Jesus’s teaching that ‘for unto whom much is given, much shall be required.’” This is a nice sentiment, but does not reflect the president’s actual actions. In February, he proposed reducing the top corporate tax rate by seven percent and giving some manufactures a ten percent break. In Christ's &lt;a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+18%3A9-14&amp;amp;version=NIV"&gt;parable&lt;/a&gt; of the Pharisee and the tax collector, Jesus clearly condemns those who brag that their tax rate reflects their religious righteousness. Strangely enough, the words of the president line up with those of the man rebuked by Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2007, Mr. Obama said, “If American workers are being denied their right to organize when I’m in the White House, I will put on a comfortable pair of shoes, and I will walk that picket line with you as President of the United States.” Union members in Madison, Wisconsin are still waiting for the president to appear in support of their protests.  Whatever happened to “as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me”? Why is the president unwilling to take a stand with his “brothers”? In his speech at the Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Obama said that “each and every day, for many in this room, the biblical injunctions are not just words, they are also deeds.” Unfortunately, he seems to have not included himself in the statement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I asked whether these Prayer Breakfasts imply endorsement of particular religions that happen to have powerful voting blocs. Are they really just fundraising events that allow representatives of majority faiths to purchase influence? I recently discovered the unequivocal answer on the National Prayer Breakfast&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.waleadership.com/national-prayer-breakfast"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Despite the president’s passing reference to Hinduism and Greek religion (?), the website states:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Speakers have varied over the years, ranging from Muslim, Christian and Jewish religions. This interfaith gathering features speakers focused on affirming commonly held religious values and putting aside political differences. National and world leaders have read from the Bible, the Torah, and quoted the Koran.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aSal6YiM-IM/T3odJajFT_I/AAAAAAAAA0A/6EXoyN_SGf4/s1600/president+george+w+bush+and+bono+u2+national+prayer+breakfast+2006.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="138" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aSal6YiM-IM/T3odJajFT_I/AAAAAAAAA0A/6EXoyN_SGf4/s200/president+george+w+bush+and+bono+u2+national+prayer+breakfast+2006.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;President George W. Bush with Bono,&lt;br /&gt;featured speaker at the 2006&lt;br /&gt;National Prayer Breakfast&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;That’s not really a range, is it? It’s clear that this meeting is for leaders from the three Abrahamic traditions. The &lt;a href="http://www.waleadership.com/keynote-speakers"&gt;website page&lt;/a&gt; featuring past keynote speakers has three Catholics, two Presbyterians, a Methodist, a preacher from the Church of Christ, a self-identified “serious Christian,” a person calling himself “a follower of Jesus” and a&amp;nbsp;Modern Orthodox Jew.&amp;nbsp;This is a very strange definition of &lt;i&gt;interfaith&lt;/i&gt;, as the website for the event clearly states that this is “a place where state and community leaders can come together with emerging leaders around the person of Jesus.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the monetary issue, the website says that “registration for the National Prayer Breakfast is by state quota and by invitation only,” then gives the following instructions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Attendance as a Washington state guest at the National Prayer Breakfast is $650/person. This is made up of:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;1) National Prayer Breakfast events $500 per person (either paid by check made out to National Leadership Seminars, or by credit card information included on your nomination form).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;2) Washington state guest events totalling $150 per person. Washington state guests have additional events planned around the National Prayer Breakfast. The $150 extra you will pay covers a briefing meeting in the NW Suite, a breakfast on the Hill with Washington state Congressmembers, a Suite brunch and a dinner debrief as well as group transportation to The Cedars, The Hill and The Southeast White House.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This doesn’t exactly line up with “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven;” it seems a lot more like brazen influence-peddling. It may be&amp;nbsp;“easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God,”&amp;nbsp;but it sure seems easier for a rich man to buy his way into the halls of federal power than it is for a poor man to get a hearing from his elected representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, I discussed polls showing that Americans require presidential candidates to be true believers. This issue has clearly come to the forefront in the Republican presidential primary. The candidates have fallen over themselves to protest their own faith and question the faith of their opponents. The Interfaith Alliance’s Reverend C. Welton Gaddy has said, “I think that religion is playing a role in this election cycle unlike any in recent history. Religion has entered the Republican primary as a topic of conversation.” The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the Republican rhetoric in this election cycle has focused on the president’s supposed “War on Religion.” Strangely enough, the presidential hopefuls are painting a picture of Mr. Obama attacking those who hold Christian beliefs. This is actually the opposite of the truth, as should be clear from everything I’ve written above. On the other hand, there does seem to be an attack on minority faiths – maybe not a fully-fledged war, but at least a clear offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As reported by &lt;a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/usdas-culture-war-against-sacred-places"&gt;Indian Country Today&lt;/a&gt;, “U.S. Department of Agriculture and its Forest Service continue to wage their long-standing culture war against Native American sacred places.” Mr. Obama has, sadly, abandoned his campaign promise to support “legal protections for sacred places and cultural traditions, including Native ancestors’ burial grounds and churches.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c4qcd7Ayntc/T3oeNzXYcxI/AAAAAAAAA0I/9z6kGtPMAQA/s1600/protesters+against+obama+desecration+of+native+american+sacred+sites+san+francisco+peaks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="133" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c4qcd7Ayntc/T3oeNzXYcxI/AAAAAAAAA0I/9z6kGtPMAQA/s200/protesters+against+obama+desecration+of+native+american+sacred+sites+san+francisco+peaks.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Protesters call on President Obama to stop&lt;br /&gt;desecration of sacred Native American sites&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The Obama administration has defeated legal challenges to its granting of a permit to expand the Arizona Snowbowl’s use of the San Franciso Peaks, which are sacred to Hopi, Navajo and other Native American nations. The 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act requires all federal agencies to consult with leaders of traditional Native American religions when making decisions that affect religious practice. Government officials were bizarrely disrespectful during meetings on this particular issue, asking questions like, “You say your Gods walk around the [Peaks]. How big are their feet?” Would they dare to talk in this disgusting manner to Christian, Jewish or Muslim leaders?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been numerous breaches of faith with the Native American community in recent years, despite formal federal guidelines. What else is new? Our national media has completely fallen down on the case and totally ignored the issue. Interested individuals must turn to Native American online media outlets, as our country’s so-called religion journalists are too busy reporting on the Republican fantasy of an anti-Christian religious war to take any notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another battle that has gone largely unnoticed is the censorship of access to information about minority religions by publicly-funded institutions. In January, the &lt;a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion-belief/hunter-v-salem-public-library-board-trustees"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union&lt;/a&gt; filed &lt;i&gt;Hunter v. Salem Public Library Board of Trustees&lt;/i&gt;. [Note to the witchy: this is Salem, Missouri – not Salem, Massachussetts.]  The lawsuit charges “the Salem Public Library and its board of trustees with unconstitutionally blocking access to websites discussing minority religions by improperly classifying them as ‘occult’ or ‘criminal.’”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SxIRX-HdgJw/T3ogOBkmINI/AAAAAAAAA0g/iROLuARaR-s/s1600/mighty+thor+computer+keyboard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="73" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SxIRX-HdgJw/T3ogOBkmINI/AAAAAAAAA0g/iROLuARaR-s/s200/mighty+thor+computer+keyboard.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;I wonder if the library also blocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Norse Mythology Blog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Anaka Hunter contacted the ACLU after library software blocked her access to websites on pagan traditions and Native American religions. When she protested to library staff, library director Glenda Wofford unblocked only portions of the sites, and allegedly told Hunter that “she would only allow access to blocked sites if she felt patrons had a legitimate reason to view the content and further said that she had an obligation to report people who wanted to view these sites to the authorities.” With all the overheated political rhetoric about religious freedom, where are representatives of either political party when there actually is an attack of freedom of religion? [Insert sound of chirping crickets.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;America is not alone in undergoing these strange attacks on minority religions. In March, &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; (UK) ran an article called “&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/25/atheists-please-read-heathen-manifesto"&gt;Atheists, please read my heathen manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.” In it, author Julian Baggini puts out a call to non-believers to abandon the term &lt;i&gt;atheist&lt;/i&gt; (due to what he calls “unhelpful connotations”) and adopt the term &lt;i&gt;heathen&lt;/i&gt;. The article goes on to elaborate his idea with subsections on “Why we are heathens,” “We are secularists,” “Heathens can be religious,” and “This manifesto is less concerned with distinguishing heathens from others than forging links between us and others.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article has done little to bolster what little respect I have left for religion journalists and religion editors in the mainstream media. Is there really no one at &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; who has spent any time studying the history of religion? Not one editor who bothered to look up the historical or current use of the word &lt;i&gt;heathen&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8XVqdoJjN3o/T3oYcZztH1I/AAAAAAAAAzo/YJp12HmSL1c/s1600/Bishop+Ulfilas+explains+the+Gospels+to+the+Goths+Bischof+Ulfilas+erkla%CC%88rt+den+Goten+das+Evangelium.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8XVqdoJjN3o/T3oYcZztH1I/AAAAAAAAAzo/YJp12HmSL1c/s200/Bishop+Ulfilas+explains+the+Gospels+to+the+Goths+Bischof+Ulfilas+erkla%CC%88rt+den+Goten+das+Evangelium.jpg" width="147" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Ulfilas discusses religion&lt;br /&gt;with heathen Goths&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;i&gt;Heathen&lt;/i&gt; is an ancient Germanic term for followers of pagan faiths that goes back to at least the 4th century, when Ulfilas used the Gothic &lt;i&gt;haiþno&lt;/i&gt; to describe female pagans. The word took various forms in northern Europe, including the Old English &lt;i&gt;hæðen&lt;/i&gt; (“pagan man,” used especially of Danish invaders who followed the Norse gods) and the Old Norse &lt;i&gt;heiðinn&lt;/i&gt; (“pagan”). The latter term is used throughout the Icelandic sagas to distinguish followers of the Old Way from those who had adopted the new Christian faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last few decades, the term has been used to designate followers of the contemporary Norse religion that is also known as Ásatrú (“faith in the Æsir”). This usage is not secret. I would direct Mr. Baggini and his editors to the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/paganism/subdivisions/heathenry_1.shtml"&gt;BBC page&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, which respectfully explains both historical and modern forms of the religion.&amp;nbsp;It would be a nice gesture for &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; to issue an apology to practitioners of modern heathenry for attempting to co-opt the name of their faith, but I wouldn't advise holding your breath waiting for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The behavior of &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; goes hand-in-hand with the mainstream American media’s continuing failure to cover minority religions. National Public Radio librarian Elizabeth Allin has released &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2011/12/20/144018419/is-npr-doing-too-many-stories-about-catholicism?ft=1&amp;amp;f=17370252"&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt; for the network’s 2011 religious coverage, by stories per faith:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Islam: 148&lt;br /&gt;Christianity: 63&lt;br /&gt;Judaism: 55&lt;br /&gt;Catholicism: 39&lt;br /&gt;Buddhism: 14&lt;br /&gt;Mormonism: 12&lt;br /&gt;Protestantism: 6&lt;br /&gt;Amish: 2&lt;br /&gt;Hinduism: 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you add up the various forms of Christianity, the numbers look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Islam: 148&lt;br /&gt;Christian: 121&lt;br /&gt;Judaism: 55&lt;br /&gt;Buddhism: 14&lt;br /&gt;Hinduism: 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take it one step further, the numbers can be also crunched like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abrahamic faiths: 324&lt;br /&gt;Non-Abrahamic faiths: 15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the personal beliefs and biases of the reporters and producers, it is clear that they are not giving the American public real information about faiths outside the Big Three. NPR (and other media outlets) can argue that they don’t have time or space to dedicate to every faith. This is given the lie by the endless coverage of pop culture Evangelicals like Justin Bieber, Tim Tebow and Jeremy Lin. Religion journalists are making conscious decisions to ignore certain faiths, due to either prejudice or ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much reporting, however, has been done on the conflict between President Obama and the Catholic bishops over the issue of birth control. Some supporters of the president insist that his actions showed subtle skills in political jiu jitsu, and that he cleverly played the bishops. A careful examination of the case shows other issues at play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HAop7EZuhBs/T3ohRc-iS2I/AAAAAAAAA0o/1JYJlcavf8k/s1600/pope+benedict+ratzinger+throne.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HAop7EZuhBs/T3ohRc-iS2I/AAAAAAAAA0o/1JYJlcavf8k/s320/pope+benedict+ratzinger+throne.jpg" width="180" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;American women don't get&lt;br /&gt;to vote for the Pope&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Catholic bishops, of course, are appointed members of an all-male organization led by the internally-chosen leader of a foreign state – the Pope is literally&amp;nbsp;“Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City.”&amp;nbsp;Why did Mr. Obama allow representatives of what is essentially an exclusively male, non-democratic foreign government to have any say in the internal governmental policies of the United States&amp;nbsp;– especially those that affect the most private concerns of American women?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the money (and the votes): the 77.7 million Catholics in the US are the largest religious denomination in the nation and form approximately twenty-five percent of the electorate. It would be political suicide for the president to openly oppose such a large voting bloc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The religious rights of followers of Native American and other minority faiths, on the other hand, can be freely ignored. Mr. Obama, in his &lt;a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/obama-speeches/speech/928/"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of the Catholic compromise, said&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Now, we live in a pluralist – pluralistic society where we're not going to agree on every single issue or share every belief. That doesn't mean that we have to choose between individual liberty and basic fairness for all Americans. We are unique among nations for having been founded upon both these principles and our obligation as citizens is to carry them forward. I have complete faith that we can do that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Liberty and fairness for all Americans, however, doesn’t include followers of minority religious groups that lack financial and political clout. The 1990 Supreme Court decision in &lt;i&gt;Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith&lt;/i&gt; ruled that religious beliefs do not free individuals from complying with local or federal law. Members of the Native American Church were told that the state law forbidding use of peyote trumped Indian ritual use of the plant – a religious practice that predates the formation of the United States itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l5Yfp1CyBbw/T3oh38elWPI/AAAAAAAAA0w/Kdiuz4RtkQY/s1600/peyote.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="135" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-l5Yfp1CyBbw/T3oh38elWPI/AAAAAAAAA0w/Kdiuz4RtkQY/s200/peyote.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Peyote cactus - a grave threat to America&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Judge Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion declared that religious beliefs do not provide immunity from the law. “To permit this,” he wrote, “would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Obama has taken a different view, as he stated in his announcement on birth control coverage: “Now, as we moved to implement this rule, however, we've been mindful that there's another principle at stake here, and that's the principle of religious liberty, an inalienable right that is enshrined in our Constitution.” He continued: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;I also know that some religious institutions, particularly those affiliated with the Catholic Church, have a religious objection to directly providing insurance that covers contraceptive services for their employees. And that's why we originally exempted all churches from this requirement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mr. Obama says that he has faith in “basic fairness for all Americans,” yet his exemption directly contradicts the Supreme Court ruling. The judicial branch has specifically denied religious exemption to minority faiths, and the executive branch has openly given it to majority religions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clearly answers the question I posed last year about the president privileging some faiths over others. This aggrandizement of powerful religious groups is also reflected in the Obama-appointed advisory council on faith-based programs, which is almost exclusively Christian. In my previous article, I questioned the membership of this group. Several others have spoken out on the issue, including Suhag Sukla of the Hindu American Foundation. At this year’s Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Obama said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Since we’ve expanded and strengthened the White House faith-based initiative, we’ve partnered with Catholic Charities to help Americans who are struggling with poverty; worked with organizations like World Vision and American Jewish World Service and Islamic Relief to bring hope to those suffering around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note that, once more, he only mentions the Abrahamic religions. He also said, “we’re linking arms with faith-based groups all across the country.” The &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ofbnp/about/council"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of the White House Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships lists the members of the group, which includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15 Christians&lt;br /&gt;3 Jews&lt;br /&gt;2 Muslims&lt;br /&gt;1 Hindu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i-lNotF7LFI/T3ojwLA8xpI/AAAAAAAAA04/0vUPY1lISww/s1600/Council+on+Faith-Based+and+Neighborhood+Partnerships+obama+2010.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i-lNotF7LFI/T3ojwLA8xpI/AAAAAAAAA04/0vUPY1lISww/s320/Council+on+Faith-Based+and+Neighborhood+Partnerships+obama+2010.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;President Obama with faith-based council members in 2010&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Last year, Reverend Gaddy said of the council, “I would think that it would have been a priority to have had a Muslim leader on there and at least one representative from the non-Abrahamic traditions.” The White House has followed the letter of this suggestion, if not the spirit. Mr. Obama is clearly sticking to his past statement that America “is a country that is still predominantly Christian.” Sadly, nothing in the past year has shown that he has any interest in protecting the rights of minority religions or listening to their concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's one last quote from Odin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;The eagle snaps and cranes his neck when he comes to the sea,&lt;br /&gt;to the ancient ocean;&lt;br /&gt;so does a man who comes among the multitude&lt;br /&gt;and has few people to speak for him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Who among us will be brave enough to speak for the voiceless and defend the defenseless? As one-time Obama supporter Matt Damon has said,&amp;nbsp;“I no longer hope for audacity.”</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/514543576103712094/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=514543576103712094&amp;isPopup=true' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/514543576103712094'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/514543576103712094'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/04/obama-and-ostara-one-year-later.html' title='OBAMA AND OSTARA: ONE YEAR LATER'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

There were a few drainage ditches originally dug through the area, but it was not known what lay to the right and left of the trenches.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“The discovery is unique in a Norwegian context, the first ever made in our latitudes,” says Preben Rønne of the Science Museum at the University of Trondheim, who led the excavations.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;The temple may have been built sometime around or after the year 400 CE and thus been used for hundreds of years, until the people emigrated to avoid Christianity’s straitjacket. It consisted of a stone-set&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;sacrificial altar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;and also traces of a pole-building that probably housed idols in the form of logs with carved faces of Thor, Odin, Frey and Freya. Deceased relatives of high rank were also portrayed in this way and worshiped. Nearby, by the archaeologists also uncovered a procession route.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;Thanks to the soil, the temple was very well-preserved.

The pole-building a few meters away was rectangular, had a 5.3-by-4.5 meter floor plan, and was erected with 12 pillars – each having a strong stone foundation. It may have been a tall building, and the findings made very clear that it was not used as a dwelling. Among other things, it had no fireplace. Inside the building were found traces of four pillars that may be evidence of a high seat where the idols stood between ceremonies. A processional road west of the temple – and headed straight towards the pole-building – was marked with two parallel rows of large stones, the longest series at least 25 feet long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;STRANGE BURIAL MOUND&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;When archaeologists began excavation work last year, the site was thought at first to be a flat burial mound with a main grave and one or more secondary graves.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“But as we dug, the stone cairn appeared more and more peculiar,” says Rønne.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“Approximately in the middle of the excavation, we had to admit that it was not a burial mound, but a sacrificial altar – in the Norse sources called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;horg&lt;/i&gt;. It was made up of both round domed rocks and stone slabs. During the work, we found two glass beads – and also some burned bones and traces of a wooden box that had been filled with red-brown sand/gravel and a broken cooking stone. Among the bones, we found part of a skull and several human teeth. However, we found no&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;‘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;gold old men&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;– small human figures of thin gold – which were often used in connection with sacrifices.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BEaeJdHTaXc/T3X9gVm4LKI/AAAAAAAAAzU/uox9TNCtzFw/s1600/glass+beads+found+on+top+of+heathen+pagan+temple+norway.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BEaeJdHTaXc/T3X9gVm4LKI/AAAAAAAAAzU/uox9TNCtzFw/s1600/glass+beads+found+on+top+of+heathen+pagan+temple+norway.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Glass beads found on top of sacrificial altar during excavation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;The most recent dating of the temple is from between 895 CE and 990 CE. Precisely in this period, Christianity was introduced by heavy-handed methods in Norway. This meant that many left the country to retain their original faith.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“Probably the people who used the temple were among those who chose to emigrate, either to Iceland or other North Atlantic islands,” said Rønne. “Posts from the pole-building were, in fact, pulled up and removed. The whole&amp;nbsp;‘altar’&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;was carefully covered with earth and clay precisely during the transition to Christian times. Therefore, the cult site was completely forgotten.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;UNIQUE IN NORWAY&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;Large pre-Christian cult sites in Scandinavia – often large settlements with a large central hall and a smaller attached building – have not been found in Norway. However, they have been found in Central and Southern Sweden (Skåne), and also in eastern Denmark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“Under the sacrificial altar, we found a fire pit that actually lay directly on the prehistoric plow-layer. The charcoal from this tomb is now dated to 500-400 BCE. Thus, the site may have been regarded as sacred – or at least had a special status – long before the stone altar was built. In the prehistoric plow-layer under the fire pit, we could clearly see the traces of plowing with a plow or plow-precursor,” said Rønne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0d-ZWIULYHQ/T3X-wbH8wNI/AAAAAAAAAzc/KIV5ONS8F7Y/s1600/pre-excavated+heathen+pagan+temple+norway+embankments.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0d-ZWIULYHQ/T3X-wbH8wNI/AAAAAAAAAzc/KIV5ONS8F7Y/s1600/pre-excavated+heathen+pagan+temple+norway+embankments.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The temple site before excavation, in the shape of a circular&lt;br /&gt;stone setting with an opening in the middle of the cleared area.&lt;br /&gt;Embankments behind show the thick layers of soil that were&lt;br /&gt;once laid over the temple to hide it.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;According to Rønne, the find was easy to interpret as a temple from Norse sources. It was also from precisely the Trøndelag area that the largest exodus of people who wanted to retain their freedom&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;and not become Christians&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;– t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;ook place. A large part of them went to Iceland between between 870 CE and 930 CE – i.e., during Harald Fairhair’s time. In all, 40 people from Trøndelag are specifically mentioned in the Norse sources. In Iceland, their descendants later wrote a large part of these sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“Indications are that the people who deliberately covered up the temple in Ranheim took the posts from the pole-building – in addition to soil from the altar – to the place where they settled down and raised a new temple. Because our findings and the Norse sources work well together, the sources may be more reliable than many scientists believed,” said Rønne.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;Now the unique Ranheim shrine will be removed forever to make way for housing. Not all agree.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“The facility will be a great tourist attraction, if it is simultaneously disclosed what happened on the site. It is unique in Norway, says civil engineer Arvid Ystad, who has – on private initiative – applied to both the Directorate for Cultural Heritage and the Society for the Preservation Norwegian Ancient Monuments for site conservation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;"&gt;“The location of the homes could easily be adapted to this unique cultural heritage, without anyone losing their residential lots. It could have been an attraction for new residents and tell them much about the history of the site from over 1,000 years ago. Unfortunately, housing construction is now underway,” said Rønne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/7657128579820666833/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=7657128579820666833&amp;isPopup=true' title='5 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/7657128579820666833'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/7657128579820666833'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/03/unmatched-heathen-shrine-found.html' title='UNMATCHED HEATHEN SHRINE FOUND'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

How many are there, and do they have control over every aspect of life, or are there parts that not even the gods could control?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VxcnXL1rJFY/T2joLYrBxYI/AAAAAAAAAxs/l9EjKRqBdsE/s1600/norse+gods+goddesses+attributes+So%CC%81l+Hrafnsdo%CC%81ttir.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VxcnXL1rJFY/T2joLYrBxYI/AAAAAAAAAxs/l9EjKRqBdsE/s320/norse+gods+goddesses+attributes+So%CC%81l+Hrafnsdo%CC%81ttir.jpg" width="319" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;How many of the Norse gods &amp;amp; goddesses can you identify&lt;br /&gt;from their attributes in this artwork by Sól Hrafnsdóttir?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – In the book known as the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;, the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Icelandic writer Snorri Sturluson lists the main gods as Odin, Thor, Njörð, Frey, Týr, Heimdall, Bragi, Vídar, Váli, Ull, Hœnir, Forseti and Loki. He does, however, say that Loki is only “numbered among the Æsir,” so his status as a god is a bit suspect. Snorri lists the main goddesses (Ásynjur) as Frigg, Freya, Gefjon, Idun, Gerd, Sigyn, Fulla, Nanna, Sága, Eir, Lofn, Vár, Vör, Hlín, Snotra, Gná and Sól; he neglects to mention Thor’s wife Sif and the icy maiden Skadi. Like Loki, Skadi is (temporarily) aligned with the gods – she’s actually a giant-maiden associated with mountains, skiing and archery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;There are, as you said, many figures (even beyond what I’ve listed here), but some of them don’t really have developed characters or stories associated with them. In fact, some scholars argue that these lesser gods and goddesses may merely be aspects of the better-known gods that have “branched off” into separate entities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I don’t know if I would use the word &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;control &lt;/i&gt;when talking of the gods' relationship to the various aspects of life.&amp;nbsp;I think a better word might be &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;influence&lt;/i&gt;. The gods are definitely involved in all aspects of life – birth, death, love, war, creativity, wealth, power, etc – but their contact with humanity is much more interactive and interesting than simple control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br style="mso-special-character: line-break;" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yBif7GA0WQg/T2jpDLuj0WI/AAAAAAAAAx0/2rr2dl4-SHQ/s1600/ark+of+the+covenant.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yBif7GA0WQg/T2jpDLuj0WI/AAAAAAAAAx0/2rr2dl4-SHQ/s320/ark+of+the+covenant.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;If you ever have to carry the Ark of the Covenant, please be careful!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The Norse gods are very different from the god of the Old Testament, who demands obedience and adherence to his commandments, and who (for example) smites you with lightning if you accidentally bump into the Ark of the Covenant. In the Old Norse worldview, the gods were actors on the stage of life, not all-powerful directors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Possibly the strongest evidence for the Norse gods &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; controlling life is the fact that they themselves can die – that they are subject to the decrees of the Norns, the three mystic women who spin the fates of all living things. The gods (especially Odin) may mightily struggle against destiny, but they do not control it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;TL – Throughout all the sources I’ve looked through while working on my project, most have told me that information on the Norse religion is scarce and hard to find, due to the lack of writing used in Viking culture. How lacking is this info? &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – There actually is a lot of information, and our body of knowledge is continually growing. New archaeological finds occur fairly regularly, and each discovery adds another piece to the puzzle of our understanding of this ancient culture. Linguists and philologists work to reconstruct long-lost language-forms and dialects. Historians study primary sources written by Greek and Roman authors for their descriptions of the Germanic and Nordic traditions of their times. Literary scholars pour over the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Eddas&lt;/i&gt; and sagas of Iceland and try to piece together a coherent picture of the mythology and religion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;You are right, however, about the lack of written sources from the actual believers in the ancient faith. Most of our written records come from well after the conversion to Christianity, when the new religion brought the traditions of Latin learning and writing with it as it moved into northern Europe. We really have a collection of second- or third-hand descriptions of religious practice that were written down by (at best) interested non-believers or (at worst) individuals who were actively hostile to the Old Way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHCcN8HHg8I/T2jpqZlP1II/AAAAAAAAAx8/2jcXVDySnUM/s1600/viking+reading+book.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NHCcN8HHg8I/T2jpqZlP1II/AAAAAAAAAx8/2jcXVDySnUM/s1600/viking+reading+book.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Books are awesome.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Today, there is a vast body of scholarship on all aspects of Norse history and religion. However, it’s very difficult to find reliable information on the Internet, which tends to be dominated by superficial, non-scholarly material. If you have access to a university library – or a good public library – you will find a whole world of books waiting for you on these subjects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;TL – Why wasn’t the Runic writing system – the system said to be created by Odin himself in the old tales – not used to write down the legends that skalds told?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The runic system was mainly used for carving in stone and wood. The tradition of writing on parchment with ink came in with the arrival of Christian learning. In pre-Christian times, poems and stories were preserved as oral tradition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;A story from &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Gautrek’s Saga&lt;/i&gt; underscores the importance of memory for the poet-storyteller. Odin, disguised as Grani Horsehair (&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;grani&lt;/i&gt; means “moustache”), takes the hero Starkad to a meeting of the gods. Thor is mad at Starkad, since the hero’s mother chose a giant for a mate instead of the Thunder God. Whatever gift Odin gives the hero, Thor cancels out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Then just about midnight, Grani Horsehair woke up his foster-son Starkad and asked him to come along with him. They got a small boat and rowed over to another island. They walked through a wood until they came to a clearing where a large number of people were attending a meeting. There were eleven men sitting on chairs but a twelfth chair was empty. Starkad and his foster-father joined the assembly, and Grani Horsehair seated himself on the twelfth chair. Everyone present greeted him by the name Odin, and he said that the judges would now have to decide on Starkad's fate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Then Thor spoke up and said: 'Starkad's mother, Alfhild, preferred a brainy giant to Thor himself as the father of her son. So I ordain that Starkad himself shall have neither a son nor a daughter, and his family will end with him.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I ordain that he shall live for three life spans.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'He shall commit a most foul deed in every one of them.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I ordain that he shall have the best in weapons and clothing.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'I ordain that he shall have neither land nor estates.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I give him this, that he shall vast sums of money.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'I lay this curse on him, that he shall never be satisfied with what he has.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I give him victory and fame in every battle.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'I lay this curse on him, that in every battle he shall be sorely wounded.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I give him the art of poetry, so that he shall compose verses as fast as he can speak.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'He shall never remember afterwards what he composes.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin: 'I ordain that he shall be most highly thought of by all the noblest people and the best.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Thor: 'The common people shall hate him every one.'&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Then the judges decreed that all that had been said should happen to Starkad. The assembly broke up, and Grani Horse-hair and Starkad went back to their boat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4WJiXZ4wWFY/T2jrML2S4JI/AAAAAAAAAyE/yIiES1MonZg/s1600/Starka%C3%B0r+Starkad+rune+staffs+runes+Starcaterus+pugil+Suctius+1555+%09Olaus+Magnus+Historia+de+gentibus+septentrionalibus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4WJiXZ4wWFY/T2jrML2S4JI/AAAAAAAAAyE/yIiES1MonZg/s320/Starka%C3%B0r+Starkad+rune+staffs+runes+Starcaterus+pugil+Suctius+1555+%09Olaus+Magnus+Historia+de+gentibus+septentrionalibus.jpg" width="202" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Here's an illustration of Starkad from 1555.&lt;br /&gt;The huge rune-stick in his right hand&lt;br /&gt;gives the Latin version of his name.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Odin, the god of poetic inspiration, gives Starkad the ability to compose poetry on the spot, like a freestyle rapper. Thor makes the gift useless by decreeing that Starkad won’t be able to remember what he composes after he speaks it. In an age when the written word was still uncommon, this meant that Starkad’s poetry would be instantly lost. From this tale, you can see that simply being creative wasn’t enough; you had to remember what you had composed, too!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;TL – Do the stories told by the Norsemen affect our culture any great deal today without most people knowing?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;They do. When you study English literature in high school or college, you’ll find that one of the foundational works of Old English is &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt;, which details both historical and legendary events in Denmark and other northern locales. It preserves alternate versions of famous legends, including that of the great dragon-slayer Sigurd/Siegfried (although Beowulf switches the roles of Sigurd and his father, Sigmund).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CbFLWX8YLwI/T2js8XpaiaI/AAAAAAAAAyM/6gAQm7v_Eb0/s1600/bilbo+baggins+gollum+riddle+contest+the+hobbit+rankin+bass.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CbFLWX8YLwI/T2js8XpaiaI/AAAAAAAAAyM/6gAQm7v_Eb0/s320/bilbo+baggins+gollum+riddle+contest+the+hobbit+rankin+bass.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Many scenes in &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;- like this riddle contest between&lt;br /&gt;Bilbo Baggins &amp;amp; Gollum - come straight from Norse mythology.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien was an expert on Old English and Old Norse literature, and his essay on &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt; influenced the way that way study it in England and America to this day. Tolkien’s books of fantasy fiction (especially &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt;) are full of references to and retellings of Norse myth. How many people watching the Peter Jackson films understand these allusions? Many ideas from Norse mythology (magical runic inscriptions, mystical swords, wandering wizards) have simply become part of the fantasy genre, and their connection to Norse myth goes unnoticed by most people.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The concepts of the Old Way continue to influence politics, too. We developed a different system here in America, but many European nations (and countries where they have had influence) have a parliamentary system. The roots of this system can be traced back to the Þing (pronounced “thing”) of the ancient Germanic world. In Iceland, they actually still use this old name for their parliament.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The Icelandic sagas contain many fascinating stories of debates (and sometimes actual fights) at these long-ago councils, and the myths tell us that even the gods held their own Þings. It’s fascinating that this system of government has survived and evolved over so great a time span.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;There are many other ways Norse myth still lives on around us. You can read about some of them in &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/11/high-school-student-asks-about-norse.html"&gt;my article&lt;/a&gt; answering questions on Norse mythology and Norse religion from a high school student.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eljYm0LY8bQ/T2juAMDppcI/AAAAAAAAAyU/cgBdSxJgP4A/s1600/yggdrasil+world+tree+nine+worlds+norse+mythology.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eljYm0LY8bQ/T2juAMDppcI/AAAAAAAAAyU/cgBdSxJgP4A/s320/yggdrasil+world+tree+nine+worlds+norse+mythology.jpg" width="222" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Norse mythology tells us that the World Tree&lt;br /&gt;connects Nine Worlds, but artists can't seem&lt;br /&gt;to agree on how to illustrate them.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;TL – The Norse gods created several different worlds, each housing its own specific race. Were these separate worlds, or the races within them ever greatly detailed, or just vaguely referenced?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;KS – We know a lot about some of them, very little about others. The myths tell us about Asgard (home of the Æsir) in great detail – about the buildings, the inhabitants, the events that take place there. Thor has adventures in Jötunheim (home of the giants) and meets many of its monstrous inhabitants – he usually ends up smashing them with his mighty hammer. Humans live on Midgard, so you could say that all the sagas deal with this world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;On the other hand, we know very little about Álfheim (home of the light-elves) and its inhabitants. We may &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; we know all about the elves, but most of our image of them comes from later folk tales and fantasy literature; the myths themselves tell us very little. The dwarves appear in the mythology and make treasures for their gods, but no female dwarves ever show up. I wonder if the dwarves spend so much time in their workshops because they can't find any girls to talk to . . .&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The poems, myths and sagas all suggest that ancient people had detailed ideas about the different races of beings. References are made to Álfablót (sacrifice to the elves), for instance. The poems collected in the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; make shadowy references to stories that are now lost. It seems clear that there was once a more detailed conception of these different types of beings, but they haven’t survived in the written record that we have today.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;TL – Were the gods immortal like most gods in other religions? The gods&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;who planned to fight with the forces of evil in Ragnarök&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;seemed to be able to die, so what made them higher then mere men?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The gods are definitely not immortal, and they are not eternal – unlike the god of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, who has always existed. The myths tell us of the “birth” of the first god (he’s actually licked from salty ice by a magic cow) and of the deaths of Odin, Thor and the other major gods. They have both a beginning and an end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JPB43rUQE_E/T2jvjmeAwJI/AAAAAAAAAyc/znZj4evuywA/s1600/das+rheingold+rhine+gold+without+freia+the+gods+age+arthur+rackham+richard+wagner.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JPB43rUQE_E/T2jvjmeAwJI/AAAAAAAAAyc/znZj4evuywA/s320/das+rheingold+rhine+gold+without+freia+the+gods+age+arthur+rackham+richard+wagner.png" width="222" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The gods fade away without their magic apples.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;What enables the gods and goddesses to outlive mortals is their access to mystic apples of youth, harvested by the goddess Idun. As long as they take these sort-of super-vitamins, they stay young and strong. In one story, the giants kidnap Idun, and the gods age and wither until they get her (and her magic apples) back.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The gods are higher than humans in the same way that humans are higher than hamsters; they’re simply a higher order of being. The gods are older and wiser, they are more powerful and stronger, and they have access to all sorts of wondrous things that you and I couldn’t really handle – Thor’s hammer, Odin’s eight-legged horse, Freya’s falcon cloak and so on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;One way to think of the gods is as personifications of powerful natural forces. In fact, one of the old terms for the gods is &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;regin&lt;/i&gt;, which means “powers.” You and I are just people, but some of the gods’ names show their very different natures.

Loki, Hel, Fenrir and Jörmungand will be joined by an army of evil dead and a host of monstrous giants. Surt will raise his flaming sword to lead giants from Muspell, the land of fire to the south. Hrym will lead the giants from the east, raising his shield before him. The monstrous hound named Garm will break free from his bonds and join the attack. All of the Nine Worlds seem to be involved in the battle, but the allegiances of the different groups aren’t completely spelled out. One of the main poems in the &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt; tells us that “the dwarfs howl before their rocky doors,” but it doesn’t tell us whose side they’re on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;TL – Why are the Æsir and Vanir gods so different from one another, and why did the Æsir receive more attention from followers of the religion?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Generally speaking, the Æsir are gods of rulership and war, and the Vanir of fertility. However, their roles tend to overlap. There is historical evidence that Thor was invoked in battle, but he was also seen as the patron of the independent farmer; you can see that this reflects both the destructive power of lightning and the fertile power of the rain that it brings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;At the beginning of this interview, you asked if the gods “have control over every aspect of life.” Together, the two tribes of gods are involved in the totality of existence. Neither group by itself is enough; they need each other to complete the circle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WZcubZfEiQ/T2jyYQjkV5I/AAAAAAAAAys/beamzs698q4/s1600/freya.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WZcubZfEiQ/T2jyYQjkV5I/AAAAAAAAAys/beamzs698q4/s320/freya.jpg" width="187" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Freya was a sorceress before&lt;br /&gt;Odin was a wizard.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;For example, Freya brings knowledge of magical practice from the Vanir to the Æsir. Odin learns this wisdom, and goes on to become a sort of wizard-priest and master of magic. So, is magical knowledge a trait of the Vanir or the Æsir? Although Freya is one of the Vanir – and can be seen, in part, as a goddess of fertility and love – she lives with the Æsir in Asgard and divides with Odin the warriors who die in battle. The two tribes of gods have a very complicated partnership.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I’m not sure that I would say the Æsir received more attention from the followers of the old religion. Odin looms large in the poetry that has survived, but you have to remember that he was the god who inspired poets. It makes sense that they would dedicate their poems to him. If we could go back in time and interview old-time farmers, they might tell us a great number of forgotten tales of Thor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;As a matter of fact, historical sources tell us that the ancient temple at Uppsala in Sweden had a huge statue of Thor in the middle; Odin and Frey were placed off to the side. We also know that Frey himself had very devoted followers in both Sweden and Iceland. My point is that different gods were given varying degrees of importance in different locales.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Snorri Sturluson’s &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt; tells us that women prayed to specific goddesses for specific needs. Earlier, I mentioned the Álfablót (sacrifice to the elves). The elves – mysterious as they are – are associated with the Vanir in the mythology. Frey, one of the most important of the Vanir, lives in Álfheim (home of the elves). As with so much of this material, we seem to be missing some important pieces of the puzzle here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Like we did in the case of Odin and the poets, we should consider who eventually wrote down the myths. If women writers were the ones preserving the records of mythology and religion, we might have a very different idea of the whole subject – perhaps with a greater emphasis on the Vanir.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UEJqwThndeI/T2j0IG1Fw-I/AAAAAAAAAy0/h1vZMXNMdso/s1600/Frey+Marvel+Comics+Thor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UEJqwThndeI/T2j0IG1Fw-I/AAAAAAAAAy0/h1vZMXNMdso/s320/Frey+Marvel+Comics+Thor.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Frey actually has appeared in the pages of &lt;i&gt;The Mighty Thor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;br /&gt;but it seems like Marvel Comics wasn't sure what to do with him.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It’s also important to consider our own contemporary perspective. I grew up reading Thor comics, not Frey comics. It’s a lot easier to write adventure tales about a violent god of thunder than about a peaceful god of fertility. Which would &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; rather read? Our own interests can shape our view of the material, and we need to be careful not to project our own attitudes onto a complicated group of people that lived over a thousand years ago, and who had a very complex relationship with this ancient religion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I would like to thank you for asking me to be part of your school project. Your questions are very insightful and sophisticated. Many of the issues that you raise are the same ones that I discuss with students in my &lt;a href="http://faculty.carthage.edu/kseigfried/"&gt;Norse religion college class&lt;/a&gt;. You’re way ahead of the game in your thinking on these issues, and I am curious to see how your studies progress.

In Summer 2010, I spent three weeks in Iceland getting to know the wonderfully open and friendly members of the Ásatrúarfélagið (“Æsir Faith Fellowship”), the pagan church founded in 1972 that is officially recognized by the Icelandic government. I had been corresponding with several of them for some time via their web forum and email, and they were incredibly welcoming from the moment I arrived in Iceland.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Uw8MiqHW34/T0qk2rTz2EI/AAAAAAAAAvs/BNADqzels6k/s1600/Hilmar+Orn+Hilmarsson+Asatruarfelagid+Aesir+Faith+Fellowship+Iceland+Thingvellir+Naming+Ceremony.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="156" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8Uw8MiqHW34/T0qk2rTz2EI/AAAAAAAAAvs/BNADqzels6k/s320/Hilmar+Orn+Hilmarsson+Asatruarfelagid+Aesir+Faith+Fellowship+Iceland+Thingvellir+Naming+Ceremony.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;A living religion woven into the fabric of everyday life:&lt;br /&gt;Hilmar (left) at Ásatrú name-giving ceremony - June 24, 2010&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;In my interviews with &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/06/interview-with-hilmar-orn-hilmarsson-of.html"&gt;Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson&lt;/a&gt; (allsherjargoði – very roughly translated as&amp;nbsp;“high priest”) and &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/01/interview-with-johanna-g-harardottir-of.html"&gt;Jóhanna G. Harðardóttir&lt;/a&gt; (staðgengill allsherjargoða (“deputy high priestess”), the two church leaders express very different views on how contemporary individuals can experience a living religion that is based on the ancient texts of Norse myth and saga. Since my visit, I have received powerfully moving letters from Hilmar in which he describes his experiences as a spiritual leader – providing grief counseling to the family of friends who died unexpectedly young; presiding over name-giving ceremonies, weddings and funerals; dealing with the business side of building a hof (“temple”) in a country that has gone through an intense economic battering. For the members of the Icelandic church, this is a real, living religion connected to an ancient tradition that impacts their lives as strongly as any other faith – it has nothing to do with wearing a horned helmet and running around the forest with a wooden sword.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fMrX-LN0_0/T0qluJ6MkjI/AAAAAAAAAv0/zvpxEepyBG8/s1600/Presbyterian+Minister+Kurt+Esslinger+Agape+House+University+of+Illinois+at+Chicago+Yggdrasil+Tattoo+World+Tree.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fMrX-LN0_0/T0qluJ6MkjI/AAAAAAAAAv0/zvpxEepyBG8/s200/Presbyterian+Minister+Kurt+Esslinger+Agape+House+University+of+Illinois+at+Chicago+Yggdrasil+Tattoo+World+Tree.jpg" width="150" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Reverend Kurt Esslinger's&lt;br /&gt;Yggdrasil tattoo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Here in Chicago, I have gotten to know Reverend Kurt Esslinger, the Presbyterian minister who runs Agape House at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His dedication to working for positive change is truly inspiring, and his efforts to reach out across cultural, ethnic and religious lines provide a standard for the rest of us. He surprised me recently when he unveiled a massive new tattoo of Yggdrasil, the World Tree of Norse myth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;For Kurt, the World Tree “denotes the permeation of the divine throughout all existence.” I completely agree, and I am happy to know a Christian minister who is open enough to other traditions to be able to embrace the power of this ancient symbol from another faith. I just wish that people with Kurt’s progressive attitude were in charge of more of America’s interfaith organizations – which mostly seem to define “interfaith” as dialogue between various Christian denominations or between Christians and Jews (and sometimes Muslims).&amp;nbsp;There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in only those philosophies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACTIVISTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;One of the ways that Norse myth has inspired contemporary social dialogue is through the progressive political actions of many involved in this international community. For those who espouse an allegiance to the various forms of modern religion that are based (in whole or in part) on the Old Norse faiths, progressive political action is often at the core of their public lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kLzURo7EVfU/T0qneXdch3I/AAAAAAAAAv8/eZ5rX6xaW4k/s1600/Governor+Scott+Walker+Madison+Wisconsin+Capitol+Protests.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="172" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kLzURo7EVfU/T0qneXdch3I/AAAAAAAAAv8/eZ5rX6xaW4k/s320/Governor+Scott+Walker+Madison+Wisconsin+Capitol+Protests.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Protests in Madison - partially Thor-inspired?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;On the other hand, the power of the myths to inspire activism also shows up in purely academic settings; Scott Mellor and several of his students from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Department of Scandinavian Studies were very active participants in the protests against Governor Scott Walker. According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Hárbarðsljóð&lt;/i&gt; ("Harbard's Song"),&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Odin has the nobles who fall in battle&lt;br /&gt;and Thor has the breed of serfs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This political season, Odin may or may not be throwing his runes for the aristocratic Romney; only the Allfather knows what the Allfather knows. Thor, on the other hand, is clearly aligned with the 99%.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson told me that “for some of us, the gods are personifications of natural forces,” and it is this spiritual connection to the natural world that seems to be at the root of actions such as Hilmar’s raising of a traditional níðstöng (“scorn-pole”) against the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Project in an effort to protect a place of great natural beauty from the destructive actions of modern industry. As he told me in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/07/interview-with-hilmar-orn-hilmarsson-of.html"&gt;our interview&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;It’s part of my oath that I will fight with nature [i.e., on nature’s side] and respect the . . . how can I say it? We sincerely believe that, when we settled this country, we did it in good connection with the nature spirits and the spirits of the land. When we do our ceremonies, we are also offering our greetings and pouring out beer for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;genius loci&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the local spirits. I think it’s really important that we should give this country in better shape to our children and grandchildren than we receive it. If you have to take a political stand, so be it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nlF3hUE_X8k/T0qn32M3TFI/AAAAAAAAAwM/2U--MKomH48/s1600/Singv%C3%B8gel+anti-ACTA+demonstration.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="191" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nlF3hUE_X8k/T0qn32M3TFI/AAAAAAAAAwM/2U--MKomH48/s320/Singv%C3%B8gel+anti-ACTA+demonstration.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Singvøgel performs at anti-ACTA demonstration&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;For some time, I have corresponded with members of Germany’s Nornirs Ætt (“Norn’s Family”), another contemporary religious group – particularly the members who belong to the rock band Singvøgel. Along with the organization called Rabenclan, they have been prominent in publicly denouncing right-wing groups. Recently, Singvøgel performed at a German demonstration against ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement), which is the international equivalent of the American SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) that caused such an outcry in January. It’s easy to see how these German activists can find inspiration in Norse myth and legend, with its emphasis on individual freedom and responsibility.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;One of the most interesting connections I have made is with Suhag Shukla, Managing Director of the Hindu American Foundation. I heard her speak with Reverend C. Welton Gaddy on his wonderful&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;State of Belief&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;radio show, and her criticism of President Obama’s advisory council on faith-based programs lined up perfectly with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/04/obama-ostara-president-ponders-easters.html"&gt;my own&lt;/a&gt;. When I contacted her through her Facebook page, she was gracious and kind. I look forward to meeting her in person in the near future and discussing her powerful advocacy for enlarging the scope of respectful interfaith dialogue in the United States.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;LGBT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KUDG91eirdE/T0qpKcIKUeI/AAAAAAAAAwU/3kdfK9pA-5M/s1600/Marvel+Comics+female+Loki+Dylan+Tegue.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KUDG91eirdE/T0qpKcIKUeI/AAAAAAAAAwU/3kdfK9pA-5M/s320/Marvel+Comics+female+Loki+Dylan+Tegue.jpg" width="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Loki expresses his feminine side.&lt;br /&gt;Art by Dylan Teague&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;For those with only a passing acquaintance with Norse mythology, it may come as something of a surprise to read that I have met several members of the LGBT community who are truly passionate about this material. I have met and exchanged letters with gay and lesbian individuals in America and abroad who feel that they can find themselves in Norse myth in a way that they cannot in Christian myth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Specifically, they feel a sort of sympathetic kinship with the complicated figure of Loki. The charismatic trickster of Norse mythology changes gender with aplomb, cross-dresses with gleeful abandon, mates with both male and female partners, makes no distinction between gods and their enemy giants in his choice of partners – he even gives birth. Although I get exhausted just thinking about all this, I can understand why members of the LGBT community find Loki so simpatico. Where in the Judeo-Christian tradition can they find such a colorful character who takes such Samantha-Jones-like delight in his all-embracing, pan-sexual nature?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELIGION JOURNALISTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;The one great disappointment in all of this is the interaction I have had with America’s mainstream religion journalists – actually, the complete &lt;i&gt;lack&lt;/i&gt; of interaction. I feel that many religion journalists have not lived up to the calling of their profession. If I had a nickel for every time I asked a writer who covers religion a question about coverage of faiths other than Christianity, Judaism and Islam&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;and received absolutely no response back . . . well, I sure would have a lot of nickels. This willful ghettoization of minority faiths is shameful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Covering the religion beat for a major national news organization should not mean using your position as a bully pulpit for promoting your own religious views. It should mean digging deeper into religious matters than simply parroting the headlines in the other sections of the newspaper. To pick just one example, if Mitt Romney says that President Obama is waging a “war on religion,” don’t just ask your Christian minister friend if he thinks Obama is really a Christian or not; spend some time with Native American activists and learn about a real war on religion – what&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Indian Country Today&lt;/i&gt;’s Suzan Shown Harjo calls the “&lt;a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/ict_sbc/usdas-culture-war-against-sacred-places"&gt;USDA’s Culture War Against Sacred Places&lt;/a&gt;.” We as a nation need to learn more about the perspectives of minority faiths, not just be fed an incessant stream of statements from leaders of and evangelists for the massive majority religions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9fVLSwJojhs/T0qskdLsfeI/AAAAAAAAAwc/6AYKOz3Gb6E/s1600/Justin+Bieber+Christian+Evangelical+Theologian.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="189" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9fVLSwJojhs/T0qskdLsfeI/AAAAAAAAAwc/6AYKOz3Gb6E/s320/Justin+Bieber+Christian+Evangelical+Theologian.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Is Justin Bieber the most important religious thinker of our times?&lt;br /&gt;Many religion journalists seem to think so.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;Working as a professional religion journalist should also not mean writing endless stories on the (not incredibly deep) proclamations of Christian faith by celebrities like Justin Bieber, Tim Tebow and (new flavor-of-the-month) Jeremy Lin. If you are (as Bernie Mac would say) “a grown-ass man” (or woman) and went to a fancy journalism school, you shouldn’t be writing article after article on, for example, what a eighteen-year-old Auto-Tuned pop singer says about Jesus. You’re better than this. I realize that repeating the simple faith statements of evangelical celebrities will get you more Twitter followers than taking the time to research the deep spiritual beliefs of the followers of minority religions, but I also believe that the benefits to your own spiritual journey – and that of your readers – will be worth making the effort to expand your horizons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_NB44T3xmCI/T0-kQm3LmXI/AAAAAAAAAw0/x2CahZDMFX4/s1600/religion+newswriters+association+logo" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="62" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_NB44T3xmCI/T0-kQm3LmXI/AAAAAAAAAw0/x2CahZDMFX4/s320/religion+newswriters+association+logo" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In order to help shine a light on this issue, I recently joined the Religion Newswriters Association. I hope that my membership in the organization will enable me to make contact with the more open-minded wing of the profession. I also hope that my work on this blog (and the other websites of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/p/norse-mythology-online.html"&gt;Norse Mythology Online&lt;/a&gt;) will inspire other writers to move beyond their comfort zones and begin to investigate the deep reservoir of &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; the world’s religious beliefs – past, present and future.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;CODA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I have been able to show that Norse mythology matters to a wide range of people around us and around the world. It continues to be a source of solace, a stirrer of inspiration, and a guide to the great mysteries – mysteries that moved the ancient northern peoples in as deep and complex a fashion as we are moved by them today. Personally, I find it somehow comforting to know that my German, Anglo-Saxon and Norse-Gael ancestors were struggling with the same Big Issues as I am today, and that their insights are still meaningful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A FINAL BIG THANK YOU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;div style="margin: 0px;"&gt;. . . to everyone who blogged, emailed, posted, reposted, tweeted and retweeted in support of The Norse Mythology Blog, working hard to bring out the vote.

That was a pretty big deal in itself, but this year was the topper; I won the award by beating Christian Blog, Freethought Blogs and Religion Dispatches. What does it mean that a one-man blog about &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-one.html"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; won an international popular vote over these large multi-author sites?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I began writing this blog less than two years ago, at the end of March 2010. Since then, I have met and corresponded with an amazingly wide array of people who are passionate about Norse myth. It is this incredibly diverse international group that is responsible for the victory that this blog has achieved in the Bloggies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgPXS25c5HE/T0qSe0AwdXI/AAAAAAAAAvE/dPxjlvRH04E/s1600/Bohuslan+rock+carving+1800+BCE+maybe+thor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QgPXS25c5HE/T0qSe0AwdXI/AAAAAAAAAvE/dPxjlvRH04E/s1600/Bohuslan+rock+carving+1800+BCE+maybe+thor.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Bohuslän rock carving (c1800 BCE)&lt;br /&gt;A "reverse echo" of Thor or Frey?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The roots of what we now call Norse mythology can arguably be dated back to approximately &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/11/high-school-student-asks-about-norse.html"&gt;4,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; – an antiquity comparable to that of Judaism. These ancient “reverse echoes” of the mythological corpus that was preserved and codified by 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Icelanders may come from a time that is so distant as to be largely unknowable, but the meme that began so long ago continues to affect the thoughts and lives of a great many living in today’s world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nearly 900 years after the last northern nation &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/06/clash-with-christianity-part-one.html"&gt;converted to Christianity&lt;/a&gt; and officially abandoned the ancient faith that gave birth to this body of myths, why does Norse mythology continue to have such an outsized impact on so many people? Why does Norse mythology still matter? There are as many answers as there are people in this diverse community of interest.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I would like to present a portrait of some of the wonderful people I have had the privilege of interacting with since The Norse Mythology Blog went live. By examining their connections to Norse myth, I believe that we can gain some small understanding of the meaning that this material has for modern life – and begin to see how it remains deeply relevant to public discourse in today’s world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;STUDENTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I have been lucky enough to teach Norse myth and &lt;a href="http://faculty.carthage.edu/kseigfried/"&gt;Norse religion&lt;/a&gt; to students from many stages of life, including high school, college and adult. There is definitely a hunger to learn more about Norse mythology. The questions students ask are telling, and they reflect a gap in American education that cries out to be filled. Why is this material not taught in literature classes? Why do courses on the heritage of European culture include Greek myths but not Norse? Why do history classes ignore the cultural artifacts of pre-Christian Europe? Over fifty years after &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/12/report-from-international-vinland_23.html"&gt;archaeology proved that Vikings visited North America&lt;/a&gt;, why are American schoolchildren still taught that Christopher Columbus was the first European to arrive?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_uYQNOjy8is/T0qUxNOJSSI/AAAAAAAAAvM/dUWM3EMeYQM/s1600/viking+at+school+jeremy+strong.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="157" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_uYQNOjy8is/T0qUxNOJSSI/AAAAAAAAAvM/dUWM3EMeYQM/s200/viking+at+school+jeremy+strong.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;There's clearly a need for more&lt;br /&gt;Vikings in the classroom.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The reasons that students contact me or enroll in my classes are very wide-ranging. The initial interest can stem from a love of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/07/interview-with-johan-hegg-of-amon.html"&gt;Scandinavian metal bands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/a&gt;, gaming or the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. For some, the impetus comes from a familial connection to Germany, Scandinavia or Britain – lands where the ancient religions that gave birth to this mythology once held sway. Some have already studied the material on their own; others arrive with few preconceptions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;One of the great joys of teaching this subject is to watch light bulbs appear over the students’ heads as they suddenly realize where Tolkien got a scene from, &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/11/report-from-international-vinland.html"&gt;how the parliamentary system relates to Old Norse society&lt;/a&gt;, how some folklore superstition of their immigrant grandmother has distant roots in the Old Way, or how something they read in &lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt; or saw in a Wagner opera now actually makes sense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;SCHOLARS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;In-person and via email, I have discussed various aspects of Norse myth with several brilliant scholars, some who work independently and some who are attached to academic institutions. Their areas of expertise range from fine points of Germanic philology to gender issues in the Icelandic sagas to explications of obtuse poetic imagery to interpretations of ancient runic inscriptions.

I think that what they’re doing is something quite special, and I hope that those in academia will realize the beauty of non-academics, in effect, giving themselves reading assignments and writing research papers.

The first interview I did for this site was with &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/07/interview-with-johan-hegg-of-amon.html"&gt;Johan Hegg&lt;/a&gt;, the vocalist for Swedish Viking metal band Amon Amarth. The interview has received more visits to the website than anything else I’ve posted – with the exception of my article on &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/09/stephen-hawking-myths-and-critics.html"&gt;Stephen Hawking&lt;/a&gt; and the interview where &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/11/high-school-student-asks-about-norse.html"&gt;a very intelligent high school student plied me with astute questions&lt;/a&gt; about Norse mythology and religion. In 2011, Amon Amarth’s &lt;i&gt;Surtur Rising&lt;/i&gt; was, for a time, the &lt;a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts-year-end/top-hard-rock-album-artists?year=2011#/charts/hard-rock-albums?chartDate=2011-04-16"&gt;#1 hard rock album in America&lt;/a&gt; – charting ahead of major mainstream acts including Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters and Linkin Park. That’s pretty impressive for a band with lyrics that deal almost exclusively with myths of Ragnarök.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Hawkwind saxophonist and vocalist Nik Turner plays a very different kind of music, but he turns out to have just as deep an interest in Norse myth. He famously played the role of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt; in an incredibly strange performance with Canadian vocalist and bodybuilder Jon Mikl Thor – “the Rock Warrior.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LfJbMDrqGgU" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nik and I recorded a much more subdued collaboration in our jazz duet inspired by the Lincolnshire Charm, which references the Norse gods: “With this mell [hammer] I thrice do knock: one for God, one for Wod and one for Lok.” To create a video for the track, I used clips from Fritz Lang’s &lt;i&gt;Siegfried&lt;/i&gt; (1924), the first part of the Austrian director’s silent film epic, &lt;i&gt;Die Nibelungen&lt;/i&gt; – creating a virtual dialogue across the decades between artists who were inspired by these ancient materials.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SSExawO9frs" width="420"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Outside of music, I have corresponded with comic book artists whose work continues the tradition of (re)interpreting Norse myth that goes back at least to the work of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;Stan Lee and Jack Kirby&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1960s.

Bestselling author Joanna Harris brilliantly recontextualizes the myths in a series that begins with&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Runemarks;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;my long-delayed interview with her will finally happen when I get my act together and finish reading and taking notes on the second book, &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;hopefully before the third book sees print!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;The point of all this is that these ancient stories continue to inspire new artistic creations a millennium after they were first written down.

Njörð is one of the Vanir, the tribe of Norse gods who are associated with fertility - as opposed to the more warlike Æsir. Njörð's home is Nóatún ("ship-enclosure"), but his street doesn't quite go down to Reykjavík's docks.

Egilsgata (Egill's Street) honors the protagonist of &lt;i&gt;Egil's Saga&lt;/i&gt;, Egill Skallagrímsson. A brilliant warrior-poet and master of runes, he had a conflicted relationship with Odin, who inspired his poetry.

Erik the Red has his own saga; it tells of the Norse settlement of Greenland and exploration of &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/12/report-from-international-vinland.html"&gt;Vínland&lt;/a&gt; in North America. It also features a detailed account of a ritual in which Þorbjörg Lítilvölva ("little seeress") predicts the future while sitting on a high-seat and wearing a blue cloak, a black lamb-skin hood and white cat-skin gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Aq3FGWS_p_Y/Txw-kcgS-zI/AAAAAAAAAsw/U-YSDf-S7ds/s1600/Leifsgata+Leif%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Aq3FGWS_p_Y/Txw-kcgS-zI/AAAAAAAAAsw/U-YSDf-S7ds/s320/Leifsgata+Leif%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Leifsgata (Leif's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Between Erik's Street and Egill's Street is Leifsgata (Leif's Street), named for Leif Erikson (son of Erik the Red).

Thor appears in several versions in the poems, myths, sagas and folklore of Denmark, Germany, Iceland and other northern lands. In some ways, he can be seen as the idealized self-image of the rugged, honest and hardworking common man of ancient times, always ready to stand against evil and tyranny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wHI8TXtH4JE/TwoHr146GAI/AAAAAAAAAq4/E1c4BY2dHGE/s1600/Mjo%25CC%2588lnisholt+Mjo%25CC%2588lnir%2527s+Hill+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wHI8TXtH4JE/TwoHr146GAI/AAAAAAAAAq4/E1c4BY2dHGE/s320/Mjo%25CC%2588lnisholt+Mjo%25CC%2588lnir%2527s+Hill+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Mjölnisholt (Mjölnir's Hill)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;A little over a kilometer from the Neighborhood of the Gods, you can find the street called Mjölnisholt (Mjölnir's Hill), named for the dwarf-forged mystic hammer of Thor. According to Snorri, the hammer would never fail, however hard Thor hit; it would never miss its target; it would return to Thor's hand after being thrown; and it could be shrunk down and carried in the thunder god's shirt.

The name &lt;i&gt;Týr&lt;/i&gt; literally means "god," and has cognates in several other languages (Deus, Deva, Zeus, etc.). Týr may once have been a major Germanic god, but his role had been greatly reduced by the time that the myths were codified at the end of the Viking Age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OUSpTOTWEWg/TwXaXow26VI/AAAAAAAAAp4/DCssEdmYcII/s1600/Freyjugata+Freya%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OUSpTOTWEWg/TwXaXow26VI/AAAAAAAAAp4/DCssEdmYcII/s320/Freyjugata+Freya%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Freyjugata (Freya's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Freyjugata (&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-one.html"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;'s Street) was named in 1920 for the most complex and fascinating goddess of the Norse pantheon. Freya is associated with death, fertility, gold, love, magic and much more. Of all the goddesses, she plays the most active role in the surviving poetry and prose that documents Norse mythology and religion. Her character is arguably as complex as that of Odin, patriarch of the Norse gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bKyq37F7MsA/TwoH61j089I/AAAAAAAAArA/bC0k4z0NLAY/s1600/Ur%25C3%25B0arsti%25CC%2581gur+Ur%25C3%25B0%2527s+Lane+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bKyq37F7MsA/TwoH61j089I/AAAAAAAAArA/bC0k4z0NLAY/s320/Ur%25C3%25B0arsti%25CC%2581gur+Ur%25C3%25B0%2527s+Lane+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Urðarstígur (Urð's Lane)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Dedicated in 1919, Urðarstígur (Urð's Lane) is another street named for a powerful female figure from Norse myth. Urð&amp;nbsp;is one of the three norns who determine the fate of both human beings and gods. Along with Verðandi and Skuld, she sits at Urðarbrunn ("Well of Urð") beneath the roots of Yggdrasil (the World Tree of Norse cosmology), weaving the web of each individual's doom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7rprl0HlCVg/TwcTNlImKgI/AAAAAAAAAqw/P8xBLtC8W5A/s1600/Sjafnargata+Sjo%25CC%2588fn%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7rprl0HlCVg/TwcTNlImKgI/AAAAAAAAAqw/P8xBLtC8W5A/s320/Sjafnargata+Sjo%25CC%2588fn%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Sjafnargata (Sjöfn's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Ten years after&amp;nbsp;Urð was given her street, Sjafnargata (Sjöfn's Street) was named for a minor goddess from Norse mythology. According to Snorri Sturluson, Sjöfn "endeavors to turn the minds of people to love, both those of women and men, and from her name a lover is called &lt;i&gt;sjafni&lt;/i&gt;." That's really all we know of her; she is simply one of several sketchily-characterized ásynjur (Norse goddesses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-URMlP9Ef4AQ/TwXqFqfMskI/AAAAAAAAAqo/3AUTOVsSLvI/s1600/Bragagata+Bragi%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-URMlP9Ef4AQ/TwXqFqfMskI/AAAAAAAAAqo/3AUTOVsSLvI/s320/Bragagata+Bragi%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Bragagata (Bragi's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Bragagata (Bragi's Street) was named in 1919. Snorri writes that the god Bragi "is renowned for wisdom, and most of all for fluency of speech and skill with words. He knows most of skaldship [the art of poetry], and after him skaldship is called &lt;i&gt;bragr&lt;/i&gt;, and from his name that one is called bragr-man or -woman, who possesses eloquence surpassing others." While Bragi is the poet of the gods, Odin is the god who brings inspiration to human poets.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/397195601073649649/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=397195601073649649&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/397195601073649649'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/397195601073649649'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2012/01/neighborhood-of-gods-part-two.html' title='NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE GODS, Part Two'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

In 1906,&amp;nbsp;Óðinsgata (Odin's Street) was the first street in this part of the city to be named for one of the Norse gods. Many others followed, creating what became known as the Heathen Neighborhood; Sjafnargata (Sjöfn's Street) completed the set in 1929. In the mid-1920s, the district was known for poorly-built houses and the poverty of its inhabitants, leading some to refer to it as the Blasphemy&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;–&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;meaning that the deteriorated condition of the neighborhood was an affront to the gods whose names it bore. With the usual tides of population change that sweep through urban areas, the neighborhood is now considered a fashionable place to live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This map shows the Neighborhood of the Gods, from&amp;nbsp;Týsgata (Týr's Street)&amp;nbsp;at the top to Mímisvegur (Mimir's Way) at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="450" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;source=s_q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;geocode=&amp;amp;q=reykjavik&amp;amp;aq=&amp;amp;sll=64.139709,-21.914601&amp;amp;sspn=0.021826,0.091066&amp;amp;vpsrc=6&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hq=&amp;amp;hnear=Reykjavik,+Iceland&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=64.142402,-21.930192&amp;amp;spn=0.004211,0.008583&amp;amp;z=16&amp;amp;output=embed" width="400"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wlcFLpKB6-4/TvoykOksWjI/AAAAAAAAAmI/zP8iEz_KUgE/s1600/O%25CC%2581%25C3%25B0insgata+Odin%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wlcFLpKB6-4/TvoykOksWjI/AAAAAAAAAmI/zP8iEz_KUgE/s320/O%25CC%2581%25C3%25B0insgata+Odin%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Óðinsgata (Odin's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The first street in the Neighborhood of the Gods is named for &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-one.html"&gt;Odin&lt;/a&gt;, the Allfather of the Norse pantheon. Like so many figures in Norse mythology, Odin is a complex and enigmatic figure. He is the god who stirs anger in human hearts and delights in war, but he is also the god who inspires creativity in men's minds and (according to &lt;i&gt;Ynglinga Saga&lt;/i&gt;) speaks everything in rhyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iq0BU8F2kGg/Tvo3w5D5b3I/AAAAAAAAAmU/3db7cQWac4o/s1600/Baldursgata+Balder%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Iq0BU8F2kGg/Tvo3w5D5b3I/AAAAAAAAAmU/3db7cQWac4o/s320/Baldursgata+Balder%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Baldursgata (Balder's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In 1912, six years after Óðinsgata was dedicated, Baldursgata (Balder's Street) became the second street in the district named for one of the Norse gods. Balder, the bright and beautiful, is better known for his death and afterlife than for any actions he accomplished while alive. Troubled by dreams, magically protected, killed by mistletoe and trapped in Hel's domain, Balder will return after Ragnarök.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qmsUFIbzZ6o/TvtsgjHSaDI/AAAAAAAAAmg/jhghDKnXiF0/s1600/No%25CC%2588nnugata+Nanna%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qmsUFIbzZ6o/TvtsgjHSaDI/AAAAAAAAAmg/jhghDKnXiF0/s320/No%25CC%2588nnugata+Nanna%2527s+Street+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Nönnugata (Nanna's Street)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;According to Snorri Sturluson, Nanna was the wife of Balder. She died of a broken heart at his funeral and was placed on the burning pyre alongside her husband. Nönnugata (Nanna's Street) was named for her in 1919.

The love shared between the god and goddess was stronger than death, and the two of them journeyed together to the dark realms of Hel, the sinister ruler of the afterlife. Today, Balder and Nanna remain connected in the streets of Reykjavík's Neighborhood of the Gods.

Höðr's hand was guided by the scheming &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/gods-goddesses-part-five.html"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, who was jealous of the attention the gods were paying to the seemingly invulnerable Balder.

According to the &lt;i&gt;Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Váli kills&amp;nbsp;Höðr "when one night old."&amp;nbsp;Válastígur lies directly behind Baldursgata, suggesting&amp;nbsp;Váli's&amp;nbsp;role as Balder's avenger - or perhaps referring to the Eddic assertion that&amp;nbsp;Váli and Balder will both survive&amp;nbsp;Ragnarök to rule over a new era of peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_86_fqvbuw0/Tvt7Ors3gCI/AAAAAAAAAn0/qfUA3vkHTjU/s1600/Lokasti%25CC%2581gur+Loki%2527s+Lane+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_86_fqvbuw0/Tvt7Ors3gCI/AAAAAAAAAn0/qfUA3vkHTjU/s320/Lokasti%25CC%2581gur+Loki%2527s+Lane+Reykjavi%25CC%2581k+Iceland+.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Lokastígur (Loki's Lane)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Completing the cast of Balder's drama is Loki, "originator of deceits and the disgrace of all gods and men." In 1920, Reykjavík's mayor supposedly named Lokastígur (Loki's Lane) to get even with a greedy landowner who sought to increase profits by dividing his property. The lane hides behind Þórsgata (&lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/04/mighty-thor-part-one.html"&gt;Thor&lt;/a&gt;'s Street), as Loki hides behind (or from) the god of thunder in the myths. Note the graffiti monster lurking around the corner as shadows descend on Loki's Lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/5315053382874649649/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=5315053382874649649&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/5315053382874649649'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/5315053382874649649'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/12/neighborhood-of-gods-part-one.html' title='NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE GODS, Part One'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.

Mr. Lodle has asked his students "to think beyond the traditional research sources" and include an interview as part of a research assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woodrow asked me to be his interview subject and sent me a list of wonderfully insightful questions about Norse mythology and Norse religion. He asked about religious history, the meanings of the myths and the role that the mythology plays in today's world. Since he posed such interesting questions, I felt a responsibility to put some time into writing serious answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There must be other young people who are thinking about these same issues, so I'm posting the interview here for their benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;WG – How would you describe the characteristics of Norse gods as a whole? Are they generally reliant on brute strength or cunning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lNs1CegCMow/TrGCktDYzSI/AAAAAAAAAfo/vaRsNZFa7iU/s1600/Sun+Shines+in+the+Hall+Thor+Thrud+Alviss+W.+G.+Collingwood.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="259" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lNs1CegCMow/TrGCktDYzSI/AAAAAAAAAfo/vaRsNZFa7iU/s320/Sun+Shines+in+the+Hall+Thor+Thrud+Alviss+W.+G.+Collingwood.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Thor, his daughter &amp;amp; the dwarf he outwitted, now turned to stone&lt;br /&gt;(1908 illustration by W. G. Collingwood)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – One of the things that makes Norse myth so fascinating is that the gods are as diverse and individual as the people you meet in your own life. Odin is wise, Loki is tricky, Thor is macho, Frigg is loving, Balder is kind, Frey is peaceful, Skadi is tough, and so on. What makes the gods even more interestingly human-like is that each one has a complex character that really can’t be summed up in a single phrase. Odin may have vast amounts of knowledge, but he can’t figure out a way for the world to survive the final battle at the end of time. Thor may be a simple tough guy, but he also manages to outwit a clever dwarf whose name is literally “All-Wise.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more you read Norse myth, the more you will find that the gods reflect people you know. Maybe you have a friend who – although you’re buddies and have fun together – sometimes drags you into trouble, even if it you had nothing to do with it. That’s Loki. Maybe you have a teacher who has dedicated himself to learning everything he can and sharing it with you. That’s Odin. It’s amazing to realize that people over a thousand years ago were thinking about the same issues we think about today.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Why did the Norsemen have mortal gods? They were able to be killed (like Balder), and most of them die at the final battle of Ragnarök (“Doom of the Powers”).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – This is a very difficult question. Why do Christians have a god who is all-powerful and all-knowing? Why do Hindus have a complicated pantheon of gods? We can’t know for certain why the religions of the world developed in the ways that they did. We can only look at what records we have and theorize about the evolution of religious ideas in different cultures. Over many centuries of religious scholarship, learned people have come up with a variety of explanations. Maybe the gods were human leaders who were elevated to godhood after their deaths. Maybe the gods are natural forces that evolved into characters (Thor = thunder and so on). Maybe the religion of a people is a reflection of their psychology or so-called “collective unconscious.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to really get into the study of religious history, you will find that the past can be just as magical and mysterious as the future. In the grand scheme of human existence, a thousand years is no time at all, but there's no way you and I will live that long. Since we won't experience it, the far future is merely science fiction to us. The distant past can be like that, too. When you begin to study history in a serious way, you realize how little we actually know about life a thousand years ago. The farther back you go, the more fragmentary the records are, and the more guesswork we have to do to fill in the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41oPQDyPG8s/TrGCxjvO5UI/AAAAAAAAAfw/FO71TZe9XFk/s1600/German+flag+over+Reichstag+Berlin+Germany.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41oPQDyPG8s/TrGCxjvO5UI/AAAAAAAAAfw/FO71TZe9XFk/s320/German+flag+over+Reichstag+Berlin+Germany.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The German flag flying over the parliament building in Berlin&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;You could say that the Norse outlook is a little gloomy – everything dies, even the gods. However, that isn’t quite true, is it? Balder, the god of light and peace, comes back to life after the final battle and rules over a new world of joy and happiness. Maybe this is actually a hopeful idea that the “undiscovered country” of the future holds better things. The three-colored flag of Germany reflects this concept: black stands for the dark past, red for the bloody present, and yellow for the golden future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read the myths as life-affirming, as well. In one of the poems, Odin says:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Merry and mirthful each man should be,&lt;br /&gt;until the time of his death.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;He also says:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Better blind than to be burnt:&lt;br /&gt;no one has use for a corpse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;I would interpret both of these to mean, basically, &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;carpe diem&lt;/i&gt;. Seize the day, live life to the fullest. This life is all that we have, but it is beautiful. Enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – In what form has the mythology survived to today? Are the stories still told in Scandinavia?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – The stories are still told around the world. We’ll talk in a minute about how the myths have survived as living religion, but the stories themselves are continually told and re-told. Walk into any comic book store and you’ll see &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/09/blond-thor-stan-lee-wasnt-wrong.html"&gt;&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Thor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the shelf. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, two Jewish-American artists, created the Marvel Comics character based on the Norse god way back in 1963, and he’s been a fixture in popular culture ever since – including in the recent blockbuster &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/04/almost-interview-with-kenneth-branagh.html"&gt;&lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"&gt;Thor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VTbWSoJBKhg/TrGDBVLNLbI/AAAAAAAAAf4/a1IYBroo9Nk/s1600/Children+of+Odin+Padraic+Colum+Willy+Pogany+frontispiece.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VTbWSoJBKhg/TrGDBVLNLbI/AAAAAAAAAf4/a1IYBroo9Nk/s320/Children+of+Odin+Padraic+Colum+Willy+Pogany+frontispiece.gif" width="256" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Frontispiece to &lt;i&gt;The Children of Odin&lt;/i&gt; by Padraic Colum&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Every few years, someone publishes a new re-telling of the myths, turning the complicated collection of prose and poetry into a coherent storyline that a modern reader can understand and enjoy. The first book on Norse myth that I read was &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MvXmQUbH9oIC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Children of Odin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderful version of the myths written in 1920 by the Irish poet Padraic Colum, with beautiful illustrations by the Hungarian artist Willy Pogany. There’s also a recent graphic novel by the American artist Erik Evensen called &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/05/interview-with-erik-evensen-gods-of.html"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods of Asgard&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that brings all the myths together into a coherent storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novelists continue to use Norse mythology as a source of material for original works. J. R. R. Tolkien based much of &lt;i&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; on Norse myth, of course. My favorite recent releases are by the English author Joanne Harris. She has two brilliant books out called &lt;i&gt;Runemarks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Runelight&lt;/i&gt;. They tell the story of a young girl named Maddy who lives after Ragnarök and gets mixed up with all the Norse gods who have somehow survived (it’s complicated). The books are in the same Young Adult genre as the Harry Potter novels, but are full of Ms. Harris’s original take on the Norse myths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see that the myths speak to people all over the world. There is something in them that appeals to writers in Britain, artists in Hungary, and high school students in Illinois. It’s up to you to meditate on what makes them so endlessly fascinating.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Does Norse mythology have any influence on today’s society, like Greek mythology apparently does (i.e., Nike shoes, Midas Touch car shop, etc.)?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – Just look at your cell phone. The Bluetooth symbol is a bind-rune, which means that it is formed from two runes that are merged together. Runes are the ancient Norse letters that, according to mythology, Odin discovered and gave to gods and humans. Runes actually exist and were used for over a thousand years. They were letters (used to spell things) and symbols (each symbol stood for a specific word or concept). Harald Bluetooth (circa 935-985) united Denmark under his rule; the Bluetooth technology unites different devices under its “rule.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take the rune for “H” –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E4ypwa9-yEQ/TrGec-HiC1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/RKLYrl8GNaA/s1600/hagalaz+rune.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E4ypwa9-yEQ/TrGec-HiC1I/AAAAAAAAAgY/RKLYrl8GNaA/s1600/hagalaz+rune.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;and combine it with the rune for “B” –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ji_nirVOauw/TrGeoZ596zI/AAAAAAAAAgw/yxXIqTUi5SA/s1600/berkanan+rune.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ji_nirVOauw/TrGeoZ596zI/AAAAAAAAAgw/yxXIqTUi5SA/s1600/berkanan+rune.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1034033001"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1034033002"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you get the Bluetooth logo –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aYmVSROKIMY/TrGe4THOSWI/AAAAAAAAAg4/OE_nX7XkcSA/s1600/Bluetooth+Logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aYmVSROKIMY/TrGe4THOSWI/AAAAAAAAAg4/OE_nX7XkcSA/s200/Bluetooth+Logo.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Also, next time you use the restroom in a public place, look at the paper towel dispenser. Chances are, it will have this symbol on it –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sDalTj-JsR8/TrGfRf26KRI/AAAAAAAAAhA/7uBxB05dDhA/s1600/Svenska+Cellulosa+Aktiebolaget.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sDalTj-JsR8/TrGfRf26KRI/AAAAAAAAAhA/7uBxB05dDhA/s1600/Svenska+Cellulosa+Aktiebolaget.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which is the logo of Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, a Swedish paper-goods company. It’s based on a symbol that is associated with Odin in ancient carvings like this one –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bAAh_X-Cuwc/TrGf-Dc2FbI/AAAAAAAAAhI/t9RJpe4iwDs/s1600/Valknut+Odin+Hammars+Stone+Sweden.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="114" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bAAh_X-Cuwc/TrGf-Dc2FbI/AAAAAAAAAhI/t9RJpe4iwDs/s320/Valknut+Odin+Hammars+Stone+Sweden.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Detail of the Hammars Stone in Sweden (8th century)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;So, think of Odin the next time you make a phone call or dry your hands!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – What are some underlying themes throughout Norse mythology? Maybe humanity being flawed, or that we are insignificant compared to the workings of gods and giants, or that maybe we are the next big thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – You can find all the themes you suggest in the Norse myths – and many others. Myths and poetry are open to interpretation. This is, in large part, why they do continue to appeal to people around the world, after all these years. You may find one message in a particular story, and I may find the complete opposite. The Norse myths do not give commandments or moral instructions; it is up to you to decide what they mean. In one poem, Odin says of the runes –&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;Do you know how to cut? Do you know how to read?&lt;br /&gt;Do you know how to stain? Do you know how to test?&lt;br /&gt;Do you know how to invoke? Do you know how to sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;Do you know how to dispatch? Do you know how to slaughter?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7pzf309-Mio/TrGhy-KSQgI/AAAAAAAAAhw/DIycbYER7w4/s1600/Elder+Futhark+runic+inscription+Kylver+Stone+Gotland+Sweden.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="182" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7pzf309-Mio/TrGhy-KSQgI/AAAAAAAAAhw/DIycbYER7w4/s320/Elder+Futhark+runic+inscription+Kylver+Stone+Gotland+Sweden.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Runic inscription on Kylver Stone in Gotland, Sweden (c400 CE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;To understand this, you should know that runes were cut into wood or stone, and that they were stained with some sort of material (paint or blood, most likely) so that they were easier to read (or to magically “activate” them). That being said, I would interpret this verse as Odin inviting you to make your own reading of the stories and poems. He doesn’t &lt;i&gt;tell&lt;/i&gt; you an interpretation; he asks to you to&lt;i&gt; learn how&lt;/i&gt; to interpret. This is much less comfortable than having a god who instructs you very clearly on what is right and wrong, how you should behave, and what life really means. It is more difficult to struggle with these complicated ideas and make your own decisions, but it can lead to deeper understanding and be more meaningful for your own experience of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Where and for how long was Norse mythology held as a main religion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – I would make a distinction between mythology and religion. Mythology is a set of stories and poems that is connected to a religion; religion is a set of spiritual beliefs and practices in real life. That being said, you can argue that some form of Norse religion has existed for approximately 4,000 years. This is definitely open to debate, so let me explain what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I would define “Norse religion” as a set of beliefs that was common to the ancient northern world – what is now Germany, Scandinavia and Britain. These beliefs were greatly varied, complicated and contradictory over a very large geographic and temporal space. What we call “Norse mythology” comes mostly from two books that were written down in Iceland in the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. This is where we get the stories and poems from – the tales of Thor, Odin, giants, dwarves, etc. I would argue that this is a very late form of the religion, as it was actually written down two hundred years after Iceland’s official national conversion to Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are rock carvings in Sweden from around 1800 BCE that show “reverse echoes” of Norse myth. We can’t say that they portray Thor or Odin, but we can argue that they show an early form of a religion that eventually evolved into the one that we’re familiar with. For instance, does this carving show an early version of Thor in his goat-drawn chariot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dG8jDCiF8vo/TrGgo1dcneI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/_fRzjZ7TtaE/s1600/Bohusl%25C3%25A4n+rock+carving+maybe+Thor.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dG8jDCiF8vo/TrGgo1dcneI/AAAAAAAAAhQ/_fRzjZ7TtaE/s1600/Bohusl%25C3%25A4n+rock+carving+maybe+Thor.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Bohuslän rock carving (c1800 BCE) &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;This Swedish carving from around 1300 BCE shows axe heads and wheels. Are the axes “thunder-weapons,” and therefore prototypes of Thor’s mystic hammer? Are the wheels the same “sun-wheels” that continually reappear century after century in Scandinavian religious art?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nE9X42QfuLk/TrGg4KARaRI/AAAAAAAAAhY/vgw0GDAv21Y/s1600/Scania+rock+carving+axes+sun+wheels.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nE9X42QfuLk/TrGg4KARaRI/AAAAAAAAAhY/vgw0GDAv21Y/s320/Scania+rock+carving+axes+sun+wheels.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Scania rock carving (c1300 BCE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;This small Danish chariot from around 500 BCE seems to portray the horse-drawn chariot of the sun that is described in 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century mythology, and its wheels look just like those in the Swedish carving above –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uyo4HHVHPWs/TrGhDAyxd4I/AAAAAAAAAhg/fnMKEbPFafA/s1600/Trundholm+sun+chariot+Denmark.jpg" imageanchor="1"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uyo4HHVHPWs/TrGhDAyxd4I/AAAAAAAAAhg/fnMKEbPFafA/s1600/Trundholm+sun+chariot+Denmark.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;This poor fellow was stabbed and hung, then thrown into a Danish bog around 300 BCE. Later mythology describes that those sacrificed to Odin were, strangely enough, both stabbed and hung. Was this man sacrificed to the leader of the Norse gods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y2DUSWZI5C0/TrGhQ6tMjPI/AAAAAAAAAho/JNcBmdBxv14/s1600/Tollund+Man+bog+sacrifice.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="214" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y2DUSWZI5C0/TrGhQ6tMjPI/AAAAAAAAAho/JNcBmdBxv14/s320/Tollund+Man+bog+sacrifice.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Tollund Man (c300 BCE)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;In 58 CE, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5UZAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=Caesar%27s+commentaries:+with+an+analytical+and+interlinear&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=Wi6DTuv4CsnIgQeDoIEg&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Julius Caesar&lt;/a&gt; described the religion of the Germans. In 98, the Roman writer &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qZFJAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Tacitus%20Brodribb&amp;amp;pg=PR6&amp;amp;#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Tacitus&lt;/a&gt; described it in much greater detail, portraying gods whom we understand as Odin, Thor and Tyr. So you can see that recognizable forms of the Norse gods had already developed by the Roman Age, centuries before the Viking versions that we are most familiar with today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cd4jvYvuZmI/TrGjlboWsnI/AAAAAAAAAiA/ks3fayBIM7w/s1600/Indo-European+Language+Map.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Cd4jvYvuZmI/TrGjlboWsnI/AAAAAAAAAiA/ks3fayBIM7w/s320/Indo-European+Language+Map.gif" width="302" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The brown areas of this map give you an idea of where&lt;br /&gt;the Germanic languages are spoken in northern Europe &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;The story of the &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/06/clash-with-christianity-part-one.html"&gt;conversion of northern Europe to Christianity&lt;/a&gt; is long and complicated. Conversion occurred at different times in different European cultures; in Iceland, for instance, we date the conversion to the year 1000. Some Scandinavians argue that the &lt;a href="http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/06/interview-with-hilmar-orn-hilmarsson-of.html"&gt;Norse religion &lt;span id="goog_1034033117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;continued in secret&lt;span id="goog_1034033118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the conversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is clear is that the stories of gods and heroes never completely disappeared, but were preserved in literature, oral tradition, folk tales, popular song, art and superstition. They pop up in England, Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia and Germany – any place that was part of what we can call pan-Germanic culture. This doesn’t mean “German” (as in “from Germany”), but refers to the family of Germanic languages, of which English is a part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bc54O8bAb9I/TrGllUPC1rI/AAAAAAAAAiY/dbXkhS5UJ1U/s1600/%25C3%2581satr%25C3%25BAarf%25C3%25A9lagi%25C3%25B0+%25C3%2586sir+Faith+Fellowship+Iceland.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bc54O8bAb9I/TrGllUPC1rI/AAAAAAAAAiY/dbXkhS5UJ1U/s1600/%25C3%2581satr%25C3%25BAarf%25C3%25A9lagi%25C3%25B0+%25C3%2586sir+Faith+Fellowship+Iceland.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Yes, the old faith is a living religion in Iceland!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;In 1972, a group of poets and intellectuals formed a church in Iceland called the &lt;a href="http://asatru.is/"&gt;Ásatrúarfélagið&lt;/a&gt; (“Æsir Faith Fellowship” – the Æsir are the Norse gods) that brought the old faith into modern life. In 1973, it was officially recognized by the Icelandic government. Today, the members of the church form 0.6% of the Icelandic population. This might not seem like much, but it’s exactly the same percentage of Americans that are Muslims – so you are just as likely to meet a follower of Thor in Iceland as you are to meet a follower of Allah in the United States. Probably even more likely, because Iceland is so small! The members of the Icelandic group have been very involved in their country’s spiritual, social, cultural, ecological and political life – just like any other active church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all of this, you can argue that the Norse religion has had a (very complicated) existence of over 4,000 years. Interestingly, Judaism is usually dated to the traditional birth of Abraham in circa 1800 BCE. This is also the approximate date of the Swedish carvings I discussed earlier, so these faiths are just about the same age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Who exactly followed Norse religion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – It was followed, in one form or another, by people all over the northern world. We can find echoes of the old belief in place names from Britain, Scandinavia and Germany. There are historical and archaeological records from various locations over this vast area that show the geographical scope of the beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize that this wasn’t a continuous, coherent and clear religion. There were great variations over time, and each cultural group had their own particular version. However, we can see common elements that appear again and again in different times and places. Part of the fun of studying this subject is trying to make sense of such a large and complicated body of literary, historical and archaeological evidence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – What is, in your opinion, the most interesting aspect of Norse mythology?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KS – There are so many! It’s both terrifying and hilarious. It’s both spiritual and vulgar. It has all of life in it, really. I find it somehow comforting to know that my ancestors (I’m German, English and Scottish) were struggling with the same questions that I am – about relationships, life, death, learning, finding your place in the world and so on. I love that there is always something more to learn about and that there are always surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could spend your whole life studying just the BCE period, the Roman Age, the Viking Age or the Middle Ages. Some scholars only study the runes, and they have plenty to keep them busy. Some professors work with only the literary records from Iceland; others work solely with archaeological artifacts. You can focus on oral tradition, you can focus on artistic interpretations or you can focus on the written poetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0GCokLQaxio/TrGmNx4WAzI/AAAAAAAAAio/fUg-4UV1l8Q/s1600/Anglo-Saxon+Staffordshire+Gold+Hoard.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="214" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0GCokLQaxio/TrGmNx4WAzI/AAAAAAAAAio/fUg-4UV1l8Q/s320/Anglo-Saxon+Staffordshire+Gold+Hoard.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;From the English hoard (c675) - were these objects "sacrificed" to the gods?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;There are always new discoveries to keep things exciting. In the last few weeks alone, there were news items about a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/oct/19/viking-burial-ship-found-scotland?fb=optOut"&gt;Viking burial in Scotland&lt;/a&gt; and an ancient &lt;a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/11/gold-hoard/alexander-text"&gt;Anglo-Saxon “weapon sacrifice” in England&lt;/a&gt;. Every new thing that we learn sheds more light on the great mysteries of the past.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Why do you think it is that Norse mythology is so unknown? Some kids in my class don't know that it exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TAGX0vvoe30/TrGnvCjAyEI/AAAAAAAAAi4/Miaz5m-C124/s1600/Recreation+of+Norse+settlement+L%2527Anse+aux+Meadows.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TAGX0vvoe30/TrGnvCjAyEI/AAAAAAAAAi4/Miaz5m-C124/s320/Recreation+of+Norse+settlement+L%2527Anse+aux+Meadows.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Recreation of Norse settlement (c1000) at L'Anse aux Meadows&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – This is another complex question. It has to do with the educational system in America, with individual religious upbringing and with intellectual curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, we have ancient literary records that the Norse landed in North America nearly five hundred years before Columbus (who never actually set foot on North America itself). In the 1960s, physical proof of ancient Norse presence was unearthed in Canada. Do you study this in your American history class? If not, maybe you should ask your teacher why the decision was made to ignore these historical facts. I’d be very interested in the answer, myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s possible that some Americans with Norse heritage are embarrassed about this aspect of their own family history. If you are a devout Christian, do you want to admit that your ancestors were still making human sacrifices to the old gods 1,000 years after the birth of Christ? That’s a hard thing to deal with, both psychologically and spiritually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’re not an intellectually curious person, it’s very easy to live a modern life – full of Facebooking, Twittering and YouTubing – and never come across this subject. Actually, it’s very easy not to come across a lot of subjects! I would guess that the average student in your class also doesn’t know that William S. Burroughs, Charles Mingus or Caspar David Friedrich existed, either. These are the times we live in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – What does Norse mythology encompass? Obviously the gods, but does it also include stories like &lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_wMcirpgTV8/TrGpcM9NgII/AAAAAAAAAjI/jdWIbCXUirM/s1600/Prose+Edda+18th+century+manuscript+Snorri+Sturluson.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_wMcirpgTV8/TrGpcM9NgII/AAAAAAAAAjI/jdWIbCXUirM/s320/Prose+Edda+18th+century+manuscript+Snorri+Sturluson.jpg" width="236" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;An 18th-century manuscript of &lt;i&gt;The Prose &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edda&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;with pictures of the gods Odin &amp;amp; Heimdall&lt;br /&gt;and places, objects &amp;amp; animals from Norse myth&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – What we know of Norse mythology comes mainly from the two Icelandic books I mentioned earlier (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ls2F5i6_LeYC&amp;amp;dq=Edda&amp;amp;pg=PR3&amp;amp;#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Prose Edda&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SSDn575qxwoC&amp;amp;lpg=PR13&amp;amp;dq=The%20Poetic%20Edda&amp;amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Poetic Edda&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), plus another Icelandic book (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=svjUAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;dq=heimskringla&amp;amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Heimskringla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), plus a Danish book (&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kPEeAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Saxo%20Grammaticus&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;The History of the Danes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), plus a limited number of other poems and stories. These are, basically, the main primary sources on the subject. However, you’re completely right to ask about &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YAZEAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Beowulf&amp;amp;pg=PR1&amp;amp;#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beowulf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was written in a Christian era but contains many references to the older beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, there are records about the religion going back many centuries. However, I did make a distinction between mythology and religion, so you have to decide for yourself where to take your own research. Do you stick to reading the main stories? Do you start reading about the history of the various periods? Do you compare the German &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kyZLXbUIxS0C&amp;amp;dq=The+Nibelungenlied&amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;amp;#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (about Siegfried the Dragon Slayer) to the Icelandic &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1mQJAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Saga%20of%20the%20Volsungs&amp;amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;Saga of the Volsungs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (about Sigurd the Dragon Slayer)? Do you search the Icelandic sagas for more information about myth and ritual? Do you check out books about the runes? It’s all related, which makes it a lot of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WG – Is there anything else you would like to add, that you think everybody should know about Norse mythology but doesn't?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6hbiW8audKk/TrHWUhBm6PI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/xt5Y30YNLb4/s1600/Georg+von+Rosen+Oden+som+vandringsman+Odin+the+Wanderer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6hbiW8audKk/TrHWUhBm6PI/AAAAAAAAAjQ/xt5Y30YNLb4/s320/Georg+von+Rosen+Oden+som+vandringsman+Odin+the+Wanderer.jpg" width="218" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Odin the Wanderer by Georg von Rosen (1886)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;KS – I think that everybody should know about everything! I mean, the main reason that I like Odin is his endless quest for knowledge. He’s always disguising himself as an old wanderer and travelling through the world, trying to find out more about life and death. I’m an endlessly curious person, and I’m always hunting for new information. Each question I answer leads to more questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the Norse myths speak to you. If so, you should learn everything you can about them. Maybe you think they’re just a bunch of nonsense. That’s fine, too. I would encourage you to find something that &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; speak to you on a fundamental level. Maybe it's mathematics, maybe it's music, maybe it's mixed martial arts. Whatever it is, make it a part of your life and learn as much as you can about it. The quest for knowledge will make you a deeper person and a valuable contributor to the intellectual and cultural life of our society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for inviting me to participate in this interview. I hope that my answers help you a little bit on your own quest! &lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/feeds/6094631793594565824/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=2841348142033509263&amp;postID=6094631793594565824&amp;isPopup=true' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/6094631793594565824'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2841348142033509263/posts/default/6094631793594565824'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.norsemyth.org/2011/11/high-school-student-asks-about-norse.html' title='A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT ASKS ABOUT NORSE MYTHOLOGY AND NORSE RELIGION'/><author><name>Dr. Karl E.
