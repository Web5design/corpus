				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the reasons that I fell in love with Berlin so hard is that, when you wander, you can find views and surprises that will take your breath away. As we meandered around the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg area and the <a title="The East Side Gallery at the Berlin Wall" href="http://overyonderlust.com/berlin-wall-east-side-gallery/" target="_blank">East Side Gallery</a>, we found ourselves peeking at some really awesome scenery.</p>
<p>The first is Shaun&#8217;s favorite bridge in Berlin, Oberbaumbr√ºcke, that connected the two previously separated neighborhoods that found themselves in East and West Berlin, respectively. I found this little gem on wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 1999, the traditional rivalry between the traditionally left-leaning boroughs Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain is played out in the annual &#8220;water battle&#8221;, where residents from both areas, organized in groups with satirical names such as &#8220;<a title="Anarchism" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism">Anarcho</a>-<a title="Cynicism (contemporary)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_%28contemporary%29">Cynical</a> Offensive Berlin &#8211; Friedrichshain Faction&#8221; or &#8220;Kreuzberg <a title="Landwehr" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landwehr">Landwehr</a>&#8221; pelt each other with rotten vegetables, jello, eggs, flour and water and try to symbolically &#8220;reconquer&#8221; the &#8220;renegade&#8221; other borough (Friedrichshain being mockingly referred to as &#8220;East Kreuzberg&#8221; and Kreuzberg as &#8220;Lower Friedrichshain&#8221;) by driving their participants from the bridge. Due to their higher turnout and the superior &#8220;armament&#8221; (including home-built water cannons), the Friedrichshain detachments have won the water battle on a regular basis. -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberbaum_Bridge" target="_blank">Wiki</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Now we kinda want to see it in action. I guess we will have to be back!</p>
<p>The second picture was found across the Spree riverbank near the YAAM (close the the East Side Gallery). The lines, the texture, and the graffiti really caught my eye. I couldn&#8217;t help but capture it.</p>
<p>Berlin brought back my photography inspiration. I had felt so empty about trying to capture moments and places for quite a while. It was nice to feel like a kid at Disneyland all over again, aiming my lens all over, grabbing as many Berlin pictures I could.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/100_3777-800x800.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7699" alt="Winter in Arizona" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/100_3777-800x800.jpg" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We&#8217;re stepping it up around here at Over Yonderlust. Today we have a spectacular photo essay guest post by the amazing Amy Moore of Everything-Everywhere. Enjoy the eye candy!</em></p>
<p>While snowbirds flock to south Arizona each winter, winter in northern Arizona is considered to be the off-season. And for good reason! It can get very cold and snowy as you climb in elevation. Even the north rim of the Grand Canyon is closed because heavy snowfall makes the roads impassable. But we decided to pack warm coats and snow pants and hit the road anyway!</p>
<p>Beginning in the pleasantly cool Tucson and traveling up to the freezing cold Grand Canyon, what we found was beauty. The contrast of snow on red rock canyons is such a different vision than the desert I envisioned Arizona to be. The trip was not without challenge. We had to change plans on the fly, dodging a large snowstorm that threatened to drop over a foot of snow on very winding and narrow mountain roads. While I still long to see Arizona in the spring while the wildflowers are blooming, I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to make another winter trip to this amazing state.</p>

<p>I never knew I had such resilience about weather until we found ourselves eye-devouring the East Side Gallery at the Berlin Wall. The icy cold weather and snowfall couldn‚Äôt keep me away from the murals I had so desperately wanted to see for myself.</p>
<p>I, my friends, am an art lover&#8230; apparently. <img src='http://overyonderlust.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So a few things you must know when wanting to visit the East Side Gallery.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are multiple ‚ÄúWall‚Äù experiences. In our ‚Äú<a title="Berlin, I Love You" href="http://overyonderlust.com/berlin-i-love-you/" target="_blank">Berlin, I Love You</a>‚Äù post from our time there in October we visited one of the more sobering spots where they chronicled who died on that particular piece of land. If you‚Äôre looking for art, you head to the East Side Gallery.</li>
<li>There are two stops that you can take that will get you to different parts of the wall. Warschauer Strasse that has both the U1 and the S5/7 and the Ostbahnhof stop which you can hop on the S3/5/7 trains.</li>
<li>The walk is 1.3 kilometers.</li>
<li>There are over 100+ murals.</li>
<li>There is currently a big disagreement in Berlin over pieces of the East Side Gallery being moved in place of luxury apartments. <a title="Don‚Äôt Hassel the Hoff in Berlin" href="http://overyonderlust.com/dont-hassel-the-hoff-in-berlin/" target="_blank">David Hasselhoff even showed up to a protest</a> to show his support/give a PR boost to his career.</li>
</ol>
<p>The walk to the gallery in the snow really paid off. With few to no people around, we were able to grab pictures of the artwork with no problem. Here are a few of my favorites &#8211; make sure to head to The Wall to see them in all their glory.</p>

<p>‚ÄúDid you hear that The Hoff is confirmed to be at the East Side Gallery for the protest on Sunday?‚Äù</p>
<p>Wait&#8230; <em><strong>WHAT</strong></em>?!</p>
<p>It was music to my ears. I had heard time and time again that Germans had this weird fixation with David Hasselhoff and I was going to be able to experience it in full force? NO WAY.</p>
<p><a title="David Hasselhoff Germany-21 by Piratepenpen, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piratepenpen/8564873769/"><img alt="David Hasselhoff Germany" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8229/8564873769_cd731f6d05_z.jpg" width="300" height="450" /></a><a title="David Hasselhoff Germany-23 by Piratepenpen, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piratepenpen/8564868997/"><img alt="The Hoff in Berlin" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8375/8564868997_eb276ddf9e_z.jpg" width="300" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>But I didn‚Äôt go into it completely uninformed. There seems to be a split among young Germans on what they think about The Hoff. Looks of glee, disgust, embarrassment, and excitement took over the faces of my interviewees.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo, I don‚Äôt get it. To me David Hasselhoff is just Baywatch. How on EARTH did he become cool in Germany?‚Äù</p>
<p>And multiple times I got, ‚ÄúNot Baywatch! Freaking <em>KNIGHT RIDER</em>. He is AWESOME.‚Äù and on one occasion I had the reaction of very excited man that looked like he was a 15 year old girl going to a New Kids on the Block concert.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/IrishBerliner/status/313278874828042240"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7669" alt="The Hoff" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TheHoff3.jpg" width="604" height="379" /></a></p>
<p>So Knight Rider, eh?</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>
<p>But besides that, David Hasselhoff has put himself squarely in the middle of the history of the Berlin Wall (whether you agree with it or not). As he entered the pop charts in 1989 with <em>Looking for Freedom</em>, the song inadvertently became the mascot, or song of the falling of the Berlin Wall. He had solidified his place in Germany and continued to be successful for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/andberlinblog/status/313300569978703873"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7672" alt="The Hoff 6" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TheHoff6.jpg" width="490" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Enter current day Berlin:</strong></em><br />
With thousands of people moving into Berlin every year, it is going through the growing pains that I am waaaaaay too familiar with in Austin &#8211; namely gentrification. A big time real estate developer recently submitted plans to create a luxury condo complex&#8230;. directly on top of the East Side Gallery, home to some of the most beloved murals in Berlin.</p>
<p>With a difficult past, the Berlin community has come together to preserve the Berlin Wall &#8211; a monument to remind people of horrific acts of history &#8211; to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again and to preserve the art as is. The location is important. Sure you can move the pieces of the wall but isn‚Äôt there some sort of reverence to the area? Is money really worth building on top of an area where so many died?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/IrishBerliner/status/313272233218936832"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7670" alt="TheHoff4" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TheHoff4.jpg" width="601" height="356" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Enter The Hoff:</strong></em><br />
A normal protest against the gentrification and destruction of the wall brought in 2,000 people previously. Due to the presence of David Hasselhoff, it swelled to well over 10,000. And while a short Mexican girl like me did nearly get trampled by tall Germans in a paparazzi style rush for The Hoff, I don‚Äôt regret it. I just captured a little piece of the East Side Gallery‚Äôs history.</p>
<p><a title="David Hasselhoff Germany-30 by Piratepenpen, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piratepenpen/8564856257/"><img alt="The Hoff in Berlin" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8389/8564856257_320245595a_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And as The Hoff made his way to the yellow bus after the press conference, the most amazing, cliche thing happened. With a microphone in hand he sang,</p>
<p><em>One morning in June</em><br />
<em>some twenty years ago</em><br />
<em>I was born a rich man&#8217;s son</em><br />
<em>I had everything that money could buy,</em><br />
<em>but freedom I had none</em></p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve been looking for freedom</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ve been looking so long</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ve been looking for freedom</em><br />
<em>Still the search goes on</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ve been looking for freedom</em><br />
<em>since I left my home town</em><br />
<em>I&#8217;ve been looking for freedom</em><br />
<em>Still it can&#8217;t be found</em></p>
<p><a title="David Hasselhoff Germany-32 by Piratepenpen, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/piratepenpen/8564855435/"><img alt="David Hasselhoff Germany-32" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8564855435_94bcaf8174_z.jpg" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>With records &#8211; and in one case, a red Baywatch rescue buoy &#8211; held triumphantly in the air, the horde followed the bus down the street, joining in song, all smiles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo8-e1363348660482.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7657" alt="why move to berlin" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo8-1024x768.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The snow crunched under my feet and I giggled as I made my way around in circles all over the freshly fallen snow. The snowflakes hung delicately in the air as Shaun and I precariously balanced ourselves on the ice as we walked towards our friends house, bottle of wine in tow.</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe totally need to make this work.‚Äù I said.<br />
‚ÄúYeah we do.‚Äù Shaun replied.</p>
<p>And for the first time we agreed on where we can see ourselves living other than Austin. Berlin, you captured our hearts the first time. The second time, you locked them up and threw away the key.</p>
<p>&#8230;and these words escaped my lips more than my fair share of times&#8230;</p>
<p>‚Äú<a title="Berlin, I Love You" href="http://overyonderlust.com/berlin-i-love-you/" target="_blank">Berlin is cooler than Austin.</a>‚Äù</p>
<p>There it was. The kiss of death (in a good way).</p>
<p>Why move to Berlin? Here are a few reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1. We have friends here</strong>. Berlin is becoming a travel blogger mecca and the greatest part about that is that being travel bloggers ourselves, we understand that we leave all the time. It is nice to catch up when someone happens to be in town. It is nice to come to Berlin and know you have a community waiting for you.</p>
<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo10-e1363348615759.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7655" alt="why move to berlin" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo10-1024x768.jpg" width="642" height="481" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. We get to experience seasons</strong>. In the past year Shaun and I got to experience our first autumn and my first winter here. I had never seen snow fall in a city before (not counting the horrid blizzard we were in while in Iceland and feared for our lives while not leaving the safety of the car). Weather in Austin goes from insanely hot to&#8230; mild.</p>
<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382216_10151376828984387_2065453856_n.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7660" alt="why move to berlin" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/382216_10151376828984387_2065453856_n.jpg" width="612" height="612" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3. We fit in.</strong> Not to say we didn‚Äôt fit in at home but we also fit in here. Everyone has piercings, colored hair, and tattoos. AND we‚Äôre not followed around by anti-theft people in stores. It is nice. I even went into this awesome little punk rock club where the rollerderby girls were celebrating after the evening‚Äôs bout and they were blasting rockabilly. *swoon*</p>
<p><strong>4. Cheap beer.</strong> Yes, even cheaper than Austin. Need I say more?</p>
<p><strong>5. Art. Is. Everywhere.</strong> Whether it be the amazing street art, the great galleries, or the loads of live music and bars that are here, there is always something to see or do. I would have a whole new city to explore and that makes me SUPER excited.<br />
With the availability of the ‚Äúartist visa‚Äù and the cheap living that is here, it makes for a viable choice for us to continue our traveling lifestyle. We would love to keep a home base, travel, and have somewhere to come back to. With all of the New Yorkers and Californians moving to Austin and driving up our rent, it just isn‚Äôt within our realm of possibility anymore&#8230; but Berlin is.</p>

<p>I have never lived outside of Texas before. I‚Äôm a little scared and a little excited. Have you lived abroad before? What advice do you have?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_crocodile-sleeping.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7639" alt="animals in mexico" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_crocodile-sleeping.jpg" width="800" height="491" /></a></p>
<p>At Playa Linda, just north of the town of Ixtapa, Mexico, in the forest beside the dock, hidden away in the tangle of trees is the unexpected gem of a crocodile sanctuary. The area of Ixtapa was once home to many crocodiles. Before the government established the tourist town of Ixtapa, these ancient reptiles roamed the land in vast numbers. When people first started living there, trucks and vehicles were constantly running over them on the highways ‚Ä¶ some say the ghosts of all the highway fatalities still rise in the mist when a large rain covers the roads. Eventually a sanctuary was built to maintain the crocodile population in their natural habitat. Thousands now live there.</p>
<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_spoonbill-pair.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7648" alt="animals" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_spoonbill-pair.jpg" width="469" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>The upshot of an undisturbed lagoon-like habitat is the settlement of many bird species within the protected area, including the very exotic spoonbill. A large population of iguanas reside near the area just off the beach, where the proprietor of the nearby restaurant feeds them cabbage one or twice a day, providing great photo opportunities for the handful of tourists who might be around. I‚Äôve been there on several days in which I was the only visitor. There is no admission price. There is a wooden viewing platform just off the highway that runs out of Ixtapa, near a little hub of tourist trinket shops ‚Äì a place where taxi cabs often gather and the occasional tourist bus stops. You can follow the fence-line of the reserve from there down to the beach.</p>
<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_iguana.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7646" alt="animals in mexico" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_iguana.jpg" width="800" height="553" /></a></p>
<p>Occasionally you may see a crocodile catch an egret or a large fish in the water. I was amused by an intrepid black cat who was missing a foot, yet hobbling through the sanctuary a stone‚Äôs throw from the crocodiles, apparently unconcerned with the possibility of losing another foot.</p>
<p><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_black-kitty.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7637" alt="animals in mexico" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/OYL_black-kitty.jpg" width="639" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>What I found most entertaining is that occasionally a crocodile escapes the reserve and ambles down the beach. Sometimes, I‚Äôm told, they will go for a swim in the ocean. The locals are used to this, but it can scare the daylights and more out of a tourist who never expected to see a crocodile approach their sandcastle while sunbathing, nor slide through the salty sea beside them, sinister eyes just above the surface, while taking an afternoon dip in the serene waters of Playa Linda.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going snowboarding!!!&#8221; I kept yelling as I ran around the house, exciting the dogs who happily joined the celebration. &#8220;And you&#8217;re going to meet people and learn things&#8221; Erica replied in her sternest voice, clearly sad that she would not be joining me due to her re-occurring knee injury that had flared up and prior commitments at home. &#8220;Yeah, yeah, I&#8217;ll be social&#8221; I said, completely unaware of what awaited me at this tech conference.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no stranger to conventions having attended (and/or worked) everything from Blizzcon and Comic-Con to ITB, WTM, and TBEX, however, I&#8217;ve never been to any without my better half. There are pros and cons to being couple bloggers, and one of the biggest pros is the splitting of work. I soon learned how hard it is to do everything on my own.</p>
<p>This year was the 5th annual <a href="http://www.tahoesnowcial.com/" target="_blank">Snowcial</a>, a convention created by snowsport enthusiasts for snowsport enthusiasts that also mixes in a healthy (or unhealthy, depending on how far you take it) dose of fun at the California/Nevada border. Although, hitting the slopes is so important that it is actually part of the conference itinerary. And having it hosted in South Lake Tahoe means that you&#8217;ll be blown away by views like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_7606" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/South-Lake-Tahoe.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7606" alt="tech conference" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/South-Lake-Tahoe.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just take this in for a while.</p></div>
<p>And this:</p>
<div id="attachment_7610" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chairway-to-Heavenly.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7610" alt="tech conference" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chairway-to-Heavenly.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Chairway to Heavenly.</p></div>
<p>But snowsports aside, this is a business-related convention designed to teach you a thing or two about social media, technology, and innovation. Though, that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be boring, nor does it mean you have to wear a monkey suit. In fact, you&#8217;re encouraged to wear your mountain gear all day long- and even wearing a gorilla suit would be acceptable too!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7604" alt="tech conference" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Expectation-Reality.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>On the business side there was quite an impressive speaker lineup this year and they did not disappoint. We heard from such industry leaders as¬†Dean Eckles, from the Facebook Data Science Team, who showed us that statistics are sexy; Paul Crandell, the VP of Marketing for GoPro (and Red Bull before that); and Stanley Hainsworth, the Chairman and COO of Tether (who also worked for Starbucks, Lego, and Nike), who had the only haircut that drew more attention than mine (somewhere between Keith Flint from Prodigy and Bozo the Clown).</p>
<div id="attachment_7611" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Speakers.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7611" alt="Dean Eckles blowin' minds." src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Speakers.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dean Eckles blowin&#8217; minds.</p></div>
<p>As the convention went on, it became more and more evident how different Snowcial is from other conventions. But it was during the &#8220;Lightning Round&#8221; that I could really put my finger on what makes it special.</p>
<p>The Lightning Round was another set of talks, only they were on any subject that the speakers were passionate about. Though, to make it even more interesting, they had no control of the slideshow they created. With such topics as¬†&#8221;Raise kids like puppies&#8221; and &#8220;How to know when you&#8217;re too stoned to ski&#8221; and¬†the added encouragement of the audience to cheer/jeer the presenters, the hall war roaring with laughter. There were also a few¬†interesting &#8216;rules&#8217; in place that sprang up after previous years.¬†One such &#8216;rule&#8217; was called into play when a presenter knocked over her beer, resulting in a different kind of &#8216;shoeing&#8217;:</p>
<div id="attachment_7609" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 650px"><a href="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Das-Boot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7609" alt="Das boot." src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Das-Boot.jpg" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Das boot.</p></div>
<p>But there was a softer side to the craziness as well. A beloved Tahoe local, and Snowcial attendee in previous years, Chris Rudolph, who recently passed away in an avalanche was honored with friends telling stories or simply stating what they remember most about him. Once the brief eulogies were done, cases of his favorite beer &#8211; Pabst Blue Ribbon &#8211; were passed around for all to drink in his memory. Many people also dressed in their finest PBR gear- anything from hats and shirts to a giant PBR onesie.</p>
<p>The difference is the community. The people who attend Snowcial aren&#8217;t just a clique or group of colleagues, they&#8217;re a passionate collective of people driven by similar interests. Whether it be snowsports, technology, social media, or partying, you will find new friends and like-minds here.¬†And there&#8217;s always room for more in the fold.</p>
<p>-=-=&#8211;=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />

<p>I blinked incredulously as I realized the upcoming date&#8230;</p>
<p>‚ÄúHoly crap. We‚Äôre turning three!‚Äù</p>
<p>Somehow my blog had made it through the terrible twos and miraculously made it into our third year. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.</p>
<p>I bet there would be no way I would have believed you if you told me my future three years ago. We have come so far and now I can‚Äôt imagine my life without my blog, my lifestyle, my freedom. I‚Äôve become addicted.</p>
<p>Which is good news for you, readers (I HAVE READERS, HOW COOL IS THAT?!). What started as a personal blog to update friends and family has blown up into the glorious baby it is now. We have nurtured it and for the first time, I‚Äôm so proud of a project that I‚Äôm working on. This is something I can get behind and we have poured blood, sweat, and tears into it.</p>
<p>Our past year has been incredible.</p>
<p>Here are a few of our favorite highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>We broke <a href="http://facebook.com/overyonderlust">3000 fans on Facebook</a> and are still quickly growing.</li>
<li>It was paired with <a href="http://twitter.com/overyonderlust" target="_blank">6000 Twitter followers</a> as well.</li>
<li>My <a href="http://instagram.com/overyonderlust" target="_blank">Instagram</a> is about to go over 900 people (which blows my mind!).</li>
<li>We won the Hostelbookers award for Most Epic Travel Photography Blog.</li>
<li>Our <a title="Our Machu Picchu Llama has gone VIRAL!" href="http://overyonderlust.com/machu-picchu-llama-has-gone-viral/" target="_blank">Bossy the Llama picture</a> went VIRAL.</li>
<li>We were nominated for the 2013 Bloggies in Photography.</li>
<li>We got our first press trip!</li>
<li>We got to make it out to <a title="Takin‚Äô the Long Way ‚Äì Road Trippin‚Äô with SAD Cars" href="http://overyonderlust.com/sad-cars-takin-the-long-way-road-trippin/" target="_blank">Iceland</a>.</li>
<li>I <a title="The World‚Äôs Largest Snowcone: The Matanuska Glacier" href="http://overyonderlust.com/the-worlds-largest-snowcone-the-matanuska-glacier/" target="_blank">licked a glacier</a> in Alaska.</li>
<li>Our last blog birthday was spent with Leigh and Noah from <a href="http://cloudhead.org/" target="_blank">CloudHead Art</a>.</li>
<li>Shaun got to skateboard all over Europe.</li>
<li>We got to experience both our first <a title="Berlin, I Love You" href="http://overyonderlust.com/berlin-i-love-you/" target="_blank">AUTUMN</a> and our first SNOW in Berlin &#8211; all in two different trips!</li>
<li>Shaun got to put away a <a title="Living the Dream: Costa Brava by Hot Air Balloon" href="http://overyonderlust.com/hot-air-balloon-costa-brava/" target="_blank">hot air balloon</a>.</li>
<li>We made it to the <a title="Pretending to be a Gladiator in the Colosseum with Walks of Italy" href="http://overyonderlust.com/colosseum-walks-of-italy/" target="_blank">Colosseum in Rome</a>!</li>
<li>We got to see Shaun‚Äôs parents after many years in <a title="Dela-WHERE?" href="http://overyonderlust.com/delaware-dela-where/" target="_blank">Delaware</a>.</li>
<li>Shaun rocked it at Snowcial in Tahoe.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have grown so much and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without you guys. We have so much planned over the next few months.</p>
<p>This is what you have to look forward to over the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will have visited all continents except for Antarctica.</li>
<li>We are going to Australia for the Work/Holiday Visa!</li>
<li>We are finally visiting Canada for the first time. (Heckle away.)</li>
<li>We are heading back to Latin America.</li>
<li>We‚Äôre going to the regional Burning Man, Flipside.</li>

<h2><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7547" alt="TripRider" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/TripRider.png" width="634" height="315" /></h2>
<h2>Features:</h2>
<p>TripRider is an app designed to be a one-stop-shop for any trip you take. And with the features detailed below, it¬†accomplishes¬†that goal quite well. If you&#8217;re interested in purchasing the app, check it out on the App Store or on the <a title="TripRider iTunes Preview" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/triprider/id553823952?mt=8">TripRider iTunes preview</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7522" alt="Trip Plan" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Trip-Plan-200x300.png" width="200" height="300" />Trip Plan:</strong></span></p>
<p>This is the main daily breakdown of your trip. Here you add and keep track of the following, broken down by each day (there is also a very handy &#8220;copy previous day&#8221; option if you are staying put for multiple days):</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Accommodation info (Name, address, etc. This is especially handy when going through immigration or getting a taxi)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Event list (Choose the event type, add a description, and decide if the even is a &#8220;must see&#8221;)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Packing List:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Broken down by category (clothing, documents, medicine, gadgets, etc.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Includes a task list of things to be done before you leave (i.e. find someone to feed your cat)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Wallet:</strong></span></p>
<p>This feature keeps track of important numbers (passport, credit cards, tickets) and can be protected by an additional password.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7532" alt="Traveller" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Traveller1-200x300.png" width="200" height="300" />Travellers:</strong></span></p>
<p>This is one of my favorite features. I have a terrible memory and this lets the app keep track of all the awesome people I&#8217;ve met until my brain catches up. You can add their name, picture, number, and notes about who they are or where you met.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quick Notes:</strong></span></p>
<p>This feature allows you to jot down thoughts or information that you may need to reference later or may want to add into your journal.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Diary:</strong></span></p>
<p>Here you can elaborate on your day, what the highlights were, add pictures, and select stamps to signify what the weather was like.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7530" alt="Maps" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Maps-200x300.png" width="200" height="300" />Maps:</strong></span></p>
<p>Another awesome feature, this section lets you add screenshots or pictures of maps that you can view when connectivity is lacking.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Location List:</strong></span></p>
<p>This feature lets you manually track where you are or pinpoint your location via GPS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select or take a picture to pair with the location</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Tracks latitude, longitude, and altitude</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Publish to FB, Twitter, or brag via email</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">You can enable &#8220;FollowMe&#8221; to automatically add locations to your active trip at the frequency of your choice</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Share Trip:</strong></span></p>
<p>Share your trip with other TripRider travellers via email, with options to include your packing and location lists (though photos will not be shared).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Must See:</strong></span></p>
<p>The app keeps a separate list of any event that you listed as a &#8220;Must See&#8221; when added to the Trip Plan. This feature lets you check them off individually once completed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Briefing:</strong></span></p>
<p>This feature gives you an overview of the day. Including such information as where you&#8217;re staying, what events are planned, which must see events are scheduled for that day, what travellers you met that day, how many locations were marked, what your expenses have been for the day, how much of your budget is remaining for the day, your total expenses for the trip, and how much of your budget remains for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7545" alt="Expenses" src="http://overyonderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Expenses-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300" />Expenses:</strong></span></p>
<p>Another fantastic feature of the app is the ability to set your budget, track your expenses, and have the app automatically convert the currencies once you&#8217;ve entered the exchange rate (as this will work offline as well).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trip Book:</strong></span></p>
<p>When your trip is over, this feature will help you preserve the memories forever. It can create a separate album for all your photos and save the entire trip as PDF file.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts:</h2>
<p>Overall, I think this app is a wonderful addition to any traveller&#8217;s mobile software collection. I even used the app while attending a conference to not only keep track of my budget and schedule, but the Travellers section was invaluable when it came to networking.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The only cons I really saw with the app was that I couldn&#8217;t edit all of the fields once created. Some of them worked just fine, but it seems that others become locked (sometimes for good reason). So, just ensure that you carefully enter your information and don&#8217;t skip any fields when initially setting up your trip.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> I would love to see integration with the calendar and/or alarm for events as an added reminder and so I don&#8217;t have to constantly check the app to see what time it is in comparison to my next scheduled event. It would also be amazing if there was an &#8220;Add to Contacts&#8221; option for the iPhone in the Travellers feature that would add them directly into the phone list (or even just be able to call their phone number directly from the Travellers section).</p>
