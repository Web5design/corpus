<p><strong>Scott Disick</strong> can now breathe easy, because it looks like the male model who is demanding a paternity test for little <strong>Mason</strong> made the whole thing up!</p>
<p>Back in 2009, <strong>Michael Girgenti</strong> claimed that he and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kourtney-kardashian/" target="_blank">Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong> knocked boots after meeting at a photoshoot. 9 months later, she gave birth to her first son and now the model is demanding a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-kourtney-kardashian-male-model-mason-is-his-son-not-scott-disick-dna-test-demand#.UVQ_zqW_1AQ" target="_blank">paternity test</a>!</p>
<p>But before we go and call up <strong>Maury Povich</strong>, a source is pointing out that Michael has had trouble keeping his <del>lies</del> facts straight!</p>
<p>When he first dropped the bombshell he claimed he never heard back from the Kardashian after their steamy affair. However, a month later he gave another interview where he said he received an email from her saying: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Last night was so much fun. But Scott’s bugging me again, and I don’t know what to do."</p></blockquote>
<p>So which is it Mr. Girgenti? Did she use and abuse you, or were you two exchanging emails afterwards?</p>
<p>Kourtney and her attorney say she and Michael never exchanged contact information, so this could be a MAJOR hole in his story.</p>
<p>This whole thing has sounded a bit <a href="http://perez.ly/102JezN" target="_blank">fishy</a> to us from the get-go. Mason looks EXACTLY like Scott and we've never really thought of Kourtney as the cheating type, even if her beau can be a total ass from time to time!</p>
<p>What do U think? Did Michael make the whole thing up??</p>

<p>Nothing says true love like signing a CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT!</p>
<p>At least it does when you're <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/britney-spears" target="_blank">Britney Spears</a></strong>!</p>
<p>The pop sensation has definitely moved quickly right along from her split with ex-fiance <strong>Jason Trawick</strong>, as she's been spotted spending a serious amount of time with <strong>David Lucado</strong>, who joined her during her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-britney-spears-wearing-ring-on-left-hand-ring-finger-las-vegas-trip/#comments" target="_blank">tour</a> of Las Vegas last weekend!</p>
<p>But what does it take to earn the trust - and HEART - of a musical icon, her team of handlers, and her father <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/jamie-spears" target="_blank">Jamie Spears</a></strong>?!</p>
<p>Background checks, and a contract of nondisclosure!</p>
<p>According to insiders: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Jamie has known David (Lucado) for awhile, and always thought he was a thoughtful, and an all-around good guy.  Britney needed someone to keep her company after she and Jason (Trawick) broke up.  It had to be a male, because Britney just doesn’t respond as well to females. And remember, she is still under a conservatorship.  Before David started spending time with Brit, he had to undergo a background check, and sign a confidentiality agreement, all arranged by Papa Spears. Jamie makes sure if things go south between Jamie and Britney, details about her life wouldn’t be made public.  David had absolutely no problem with it, and completely understood why it was being done.  David is very protective of Britney, and isn’t dating her for fame.  He is very, very patient with her as Britney can be prone to drastic mood swings. He has become a very calming influence in her life.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Aww!  Well, this is EXACTLY what we like to hear!</p>
<p>Brit Brit deserves to be around a guy who is happy being with her for her, not because of her incredible success and financial security!</p>
<p>And it's so refreshing to hear that he's already having such a positive impact on her happiness!</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that their <a href="http://perez.ly/10kGwV6" target="_blank">relationship</a> will only continue to grow and deepen from here on out!</p>
<p>All the best, you two!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong> will not be slandered!</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to his bodily fluids!</p>
<p>And those fluids have been at the center of some major dramz with his neighbor after he was accused of <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-spitting-battery-case-neighbor-fight#.UVRFOBl5j6Y" target="_blank">spitting</a> on a man who came by his home to complain about his cray cray driving in the ‘hood.</p>
<p>But the Biebs is pleading <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-26-justin-bieber-battery-investigation-calabasas-home-neighbor-altercation#.UVMhqRl5j6Y" target="_blank">innocent</a> in the case of the loogie as a source revealed: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Yes, they had an interaction, but the neighbor came on to Justin's property without permission. He was trespassing. There was definitely no spitting.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We almost have to believe this because if Justin HAD spit, wouldn’t the neighbor have conspired with his supposed dollar-sign seein' friend and <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-neighbor-threatened-sell-photos-tied-to-battery-charges#.UVRFMxl5j6Y" target="_blank">bottled</a> that stuff up for major buckos on eBay?!</p>
<p>Seriously, we’re sure some teen girl would <a href="http://perez.ly/14ybK0S" target="_blank">max</a> out her parent’s credit card for that shizz!</p>
<p>LOLz!</p>

Most recently? At a golf course in Los Feliz!</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the <em><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/twilight" target="_blank">Twilight</a></strong></em> couple got together during “super twilight time,” says pro shop employee <strong>Jeff Lewis</strong>. A source saw K.Stew “[walk] into the pro shop around 4pm and [buy] a bucket of balls.”</p>
<p>The source then added: </p>
<blockquote><p>"After they retrieved their balls, Kristen gave Rob a little kiss and then they headed toward the course. They looked like they were really enjoying themselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p>AWWW!!</p>
<p>Lewis happened to tweet the sighting as well!</p>

<p>But if only Lewis hadn't misspelled Rob's last name. Do we know a Robert Patterson??</p>

<p>Aren't you ever so curious about <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/angelina-jolie" target="_blank">Angelina Jolie</a></strong>'s mystery <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-angelina-jolie-congo-not-wearing-brad-pitt-engagement-ring#.UVQ971tRi6Y" target="_blank">gold band</a>?! Did girl fool us all and secretly get married to <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/brad-pitt" target="_blank">Brad Pitt</a></strong>?!</p>
<p>Well, we'd have all the deets for you if that were the case...</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it seems the humanitarian has NOT gotten hitched (yet) to her flaxen-haired lover!</p>
<p>Angelina landed in LAX Wednesday after she was spotted rocking the simple piece of jewelry on that tell-tale finger during her latest trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and YES, she was STILL without her super <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-07-08-angelina-jolie-sarajevo-film-festival-engagement-ring/" target="_blank">fancy</a> engagement ring (above)! </p>
<p>But when asked whether or not her NEW finger bling was a wedding ring, Angie replied... </p>
<p>NOPE. Plain and simple! Just like her gold band LOLz! </p>
<p>In fact, we hear Angelina chose not to wear her bedazzled, extravagant <a href="http://perezhilton.com/teddyhilton/2013-03-04-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-no-elephants-at-wedding" target="_blank">engagement</a> rock for fear it might get stolen, lost, or damaged... </p>
<p>Also, it's in pretty poor taste to wear something that probably costs more than what most people make in a lifetime while <a href="http://perez.ly/14yapXJ" target="_blank">attempting</a> to alleviate poverty.</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out TONS more snaps of Angelina's LAX adventure (below)! </p>

<p>Could <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong>'s sweet saliva-slangin' ways land the the popstar <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-threatens-a-break#.UVQzDltRi6Y" target="_blank">behind</a> BARS?!</p>
<p>Well, maybe!</p>
<p>Biebsy's disgruntled Calabasas neighbor alleges that the <em>Believe</em> singer <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-spitting-battery-case-neighbor-fight#.UVQzSFtRi6Y" target="_blank">ASSAULTED</a> him with his bodily fluids...</p>
<p>And the L.A. County DA apparently takes spitting crimes SUPER seriously because they are just plain GROSS and spitting is obviously a huge health hazard. </p>
<p>In fact, once the police are finished investigating Bieber's loogie-hacking <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-26-justin-bieber-battery-investigation-calabasas-home-neighbor-altercation#.UVMhqRl5j6Y" target="_blank">incident</a>, they'll most likely refer it over to the DA, who could potentially PROSECUTE Biebs for his frothy-mouthed attack!  </p>
<p>That's a big IF, however, because we've also <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-neighbor-threatened-sell-photos-tied-to-battery-charges#.UVQzMVtRi6Y" target="_blank">heard</a> that the neighbor in question has been trying to set up the singer in the hopes of making money selling JB's pics/information to the press, so authorities may find that Da Beebz is <del>completely</del> semi innocent.</p>
<p>And even if he's not, jail would be a stretch... but it could go on his permanent record! </p>
<p>And that's just kinda embarrassing. </p>
<p>Plus, we doubt Justin's going to <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-reunion-encino-visit-hour-long-munich-tour#.UVQyrVtRi6Y" target="_blank">win</a> back <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/selena-gomez/" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a></strong> by showing her how far he can spit...</p>
<p>Although it did <a href="http://perez.ly/102rTqq" target="_blank">work</a> for Jack Dawson, LOLz! </p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out some recent snaps from JB's <em>Believe</em> tour (below)!

<p>R-Patz and KStew's reunion sure is blossoming nicely!</p>
<p>Only weeks ago we questioned whether they'd ever emerge from their <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-19-robert-pattinson-stays-in-australia-after-filming-completion-despite-kristen-stewart-being-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank">rough</a> patch, but now their bliss is so big the two of them are counseling <em>others</em> in the way of love!</p>
<p>As <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/katy-perry/" target="_blank">Katy Perry</a></strong> rebounds from her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-23-katy-perry-john-mayer-break-up-details-used-her-for-spotlight/" target="_blank">tumultuous</a> split with awkward hat-afficiando <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/john-mayer/" target="_blank">John Mayer</a></strong>, we're learning <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kristen-stewart/" target="_blank">Kristen Stewart</a></strong> is willing and eager to comfort her bestie!</p>
<p>She and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robert-pattinson/" target="_blank">Robert Pattinson</a></strong> helped the <em>Firework</em> singer <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-birthday-party-dinner-sighting/" target="_blank">celebrate</a> her assistant's birthday last week, but their assistance didn't end there!</p>
<p>Kristen lifted KatyKat's spirits and now the pop-star is fixated on seeing life through rose-colored designer glasses!</p>
<p>According to <em>OK</em>!, a source close to the situation revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[Katy] wants to remind herself of who she really is and where she came from.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Awww! Here, let <em>us</em> help!</p>
<p>You are a brilliant and <a href="http://perez.ly/qsLM6r" target="_blank">beautiful</a> musician from Santa Barbara, LOLz!!</p>
