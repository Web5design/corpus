<p>JK!! Wow, we hope we didn't give anyone a heart attack... LOLz!</p>
<p>We know you're clamoring to know the deetz about <em>True Blood</em>'s season 6 premiere date! Are you ready?</p>
<p>Here it is: JUNE 16th!!</p>
<p>Summer is hot and sticky, and what better way to get hotter and stickier than with sexy vampires and buckets of blood (both fake)?? We'll finally get a glimpse at how Bon Temps is functioning with all those new <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-28-karolina-wydra-luke-grimes-true-blood-bon-temps-vampires-sexy" target="_blank">characters</a>, and without <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-08-27-alan-ball-thanks-true-blood-fans" target="_blank">creator</a> <strong>Alan Ball</strong>!</p>
<p>Also, is it okay to be mad at <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/anna-paquin/" target="_blank">Anna Paquin</a></strong> for getting preggers? The season is only 10 episodes long <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-09-04-true-blood-season-six-reduced-episode-order" target="_blank">instead</a> of 12 because she's bringing a human into the world! How daaaaare she! (No, it's not okay to actually be mad!)</p>
<p>Ha!

<p>It's good to know that <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan/" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong> doesn't take herself too seriously! </p>
<p>The hard partying actress has been in loads of trouble with the law and she used her guest <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-26-lindsay-lohan-anger-management-role-success-looking-good" target="_blank">role</a> on <em>Anger Management</em> as a chance to tell the world she knows she's made some mistakes. </p>
<p>On her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-lindsay-lohan-anger-management-guest-role-early-arrival-on-set" target="_blank">angelic </a>first day of filming on Monday, Lindsay (who plays herself)  and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/charlie-sheen/" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen</a></strong> woke up from a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-26-lindsay-lohan-charlie-sheen-fake-sex-anger-management-nice-tweet#.UVSxeFu4H84" target="_blank">raunchy</a> night in bed and when Charlie's character told her he had to go to <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-lindsay-lohan-240-days-jail-lying-to-cops-case-mark-heller-bringing-in-new-lawyer-postpone-trial" target="_blank">jail </a>for an hour, LiLo replied: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Wow! You have a great lawyer!" </p></blockquote>
<p>LOLz! </p>
<p>At one point when she is visiting Charlie's character in prison she advises other inmates: </p>
<blockquote><p>"What I've learned is, if you just take the time to think before you speak it actually improves your life!!!"</p></blockquote>
<p>Wise words, gurl. Wise words!!!</p>
<p>Like the crew, we're also SUPER impressed by Linds' comedic timing from what we've <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/28/lindsay-lohan-charlie-sheen-anger-management-community-service-video/" target="_blank">seen</a>.  </p>
<p>We cannot wait to see the rest of her HIGHlarious guest role.</p>
<p>Who knows??! Maybe if she can show up on <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-lindsay-lohan-late-for-work-delays-anger-management-shooting" target="_blank">time</a> she'll become a series regular!</p>

<p>Did someone say <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/denzel-washington/" target="_blank">Denzel Washington</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/mark-wahlberg/" target="_blank">Mark Wahlberg</a></strong> in a bromantic cop, action flick?</p>
<p>Count us in!</p>
<p>In the new trailer for the film adaptation of <em>2 Guns</em>, we see the two take on the roles of a couple of bank robbers who just pulled off a HUGE heist! Well, sort of.</p>
<p>Denzel and Dirk Diggler are actually both undercover cops who have unknowingly been pitted against each other and when they find out the money they stole belonged to a mob boss, played by <strong>Edward James Olmos</strong>, they have to find a way to pay him back!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the awesome trailer (above)!</p>
<p>From what we can tell, this movie has just the balance of laughs and action for a perfect summer blockbuster! And a little bit of <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jack-white/" target="_blank">Jack White</a></strong> and <strong>The Dead Weather</strong> rocking in the background never hurt anyone!</p>
<p>With this AND <em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-chloe-moretz-kick-ass-2-international-trailer-hit-girl-aaron-johnson#.UVYIBKW_1AQ" target="_blank">Kick Ass 2</a></em> hitting theaters in August, it looks like it's going to be a great summer!

<p>It may not be mead or Dornish red, but at least we can actually find it at our local grocery store!</p>
<p>Just in time for the third season three premiere, Belgian-style Brewery Ommegang is releasing the first official <em>Game Of Thrones</em> beer!</p>
<p>Iron Throne is a blonde ale, so we know it's not one of King Robert Baratheon's children!</p>
<p><strong>Allison Capozza</strong>, a spokesperson for Ommegang, says: </p>
<blockquote><p>"HBO approached us last year. The producers of the show are fans of Ommegang beers and they thought that would be a good fit for them for this project."</p></blockquote>
<p>New York-based Ommegang plans on <a href="http://perez.ly/14CaQAy" target="_blank">releasing</a> other varieties of <em>GoT</em>-inspired ales over the course of the show.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we can "take the black" with a Night's Watch Dark Lager!</p>

<p>It looks like <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/brendan-fraser/" target="_blank">Brendan Fraser</a></strong> might need that <em>Mummy</em> <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-06-19-alex-kurtzman-the-mummy-star-trek-van-helsing-reboot-dark-knight-style#.UVXqUKW_1AQ" target="_blank">reboot</a> we heard about so long ago to happen sooner rather than later!</p>
<p>As we've mentioned before, the actor has been <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-04-brendan-fraser-going-broke-losing-money-alimony-payments#.UVXp-qW_1AQ" target="_blank">struggling</a> to keep up on his alimony and child support payment which total more than $110,000 a month! Well apparently things have gotten so bad that he's been forced to 'plead poverty' in hopes of getting those costs slashed!</p>
<p>According to a source close to Brendan, he hasn't been able to keep up with payments after sustaining a serious back injury while trying to do some repairs on his home in Connecticut: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Back in October a tree fell on Brendan’s home during Hurricane Sandy, and it caused a lot of damage to the property. In his efforts to clear up after the storm, Brendon grabbed his chainsaw and tried to cut the fallen tree free. As the chainsaw went through the bark, Brendan’s back gave way, and he was left in excruciating pain. The debilitating injury left him requiring correction back correction surgery, which he was performed in a private Beverly Hills clinic. Then, he had to undergo rehabilitation and was even using a stroller for a while, the injury was so bad."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch! That sounds painful!</p>
<p>In addition to racking up a huge medical bill, the source claims the injury can also hurt his chances of finding acting jobs since doctors have advised him to not perform his own stunts.</p>
<p>Back in 2009 when Brendan and <strong>Afton Smith</strong> filed for divorce, they came to a settlement without too much conflict. But now the actor is claiming he doesn't make nearly as much money as he once did, and he can no longer afford the price they agreed on.</p>
<p>It definitely doesn't seem like the demand for Brendan is as high as it once and his <a href="http://perez.ly/173AcX6" target="_blank">funds</a> might be starting to dry up!</p>

<p>FX is looking to make some big moves this fall as they recently announced they will be launching a new network later this year!</p>
<p>Network President <strong>John Landgraf</strong> confirmed their plans to launch of of their new channel, FXX on September 2nd. That's right. It's like FX, just with another X. How original!</p>
<p>FXX will aim for a target audience of 18-34 year olds, a demographic that shouldn't be to hard to reach considering the network will be inheriting HIGHlarious veteran shows like <em>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em> and <em>The League</em> when their new seasons start! </p>
<p>The new channel will also feature reruns of classics like <em>Rescue Me</em> and <em>Arrested Development</em>, which is definitely a good thing because who doesn't love the Bluths??</p>
<p>While FX is certainly lending a helping hand to their new baby bro, they aren't giving up hits like <em>Louie</em>, <em>Archer</em>, or <em>Wilfred</em>, meaning they will probably have to launch a few pilots for original programming. But considering the network's recent track record with comedies, that probably won't be too difficult!</p>
<p>We're always down for a good laugh, so we're definitely looking forward to <a href="http://perez.ly/14te354" target="_blank">FXX</a>! Hopefully it can keep up with the rest in this golden age for cable television!</p>

<p>It’s never nice to slam a momma-to-be.</p>
<p>But luckily <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kim-kardashian/" target="_blank">Kim Kardashian</a></strong> probably has a pretty thick skin, and she’ll need it!</p>
<p>Kim was already <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2011-11-18-tyler-perry-defends-his-choice-to-cast-kim-kardashian-in-the-marriage-counselor" target="_blank">hassled</a> for even being CAST in <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/tyler-perry/" target="_blank">Tyler Perry</a></strong>’s <em>Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor</em>, but now she’s getting even more hassle for not quite pulling off the role.</p>
<p>But she knows so much about marriage! We kid, we kid!!</p>
<p>Critics have already laid into the reality TV star for her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-12-21-tyler-perry-temptation-kim-kardashian-official-trailer#.UVX6aBl5j6Y" target="_blank">attempt</a> at playing Ava, a marriage counselor.</p>
<p><strong>Jenni Miller</strong> of Hollywood.com commented on the starlet: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Her coworker Ava is played by Kim Kardashian, a true feat of stunt casting that’s only made all the more impressive by her inability to inject the slightest bit of emotion into her steady stream of insults.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Alonso Duralde</strong> of <em>The Wrap</em> added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Kim Kardashian, as nasal and awful an actress as you might imagine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But that wasn’t the end of it as <strong>Joel D Amos</strong> of Moviefanatic.com wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is there we also meet the Kim Kardashian character. Let’s just say that the question of whether the celebrity gossip maven can act is answered within 60 seconds of her cold absence of any feeling performance.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p>Those sour reviews surely have to sting no matter how <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2011-11-15-kim-kardashian-hires-acting-coach-to-helo-with-tyler-perry-movie" target="_blank">confident</a> you are with yourself.</p>
<p>Luckily, we think Kim will be just <a href="http://perez.ly/10nKZqa" target="_blank">fine</a> without a successful acting career.</p>
<p>Especially since she has <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kanye-west/" target="_blank">Kanye West</a></strong> cheer her up after a bad day!</p>

Oh Fox News, you took the bait, didn't you??
Jim Carrey dropped a hottttt new track the other day, which we covered for you &#8212; it was a song about gun control, done in a Hee Haw parody! Honestly, it was harmless while getting Jim's personal views across.

<p>Oh Fox News, you took the bait, didn't you??</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jim-carrey/" target="_blank">Jim Carrey</a></strong> dropped a hottttt new track the other day, which we <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-26-jim-carrey-gun-control-funnyordie-hee-haw-spoof-hilarious" target="_blank">covered</a> for you -- it was a song about gun control, done in a <em>Hee Haw</em> parody! Honestly, it was harmless while getting Jim's personal views across.</p>
<p>Fox News on the other hand took it as a personal slight and has been losing their shizz over it the past few days, regardless of literally <em>all</em> other stories being way more important news! Isn't there something <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-proposition-8-equal-rights-listen-full-audio" target="_blank">going on</a> in the Supreme Court right now or something...? LOLz!</p>
<p>Anyway, Jim has responded to their bashing! Here's what he said: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Since I released my "Cold Dead Hand" video on Funny or Die this week, I have watched Fux News rant, rave, bare its fangs and viciously slander me because of my stand against large magazines and assault rifles. I would take them to task legally if I felt they were worth my time or that anyone with a brain in their head could actually fall for such irresponsible buffoonery. That would gain them far too much attention which is all they really care about.</p>
<p>I'll just say this: in my opinion Fux News is a last resort for kinda-sorta-almost-journalists whose options have been severely limited by their extreme and intolerant views; a media colostomy bag that has begun to burst at the seams and should be emptied before it becomes a public health issue.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that in time, good people will lose patience with the petty and poisonous behavior of these bullies and Fux News will be remembered as nothing more than a giant culture fart that no amount of Garlique could cure.</p>
<p>I wish them all the luck that accompanies such malevolence."</p></blockquote>
<p>DAMN! </p>
<p>Did someone leave toast in the toaster because something smells like it just got BURNED!</p>
<p>We're anxiously awaiting the one day that everyone over at Fox News can't keep a straight face <a href="http://perez.ly/173Mi2A" target="_blank">anymore</a> and just busts out laughing at how many people they've tricked by trolling the nation. It'll be a weird kind of relief, and though many will be shocked and horrified: we'll all get through it!</p>
<p>Ha! You can watch Jim's inflammatory spoof video (above)!
