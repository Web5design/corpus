<p>Whoa! Our minds are blown!</p>
<p>After watching <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jamie-foxx/" target="_blank">Jamie Foxx</a></strong> slay it as the titular hero of <em>Django Unchained</em>, it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the lead!!</p>
<p>So we were triple stunned to learn <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/will-smith/" target="_blank">Will Smith</a></strong> was once attached to the <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/quentin-tarantino/" target="_blank">Quentin Tarantino</a></strong> script, but eventually turned down the role because his character wasn't in enough scenes!</p>
<p>The Man in Black recently revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Django wasn’t the lead, so it was like, I need to be the lead. The other character was the lead! I was like, 'No, Quentin, please, I need to kill the bad guy!'"</p></blockquote>
<p>That's INSANE!! And maybe slightly self-centered!!</p>
<p>Everything worked out for the best, we suppose!</p>
<p>Jamie took the role, his performance was amazeballz, <strong>Christoph Waltz</strong> <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-24-oscars-2013-christoph-waltz-winner-best-supporting-actor/" target="_blank">waltzed</a> away with an <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/oscars/" target="_blank">Oscar</a></strong> for Best Supporting Actor, and a bunch of slave owning white jerks got dead.</p>
<p>Still, we can't help but wonder how it might've all turned out if The Fresh Prince was <a href="http://perez.ly/11DIoNN" target="_blank">involved</a>, LOLz!!</p>

<p>Guess what? It gets better!</p>
<p>We also learned Queen Bey & <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/john-legend/" target="_blank">John Legend</a></strong> will join forces to blow Britain's <del>mind</del> ears with a London concert on June 1st that they will simulcast across the globe to raise cash and awareness for their charity!</p>
<p>Bey is totes passionate about the cause, too!!</p>
<p>She admitted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have always felt strongly about equal opportunity for women. Girls have to be taught from early on that they are strong and capable of being anything they want to be. It's up to us to change the statistics for women around the world. I'm honored to be in the company of women who live fearlessly and set an example for the next generation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You are setting a phenomenal example for all of us, gurl!!</p>
<p>You've heard us say it before, but we'll say it again:</p>
<p>Nothing makes us happier than celebz who give back to the world they live in! It truly warms our heart!!</p>

<p>It’s always great to see celebrities interact with their fans through social media websites like <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/twitter/" target="_blank">Twitter</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/facebook/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/tom-cruise/" target="_blank">Tom Cruise</a></strong> is breaking new ground as the first celebrity to join Vkontakte.</p>
<p>If you’ve never heard of the website, you’re definitely not alone! VK.com is essentially the Russian equivalent of Facebook and has a nearly identical layout.</p>
<p>We’re not sure that we’ll be seeing many celebrities jumping on this bandwagon, but so far it’s been working out for Tom who already has over 63,000 <a href="http://vk.com/id205387401" target="_blank">followers</a> since joining last week!</p>
<p>Looks like Russia loves them some Stacee Jaxx!</p>
<p>The <em>Rock of Ages</em> star and “TeamTC” have mainly been using the site to promote his upcoming film <em>Oblivion</em>, but they have also taken the time to thank fans for the warm welcome with posts saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hey Guys, We opened up the wall for a bit this morning, (It's 10:33am PT in L.A.!), cause we wanted to hear from you and interact a bit with you.... you guys are awesome!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well isn’t that nice!!</p>
<p>Tom and his team have even taken the time to reply to some fans individually, and from what we can see he has been brushing up on his Russian!</p>
<p>His number of followers continues to grow with each minute, and it looks like he might have struck gold with <a href="http://perez.ly/10d3yx9" target="_blank">Vkontakte</a>! Either way, it’s great to see a star showing some appreciation for his fans overseas!</p>

<p>We LOVE being able to bring you guys news like this!</p>
<p>In our political climate right now, we're getting more and more excited about the number of people holding government positions who are publicly supporting gay <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-14-illinois-senate-passes-same-sex-marriage-law" target="_blank">rights</a> and gay <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-colorado-legalizes-same-sex-unions-not-gay-marriage-yet" target="_blank">marriage</a>! To us, it's reflecting a shift in not only the beliefs within the offices held, but also a shift in how those beliefs are handled!</p>
<p>Being loud and proud about your view to support equality is the best way, because you're not cowering in fear of losing votes by standing up for your fellow humans! This is why we're applauding <strong>Senator Claire McCaskill</strong>!</p>
<p>Claire decided it was high time that she stand up for love, so she posted this on her tumblr:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. I Corinthians 13</strong></p>
<p>The question of marriage equality is a great American debate. Many people, some with strong religious faith, believe that marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. Other people, many of whom also have strong religious faith, believe that our country should not limit the commitment of marriage to some, but rather all Americans, gay and straight should be allowed to fully participate in the most basic of family values.</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that our government should not limit the right to marry based on who you love. While churches should never be required to conduct marriages outside of their religious beliefs, neither should the government tell people who they have a right to marry.</p>
<p>My views on this subject have changed over time, but as many of my gay and lesbian friends, colleagues and staff embrace long term committed relationships, I find myself unable to look them in the eye without honestly confronting this uncomfortable inequality. Supporting marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples is simply the right thing to do for our country, a country founded on the principals of liberty and equality.</p>
<p>Good people disagree with me. On the other hand, my children have a hard time understanding why this is even controversial. I think history will agree with my children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your children are AMAZING!</p>
<p>She hits on every correct <a href="http://perez.ly/11Esum8" target="_blank">argument</a> we could really come up with as to why marriage equality should exist: churches aren't going to be forced to do anything outside of their religious beliefs, love is love and everyone should have access to the benefits and commitment that marriage brings!</p>
<p>Not only that, but people form new traditions all the time! Why would it be so bad to take "traditional" marriage and make a new "tradition" based on love and only love??</p>
<p>We think it'd be beautiful!</p>
<p>What a wonderful post, Claire! The fight has just begun! Equality for all!</p>
