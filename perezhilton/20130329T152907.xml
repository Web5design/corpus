<p>Been hearing that it could go from cold to hot <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-10-16-katy-perry-john-mayer-lunch-date-west-village-abc-kitchen-hot-n-cold#.UVWXLVu4H84" target="_blank">again</a>??</p>
<p>Sources say <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/katy-perry/" target="_blank">Katy Perry</a></strong> is totez open to reigniting the on-again, off-again love flame between her and<strong> <a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/john-mayer/" target="_blank">John Mayer</a></strong>. </p>
<p>But WHY would the singer want to reconcile with the man that's been the cause of so much recent <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-19-katy-perry-john-mayer-split-break-up-again" target="_blank">heartbreak</a>?? </p>
<p>A source close to the <em>Wide Awake</em> songstress dished: </p>
<blockquote><p>"There's no question that Katy wants to settle down, but right now, she's not ready to fling herself into another relationship. If anything, she'd be open to reconciling with John if he can get his act together."</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.  Say WHAT?</p>
<p>Hopping back in bed with John is NOT a good idea if the only reason is that she doesn't want to start all over with a new stud. Being alone isn't all THAT bad!</p>
<p>In fact, we JUST saw her looking mighty <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-29-katy-perry-smiling-phone-call-post-john-mayer" target="_blank">happy</a> all by her solo self. So this whole thing sounds like total bullshizz to us! </p>

<p>The two sound AMAZING together, and of course we always love any chance to see Swifty shake what her mama gave her!! LOLz!</p>
<p>And it's super awesome that Tyler took time out of his busy schedule to surprise the fans, especially since his band is on a tour of their own and he flew in from Florida just for the night!</p>

<p>Oh no, this is so sad!</p>
<p>Iconic British thespian <strong>Richard Griffiths</strong> died Thursday at the age of 65 after experiencing complications from heart surgery. </p>
<p>Griffiths is a renowned actor, and played the loathsome Uncle Vernon in the <strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/harry-potter/" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a></em></strong> films. Costar <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/daniel-radcliffe/" target="_blank">Daniel Radcliffe</a></strong> remembered his friend Friday, and expressed in a statement: </p>
<blockquote><p>"I was proud to say I knew him. </p>
<p>Richard was by my side during two of the most important moments of my career. In August 2000, before official production had even begun on Potter, we filmed a shot outside the Dursleys', which was my first ever shot as Harry. I was nervous and he made me feel at ease. Seven years later, we embarked on Equus together. It was my first time doing a play but, terrified as I was, his encouragement, tutelage and humor made it a joy.</p>
<p>In fact, any room he walked into was made twice as funny and twice as clever just by his presence."</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides starring in MANY films and tv productions, Richard was also a famed theater actor, and has won awards for his masterful work.</p>
<p>The world will be a little less vibrant without Richard's presence. May he <a href="http://perez.ly/10mYMNI" target="_blank">rest</a> in peace. </p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out some pics of the late, great actor (below)! </p>

<p>The neighbors must love it! Especially the one with the alleged Bieby loogi souvenir! </p>
<p>Booze?! Weed?! Hot chicks?! We bet <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong> was <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-06-justin-bieber-family-friends-worried-bad-influences-weed-codeine-ferrari#.UVWVT6tRi6Y" target="_blank">BUMMED</a> he missed this party! LOLz! </p>
<p>JB's bestie <strong>Lil Twist</strong> reallllyyyy seems to like <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-08-justin-bieber-lil-twist-hit-and-run-liquor-store-chris-brown-fisker-karma#.UVWPkqtRi6Y" target="_blank">f*cking</a> up his friend's sh*t while Justin's away globe-trotting on his <em>Believe</em> tour...</p>
<p>Because not only does Twist have a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-04-justin-bieber-lil-twist-fisker-karma-police-ticket#.UTntbtFRi6Y" target="_blank">history</a> of smashing Bieber's fancy, expensive vehicles, it seems he's also partaking in illegal activity INSIDE the singer's own home! </p>
<p>Twist reportedly threw a heady house party last week and invited over 40 ladiez...</p>
<p>And pictures have since surfaced, taken from the interior of Bieber's Calabasas mansion, depicting a coffee table LADEN with various alcohol bottles and smoking devices!</p>
<p>And seeing as Justin is already <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-28-justin-bieber-spitting-neighbors-mandatory-anger-management" target="_blank">dealing</a> with pissed off neighbors thanks to his alleged spitting <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-28-justin-bieber-spitting-scandal-new-wrinkle-another-witness-confirms" target="_blank">scandal</a>, we doubt he wants to add fuel to the neighborhood fire by having his buddy partying till all hours of the morn with copious amounts of beer, liquor, WEEDZ, and women.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time you find a new friend Biebs! You know, one that won't use and <a href="http://perez.ly/14B4jG9" target="_blank">abuse</a> your property, LOLz! </p>

<p>It seems that in her featured episode,  Lilo is pretending to promote a type of gum called "#1 Happy Whiskey Chew," but something goes awry during the promo shoot and SHOCKS both her and The Sheen!</p>
<p>We wonder what's got them so spooked??</p>

<p>Remember back when the world thought KStew and R-Patz were <del>near the bitter end</del> in the <em><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/twilight/" target="_blank">Twilight</a></strong></em> of their relationship?</p>
<p>Seems like ancient history, huh?</p>
<p>These days, the sparkly couple enjoys imprinting their love all over town!</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we told you a few lucky <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-28-robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-date-night-golfing-super-twilight-time/" target="_blank">golfers</a> spotted <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kristen-stewart/" target="_blank">Kristen Stewart</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robert-pattinson/" target="_blank">Robert Pattinson</a></strong> whacking some balls at <strong>Los Feliz Golf Course</strong>!!</p>
<p>Now we're learning more deetz of their super-cute date!!</p>
<p>According to staff and onlookers, the totally happy twosome was the cutest couple on Earth! One source says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Kristen and Rob were here Tuesday to play some golf and they looked absolutely adorable. I mean just super sweet people and totally down to earth. They definitely looked like a couple. They were holding hands while walking on the course, and at one point Rob put his arms around Kristen like he was showing her how to swing the club. They were laughing a lot and flirting a lot. It seemed like the perfect night out too. Very romantic!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Aww!! That's ah-mazing!!</p>
<p>Last week they were seen enjoying spirits in high-spirits at <strong>Ye Rustic Inn</strong> and this week they're linking up on The Links!!</p>
<p>We're so supremely happy for them!!</p>
<p>Invite us to your foursome next time, because you know we relish any excuse to wear <a href="http://perez.ly/10lDaRE" target="_blank">argyle</a> socks!! LOLz!!</p>
