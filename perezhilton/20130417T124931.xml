<p>Here we thought the <strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/real-housewives/" target="_blank">Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a></em></strong> cast was facing a MAJOR <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-18-adrienne-maloof-leaving-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills#.UW2v5IJ5j6Y" target="_blank">shakeup</a>!</p>
<p>Instead, it looks like fans will be grab a glass of rosé and enjoy the company of old friends.</p>
<p>Most of the lovelies in Beverly Hills - some <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-21-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-almost-entire-cast-replaced-season-four" target="_blank">expected</a> and some not so much - will continue to show off their diamonds and Botox next season as cast members are rumored to be already filming the new season.</p>
<p>Let the circus begin!</p>
<p>While <strong>Taylor Armstrong</strong> was on the chopping block, she is now back on Rodeo Drive with the other divas all thanks to a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-05-real-housewives-beverly-hills-kyle-richards-hoping-taylor-armstrong-stays-next-season" target="_blank">lack</a> of ANY other choices!</p>
<p>A source revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Taylor began filming for the fourth season of <em>RHOBH</em> last week. It was a bit of a shock to see Taylor in front of the camera again because the crew thought she was a goner for sure. The viewers just don’t like her. But, it has been so hard to find replacements for <strong>Adrienne Maloof</strong> and <strong>Camille Grammer</strong>, that producers had no choice but to bring her back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it's better to be a last choice than not a choice at all! Right??</p>
<p>But she isn’t the only cast member locked back in as <strong>Yolanda Foster</strong> has made the cut!</p>
<p>After showing off her Malibu mansion, AH-Mazing fridge and lemons galore, the newbie added plenty to the kooky <em>Housewives</em> lifestyle. The source commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Yolanda is quickly becoming a fan favorite because she is becoming the mama bear of the group, and calls the ladies out on their catty ways when necessary.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She sure does!</p>
<p>We saw her throw it down with <strong>Kyle Richards</strong> during the reunion and with Taylor, well, all the time!</p>
<p>Just based on this cast, we’re bound to have <a href="http://perez.ly/11o8Bwx" target="_blank">plenty</a> of dramz next season!

<p>Whoever said life is easy for celebrities' kids obviously doesn't know <strong>Cameron Douglas</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Richard Berman</strong> must not be a fan of <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/michael-douglas/" target="_blank">Michael Douglas</a></strong>' work because the judge IGNORED his son's <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2012-05-21-addiction-experts-files-brief-on-behalf-of-michael-douglas-incarcerated-son-cameron" target="_blank">pleas</a> to get out of jail early in federal appeals court in New York on Monday. </p>
<p>Cameron was first <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2010-04-20-cameron-douglas-sentenced-to-five-years-in-prison" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to five years behind bars in 2010 for narcotics distribution, but was then hit with an additional five years by the same judge after additional drug infractions behind bars. </p>
<p>That means Michael won't be seeing his son as a free man until 2018!</p>
<p>While the court admits it is an "unusually long sentence" for such a violation, they think the decision is justified. </p>
<p>We're not so sure we agree though and neither does director of Legal Affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, <strong>Daniel Abrahamson</strong>! </p>
<p>The narcotics expert explained: </p>
<blockquote><p>"Mr. Douglas's case, and his draconian sentence, underscores how our federal drug laws have departed so dramatically from medicine, reason, public health and common sense. Those laws, and our prisons which fail to provide adequate treatment and rehabilitation services, cause as much or greater devastation to individuals, families and communities than drug use and abuse."</p></blockquote>
<p>We're sure Cameron's not the first guy to have drugs in prison! </p>
<p>Obviously he has an addiction and NO history of any other criminal behavior, so why isn't he in rehab with the rest of Hollywood royalty???! </p>
<p>The BEEFY, violent bullies most likely picking on him DEFINITELY won't be helping him get past his dependency problems either. </p>
<p>We're just hoping Cameron AND his<a href="http://perezhilton.com/2010-04-07-catherine-zeta-jones-pleads-for-stepson-cameron-douglas" target="_blank"> family</a> have the strength to endure <a href="http://perez.ly/1117HEG" target="_blank">five</a> more challenging years!</p>

<p>Say it ain't so, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robert-downey-jr/" target="_blank">Robert Downey Jr.</a></strong>!</p>
<p>The <em>Avengers</em> star is thinking about retiring from the role of <em>Iron Man</em>, and it's Tony Stark's family demons that made him realize it! He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It got me thinking about how big the message from your cosmic sponsor needs to be before you pick it up. </p>
<p>How many genre movies can I do? How many follow-ups to a successful follow-up are actually fun?"</p></blockquote>
<p>We just hope he doesn't forget about his <em>comics</em> sponsor! </p>
<p>But of course no franchise can last forever, not even <em>Fast & Furious</em>! But what will RDJ do next if not defeating super-villains? He says: </p>
<blockquote><p>"I come from a family of very innovative writers and directors and actors and artists, and the circle of friends they were in were the people I heard having pun-offs playing poker at two in the morning, and it was just the most comforting aspect of my childhood. </p>
<p>So there's this kind of legacy of souls from what I consider to be a very particular time in entertainment, and I'm sensing a return to that."</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like he's aiming at a more old-fashioned type of <a href="http://perez.ly/11oNTfS" target="_blank">entertainment</a>. Theatre, variety, maybe even vaudeville?</p>
<p>Ooh, he could do a Marvel stage show! <em>A Stark Is Born</em>! LOLz!</p>
<p>Srsly, we'd be super sad to see him go, but all things must come to an end. But not yet!</p>

<p>...which, yes, surely doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, but her agreement states that if she misses even ONE payment, the bank can demand the whole balance!</p>
<p>And they did!</p>
<p>Considering her other financial <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-04-jacqueline-laurita-real-housewives-new-jersey-tax-lien-unpaid-assets" target="_blank">sitch</a>, we’re starting to wonder what these ladiez do with their hefty Bravo salaries!</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/robert-downey-jr/" target="_blank">Robert Downey Jr.</a></strong> is many things, but humble is not one of them!</p>
<p>In an interview with <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/gq/" target="_blank">GQ</a></strong>, the <em>Iron Man</em> actor talked about his career in film and had NO problems saying just how awesome he is:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I'm probably one of the best. But it's not that big a deal. It's not like this is the greatest swath or generation of actors that has ever come down the pike."</p></blockquote>
<p>Well at least we know confidence isn't an issue for him! LOLz!</p>
<p>But just how good is he? Will he finally nab his first <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/oscars/" target="_blank">Oscar</a></strong> before all is said and done??</p>
<p>Robert says there's not a doubt in his mind that he'll eventually get his hands on the elusive trophy: </p>
<blockquote><p>"I, personally, would be shocked if we went to the end of the tape now and I didn't have at least one. Because I'm young enough, and I'm running down being occupied with these kind of genre movies, close enough. Even the next thing we're doing with [my wife, Susan Downey], I'm so confident about it. It's the best script the studio has; it's the best thing I've read in years."</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like he still has a trick or two up his sleeve! </p>
<p>Besides, even if he doesn't win one for a role in a movie, the academy has to recognize his career at some point, right? He went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Look, even if I don't get one directly, eventually they're just going to have to give me one when I get old. So no matter how you slice it, I'm getting one."</p></blockquote>
<p>We have to admit, the thought of an 80-year old Robert Downey Jr. making his way to the stage to make his acceptance speech sounds pretty awesome to us! Ha!</p>
<p>We couldn't agree more than he's totally deserving of an Oscar and hopefully he'll be recognized before his awesome career comes to an end, but it doesn't <a href="http://perez.ly/XEtJ13" target="_blank">sound</a> like he's too worried about that!</p>
