<p>Nothing can satisfy <strong>Gucci Mane</strong> like a nice fat joint...not even sex! </p>
<p>The rapper/actor was so stoned on the set of <em>Spring Breakers</em> that he fell asleep while he was being filmed gettin' nasty. </p>
<p>Even though Gucci's sex partner could balance 5 cans on her booty and rode him for 45 minutes, it just wasn't enough to interrupt Gucci's REM cycle. </p>
<p>Director Harmony Korine spilled: </p>
<blockquote><p>"In his entourage, everybody smokes weed from the beginning of the day to the end. So we’re inside this house in St. Petersburg, and the f*cking weed smoke was so insane and Gucci was basically catatonic. I was like, 'Gucci, you’ve got to have sex with this chick now!' He wanted her to ride him so he wouldn’t have to do any physical labor. So we’re shooting the sequence, and as he is getting f*cked, I start to hear snores. He had literally passed out! And she was riding his d*ck the whole time. I’d never in my life filmed a sex scene where the dude was sleeping. At the end, he woke up and was like, 'I feel real nice. I feel like Mozart’s on my d*ck.' And that was it, and he went back to sleep."</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa! </p>
<p>Sounds like an award-worthy performance to us! HA!</p>
<p>Thankfully for Gucci, the <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/03/gucci-mane-slept-through-spring-breakers-sex.html" target="_blank">stoned </a>look worked well for his gangsta' character. </p>
<p>We should take this as a lesson to not toke up while on the job. </p>
<p>Right, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/rihanna/" target="_blank">Rihanna</a></strong>??! LOLz.</p>

<p>Fusing the music of <strong>John Lennon</strong> with imagery of <strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong>, <strong>Anne Frank</strong>, <strong>Matthew Shepard</strong>, and others, this is a video that needs to be viewed on every screen!!</p>

<p>We're so excited for the new season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> that we're getting all kinds of weird dragon boners (should we call it <em>Game of Bones</em>?? Ha!), especially when they keep releasing <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-game-of-thrones-season-3-new-trailer" target="_blank">trailers</a> and the Khaleesi keeps her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-20-emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-teaser-trailer-dragons-seasons-three" target="_blank">eye</a> on that throne!</p>

<p>The best-selling <em>Game Of Thones</em> book series has became a smash hit HBO show, thanks to great adaptation </p>
<p>Usually as show runner, <strong>David Benioff</strong> is rewriting author <strong>George R. R. Martin</strong>, but this time it's George doing the correcting!</p>
<p>David mistakenly said viewers could see the writer onscreen this season, but George says it's not gonna happen!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the video (above) to see the father of the fantasy series explain why he will NOT be doing a cameo in the upcoming Season 3- and why if he ever does another <a href="http://perez.ly/13jvAx3" target="_blank">cameo</a>, he has to be sitting down!</p>
<p>Look, just as long as George doesn't hurt himself sitting on that sword chair! We need him to write the rest of those books already!
