Selena Gomez continues to charm.
She stopped by Ellen yesterday and chatted with the HIGHlarious host about her MTV Movie Awards run-in with Brad Pitt. Well, more like his run-in with her.

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/selena-gomez" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a></strong> continues to charm.</p>
<p>She stopped by <em><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/ellen-degeneres" target="_blank">Ellen</a></strong></em> yesterday and chatted with the HIGHlarious host about her <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/mtv-movie-awards" target="_blank">MTV Movie Awards</a></strong> run-in with <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/brad-pitt" target="_blank">Brad Pitt</a></strong>. Well, more like his run-in with her. </p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the video (above) and see Selena dish the goods!!</p>
<p>She revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“They knocked on my door and they said Brad Pitt would like to come in and I was like, he can come in. I was trying to play cool and be really nice and as soon as he walked out I ran and I hide under the craft service table for like two minutes because I couldn’t believe it was happening.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Ellen wouldn’t be Ellen if she didn’t ask about Selena’s ex <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong>. The <em>Come And Get It</em> singer hasn’t given too much away about her former relationship, but she shared that things have been a bit lonely in the love department. No one’s asked her out since her breakup!</p>
<p>Ellen joked:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Tell me who you want. I’ll get ‘em. Besides Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt is not available.”</p></blockquote>
<p>HA! Doesn’t look like Selena’s too bothered by it!

<p>She's not all though... so many other other stars look so great without makeup, we wish they'd go makeup-free more often!</p>

<p>We were heartbroken to hear <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/ozzy-osbourne/" target="_blank">Ozzy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/sharon-osbourne/" target="_blank">Sharon Osbourne</a></strong> had called it quits.</p>
<p>But we are quite relieved to hear today that a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-15-sharon-osbourne-ozzy-osbourne-split-living-apart-multiple-sources" target="_blank">divorce</a> is not yet a certainty. </p>
<p>After 31 years of marriage, the two have temporarily <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-15-sharon-osbourne-spotted-moving-fan-ozzy-osbourne-split-rumors-no-wedding-ring" target="_blank">split</a> up while they deal with some very serious issues that caused strain on their relationship.</p>
<p>In fact, Ozzy stepped forward to explain the truth about their relationship and revealed that he recently took to drinking and doing drugs again, which led to this shocking split.</p>
<p>He posted an explanation on <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/facebook/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></strong>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the last year and a half I have been drinking and taking drugs. I was in a very dark place and was an asshole to the people I love most, my family. However, I am happy to say that I am now 44 days sober. Just to set the record straight, Sharon and I are not divorcing. I’m just trying to be a better person. I would like to apologize to Sharon, my family, my friends and my band mates for my insane behavior during this period………and my fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While we’re incredibly happy to hear they are NOT divorcing and he's getting sober, it's a tragedy he fell into those old, dangerous habits.</p>
<p>But we know he'll continue his fight against temptation!</p>
<p>During all this <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-14-sharon-osbourne-ozzy-osbourne-not-spending-time-together-possible-divorce" target="_blank">breaking</a> news, Sharon has been in Cabo San Lucas getting away from it all even though she’s been spotted constantly on her phone.</p>
<p>Although they’re living separately, we have no <a href="http://perez.ly/10ZYTPA" target="_blank">doubt</a> these two will be able to work ALL these issues out.</p>
<p>Good luck to you both!</p>

<p>The new queen of the twerk enjoyed some fun timez at Greystone Manor Nightclub after proving she's got it all going on!</p>
<p>We’re not sure if she donned a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-miley-cyrus-twerking-unicorn-onesie-dance-video" target="_blank">onesie</a> to twerk until the early hours of the morning, but we do know she appeared to have a great time with a couple friends.</p>
<p>As she left the club, Mileybird was all smiles, which is just how we like to see our former Disney darling.</p>

<p>It turns out <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/rebel-wilson#.UWxUZqWTNUQ" target="_blank">Rebel Wilson</a></strong> and the <em><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/hunger-games" target="_blank">Hunger Games</a></strong></em> actress are twin sisters! Well, at least according to Rebel's spoof, originally intended to air during the award show -- though pulled due to Jennifer's no-show status.</p>
<p>Rebel explained her relationship with Jennifer:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are identical in every way except for how we look or how we act."</p></blockquote>
<p>She joked: </p>
<blockquote><p>"I love my sister very, very much, I do. I mean, if she wanted a kidney, I'd be like, ‘No.' I mean you can have some of my boob meat."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the AH-mazing video <strong>...AFTER THE JUMP!!!</strong> </p>

<p>And here we thought that was more inline with her work on <em>Lovelace</em>!!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/amanda-seyfried/" target="_blank">Amanda Seyfried</a></strong> didn't strip nude for <em><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/allure/" target="_blank">Allure</a></strong></em>'s <em>Look Better Naked</em> issue, but she still revealed some pretty private parts of her life!!</p>
<p>The May cover girl opened up about how she learned to sing so swell as Cosette in <em>Les Misérables</em> and we were SHOCKED!!!</p>
<p>We can't believe what exercises her vocal coach recommended to warm up those vocal chords!!</p>
<p>Amanda revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[My coach told me to] imagine [performing a sex act], get that feeling in the back of your throat, and then sing."</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh... Wow! That's a distinct feeling all right, though we aren't entirely sure how it improves the voice!!!</p>
<p>We wonder how Coach recommends warming up to perform fellatio? Hum a few bars from <em>One Day More</em>? Ha!!</p>
<p>Amanda is the only gal in the upcoming issue who isn't showing off the Full Monty, apparently, but she says it's not her fault.</p>
<p>She admitted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I would have, but my publicist wouldn’t let me!”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! Her publicist sounds a tad more sensible than her vocal <a href="http://perez.ly/XCLw8Q" target="_blank">coach</a>!</p>

<p>We’re still waiting for our dream to come true!</p>
<p>Please, <strong>Spice Girls</strong>, reunite!</p>
<p>Unfortunately it sounds like we’re going to be waiting for a while because the ladiez aren’t getting any closer to <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-victoria-beckham-will-sing-no-more" target="_blank">bringing</a> back girl power.</p>
<p>We’ve known for awhile that <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/victoria-beckham/" target="_blank">Victoria Beckham</a></strong> has been holding out on hitting the stage once again, but we didn’t think it’d cause the end of the Spice Girls forever!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/melanie-c/" target="_blank">Mel C</a></strong> admitted that if <del>Posh Spice</del> Victoria wants to be done with the girl group then they will <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-12-17-spice-girls-reunion-denied-victoria-beckham" target="_blank">gladly</a> let it be. She said: </p>
<blockquote><p>“To have come from a pop group to be respected in the fashion world - we have so much respect for her for doing that, and she's worked bloody hard to get there. It's not a secret that her passions lie elsewhere. So we can't drag her kicking and screaming, telling her, 'Come on! It's time to sing <em>Wannabe</em>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>They can’t??</p>
<p>Well, even if they can’t do that, we’ve always wondered about them going on without her.</p>
<p>Sure, it wouldn’t be the same, but at least we’d get a little of the old magic!</p>
<p>But don’t <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-spice-girls-reality-show-to-replace-posh" target="_blank">count</a> on it as Mel C commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We did really, really enjoy doing the Olympics and would love to do something else, but would we want to do it without Victoria? I don't know. It's something that would need to be thought about in depth ... With the Spice Girls, probably more than any other band in history, it was our individuality and the identities that made it the success it was. No Spice Girl will ever or could ever be replaced.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Awww!</p>
<p>Even though we’re dying for a <a href="http://perez.ly/XCAvo5" target="_blank">reunion</a>, we love the camaraderie!</p>
<p>The Spice Girls really ARE bestiez!</p>

<p>We knew the Louis Vuitton Don loved traveling <em>Around the World</em>, but none of us predicted this!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kanye-west/" target="_blank">Kanye West</a></strong> took his talents back to Paris to collaborate with his friends <strong>Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</strong> and <strong>Thomas Bangalte</strong>, known to most of the world as <strong>Daft Punk</strong>!</p>
<p>Apparently famed French electronic duo laid down delicious drumbeats in their studio while 'Ye slapped his ridiculously radical rhymes on top!</p>
<p>Sweeeeeet!</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Thomas described the madness that resulted from their mix. He revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It was very raw: [Kanye] was rapping – kind of screaming primally, actually. Kanye doesn’t give a fuck. He’s a good friend."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah-maazing!! We can't wait for Kanye's next album to drop so we can hear what it sounds like!!!</p>
<p>Famed director <strong>Michel Gondry</strong> heard their glorious love children already and his ears were impressed!!</p>
<p>He admitted:</p>
<blockquote><p>"One of them, I told him it sounded solid and powerful – I envisioned a cube when I heard it."</p></blockquote>
<p>Ha! We have no idea what that means, but we're totes <a href="http://perez.ly/10Yl4pi" target="_blank">excited</a> to find out!!</p>

There's just something about a man on a motorcycle that we can't resist! Especially when that man is Nicholas Hoult!
The X-Men actor traded in his blue fur for a leather jacket and a helmet as he rode off with our hearts on his new Harley Davidson in LA!

<p>There's just something about a man on a motorcycle that we can't resist! Especially when that man is <strong>Nicholas Hoult</strong>!</p>
<p>The <em>X-Men</em> actor traded in his blue fur for a leather jacket and a helmet as he rode off with our hearts on his new Harley Davidson in LA!</p>
<p>Ok, ok. Thanks to <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/bruce-willis/" target="_blank">Bruce Willis</a></strong> in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, we know it's not a motorcycle, it's a chopper. But does that really matter??</p>
<p>He could be riding a unicycle for all we care! As long as he looks like that while he's doing in, count us in! LOLz!!</p>
<p>We can't wait to see the sexy Beast back on the big screen when <em>X-Men: Days Of Future Past</em> hits theaters! We love us some Nicholas, even when he blue and furry! </p>
