<p>So much for <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/gwyneth-paltrow" target="_blank">Gwyneth Paltrow</a></strong>'s belief that her diet and health craziness is actually <a href="http://perezhilton.com/fitperez/2013-03-19-gwyneth-paltrow-thanks-her-diet-for-changing-her-marriage-to-chris-martin#.UU4bE1o6U0s" target="_blank">IMPROVING</a> her relationship with her husband!</p>
<p>In fact, it's apparently the opposite!</p>
<p>Not everyone has responded with fondness to the actress' revelations that she <a href="http://perezhilton.com/fitperez/2013-03-13-gwyneth-paltrow-food-kids-diets-starving-hungry-strict-awful-moderation#.UU4cl1o6U0s" target="_blank">bans</a> her children from eating gluten and carbohydrates, and while she seems comfortable dismissing any backlash as people just being jealous of her, her <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/coldplay" target="_blank">Coldplay</a></strong> frontman husband even agrees that she can come off like a bit of snob!</p>
<p>According to insiders:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Chris tells her she's too righteous sometimes and that she needs to think before she starts preaching. But he's the same. It's like they are out to save the world.  She's convinced people are just envious of her lifestyle and the fact that she's discovered how to live well.  Gwyneth gets herself in hot water as she can't help herself. She's a preacher over diet, exercise, meditation and how to raise kids - she thinks people want to hear about her glam lifestyle.  She's totally clueless about how much she annoys people."</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>So she really is  oblivious as to why people think it's ridiculous that her "<a href="http://perezhilton.com/cocoperez/2013-03-22-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-spring-essentials-450000#.UU4bB1o6U0s" target="_blank">spring essentials</a>," for instance, cost around $450,000 all-together?!</p>
<p>YEESH.</p>
<p>Time for a certain very GOOPy <a href="http://perez.ly/16Q8w84" target="_blank">space cadet</a> to join the rest of us back on planet Earth, please!</p>

<p>Well, no wonder <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong> is so bummed out about having to spend her <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-23-lindsay-lohan-furious-to-be-in-rehab-during-birthday" target="_blank">birthday</a> in rehab!</p>
<p>Hell, she'll probably be just as bummed for each one of the 90 days she's locked into a facility where she can't booze it up!</p>
<p>That's right!</p>
<p>Because even though drugs and alcohol have essentially destroyed any semblance of a life, let alone a career, that the hard-pAArtying starlet once had, she is still SO convinced that she doesn't have a substance abuse problem that mere HOURS after she plead no contest to her latest batch of probation violations, she was spotted at the bar of her hotel in Beverly Hills, knocking back multiple vodka sodas!</p>
<p>Furthermore, witnesses at the San Diego nightclub FLUXX saw LiLo and a friend arriving around midnight last night, and this time, she had some tricks up her sleeve!</p>
<p>Apparently, she sat in the VIP section in a Yankees hat and sweatshirt, drinking vodka on the rocks throughout the evening!  And get this: she insisted her drank be served from a glass carafe, as to avoid being photographed near any alcohol bottles!</p>
<p>What a clever little deviant, isn't she?!</p>
<p>But hey!  Whatevs!</p>
<p>All this just means that while she may have avoided <a href="http://perez.ly/14l5REa" target="_blank">jail</a> this time around, she'll end up there soon enough!</p>
<p>At this <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-20-what-can-be-done-to-save-lindsay-lohan" target="_blank">point</a>, we just hope it's not at the expense of anyone else's safety or well-being.</p>

<p>As if it weren't tragic enough that an unattended <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-ashley-greene-apartment-fire-dog-died-unattended-candle-three-injured-twilight-sad#.UU4WwVo6U0s" target="_blank">candle</a> in her West Hollywood condo started a raging <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-ashley-greene-apartment-fire-west-hollywood-dog-safe-ryan-phillippe#.UU4Wxlo6U0s" target="_blank">fire</a> that destroyed her belongings and took the life of one of her beloved dogs, it now appears that the damage was so bad that the <strong><em><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/twilight" target="_blank">Twilight</a></em></strong> starlet's living space will have to be COMPLETELY GUTTED...and four other units require work!</p>
<p>According to sources, all of the walls and flooring will need to be removed from what's left of the apartment!</p>
<p>And while the unit above Ashley's was the only one that needed to evacuate during the initial blaze, four other units were affected by moisture damage and will need repairs!</p>
<p>So unbelievably heartbreaking.  She's already been through so <a href="http://perez.ly/16Q5JMe" target="_blank">much</a>.</p>
<p>Hang in there, gurl!  </p>
<p>You're in our thoughts and prayers!</p>

<p>This guy just <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2011-04-08-gucci-mane-arrested-once-again-for-misdemeanor-battery-charges#.UU4OT1o6U0s" target="_blank">can't</a> keep it together, can he?!</p>
<p><strong>Gucci Mane</strong> has had an arrest warrant issued against him for a March 15th incident at an Atlanta nightclub, during which he allegedly beat a soldier over the head with a bottle, for which he needed ten stitches...and all because the poor guy wanted a picture with his favorite rapper!</p>
<p>The man, who only arrived back from serving in Afghanistan in October, reported to police that he was celebrating his birthday at Harlem Nights when he approached the security guard in front of the VIP section to ask for a photo.</p>
<p>As he explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I was speaking to the security guard, and Gucci Mane hit me in the head with a bottle.  And as I looked at him in the shock of why, one of his friends hit me in the side of my face." </p></blockquote>
<p>WTF?!   Seriously?!</p>
<p>We can't even BEGIN to understand how anything that went down would warrant such a ridiculous, violent response like that!</p>
<p>However, he'll be paying the piper soon, as Lt. <strong>Jeff Cantin</strong> of the Atlanta Police Department revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We do have an active warrant for Mr. Davis for aggravated assault. So I'm sure after he sees this, I'm sure he'll want to reach out and contact us."</p></blockquote>
<p>But hey!  Don't worry!</p>
<p>Even if he doesn't contact the fuzz, we imagine they'll be able to <a href="http://perez.ly/108v3rH" target="_blank">locate</a> him soon!</p>
<p>He can fall asleep during <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-23-gucci-mane-spring-breakers-sex-scene-asleep" target="_blank">ANYTHING</a>, after all!</p>

With the Tuesday release of much-anticipated third album, The 20/20 Experience, industry insiders were already predicting that the singer would sell 750,000 copies within its first week!

<p>HOLY Sh-t!</p>
<p>As if it weren't already an AWESOME <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-justin-timberlake-oscars-2014-host" target="_blank">week</a> to be <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/justin-timberlake" target="_blank">Justin Timberlake</a></strong>!</p>
<p>With the Tuesday release of much-anticipated third album, <em>The 20/20 Experience</em>, industry insiders were already predicting that the singer would sell 750,000 <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-20-justin-timberlake-solo-tour-2020-experience-album-sales#.UU4Gzlo6U0s" target="_blank">copies</a> within its first week!</p>
<p>Well, guess what?!  </p>
<p>It's not going to happen, folks!  Because in actuality, the number is going to reach much CLOSER to 850,000 to 900,000 copies!</p>
<p>Yeah.  EXACTLY why the 'Holy Sh-t' was warranted, RIGHT?!</p>
<p>NO ONE pulls these kind of <a href="http://perez.ly/TkLT24" target="_blank">numbers</a> anymore!</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this is enough indication for JT that he needs to announce those tour dates...and SOON!

<p>It's just LOVELY to see <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong> so clearly grateful that she once again managed to escape jail time in lieu of a much cushier, undeserved 90-day sentence in lock down rehab!</p>
<p>Oh, excuse us! </p>
<p>That was just an incredibly unrealistic fever dream!</p>
<p>Back to reality: Lindsay Lohan is obviously NOT the least bit appreciative of her miraculous <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-lindsay-lohan-no-charges-nyc-nightclub-brawl" target="_blank">good fortune</a>, and instead is whining to the few people who still listen to her nonsense that she won't be able to properly celebrate her 27th birthday in July...because she'll be in treatment by then!</p>
<p>As we all know, the troubled actress will be waiting until the end of the month and a half she has to enroll in a facility, so she has time to shoot a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-lindsay-lohan-will-film-anger-management-alongside-charlie-sheen-before-rehab" target="_blank">stint</a> on <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/charlie-sheen" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen</a></strong>'s <em>Anger Management</em> and hang out in <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-22-lindsay-lohan-unsure-about-rehab-location-planning-tv-shoot-trip-to-brazil" target="_blank">Brazil</a>!  But no matter how she tries to swing it, her July 2nd birthday will definitely be spent with sober coaches and security instead of her usual slew of enablers!</p>
<p>Which TOTALLY ruins the big NYC bash she was planning to throw herself, you guys!</p>
<p>Isn't everything just the <a href="http://perez.ly/16PXe3D" target="_blank">WORST</a>?!</p>
<p>Oh wait!  No it's not!</p>
<p>BECAUSE SHE'S NOT IN JAIL.</p>
<p>Now excuse us while we play her the world's smallest violin!  </p>
