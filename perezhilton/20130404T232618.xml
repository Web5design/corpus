<p><em>Girls</em> creator <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/lena-dunham" target="_blank">Lena Dunham</a></strong> has always been very honest about her feelings. As “one of the voices of her generation,” she has never shied away from saying, well, what a lot of us are thinking.</p>
<p>That being said, it may come as no surprise that she decided to speak out against <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/chris-brown#.UV3jRKWTNUQ" target="_blank">Chris Brown</a></strong> for a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-01-23-lena-dunham-rihanna-chris-brown-relationship-heart-crack#.UV3eR6sa_d4" target="_blank">second</a> time in a recent interview for <em>GQ UK</em>.</p>
<p>When asked about criticisms received for <em>Girls</em>’ second season, the talented writer likened the differences of opinion to a difference in morals:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You know people who are like, ‘It’s just not my thing.’ Or perhaps their morals don’t jibe with my morals, you know, the same way I feel about Chris Brown — it’s not for me, I don’t like your attitude and you are not someone I want to take in.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She continued: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Though, admittedly, I’ve never beaten any of my lovers in a car while heading [to] the Grammys, so maybe I’m just not ‘with it’ or something.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Loves it! You <a href="http://perez.ly/10A3Y0V" target="_blank">tell</a> ‘em, girl!</p>

<p>We lost a legend today. The renowned film critic <strong>Roger Ebert</strong> <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-04-roger-ebert-dead-passes-away-70#.UV3sbKWTNUQ" target="_blank">passed</a> after an arduous battle with cancer. And yet, his influence in film and criticism remains as visible as it ever has been.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/barack-obama" target="_blank">President Obama</a></strong> released a statement upon the announcement of Roger's death, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>"<strong>Michelle</strong> and I are saddened to hear about the passing of Roger Ebert. For a generation of Americans - and especially Chicagoans - Roger was the movies. When he didn’t like a film, he was honest; when he did, he was effusive - capturing the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical. Even amidst his own battles with cancer, Roger was as productive as he was resilient - continuing to share his passion and perspective with the world. The movies won’t be the same without Roger, and our thoughts and prayers are with Chaz and the rest of the Ebert family."</p></blockquote>
<p>"Roger was the movies." It could not have been put more perfectly.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, friend. We'll see ya at the movies. :(</p>

Amanda Bynes acting odd?! Nah, it must have been her redheaded impostor!
It seems that recently transformed Mz. Bynes' behavior is getting MORE outrageous by the day, as just last week girl apparently RAN OUT of BLOW &#8212; a Manhattan blowdry bar &#8212; after her credit card was DECLINED&#8230;
AND she allegedly STOLE a can of hairspray!!!

<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/amanda-bynes/" target="_blank">Amanda Bynes</a></strong> acting odd?! Nah, it must have been her redheaded <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-03-amanda-bynes-redhead-impostor-tweet-delete-nyc#.UV3BoatRi6Y" target="_blank">impostor</a>!</p>
<p>It seems that recently <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-amanda-bynes-twitter-picture-pierced-cheeks-sunglasses#.UV3IsqtRi6Y" target="_blank">transformed</a> Mz. Bynes' behavior is getting MORE <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-02-amanda-bynes-suspended-license-hearing-court-absence" target="_blank">outrageous</a> by the day, as just last week girl apparently RAN OUT of BLOW -- a Manhattan blowdry bar -- after her credit card was DECLINED...</p>
<p>AND she allegedly STOLE a can of hairspray!!!</p>
<p>Well she was IN <em>Hairspray</em>... perhaps she thought it was movie merch that she could take??</p>
<p>Blow's GM shares: </p>
<blockquote><p>"She had bad extensions and we were working around her sunglasses and extensions. We gave her a great blowout. We ran her credit card twice and it was declined. She was also trying to buy some hairspray too. Then she bolted on us, and took the hairspray with her!"</p></blockquote>
<p>Umm... WHAT?! </p>
<p>AND Amanda reportedly refused to take off her sunglasses during the blowdry process, and spent an AGE in the bathroom before she even made it to the hairdressing chair! </p>
<p>You'd think after this questionable -- not to mention ILLEGAL -- behavior, Amanda would never show her face at the hairstyling establishment again, but NOPE! She RETURNED to the scene of the crime two days later and requested an appointment! </p>
<p>Sadly, Blow was too full to accommodate her request. Also, they probably knew she couldn't pay for it.</p>
<p>And while this whole situation could be considered funny, it actually just makes us really sad because it's just further evidence that Amanda needs professional help to sort out her obviously <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-01-amanda-bynes-twitter-weird-nikki-blonsky-hate-feud" target="_blank">cluttered</a> and confused headspace.</p>
<p>We hope you get over whatever it is that's making you act so <a href="http://perez.ly/14HlfKX" target="_blank">strangely</a>, ladyfriend! </p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-04-amanda-bynes-runs-out-on-bill-blow-nyc-credit-card-declined-steals-hairspray/feed/</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Game Of Throne's Evil Queen Cersei Is BROKE!</title><link>http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-04-lena-heady-queen-cersei-game-of-thrones-broke-divorce-tax-refund</link><comments>http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-04-lena-heady-queen-cersei-game-of-thrones-broke-divorce-tax-refund#respond</comments><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2013 21:15:38 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Perez Hilton</dc:creator>

<p>But what about all that Lannister gold?! </p>
<p>Even though <strong>Lena Heady</strong> portrays a MAIN character in one of the most <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-02-game-of-thrones-hbo-renewed-for-fourth-season" target="_blank">popular</a> shows on television, it seems girl is FLAT BROKE because of her 2012 <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-07-27-game-of-thrones-lena-headey-divorce#.UV2sNqtRi6Y" target="_blank">divorce</a> from husband, <strong>Peter Loughran</strong>!!</p>
<p>And NOW, Peter is apparently requesting <del>Queen Cersei</del> Lena give him half of their $46,000 2011 tax refund ASAP...</p>
<p>But girl reportedly NEEDS the refund to survive, as she is living off of credit until she receives acting income from <em>Game Of Thrones</em>!</p>
<p>Lena is supposedly willing to give Peter $6000 to cover his living expenses, but wants the rest to go into a joint account that requires BOTH of their signatures for access.</p>
<p>Hmmmm!</p>
<p>Well, Lena could always <a href="http://perez.ly/14H95Sg" target="_blank">borrow</a> a thing or two from her GOT character and simply poison her ex instead! </p>
<p>Obvi we KID. Kinda.

<p>The perfect place! ;)</p>
<p>Five years after tying the knot, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/beyonce/" target="_blank">Beyoncé</a></strong> and her king <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jay-z/" target="_blank">Jay-Z</a></strong> are spending their anniversary together in Cuba this year, basking in the rich culture and sunlight of Havana!! </p>
<p>Wednesday night the lovers dined at La Guarida, an <em>extremely</em> popular restaurant, famous for its scene in <em>Strawberry and Chocolate</em>. </p>
<p>Jay and Bey caused such a commotion with their presence that police had to actually step in and tell the crowds to back the f*ck OFF! </p>
<p>Once settled, the royal couple chowed down on creole favorites including fish, chicken, black beans and rice while photos of past celebrity clientele like <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jack-nicholson/" target="_blank">Jack Nicholson</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/will-smith/" target="_blank">Will Smith</a></strong> adorned the walls. </p>
<p>But their meal wasn't done with fan-love just yet. Baby Beys started buzzing outside, cheering her name so loud and so much, she walked out onto the balcony to wave at the fans, totally making their lives complete. </p>
<p>Waitress <strong>Silvia Fernandez</strong> said of her presence: </p>
<blockquote><p>"She was beautiful, without a drop of makeup, very natural. What happened with the people was incredible."</p></blockquote>
<p>Not surprising, Jay and Bey declined to speak to the <a href="http://perez.ly/10zOMRn" target="_blank">media</a>, but later spent their stay touring colonial Old Havana on Thursday. They were last seen entering a restaurant with a rooftop terrace and a view of the harbor. </p>
<p>They will also be seen in all our dreams tonight. As they are every night. </p>
<p>HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, YOU TWO!!! xoxo</p>
