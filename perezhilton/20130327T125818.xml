<p>The Hemsworth clan is officially a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood!</p>
<p><strong>Luke Hemsworth</strong>, older brother of <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/chris-hemsworth/" target="_blank">Chris</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/liam-hemsworth/" target="_blank">Liam</a></strong>, will be making his feature film debut in <strong>John V. Soto</strong>'s <em>The Reckoning</em>. He will star alongside <strong>Jonathan LaPaglia</strong> in a murder mystery that begins shooting late April.</p>
<p>This wont be his first acting stint, as Luke has already been featured in several TV shows such as <em>Last Man Standing</em> and <em>Neighbours</em>, but this will be his first time on the big screen!</p>
<p>How exciting!</p>
<p>It might take him a little while before he catches up with Thor and Gale Hawthorne, but this definitely a step in the right direction! </p>
<p>We're definitely not complaining about another Hemsworth breaking onto the scene, and hopefully this is the <a href="http://perez.ly/ZVbjsy" target="_blank">beginning</a> of big things to come!</p>
<p>Good luck, Luke! </p>

<p>We have some FANTASTIC <em>Ender's Game</em> news for all you nerds out there!! (Don't worry, we're nerds too!)</p>
<p>First and foremost, did you see the first official <em>Ender's Game</em> poster? If not, you must've scrolled to the story too fast because it's right there (above) for your pleasure!! It's the Battle Room – the zero-gravity training ground where recruits <a href="http://perez.ly/16WqhTb" target="_blank">learn</a> to fight aliens!!</p>
<p>The director described it like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the high school football field, only it’s in three dimensions. It’s the size of a football field in all directions: up, down, left, right. And the idea is teams jump out from opposite ends of this amazing space and play this amazing game of 3D paintball, almost.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds fab to us!</p>
<p>SECONDLY, did you hear when we're getting the first trailer?? Right before the new <em>Star Trek</em>! How perfect is that??</p>
<p>This is what <strong>Roberto Orci</strong> (<em>Star Trek</em>'s writer) tweeted about it:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>“@<a href="https://twitter.com/fleetadmiralj">fleetadmiralj</a>: @<a href="https://twitter.com/boborci">boborci</a> when are we getting a trailer? Star trek?” Yup!</p>
<p>&mdash; roberto orci (@boborci) <a href="https://twitter.com/boborci/status/316058243631820800">March 25, 2013</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That's not too far at all!!</p>
<p>We just hope we get some more awesome posters and screenshots before then! If not, we just might lose our damn minds! LOLz!</p>
