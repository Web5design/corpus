<p>Beating the <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-13-taylor-swift-makes-more-concert-ticket-sales-john-mayer-one-direction-jonas-brothers-ex-boyfriends" target="_blank">boys</a> is REALLY paying off for <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/taylor-swift/" target="_blank">Taylor Swift</a></strong>! </p>
<p>We know Tay Tay's wallet is stacked thanks to her MASSIVE <em>Red</em> tour tickets sales, however now we have a hint of just HOW loaded she is. </p>
<p>Swifty is already <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-10-26-taylor-swift-still-buying-hyannis-port-house-conor-kennedy-break-up-split" target="_blank">neighbors </a>with the Kennedys, but the <em>22</em> songstress is once again searching for a mansion to call her own and this time Taylor is looking at a AHmazing Rhode Island property with an GIANT price tag. </p>
<p>The Harkness House, with more than 11,000 square on 5.23 acres of property, is going for an upwards of $20 million. </p>
<p>And we were impressed by <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/christina-aguilera/" target="_blank">Christina Aguilera</a></strong>'s new $10 million <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-17-christina-aguilera-10-million-dollar-mansion-mulholland-estates" target="_blank">mansion</a>! HA!</p>
<p>Tay brought her friends and fam to look at the property on Monday and reportedly fell in love!!! </p>
<p>We always knew she was a smart girl! </p>
<p>Fame might not be forever, but real estate <a href="http://perez.ly/XJ2HFY" target="_blank">investments</a> ALWAYS pay off. </p>
<p>Well... fingers crossed anyways!</p>

<p>It's been over a year since <em>21 Jump Street</em> blew us away with it's HIGHlarity, but <strong>20th Century Fox</strong> just confirmed we're finally getting a sequel!</p>
<p>The gloriously godlike <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/channing-tatum/" target="_blank">Channing Tatum</a></strong> plans to reprise his role alongside partner <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jonah-hill/" target="_blank">Jonah Hill</a></strong> as two misfit cops who infiltrate a high school from the inside out!!</p>
<p>At 32 and 29 respectively, these two marvelous men are no spring chickens! Maybe they should go undercover as grad students this time, LOLz!!</p>
<p>Hopefully the delicious <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/dave-franco/" target="_blank">Dave Franco</a></strong>, who played a drug dealer in the first film, will return, too!!</p>
<p>The <em>21 Jump Street</em> sequel shoots this summer and should be ready in time for a 2014 <a href="http://perez.ly/XIUT74" target="_blank">release</a>!</p>

<p>When we think of our dream wedding, a circus theme is probably not the first thing that pops into our heads...But hey, it could work! </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/bruno-mars/#.UXBe7Sugn48" target="_blank">Bruno Mars</a></strong>, on the other hand, already has his perfect circus wedding all planned out! Not only does the singer want to be surrounded by circus-esque things on his special day, but he also wants to be a part of a full circus performance!!</p>
<p>The singer proudly proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m doing pyrotechnics at my wedding and I’m gonna learn gymnastics, juggling and unicycling. It’ll probably be at the top of a mountain.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Can't wait to see that, Bruno!! Ha! </p>
<p>And if that isn’t crazy enough, instead of a traditional wedding song Bruno would rather opt for the <em>Rocky</em> theme song, “Eye of the Tiger”. Can't say that's all too surprising--if you're going to have an unconventional wedding, why not rock<del>y</del> an unconventional song?? </p>
<p>Well that should be an different, but FUN, wedding! Maybe he'll even write a circus-themed album for the <a href="http://perez.ly/115YICm" target="_blank">occasion</a>!! </p>
<p>We hope his future bride is as circus-crazed as he is, LOLz!!</p>

<p>Slow down, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/meiko/" target="_blank">Meiko</a></strong>! We can hardly keep up with you!</p>
<p>Just yesterday, the LA singer gave us an EXCLUSIVE first listen to her awesome <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-04-17-meiko-new-single-bad-things-exclusive-listen#.UXBej6W_1AQ" target="_blank">new</a> single <em>Bad Things</em>! But if that wasn't enough to satisfy your eardrums, she posted a video of herself doing an acoustic version of the song as well!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the sweet performance (above)!</p>
<p>We're not sure which one we like better, because they're both pretty amazing, but we're always impressed when someone is able to still sound so good without all of the fancy bells and whistles!</p>
<p>What about U guys?? Which version do U prefer?
