<p>Well… um…</p>
<p>You know what? We’re just going to come out and say it – what the hell happened in last night’s <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Glee/" target="_blank"><strong><em>Glee</em></strong></a>? </p>
<p>No, no. There was no major plot twist that boggled our minds or some truth bomb that changed the course of the entire season. There was, however, <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Chord-Overstreet/" target="_blank"><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a> in puffy sleeves, <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Lea-Michele/" target="_blank"><strong>Lea Michele</strong></a> running and slow motion, and A LOT of tiny, neon booty shorts.</p>
<p>Yeah, last night’s <em>Glee</em> was more of what you would probably call a jukebox episode, one more about the music than developing any kind of plot. So, in all honesty, you didn’t miss too much – except for the incomparable <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Darren-Criss/" target="_blank"><strong>Darren Criss</strong></a> crooning at the piano (possibly live?) and the first ever performance of the <strong>Spice Girls</strong>!</p>
<p>Which is still  a lot to miss in our estimation, but we’re guilty of being freakin’ hardcore Gleeks! So, maybe you shouldn’t go by us.</p>
<p>Still, we’ll catch you up on what did happen, if for nothing more than the chuckles and the smiles!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! NOTHING TO CRAY CRAY, BUT STILL WORTH AVOIDING IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE EPISODE UNTARNISHED! BE GONE WITH YOU IF YOU DON’T WANT TO KNOW!<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Sorry, Blaine +  Sam = Not Happening</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we can hear your sighs from here, Blam fans. But honestly, did you really think that <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Ryan-Murphy/" target="_blank"><strong>Ryan Murphy</strong></a> was going to go there? Okay, maybe you did (it has seemed like tumblr has been writing the last few episodes), but the line had to be drawn somewhere. Why it had to be here and not Artie scoring with yet another one of the Glee chicks… but we digress.</p>
<p>With Schue giving Finn the boot last week and now falling ill himself, the Glee kids are without a leader, so Sam and Blaine decide to take up the reigns.  They decide to have the group own up to their musical guilty pleasures, which includes everyone from <strong>Wham</strong> to <strong>Barry Manilow</strong> to the Spice Girls – yeah, someone’s been weeding through their parent’s CD collection. (Kids, a CD is what music came on BEFORE the Internet and iTunes.)</p>
<p>While all of this is delightfully entertaining, it also is lending itself to have Blaine admit he has feelings for Sam, which he has great difficulty doing. In an attempt to share his true feelings, he sits down at the piano to sing the <strong>Phil Collins</strong> classic <em>Against All Odds</em>. Maybe that didn’t make Sam fall in love with him, BUT IT SURE GOT OUR HEART RACING!!! REPEAT!! REWIND!!! PAUSE AND SWOON!!!</p>
<p>By episodes end, Sam says what Blaine can’t and admits that he knows he has feelings for him.  So, why go through all this trouble? Duh! Oh wait, we actually don’t really know… for the sake of the music, we guess? Oh no wait, we know now. Getting it out in the open makes it easier for Blaine to move on from it… but not completely, because Sam likes the attention.  So, there’s that.</p>
<p><strong>Brody’s Lies CREEEEEEP Up On Him, As Rachel Learns The Truth</strong></p>
<p>Remember last week when Finn showed up in New York to defend Rachel’s honor against Brody Bigolo, Male Gigolo? Yeah, no one felt the need to tell Rachel anything about it. Instead, at the beginning of the episode, she is quite literally trampsing around, saying “why me?!” after Brody breaks up with her for no reason.</p>
<p>Finally, Santana gets around to telling her Lima bud the sitch and Rachel furiously confronts Brody about his night job. In turn, he accuses her of never being honest about their relationship and lying about sleeping with Finn on Valentine’s Day (wait, did we miss something? We thought she was totally upfront about that!).  Anyway, Rachel admits Brody was right – she was using him, first to make Finn jealous and then to ease her own breaking heart. So, with nothing left for either of them, they part ways via Radiohead’s Creep (no sh*t, Thom Yorke? You say yay?!) and Rachel determines its time to start anew, starting with preparing for her Funny Girl audition… and possibly dating older men. </p>
<p><strong>E’rebody In The Club Getting Ditsy</strong></p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jake is beat down (pun intended) by his song choices from the week, which include <a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/Chris-Brown/" target="_blank"><strong>Chris Brown</strong></a> and then <strong>Bobby Brown</strong>, Kitty decides to be nicer to fellow Glee clubs members (something we thought was established last week when they had that lower classmen pow-wow) and Sugar apparently has dissolved in water somewhere, because not only is she nowhere to be seen, but now Artie has his eyes on Kitty Kat. </p>
<p>And  none for <del>Gretchen Wieners</del> Tina Cohen Chang!</p>
<p>Next week… OH YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING US! ANOTHER THREE WEEK HIATUS! NOT FAIR!!!! </p>

<p>AHHH!  This would be so HOT!</p>
<p>How have we not seen the potential AWEsomeness that would be <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kesha/" target="_blank">Kesha</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/pitbull/" target="_blank">Pitbull</a></strong> getting intimate?! </p>
<p>She IS an animal <a href="http://perezhilton.com/teddyhilton/2013-03-20-kesha-takes-animal-welfare-rights-so-seriously" target="_blank">lover</a>, and you know's he's a hAArd <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-15-christina-aguilera-pitbull-feel-this-moment-music-video" target="_blank">pAArtying</a>, socially conscious musician... or so his latest album title might suggest (<em>Global Warming</em>, anyone?)!</p>
<p>And hey, it COULD happen, as the equally amazeballz artists recently engaged in an adorable flirtation via Twitter! And wait, did they just randomly set up plans to hit the road together?!  WHAAAT! </p>
<p>It all began when Pitbull tweeted at Kesha about the upcoming <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kids-choice-awards/" target="_blank">Kids Choice Awards</a></strong>, and after some cute exchanges that included a "pants off dance off" challenge, it seems fans of each artist interpreted the pair's conversation as a mutual invitation to TOUR together this summer! </p>
<p>Which would be a KILLER live, collaborative production for sure! And you KNOW they would be tour <a href="http://perez.ly/13inRzx" target="_blank">buddies</a> with <a href="http://perez.ly/YEOKLC" target="_blank">benefits</a>! </p>
<p>Interpret Kesha and Pitbull's sweet tweets for yourself <strong>...AFTER THE JUMP!!!</strong></p>

<p>Ahhh, wouldn’t this be wonderful??</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/justin-timberlake#.UUxkBaWTNUQ" target="_blank">Justin Timberlake</a></strong> is everywhere these days -- not that we’re complaining!! With the release of his new album, <strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/saturday-night-live" target="_blank">SNL</a></em></strong> performances, and what <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jimmy-fallon" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> dubbed “Timberweek,” the <em>Suit & Tie</em> singer has been hitting airwaves big time!</p>
<p>Next stop? The <strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/oscars#.UUxkCKWTNUQ" target="_blank">Oscars</a></em></strong>. Well, maybe!</p>
<p>Apparently Justin is already in talks to host the <em>86th Academy Awards</em> in 2014. A source revealed to the National Enquirer: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Getting Justin to host would now be a huge coup for the Oscars. He’d been considered before, but they always thought he was too young and not seasoned enough.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But thanks to his success as <em>SNL</em> host, things may have changed:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Now, he’s the frontrunner for the job — after showing he knows how to sing, dance, host, and improvise on the spot."</p></blockquote>
<p>This newlywed is definitely a better choice than this year’s host <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/seth-macfarlane#.UUxkDKWTNUQ" target="_blank">Seth MacFarlane</a></strong>, but an insider close to Justin revealed that these rumors are “premature and ridiculous.”</p>
<p>We're not entirely sure how reliable this <a href="http://perez.ly/lgTrQg" target="_blank">information</a> is and are inclined to believe this is just speculation. But who are we kidding? Justin as Oscar Host would make our year! May the Oscar force be with you, JT!</p>

<p>Well, this is an interesting piece of late night gossip! </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jimmy-fallon/" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> is more than likely <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-20-jimmy-fallon-jay-leno-howard-stern-tonight-show-nyc-late-night-move-host-cities" target="_blank">replacing </a><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/jay-leno/" target="_blank">Jay Leno</a></strong> on <em>Tonight Show</em>, but who could warm Jimmy's <em>Late Night</em> seat when he leaves?</p>
<p><strong>Seth Meyers</strong>, that's who!</p>
<p>The <strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/saturday-night-live/" target="_blank">Saturday Night Live</a></em></strong> comedian could become the next late night talk show host and Jimmy and <em>SNL</em> creator, <strong>Lorne Michaels</strong>, will do WHATEVER IT TAKES to get Seth the gig! </p>
<p>A source dished:  </p>
<blockquote><p>“Lorne Michaels wants Seth to take over from Fallon. It would be perfect for him. Tina Fey’s name had also come up, but she has said she was too busy to do it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He has had a little bit of hosting experience on <em>Live With Kelly</em>, but he was <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-07-06-seth-meyers-kelly-ripa-live-co-host-job" target="_blank">beat</a> out to replace <strong>Regis Philbin</strong> by <strong>Michael Strahan</strong>.</p>
<p>Seth obviously has the <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-10-08-big-bird-saturday-night-live-weekend-update" target="_blank">comedic </a>timing for it. Hopefully that is that enough to convince NBC execs!</p>
<p>If you're good <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-01-amy-poehler-seth-meyers-watch-what-happen-live-video" target="_blank">enough</a> for Jimmy and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/amy-poehler/" target="_blank">Amy Poehler</a></strong>, than you're good enough for us!</p>
<p>We're <a href="http://perez.ly/16Nmurw" target="_blank">rooting</a> for you, Seth! </p>

<p>Another contestant has been sent packing!</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/american-idol/" target="_blank">American Idol</a></em></strong> is trimming the fat and sending <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-08-american-idol-season-12-top-ten-contestants-meet" target="_blank">hopeful</a> singers on their way home.</p>
<p>After performances of <strong>The Beatles</strong> greatest hits, some contestants needed major <em>Help!</em> from voters, but it didn’t happen for all.</p>
<p>The bottom three with the least votes from fans were <strong>Amber Holcomb</strong>, <strong>Devin Velez</strong> and <strong>Paul Jolley</strong> after shaky performances, but only one would see their run end last night.</p>
<p>So who won’t be fighting for the <em>American Idol</em> crown?</p>
<p>Paul Jolley!</p>
<p>After a rough performance and a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-nicki-minaj-american-idol-diss-forgettable-contestant-left-in-tears" target="_blank">lashing</a> from <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/nicki-minaj/" target="_blank">Nicki Minaj</a></strong>, Paul couldn’t cut it.</p>
<p>But, he should know it isn’t about winning <em>Idol</em> that matters!</p>
<p>Plenty of losers have gone on to have major careers including <strong>Jessica Sanchez</strong> who came in second place last season.</p>
<p>The little starlet with the big voice came back to perform last night with the help of <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/neyo/" target="_blank">Ne-Yo</a></strong>!</p>
<p>And she <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-jessica-sanchez-neyo-tonight-american-idol-ryan-seacrest#.UUxoWxl5j6Y" target="_blank">rocked</a> the stage like a seasoned pro!</p>
<p>With a hot song and plenty of attitude, we know this won’t be the last we see of this <em>Idol</em>.</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out her performance (above)!

<p>While the actress has been busy sitting down to talk about her new movie with <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/david-letterman" target="_blank">David Letterman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/jimmy-fallon" target="_blank">Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> this week, she's ALSO embraced it as an opportunity to <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-selena-gomez-david-letterman-cry-justin-bieber-joking-laugh#.UUxpwlo6U0s" target="_blank">make</a> - or <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-20-selena-gomez-jimmy-fallon-late-night-justin-bieber-cheating-mario-kart-love-song-cheating-video#.UUxpblo6U0s" target="_blank">SING</a> - some pretty HIGHlarious, well-deserved digs at her ex-boyfriend <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong>'s cheating ways!</p>
<p>And last night, when she and co-star <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/vanessa-hudgens" target="_blank">Vanessa Hudgens</a></strong> stopped by <em><strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/chelsea-lately" target="_blank">Chelsea</a></strong> Lately</em>, there was no exception of shade thrown!</p>
<p>During the interview, the talk show hostess inquired if our beloved Selenita was enjoying her new-found status as single, and she IMMEDIATELY replied:</p>
<p>"Yes, I <em>really</em> am."</p>
<p>Good!  Well, for HER anyway!</p>
<p>Not to much for him!</p>
<p>But we think Chelsea was right in her <a href="http://perez.ly/1058W5j" target="_blank">sentiment</a> that she's still only 20 years old, and if a love interest is giving you the amount of grief Justin was speculated to have bestowed on her, then she's better off enjoying her youth and finding someone who treats her the way she deserves to be!</p>
<p>Glad you're feeling good, gurl!  Keep it up!</p>

It might be time to really focus on the task at hand, Mizz Lindsay Lohan.

<p>Oh, Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay...</p>
<p>It might be time to really focus on the task at hand, Mizz <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan/" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, you have 45 days to report to <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-lindsay-lohan-court-trial-lying-to-the-cops-march-2013-monday" target="_blank">rehab</a>, but that doesn’t mean you should leave your decision about your rehab location to day 45!</p>
<p>But of course, the lady who flies into her court appearances at the last minute on a private jet is the same lady who hasn’t decided yet what to do about the whole inconvenient rehab sitch.</p>
<p>Her attorney, <strong>Mark Heller</strong>, revealed their <a href="http://perez.ly/104ZtLh" target="_blank">lack</a> of deets on her future plans. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We haven't figured it out yet. We are working on that now. We are considering whether it will be in New York. We are not sure yet.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, are we really that surprised?</p>
<p>Seriously, it makes sense considering she might get sidetracked with the inneresting plans she DOES have.</p>
<p>LiLo is going to be busy working with <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/charlie-sheen/" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen</a></strong> on <em>Anger Management</em> and then she’s considering a trip to Brazil.</p>
<p>Say what?!</p>
<p>Our redheaded queen of legal dramz is <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-lindsay-lohan-will-film-anger-management-alongside-charlie-sheen-before-rehab#.UUxc2xl5j6Y" target="_blank">carrying</a> on as usual, acting like she's free as a bird as a source revealed the questionable decision:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Lindsay’s pre-rehab plan? A week with Charlie Sheen in LA, then she wants to go to Brazil. I kid you not.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeeeaaahh, Brazil before rehab?</p>
<p>Is this like one last <a href="http://perez.ly/13ibp2C" target="_blank">celebration</a>?</p>
<p>We’re pretty sure that’s not how you should prepare to get clean and under control!</p>

<p>Talk about a reunion special! Shiz! </p>
<p><strong>Mary Tyler Moore</strong>, <strong>Valerie Harper</strong>, and <strong>Cloris Leachman</strong> will once again act for the camera alongside <strong>Betty White</strong> and <strong>Georgia Engel</strong> in a <em>Hot in Cleveland</em> episode taping on April 5. </p>
<p>With all of the gals of <em>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</em> together again (the first since 1977), this is going to be an EPIC tv event fans won't wanna miss! </p>
<p>We hear the episode will revolve around GLOB -- The Gorgeous Ladies of Bowling AKA the name of their pin-busting team. Apparently it's a reunion of GLOB as the bowling team had a falling-out after their championship season exploded their egos (ha, we see what they did there).</p>
<p>No word yet on when this special episode will air, but we do know their summer <a href="http://perez.ly/104ZxuA" target="_blank">season</a> kicks off June 19 with a LIVE episode (woo hoo)! </p>
<p>FUN FACT: This will actually be MTM's second time on the show, as she once played Elka's (Betty White) cellmate in Season 2!</p>
<p>P.S. If you've been wondering how Valerie's been dealing with brain cancer, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/fitperez/2013-03-12-valerie-harper-is-living-her-life-very-normally-after-being-diagnosed-with-terminal-brain-cancer" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a></strong>! </p>
