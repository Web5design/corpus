<p><em>Glee</em> star <strong>Cory Monteith</strong> has checked into rehab to treat substance addiction, his publicist revealed Sunday night. It is unclear what substances he is being treated for.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is not an April Fool's joke!</p>
<p>A rep for <strong>Lea Michele</strong>'s boyfriend says:</p>
<blockquote><p>"[Moteith] has voluntarily admitted himself to a treatment facility for<strong> substance addiction</strong>. He graciously asks for your respect and privacy as he takes the necessary steps towards recovery."</p></blockquote>
<p>This news is truly sad and shocking, as there have been no reports of unprofessional behavior or hard partying from Monteith.</p>
<p>Cory, 30 years old, has been open about his struggles with addiction in the past and previously checking in to rehab at 19.</p>
<p>"I don't want kids to think it's okay to drop out of school and get high, and they'll be famous actors, too," Monteith <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20687046,00.html" target="_blank">said in 2011</a>. "But for those people who might give up: Get real about what you want and go after it."</p>
<p>Our heart goes out to Monteith and we wish him a speedy recovery as he deals with his issues. </p>

<p>Well, well, well...</p>
<p>It looks as though the <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2012-05-23-gi-joe-retaliation-paramount-bruce-willis-channing-tatum-pushed-back-titanic-3d-james-cameron" target="_blank">delayed</a> <em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</em> was worth the almost-year-long wait, after the studio pulled it from its original summer 2012 release to warrant a 3D conversion!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/dwayne-the-rock-johnson" target="_blank">The Rock</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/channing-tatum" target="_blank">Channing Tatum</a></strong>-starring action sequel made its much-anticipated debut this weekend at the TOP of the box office, pulling in $41.2 million between Friday and today...and $51.7 million if you include Thursday night premieres!</p>
<p>And if you include the overseas figures, we're talking $132 million...the <em>biggest</em> worldwide opener of 2013!</p>
<p>Not too shabby, right?!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for <em>The Host</em>, which didn't come close to competing with the weeks-old <em>Oz The Great and Powerful</em>!</p>
<p><strong>Stephenie Meyer</strong>'s sci-fi version of <em><strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/twilight" target="_blank">Twilight</a></strong></em> made a weak $11, placing it at #6 in the box office top ten!</p>
<p>And despite her critically-panned <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-29-kim-kardashian-tyler-perry-temptation-review-negative-critics" target="_blank">performance</a>, <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/kim-kardashian" target="_blank">Kim Kardashian</a></strong> seemed to do just fine in the numbers with her appearance in <em><strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/tyler-perry" target="_blank">Tyler Perry</a></strong>'s Temptation</em>, which came in third and made $22.3 million!</p>
<p>But check out the full list of the weekend's top <a href="http://perez.ly/YVVBRq" target="_blank">movies</a>...<strong>AFTER THE JUMP</strong>!!!</p>
<blockquote><p><em>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</em>, $41.2 million<br />
    <em>The Croods</em>, $26.5 million<br />
    <em>Tyler Perry's Temptation</em>, $22.3 million<br />
    <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em>, $14 million<br />
    <em>Oz the Great and Powerful</em>, $11.6 million<br />
    <em>The Host</em>, $11 million<br />
    <em>The Call</em>, $4.8 million<br />
    <em>Admission</em>, $3.3 million<br />
    <em>Spring Breakers</em>, $2.8 million<br />

<p>It's official:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/gwyneth-paltrow" target="_blank">Gwyneth Paltrow</a></strong> doesn't want ANYONE in her family to get what they want!</p>
<p>She has almost ENTIRELY <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-03-29-gwyneth-paltrow-allows-her-kids-to-cheat-on-their-low-carb-gluten-free-diet-once-a-week" target="_blank">banned</a> her children from eating gluten or carbohydrates, and now, she won't even let her husband <strong>Chris Martin</strong> buy his band a HOUSE!</p>
<p>According to sources, the <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/coldplay" target="_blank">Coldplay</a></strong> frontman recently went into escrow on a 6,000 square-foot, six-bedroom property in Brentwood, California, for a little below $4 million, with the idea being that he and his bandmates could live there and record new music!  Apparently, the band even swung by and performed a mini-concert together to make sure the acoustics were what they were looking for!</p>
<p>And they WERE...until someone's very <a href="http://perezhilton.com/cocoperez/2013-03-22-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-spring-essentials-450000" target="_blank">GOOP</a>-tastic wife got herself involved, decided that the inspection report on the house was not up to par, and demanded that her husband CANCEL the deal!</p>
<p>YEESH!</p>
<p>So apparently, Gwyneth isn't ONLY an expert in child-rearing, nutrition, and spiritual wellness, she ALSO is a skilled ANALYST of property inspection reports!</p>
<p>But hey!  Maybe she did actually save him some costly <a href="http://perez.ly/10rcJKp" target="_blank">complications</a> that could arise in the future!</p>
<p>Or MAYBE she's just quickly becoming a serious '<strong>Yoko</strong> Factor' for Coldplay!</p>
<p>Only time will tell!</p>

<p>What a WONDERFUL early-Easter present this must have been!</p>
<p><strong>Mekhi Phifer</strong>, who has appeared on both <em>ER</em> and <em>Torchwood: Miracle Day</em>, married his fiance, <strong>Reshelet Barnes</strong>, yesterday afternoon at the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills!</p>
<p>And from what we gather, it was an absolutely STUNNING ceremony, held on an outdoor terrace with 100 of the couple's family and friends watching on!</p>
<p>According to eyewitness, Mekhi's son walked down the aisle with the family's chihuahua on a leash, while the groom wore a white suit and took his spot under an alter of yellow flowers, while <em>Ribbon in the Sky</em> by <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> played!</p>
<p>But it was the bride herself who rightfully stole the show, as sources continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>"When she made her entrance into the courtyard, Mekhi was completely overcome with emotion and you could tell she took his breath away. He had to wipe tears from his eyes for several minutes."</p></blockquote>
<p>Awwww!  This just sounds TOO touching!</p>
<p>We couldn't be more thrilled for you both!  </p>

<p>HBO has JUST released its first official teaser of what to expect from our fanged friends down in Bon Temps, Louisiana, and thankfully, it seems like we'll be picking up RIGHT where we left off with poor <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/anna-paquin" target="_blank">Sookie</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/alexander-skarsgard" target="_blank">Viking Vampire Eric</a></strong> as they attempt to escape the wrath of their newly-transformed former ally!</p>
<p>And that's just the START of it!</p>
<p>Seriously!  </p>
<p>There is a WHOLE lot to watch in this teaser, which is a pretty incredible feat, considering it's only 30 seconds long!</p>

Guess Lil' Twist isn't the only member of Justin Bieber's posse causing him all sorts of trouble!
In fact, according to new reports, he's one THREE individuals who are responsible for the constant-pAArtying going on at the pint-sized pop star's Calabasas estate, which, as we've reported, has his neighbors FURIOUS!

<p>Guess <strong>Lil' Twist</strong> isn't the only member of <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/justin-bieber" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a></strong>'s posse causing him all sorts of trouble!</p>
<p>In fact, according to new reports, he's one THREE individuals who are responsible for the constant-<a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-29-justin-bieber-home-lil-twist-party-weed-alcohol-awat-believe-tour" target="_blank">pAArtying</a> going on at the pint-sized pop star's Calabasas estate, which, as we've reported, has his neighbors <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-27-justin-bieber-driving-terror-100mph-neighborhood" target="_blank">FURIOUS</a>!</p>
<p>And apparently, it's with good reason!</p>
<p>According to sources close to Biebs, he shares the home with Twist, a friend he calls <strong>King Kevi</strong>, and another who wishes to remain anonymous.  These three get to live there free of charge, have their own security guard, and to the surprise of <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-29-justin-bieber-paprazzi-chris-guerra-death-hit-and-run-new-details" target="_blank">no-one</a>, are allowed to drive all of his cars...even when their sugar daddy is out of town!</p>
<p>Furthermore, this "King Kevi" character is the worst of them all, as he's only lived in the house for a month, and yet has managed to throw 30 parties in that time, all of which have included more women than men and lots of SIZZURP, which as we all know, is incredibly dangerous and allegedly nearly took <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/lil-wayne" target="_blank">Lil' Wayne</a></strong>'s life!</p>
<p>Gross.  Gross gross gross gross gross gross.</p>
<p>Who needs enabling hanger-ons when you have friends like these?</p>
<p>Time to stop pretending your life is <em>Entourage</em>, Biebs!  Lose these guys!  </p>
<p>They're OBVIOUSLY not helping your current <a href="http://perez.ly/10mtu9M" target="_blank">issues</a>, if not exacerbating them!</p>
<p>What do U think??  Should Justin make new friends?!</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-31-justin-bieber-entourage-live-and-party-at-calabasas-mansion/feed/</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>DJ Lindsay Lohan Keeps The PAArty Going In Brazil While Prosecutors Debate Possible JAIL TIME!</title><link>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-31-lindsay-lohan-djs-in-brazil-prosecution-debate-over-jail-time</link><comments>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-31-lindsay-lohan-djs-in-brazil-prosecution-debate-over-jail-time#respond</comments><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 17:24:57 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Perez Hilton</dc:creator>

<p>We guess it's a good thing that <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong> is pAArtying as hard as she is while <del>drinking</del> working her way through <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-30-lindsay-lohan-partying-in-sao-paulo-brazil" target="_blank">Brazil</a>!</p>
<p>Because it's beginning to look more and more like when she returns back to the United States, she'll be facing ACTUAL jail time for lying to the police and violating her probation in last year's PCH car accident!</p>
<p>As we've reported, the troubled starlet's lawyer, <strong>Mark Heller</strong>, forged a last minute plea bargain with prosecutors and <strong>Judge Jim Dabney</strong>, which require her to spend 90 days in a lockdown rehab facility, despite everyone later realizing that there being <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-lindsay-lohan-lockdown-rehab-not-exist-jail-plea-deal" target="_blank">no such thing</a> in New York state.</p>
<p>Therefore, we're now hearing that because the actual sentence assigned to her was, indeed, 90 days in jail that could be substituted with a lockdown treatment facility, prosecutors are now looking to amend the terms, which would either land her behind bars or in just regular rehab...and we ALL know how that's gone in the past!</p>
<p>Guess we'll just have to wait and see what Dabney decides should be done!</p>
<p>Although we doubt it's going to be in LiLo's favor, ESPECIALLY if he sees what she's been up to lately!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out Lindsay has as she took over a DJ booth at a local club in Florianopolis (above)!</p>
<p>Clearly, someone's VERY repentent for her past behavior, and looking to make serious, positive <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-29-lindsay-lohan-stole-jewelry-clothes-anger-management-set" target="_blank">changes</a> to her lifestyle so she can better herself as a human being.</p>
<p>Now hold on.  We're going to need to practice saying that last part with a <a href="http://perez.ly/10mqdHz" target="_blank">straight</a> face.</p>
