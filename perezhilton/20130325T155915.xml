<p>We can't even DEAL with <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/emma-roberts/" target="_blank">Emma Roberts</a></strong> and <strong>Evan Peter</strong>'s ADORABLE relationship!</p>
<p>The pair managed to continue their <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-06-emma-roberts-evan-peters-movie-date-holding-hands-love#.UVBaCFtRi6Y" target="_blank">display</a> of major cuteness over the weekend while on a mini-family outing with Emma's half-sister <strong>Grace Nickels</strong> (above)!</p>
<p>The threesome were spotted wandering around The Grove -- a popular West Hollywood shopping area -- before stopping at The Fat Cow restaurant for din dins. </p>
<p>YUMMERS! </p>
<p>Emma chose a rather TASTY way of introducing her new <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-19-emma-roberts-evan-peters-errands" target="_blank">beau</a> to her lil' sis! </p>
<p>During the outing, Emma donned a super flowy, olive green dress which she covered with a motorcycle jacket, and her sis rocked a grinning skullz-patterned blouse over slim-fit jeans. </p>
<p>Evan looked like your typical dude in a vintage baseball-style tee, khakis, and shades.</p>
<p>CH-ch-check out TONS more snaps of this attractive trifecta (below)!</p>

<p>And <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/patrick-schwarzenegger/" target="_blank">Patrick Schwarzenegger</a></strong> gave us all that and more!</p>

<p>Seriously, he could almost give our number one boyfriend, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/zac-efron/" target="_blank">Zac Efron</a></strong>, a run for his money!</p>
<p>Who are we kidding?! NEVER!!</p>
<p>But at least he’s probably making daddy <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/arnold-schwarzenegger/" target="_blank">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></strong> pretty <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-02-14-patrick-schwarzenegger-arnold-meet-for-parent-son-lunch" target="_blank">proud</a> with his muscle-y bod.</p>

<p>We wonder if <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/amber-rose" target="_blank">Amber Rose</a></strong> still thinks her man is the "<a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-02-22-amber-rose-wiz-khalifa-baby-daddy#.UVBZTVo6U0s" target="_blank">best daddy ever</a>" NOW!</p>
<p>While <strong>Wiz Khalifa</strong> has always enjoyed his fair share of the greenery - and pretty much straight up said a while back that the birth of his son <strong>Sebastian Taylor Thomaz</strong> would not <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2012-12-21-amber-rose-and-wiz-khalifa-say-their-baby-is-going-to-be-raised-around-weed#.UVBbTlo6U0s" target="_blank">deter</a> his smoking - it seems a little odd to us that only a month after the little guy's <a href="http://perezhilton.com/perezitos/2013-02-21-wiz-khalifa-and-amber-rose-welcome-baby-boy-sebastian-taylor#.UVBZR1o6U0s" target="_blank">birth</a>, he's posting photos of himself on <strong>Instagram</strong> taking a blunt to the face!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check out the snap (above), which he captioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Got To Get Stoned</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeesh!</p>
<p>And how does Miss Rose feel about your leaving her with the crux of the parenting responsibility while you're off getting <a href="http://perez.ly/ZPxP6g" target="_blank">high</a>?</p>
<p>Obviously, everyone has their vice of choice with which they enjoy being able to unwind, but we just hope your love of herb - or apparent NEED to be stoned - isn't impeding on your ability to be the best possible dad you can be!</p>
<p>Behave yourself, Wiz!</p>

<p>And the hits just keep on coming!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/lindsay-lohan/" target="_blank">Lindsay Lohan</a></strong>'s assistant, <strong>Gavin Doyle</strong>, will be questioned today about allegations of witness tampering by LiLo's attorney, <strong>Mark Heller</strong>,  EVEN THOUGH he already publicly called BULL <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-lindsay-lohan-ex-assistant-gavin-doyle-denies-mark-heller-witness-tampering" target="_blank">SHIZ</a>.   </p>
<p>...that is if he decides to show up to his meeting with LA City attorney, <strong>Terry White</strong>!!!</p>
<p>Gavin already blew off a meeting with the city attorney last week regarding <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-lindsay-lohan-lawyer-mark-heller-witness-tampering-investigation#.UVBaCFu4H84" target="_blank">accusations</a> that Mark wanted Gavin to say the PCH crash was HIS fault. </p>
<p>A source explained: </p>
<blockquote><p>“The prosecutor is looking into allegations that Lohan’s attorney, Mark Heller, wanted Gavin to say that the car accident last summer, in which Lindsay was behind the wheel, was actually his fault. Heller allegedly told Gavin to say that photographers were chasing the duo en route to the Liz & Dick set, and he grabbed the steering wheel, causing her to crash into the cement truck driver. White is taking this very seriously. Heller and Doyle allegedly had the conversation in New York, and White will be turning over his findings to the New York State Bar Association, and other law enforcement, if necessary.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be one CRAZY scenario if Gavin had even met Mark before court, but legal matters are still to be taken VERY seriously. </p>
<p>We don't think it would be a smart move to continue to mess with the head honcho of the LA law, Gavin. </p>
<p>Just show up so you can clear your <a href="http://perez.ly/10cDdPM" target="_blank">name</a> and Mark's and so Linds can <del>party</del> go to<a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-lindsay-lohan-court-trial-lying-to-the-cops-march-2013-monday" target="_blank"> rehab</a> in peace! </p>

<p>Well, well, well!</p>
<p>It looks to US like someone may have used the opportunity for a lovers' getaway in Las Vegas to make his burgeoning relationship with a certain pop princess even MORE official than it already clearly is...with a RING!</p>
<p>As we've reported, our beloved <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/britney-spears" target="_blank">Britney Spears</a></strong> hung out in <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-24-britney-spears-las-vegas-trip-david-lucado#.UVBmylo6U0s" target="_blank">Sin City</a> this weekend with her manager <strong>Larry Rudolph</strong> and new man <strong>David Lucado</strong>, strolling the strip, taking in a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-britney-spears-boyfriend-cirque-du-soleil-one-drop-date-sighting#.UVBl9lo6U0s" target="_blank">Cirque du Soleil</a> show, and possibly even finalizing her deal for a <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-britney-spears-going-to-las-vegas-to-watch-shania-twain-perform" target="_blank">residency</a> at Planet Hollywood's PH Live venue!</p>
<p>But what we DIDN't immediately notice is that while gurlfriend was on her way to a dinner date at Meatball Spot at Town Square Mall, she was photographed attempting to keep her left hand tucked into her jacket...because new pictures prove that she is most CERTAINLY sporting some serious BLING on her ring finger!</p>
<p>Ch-ch-check it out for yourself (above)!</p>
<p>Could this mean our Brit Brit is ALREADY ENGAGED again?!</p>
<p>We mean, we KNEW these two seemed happy and are definitely spending quality <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-16-britney-spears-golf-with-david-lucado" target="_blank">time</a> together, but it hasn't even been tree months!</p>
<p>But what are the alternatives?!  A promise ring?  Just a present?!</p>
<p>Maybe she just prefers decorating that finger!</p>
<p>Guess we'll have to wait to find out for sure...but we've got our eyes on you, gurl!</p>

<p>We can finally get excited!!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/kate-winslet/" target="_blank">Kate Winslet</a></strong> has been <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-01-25-kate-winslet-divergent-role-official#.UVBSzxl5j6Z" target="_blank">rumored</a> for months now to be cast in <em>Divergent</em>, and after a whole lot of teasing, it’s official!</p>
<p>The actress will be joining an AH-Mazing cast that includes <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/shailene-woodley/" target="_blank">Shailene Woodley</a></strong>, <strong>Theo James</strong>, <strong>Jai Courtney</strong>, <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/zoe-kravitz/" target="_blank">Zoë Kravitz</a></strong>, <strong>Ansel Elgort</strong> and <strong><a href="http://perezhilton.com/category/maggie-q/" target="_blank">Maggie Q</a></strong>.</p>
<p>But the best part about her casting is that it’s in a totally <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-15-divergent-casting-theo-james-four-kate-winslet-confirmed#.UVBSohl5j6Y" target="_blank">unexpected</a> role!</p>
<p>Instead of playing a heroin-type character like we would expect our sweet Kate to do, she’ll be downright villainous!</p>
<p>Kate has been cast as Jeanine Matthews in the film which has us just waiting on the edge of our seats to see how bada** she will be.</p>
<p>We must admit, we are so happy this <a href="http://perez.ly/16ToGxs" target="_blank">casting</a> rumor turned out to be true!</p>

<p>Guess we're not just getting a brand new album from <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/fall-out-boy" target="_blank">Fall Out Boy</a></strong>! </p>
<p>We're also getting a STORY!  With an over-arching narrative through each of the music videos released for their new tunes!</p>
<p>And the latest off <em>Save Rock and Roll</em> is called <em>The Phoenix</em>, with an all-new clip that takes place before the <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-02-04-fall-out-boy-new-album-ten-year-anniversary#.UVBU1Fo6U0s" target="_blank">events</a> featured in <em>My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)</em>...and explains why <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/pete-wentz" target="_blank">Pete Wentz</a></strong>, <strong>Patrick Stump</strong> and the boys were kidnapped and thrown in that van!</p>
<p>According to a note on their official <a href="http://perez.ly/ZPrk3k" target="_blank">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Welcome to the Prequel! Here’s the video for ‘<em>The Phoenix</em>’ – it tells the tale of how we ended up blindfolded in the back of the black van in the <em>mskwyditd</em> video. This is chapter 2 of 11. Stay tuned for chapter 3, coming to a computer, tablet, or phone near you soon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh MAN!  ELEVEN videos?!</p>
<p>Here's hoping that <strong><a href="http://www.perezhilton.com/category/courtney-love" target="_blank">Courtney Love</a></strong> finds her way into at least one of them, seeing as she's an EFFING guest <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-21-fall-out-boy-courtney-love-collaboration-save-rock-and-roll#.UVBUuFo6U0s" target="_blank">vocalist</a> on a new tune!</p>
<p>We are getting TOO excited for this!  How about U guys?!</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-fall-out-boy-new-music-video-the-phoenix/feed/</wfw:commentRss></item><item><title>Prince Harry's Peen To Enter The United States This May&#8230; But Will It RETURN To Sin City?!</title><link>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-prince-harry-tour-united-states-may-2013</link><comments>http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-25-prince-harry-tour-united-states-may-2013#respond</comments><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2013 14:19:24 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator>Perez Hilton</dc:creator>

<p>Rejoice! </p>
<p>Our royal brother from an English mother will RETURN to the United States for the first time since his salacious Las Vegas naked picture <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-01-22-prince-harry-talks-las-vegas-naked-photo-scandal-video-watch" target="_blank">scandal</a>! </p>
<p><strong>Prince Harry</strong> will fly through our spacious skies and experience America's amber waves of grain this May, but rather than party it up with <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-03-18-prince-harry-cressida-bonas-dinner-date" target="_blank">random</a> girls in Sin City, it seems the cheeky ginger has more diplomatic plans in mind...</p>
<p>Like visiting areas in NY and New Jersey that were BADLY damaged by Hurricane Sandy! </p>
<p>The <a href="http://perezhilton.com/fitperez/2013-03-11-prince-harry-inspiration-charity-lesotho-africa-children-hiv-aids#.UVBVy1tRi6Y" target="_blank">charitable</a> Prince will also travel to Colorado Springs to attend the Warrior Games (a series of athletic events involving wounded servicemen and women), visit our nation's capital, AND will be the honored guest at a swanky affair in NYC.</p>
<p>To wrap up his brief visit (May 9 - May 15), Harry will participate in a polo match benefitting his charity, Sentebale.</p>
<p>Fun times! But probably not quite as fun as <a href="http://perez.ly/16TmVQV" target="_blank">stripping</a> off one's clothes and making out with sexy strangers...</p>
<p>LOLz! </p>

Many people in Hollywood are religious, or at least very spiritual.
Other celebs are a little more in your face about it.
They are very passionate about their religion&#8230; bordering on fanatical at times!
